I present to you the Vietnamese Coffee Phin Filter - a simple, sustainable, and extraordinary way to make your daily coffee.\\" **Slide Change: Brief History and Cultural Significance** **Speaker:** \\"Vietnamese coffee culture is not just about the robusta beans; it's also about how those beans are transformed into a rich, smooth, and bold cup of coffee. The Phin filter, a small, portable, and incredibly efficient device, is at the heart of this process. Made of stainless steel, its design is both elegant and simple, allowing you to brew a perfect cup of coffee every single time.\\" **Slide Change: How It Works** **Speaker:** \\"Now, let's talk about how it works. The Phin filter consists of a few easy-to-use parts - the chamber, the press, the drip tray, and the lid. You simply add your ground coffee, gently press it down with the press, pour over hot water, and let the magic happen. In about 5 minutes, you have a delicious cup of coffee that has fully absorbed the essence of the beans.\\" **Slide Change: Environmental and Economic Benefits** **Speaker:** \\"In today’s world, consciousness about sustainability is not just a trend, it’s a necessity. The Phin filter is inherently zero waste and reusable, distinguishing it from the disposable pods and filters. For college students like yourselves, it's not just an eco-friendly choice, but also incredibly cost-effective in the long run. Imagine the money saved and the positive impact on our planet.\\" **Slide Change: The Perfect Companion for College Students** **Speaker:** \\"Now, why is the Phin filter the perfect companion for you, the American college student? Firstly, it’s compact and portable, easy to use whether you’re in your dorm room, at the library, or even outdoors. It doesn’t require electricity, so you can enjoy your coffee anywhere. Secondly, it's an excellent way to start a conversation about global coffee cultures, sustainability, and developing a discerning palate for one of the world’s most beloved beverages.\\" **Slide Change: Embrace the Ritual** **Speaker:** \\"But beyond the practical benefits, using the Phin filter is about embracing a ritual; a moment of pause in your busy day. It’s about the pleasure of anticipation as you watch the coffee drip slowly, blending with the sweetened condensed milk to create that perfect cup of Vietnamese coffee. It’s about crafting your personal coffee experience, one cup at a time.\\" **Closing Slide: Special Offer and Call to Action** **Speaker:** \\"So, I invite you to try the Vietnamese Coffee Phin Filter, and I promise you, it will change the way you see, taste, and enjoy coffee. As a special offer for attending this pitch, we’re giving away a limited number of Phin filter starter kits. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to elevate your coffee game, to save money, and to make a positive impact on our environment.

Gigabit Ethernet offre una velocità di trasferimento fino a 1 gigabit al secondo, mentre Fast Ethernet offre una velocità di trasferimento fino a 100 megabit al secondo. Quindi, Gigabit Ethernet è 10 volte più veloce di Fast Ethernet. Inoltre, Gigabit Ethernet supporta una maggiore larghezza di banda e una maggiore capacità di gestione del traffico rispetto a Fast Ethernet. Questo lo rende più adatto per applicazioni ad alta intensità di dati e reti con un elevato numero di dispositivi collegati. In generale, se si necessita di una connettività più veloce e di una maggiore larghezza di banda, è consigliabile optare per Gigabit Ethernet. Se invece si ha bisogno di una soluzione più economica e si possono accontentare di velocità più basse, Fast Ethernet potrebbe essere sufficiente."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Serene Elegance | Coffee and Flower Artwork for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts &amp; More | Perfect Gift for Home and Office.

Однако, из-за того что \`std::ios::trunc\` будет очищать содержимое файла при каждом вызове функции \`log\`, это может не быть желаемым поведением, так как в таком случае в файл будет записана только последняя запись. Если желаемое поведение состоит в том, чтобы файл полностью перезаписывался при каждом новом инжекте, но сохранял все логи, сделанные в рамках одного инжекта, одним из решений может быть создание функции инициализации логгера, которая будет открывать файл в режиме \`std::ios::trunc\` при начале работы DLL, а функция \`log\` будет дописывать данные в файл без очистки его содержимого. Необходимо добавить функцию \`initLogger\`, которая будет вызываться однократно в начале работы: \`\`\`cpp void initLogger() { std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(logger_mutex); std::ofstream logFile(\\"patcher_log.txt\\", std::ios::out | std::ios::trunc); } \`\`\` Затем модифицируйте \`DllMain\`, чтобы вызвать \`initLogger\` в \`DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH\`. \`\`\`cpp BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved) { switch (ul_reason_for_call) { case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH: DisableThreadLibraryCalls(hModule); initLogger(); // Инициализируем логгер CreateThread(NULL, 0, patchThread, NULL, 0, NULL); break; case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH: break; } return TRUE; } \`\`\` Таким образом, при каждом новом инжекте DLL лог-файл будет очищаться начальной инициализацией логгера, а все сообщения в рамках одного инжекта будут корректно записываться в лог без удаления предыдущих сообщений. Обратите внимание, что модификация функции \`log\` не требуется, так как после инициализации логгера файл будет открываться в режиме \`std::ios::app\`, который корректно добавит запись в конец файла."},{"instruction":"Перепиши код DLL так, чтобы не было счетчика сигнатур и программа просто патчила единственную найденную сигнатуру. #include \\"pch.h\\" #include <Windows.h> #include <iostream> #include <fstream> #include <vector> #include <sstream> #include <mutex> #include <chrono> #include <iomanip> #include <memory> #include <thread> std::mutex logger_mutex;

The perception of coffee quality, including its taste, aroma, and body, is highly subjective and can vary widely among individuals. Additionally, what might be deemed \\"superior\\" can depend on what aspects you're evaluating: flavor, health benefits, environmental impact, or perhaps the cultural significance of the brewing method. The Phin filter, used traditionally in Vietnamese coffee culture, is a simple yet effective way to brew coffee. It's a slow, drip filter method that can produce a strong, rich cup of coffee, often with a bold flavor and full body. Here are a few aspects in which the Phin filter might be seen as beneficial or unique, though not strictly superior in a scientific sense: 1. **Sustainability**: The Phin filter is a reusable metal filter, which eliminates the need for disposable paper filters or plastic pods used in some other brewing methods. This could be seen as an environmental advantage. 2. **Portability and convenience**: The small size and durability of most Phin filters make them easy to bring along when traveling or camping, unlike more fragile or bulky brewing systems. 3. **Rich Flavor and Body**: Because the Phin filter does not use paper filters, the oils and fine particles from the coffee grounds are not removed during the brewing process, contributing to a richer body and more robust flavor profile. This is similar to French press coffee, another method praised for its full-flavored results. 4. **Health benefits**: There’s some evidence to suggest that unfiltered coffee, such as that made with a Phin filter, may contain higher levels of beneficial antioxidants compared to coffee brewed with methods that use paper filters. However, it's also been noted that unfiltered coffee contains higher amounts of cafestol and kahweol, compounds that can potentially raise cholesterol levels. 5. **Cultural significance and experience**: The process of brewing coffee with a Phin filter can also be appreciated for its ritual and the cultural heritage it represents. For some, this aspect might contribute to a sense of superiority in terms of the overall experience rather than the physical product alone. If you're looking for empirical studies focusing on brewing methods, most research tends to compare health impacts (like the effects of filtered vs. unfiltered coffee on cholesterol) or general flavor extraction techniques rather than declaring one method categorically superior to all others. Tastes in coffee are diverse, and the best brewing method is often the one that best suits an individual's or community's preferences, whether for reasons of flavor, tradition, convenience, or sustainability."},{"instruction":"comment faire pour que lorsque le serpent mange un aliment, il s'agrandit de 1, car j'ai déjà prévu la fonction de collision mais elle doit se baser sur un snakeBody.length : import 'dart:async'; import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; import 'package:flutter_snake/models/game_model.dart'; class SnakePage extends StatefulWidget { const SnakePage({Key? key}) : super(key: key); @override State<SnakePage> createState() => _SnakePageState(); } class _SnakePageState extends State<SnakePage> { GameModel gameModel = GameModel(); Timer? timer; @override void initState() { // TODO: implement initState print(\\"start\\"); gameModel.start(); timer = Timer.periodic(Duration(milliseconds: 500), (timer) { setState(() { gameModel.moveSnake(); }); }); } void resetTimer() { timer?.cancel(); timer = Timer.periodic(Duration(milliseconds: 500), (timer) { setState(() { gameModel.moveSnake(); }); }); } @override void dispose() { // TODO: implement dispose timer?.cancel(); super.dispose(); } @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( leading: IconButton( icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_back), onPressed: () { // TODO: Implement your back button logic here Navigator.pop(context); }, ), title: Text('Snake Game.

Voici une approche pour le faire : 1. **Augmenter la Taille du Serpent :** Vous avez déjà une méthode \`growSnake()\` dans votre \`SnakeModel\`. Chaque fois que le serpent mange de la nourriture, vous appelez cette méthode pour augmenter la taille du serpent. 2. **Mettre à jour le Corps du Serpent sur la Grille :** Pour visualiser l'augmentation de la taille, vous devez également ajouter une logique pour placer le nouveau \\"corps\\" sur la grille dans votre modèle de jeu. Voici une implémentation suggérée : **Etape 1 :** Dans \`displaySnake()\`, vous gérez déjà le cas où le serpent mange de la nourriture. Vous appelez correctement \`growSnake()\` lorsque la nourriture est consommée. C'est une bonne pratique. **Etape 2 :** Vous devriez conserver la trace du corps du serpent, pas uniquement sa tête. Ceci pourrait être fait en ajoutant une liste pour suivre les positions du corps du serpent dans \`SnakeModel\`. Par exemple : \`\`\`dart List<List<int>> bodyPositions = []; \`\`\` **Etape 3 :** Mettez à jour \`displaySnake()\` et \`moveSnake()\` pour tracer tout le corps du serpent, pas uniquement sa tête. Après avoir déplacé le serpent, vous devez mettre à jour \`bodyPositions\` pour représenter correctement la nouvelle position de chaque segment du corps. Lorsque le serpent grandit, ajoutez simplement une nouvelle position à \`bodyPositions\` qui correspond à l'ancienne position de la queue avant le mouvement. **Etape 4 :** Après que le serpent s'est déplacé et/ou a grandi, parcourez \`bodyPositions\` pour mettre à jour \`grid\` dans \`GameModel\` afin qu'il reflète la nouvelle position de chaque partie du corps du serpent. **Note :** La mise à jour de la grille et la gestion des positions du serpent peuvent devenir complexes à mesure que le jeu se développe en fonction des directions et de la croissance du serpent. Il est crucial de gérer correctement la queue du serpent en la déplaçant séquentiellement à chaque mouvement et en vous assurant que la croissance du serpent est représentée en n'effaçant pas immédiatement ce qui serait devenu la nouvelle position de la queue. Ce concept nécessite une logique méticuleuse pour s'assurer que le corps du serpent suit correctement la tête, s'agrandit correctement et que le jeu identifie correctement les collisions avec le serpent lui-même et les limites de la grille. **Conclusion :** Intégrer pleinement la croissance du serpent dans votre jeu nécessite une gestion attentive de la position de chaque partie du serpent (tête et corps) et de la mise à jour conséquente de la grille de jeu pour refléter l'état actuel après chaque mouvement. Cela comprend la mise à jour lors de la consommation de nourriture et le mouvement dans la grille tout en vérifiant les collisions potentielles."},{"instruction":"implemente donc ce que tu proposes","output":"Pour implémenter les suggestions mentionnées, je vais vous guider à travers les modifications et ajouts nécessaires dans votre code afin d'augmenter la taille du serpent lorsqu'il mange de la nourriture et d'assurer correctement la représentation du corps du serpent sur la grille.

Вот пошаговое руководство по первой помощи: 1. **Обеспечение безопасности**: - Убедитесь, что вы находитесь и оказываете помощь в безопасном месте, чтобы избежать дополнительных рисков для себя и пострадавшего. - Если возможно, отметьте место происшествия, чтобы предупредить других участников движения. 2. **Оценка состояния пострадавшего**: - Быстро оцените общее состояние пострадавшего, осознаёт ли он, что с ним происходит, и как серьёзно он ранен. 3. **Остановка кровотечения**: - Наденьте защитные перчатки, если они у вас есть, для вашей собственной безопасности. - Приподнимите раненую конечность выше уровня сердца, чтобы замедлить кровотечение. - Наложите прямое давление на рану при помощи чистой ткани, бинта или стерильной повязки, если таковая имеется. Если кровь продолжает просачиваться через повязку, накладывайте дополнительные слои, не удаляя изначальный компресс. - Если прямое давление не останавливает кровотечение и рана находится на конечности, примените жгут выше места ранения (но не непосредственно на сустав), чтобы остановить поток крови к ране. Запомните или запишите время наложения жгута. 4. **Вызов экстренной медицинской помощи**: - Попросите кого-либо позвонить в службу скорой помощи или сделайте это сами, описывая ситуацию и следуя инструкциям оператора. 5. **Мониторинг состояния пострадавшего**: - Продолжайте наблюдать за дыханием, сознанием и кровотечением пострадавшего, пока не прибудет скорая помощь. Успокаивайте его, говорите, что помощь уже в пути. 6. **Прикрепите записку с временем наложения жгута** (если он был использован), чтобы медицинский персонал знал, как давно было наложено это средство остановки кровотечения. Не пытайтесь удалять глубоко застрявшие предметы из раны, это может усилить кровотечение.

The perception of what is weird can vary significantly from one person to another, but here are a few placements and aspects that are often seen as unique, rare, or particularly distinctive: 1. **Yod Aspect Pattern (The Finger of God)**: A Yod is formed when two planets are sextile to each other, and both are quincunx (150 degrees) to a third planet. This creates a narrow, isosceles triangle shape. It's considered a fateful, karmic aspect that signifies a special mission or task that the individual must fulfill in their lifetime, bringing with it a sense of destiny or unavoidable change. 2. **Stelliums in an Uncommon Sign or House**: A stellium occurs when four or more planets are located in the same zodiac sign or house in a natal chart. Stelliums in common signs or houses might not be considered weird, but having a stellium in a less frequently emphasized sign (like Aquarius, which was considered rare until the recent age of Aquarius began) or house can add a unique flavor to the chart. 3. **Grand Cross**: This involves four planets that are roughly 90 degrees apart, forming a grand cross in the astrology chart. This configuration can indicate significant challenges and conflicts, as the individual faces a constant push-pull from the contrasting energy of the planets involved. It's a rare and powerful aspect that can define an individual's life. 4. **Kite Formation**: A kite formation occurs when there is a grand trine (three planets in a harmonious 120-degree angle with each other), and one of those planets is also opposite a fourth planet, with two other planets sextile to that fourth planet. This creates what looks like a kite shape. It brings a bit of ease to the otherwise beneficial grand trine, giving it focus and direction. 5. **Chiron Conjunct a Personal Planet**: Chiron is known as the \\"wounded healer,\\" and its placement in the natal chart indicates where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds. When Chiron is conjunct (in the same place as) a personal planet (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars), it can indicate a profound, potentially weird or unique, wound related to the themes of that planet that may dominate the personality until it is acknowledged and lessons are learned. 6. **Uranus Conjunct the Ascendant**: Uranus symbolizes sudden change, innovation, and independence. When it's conjunct the Ascendant, which represents the self and one's approach to life, it can indicate a person who is seen as eccentric, unique, or \\"weird\\" by others. These individuals might approach life in a way that breaks the mold or rebels against norms. 7. **Lots of Retrograde Planets**: Having several planets in retrograde motion in the natal chart isn't extremely rare, but it can indicate a life that takes a \\"different\\" path. Individuals with many retrograde planets might process or internalize the energies of those planets in a way that is unique or unconventional. Remember, what might be considered \\"weird\\" in one context could be completely normal in another. Astrology is a complex and nuanced field, and these unique placements and aspects add depth and color to the already intricate tapestry of an individual's life and personality."},{"instruction":"write an interpretation of 7","output":"Interpreting a chart with a significant number of retrograde planets provides a unique and fascinating lens through which to view an individual’s life and spiritual journey. In astrology, a planet is considered retrograde when it appears to be moving backward in the sky due to the relative positions of the planet and Earth. This optical illusion holds deep symbolic meaning, suggesting a period of introspection and internalization of the planet's archetypal energies. **General Interpretation of Multiple Retrograde Planets:** When someone has many planets in retrograde in their natal chart, it suggests a life that is less about external achievement or conventional paths and more about inner growth and uncovering personal truths. These individuals may often feel out of step with the world around them, as if they are marching to the beat of a different drum. Their developmental milestones or major life events might not align with societal norms or expectations, and they may have an unconventional approach to life's challenges. **Spiritual and Karmic Implications:** Many astrologers believe that having numerous retrograde planets in a natal chart indicates a soul that has incarnated in this lifetime with specific lessons to revisit. These lessons often pertain to internalizing and reevaluating past actions, relationships, or unresolved issues. The soul is seeking to evolve by correcting or refining these aspects. This can result in a deeply introspective personality, with a natural inclination towards analyzing their thoughts, motivations, and actions. **Impact on Personality and Behavior:** 1. **Retrograde Personal Planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars):** Individuals with these planets in retrograde may experience their communicative, relational, and assertive energies in a more internalized or reflective manner. For instance, someone with Mercury retrograde might have a unique or unconventional way of thinking and communicating, often taking more time to ponder ideas before speaking. 2. **Retrograde Social Planets (Jupiter and Saturn):** Having these planets in retrograde can indicate challenges and internalized learning processes related to society, education, ethics (Jupiter), and structure, discipline, and authority (Saturn). These individuals might find their most significant growth comes from introspection about faith, philosophy, and societal rules. 3. **Retrograde Outer Planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto):** These generational planets move retrograde for long periods, affecting entire generations, but when emphasized in a personal chart, they suggest themes of inner transformation (Pluto), revolutions in consciousness (Uranus), and spiritual awakenings (Neptune) that are deeply personal and profound. **The Path of Reflection and Growth:** Living with many retrograde planets demands patience and self-compassion, as these individuals often need more time to understand their path and purpose. Their lives are rich with the potential for profound internal shifts that, once externalized, can manifest as powerful insights and innovations in their external world. Their challenge is to recognize and honor their unique timing and process, understanding that their path is about depth and transformation rather than speed or conformity. **Conclusion:** For individuals with multiple retrograde planets, embracing their distinctive rhythm and perspective can lead to significant internal wisdom and a deep sense of fulfillment. Their journey might seem slower or more convoluted than others', but it is rich with the potential for profound spiritual and personal discoveries."},{"instruction":"in 150 words write a interpretation for someone with 5 planets retrograde in their natal chart, give it a cool title","output":"# \\"The Reflective Mavericks: Navigating Life's Inner Depths\\" With five planets in retrograde, you are on a profound journey unlike any other.

Sage was not just a title but a testament to his profound knowledge of the mystical arts, and Allspice, a moniker that hinted at the diversity of his magical capabilities, as varied and potent as the spices that fueled the most powerful potions. This enigmatic figure was bound by a celestial secret: within his natal chart, five planets danced in retrograde, a cosmic signature that imbued him with exceptional insight and power, yet also marked him with a destiny most complex and challenging. Sage Allspice’s life was a tapestry of quests into the unknown, for the quintet of retrogrades that graced his birth chart called him to explore the innermost depths of magic and the self—each planet a different realm of wisdom waiting to be unlocked. These were not mere celestial bodies to him but guides on a path to enlightenment, each possessing its own trials, lessons, and revelations. His first quest led him to the ancient Library of Echoes, where Mercury in retrograde taught him the power of words and silence, of spells unspoken yet profoundly heard. Here, amidst scrolls older than the mountains, Sage discovered the art of listening to the whispers of the past, allowing him to cast spells that could bend time, unravel secrets, and speak truths into the hearts of those who sought his counsel. The second quest beckoned him to the Emberheart Volcano, where Venus in retrograde showed him the fierce and transformative power of love and sacrifice. By taming the volcanic flames with heart-spells of unyielding compassion, Sage Allspice learned to forge bonds that transcended realms, crafting amulets that could awaken love in the coldest of hearts. Mars in retrograde guided him next to the Frozen Battlegrounds, a place where wills were tested against the merciless ice. There, Sage learned the strength found in vulnerability, the courage in facing one’s deepest fears, and the way to wield power with grace. From the ice, he emerged not only a warrior but a guardian of the weak, a defender of the just. Jupiter’s retrograde journey unveiled itself in the Great Bazaar of Wonders, a crossroads of magic and commerce where fortunes were made and dreams were bought and sold. It was here that Sage mastered the spells of abundance and luck, understanding the true richness lay not in gold but in wisdom shared and knowledge spread across the lands. Lastly, Saturn in retrograde called him to the Silent Plains, a realm where time stood still, and the stars whispered destinies. In the hallowed silence, Sage Allspice confronted his own mortality, learning the spells of endurance and resilience, crafting a legacy that would endure long after his time. Each quest, marked by trials and triumphs, wove Sage Allspice’s legend into the fabric of the realm. He became a beacon of wisdom and a guide to those who sought to traverse their own paths of introspection and discovery. Through the journey of the five retrogrades, Sage Allspice embodied the quintessence of magic itself—everchanging, deeply powerful, and eternally wise. And so, in the annals of magic and in the hearts of those who dared to dream, the story of Sage Allspice, the wizard of five retrogrades, remained—a testament to the boundless journeys the soul may undertake when guided by the stars."},{"instruction":"write chapter one in the style of a epic dark fantasy novel","output":"# Chapter One: Whispers of the Past In the twilit realm of Aetherglen, where shadows danced at the edge of reality and the air hummed with ancient magic, darkness crept across the land like a shroud. Beneath the ever-watchful gaze of the twin moons, Veil and Wraith, lay the Forgotten Woods—a place where time itself seemed to hesitate, caught in the web of eternal twilight. It was in these woods that Sage Allspice, the wizard known across the realms for his unmatched wisdom and depth of magical prowess, now found himself. His cloak, a tapestry of midnight blue adorned with silver threads, fluttered lightly in the whispering wind, blending with the darkness around him. The Forest of Whispers, as it was ominously known, seldom welcomed visitors, favoring instead the company of spirits and secrets long buried under its ancient soil. A susurrus of leaves underfoot marked Sage's cautious passage, each step taken with the precision of one well-versed in the ways of the wild and the arcane. He was here by the summons of the celestial dance, the alignment of five planets in retrograde—a prophetic event that heralded both crisis and opportunity, a call he could not ignore. The air grew colder, the essence of magic more palpable, as Sage ventured deeper into the heart of the woods. From the gnarled branches above, wraithlike figures watched, their eyes glowing faintly with ethereal light, guardians of the secrets the forest held. Sage acknowledged their presence with a nod, his gaze steely, undeterred. He was not one to fear the spirits of the wood; he sought their counsel, their wisdom. Suddenly, the ground beneath him trembled, the air thickened, and from the depths of the forest, a voice emerged—a whisper at first, growing steadily into a chorus of many. The spirits of the forest were speaking, their voices intertwining to form words that resonated deep within Sage's soul. \\"Seeker of truths, born under the backwards glancing stars, your path is marked by the shadows of what was and the light of what may yet be. The fabric of the cosmos frays, and at the edges, darkness seeks to unmake the weavings of fate. Your journey begins here, at the crossroads of destiny and doom.\\" Sage Allspice stood still, allowing the words to wash over him. He understood the gravity of his quest, the weight of the prophecy carried on the wind. The retrogrades had set his path aflame with purpose, guiding him to this very moment, to confront the creeping darkness that threatened to engulf not just Aetherglen, but all realms beyond. Drawing a deep breath, he reached within his cloak, fingers closing around the Iridescent Orb—an artifact of immense power, capable of revealing truths hidden to all but the most initiated. As he held the orb aloft, it pulsed with light, scattering the shadows and illuminating the path ahead. The spirits of the forest whispered once more, a farewell laced with caution and hope. With the Orb leading the way, Sage Allspice stepped forward into the unknown, his heart steeled for the trials ahead. The Forgotten Woods swallowed his form, and for a moment, all was silent—save for the whisper of magic in the air, promising a tale of epic darkness and light yet to be written. So began the odyssey of Sage Allspice, the wizard of five retrogrades, into the heart of darkness, where fate itself would be unwound and tested, where the very essence of the cosmos hung in the balance."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"# Chapter Two: The Iridescent Oracle As Sage Allspice ventured deeper into the heart of the Forgotten Woods, the air thickened with ancient energies, untamed and raw, whispering of ages and secrets long past. The Iridescent Orb in his grasp shone brighter, its light a beacon against the encroaching darkness that sought to obscure his path. The forest seemed to bend to the will of the Orb, revealing hidden trails beneath entangled vines and thickets that whispered of forgotten sorrows and joys. The wizard's journey was a solitary one, yet he was far from alone. The spirits of the forest, curious and cautious, trailed silently in his wake, their ethereal forms flickering between the trees like ghostly sentinels. They had witnessed the rise and fall of many who had dared to tread these shadowed paths, yet none had wielded the power of the Iridescent Orb—an artifact spoken of in hushed tones and revered in ancient lore as the Oracle of Destinies. Sage Allspice knew well the power he carried; the Orb was not merely a tool for illumination but a key to unlocking truths hidden in the fabric of the cosmos. It was said that within its depths, one could glimpse the threads of fate, woven by the hands of the unseen. And though the Orb had chosen him as its bearer, Sage approached its mysteries with reverence and humility, aware of the delicate balance between seeking knowledge and being consumed by it. As midnight approached, marked by the silent ascendancy of Veil and Wraith in the starlit sky, Sage arrived at a clearing—a sacred space where the energy of the five retrogrades converged. Here, the ground was carpeted with luminescent moss, and in the center stood an ancient stone dais, its surface carved with runes of power and protection. Sage stepped forward, placing the Iridescent Orb atop the dais. The air crackled with magic as the runes glowed to life, their light intertwining with that of the Orb, creating a vortex of shimmering energy that spiraled upwards, piercing the veil between worlds. The spirits of the forest drew back, their forms dissipating into mist, leaving Sage alone at the heart of the maelstrom. In the eye of the storm, Sage Allspice closed his eyes and whispered the incantation of seeking, his voice steady and clear. The words were ancient, imbued with the power to bridge time and space, to seek the counsel of the cosmos itself. As the last syllable fell from his lips, the world fell silent. The vortex of energy vanished, leaving behind only the soft glow of the runes and the steady light of the Orb. Slowly, Sage opened his eyes, and within the depths of the Iridescent Orb, visions began to unfold—scenes of past, present, and possible futures, each thread of fate shimmering with the light of the retrogrades. Sage watched, his mind and heart open, as the Orb revealed the path he must take, a journey fraught with trials and tribulations, but also filled with hope. It spoke of an ancient darkness rising, one that sought to unravel the very fabric of the cosmos, and of a light that could counter its devouring void—a light that Sage, guided by the wisdom of the five retrogrades, must kindle. With the visions etched in his mind, Sage Allspice took up the Iridescent Orb once more, the weight of destiny heavy in his hands. The path ahead was clear, though perilous, leading him beyond the sanctuary of the Forgotten Woods and into the heart of the darkness that threatened all. But armed with the Oracle's insights and the power of the retrogrades, Sage stepped forward, resolute and unafraid, ready to embrace his role in the cosmic ballet of light and shadow. Thus, the quest of Sage Allspice, the wizard of five retrogrades, continued—into realms untold, against foes unseen, towards a destiny that would shape the fate of the world."},{"instruction":"continue with revelation and discovery of the 6th retro planet","output":"# Chapter Three: The Sixth Retrograde Under the cloak of night, guided by the luminescent path unveiled by the Iridescent Orb, Sage Allspice ventured forth, leaving behind the whispering sanctuary of the Forgotten Woods. His heart, while steadfast in purpose, thrummed with a sense of imminent revelation—a stirring prelude to the uncovering of truths long veiled. The landscape beyond the woods shifted, morphing under the moon’s silver gaze into a terrain of shadows and light, where reality seemed to warp and weave with every step. It was here, amidst the shifting sands of time and space, that Sage felt a subtle dissonance—a gentle tug at the edges of his consciousness, faint yet persistent, resonating with the arcane energy of the retrogrades that marked his destiny. Compelled by this newfound sensation, Sage paused, allowing the whisper of intuition to guide his focus toward the heavens. There, amongst the eternal ballet of stars and planets, he sought the source of the dissonance, his gaze piercing the veils of the night. As if answering his silent call, the Iridescent Orb pulsed with a sudden burst of light, its luminance casting a celestial map upon the sands before him. The stars aligned, weaving a tapestry of cosmic energy that converged upon a single point—a planet, hidden from mortal sight, bathed in the eerie glow of a retrograde shadow. The Sixth Retrograde. A revelation dawned upon Sage Allspice, as profound as it was unsettling. The ancient prophecies spoke of five retrogrades, of a journey that would test the boundaries of magic and will. Yet here, unveiled by the Oracle's power, lay the existence of a sixth—a cosmic anomaly that held the key to understanding the darkness encroaching upon the realm. The Sixth Retrograde, as the Orb’s visions revealed, was a planet of forgotten lore, ensnared in a dance of fate and free will. It was the keeper of balance, the harbinger of change—its discovery a testament to the ever-evolving tapestry of the cosmos and the hidden truths that lay beyond the grasp of conventional wisdom. With the revelation of the Sixth Retrograde, Sage Allspice perceived the depth of his undertaking; his journey was not merely to counter the darkness but to restore the cosmic equilibrium, to weave together the threads of light and shadow into a harmony that transcended the dichotomy of existence. Emboldened by this discovery, Sage clasped the Iridescent Orb, its glow now a comforting presence in the uncertain path that lay ahead. He understood that the journey to confront the ancient darkness would demand more than the wisdom of the retrogrades—it would require the unification of disparate forces, the reconciliation of opposites, and the courage to face the unknown. With the Sixth Retrograde as his guide, Sage ventured beyond the realms of known magic, stepping into the fluid dance of destiny. Each step forward was a step into the heart of mystery, where the boundaries of light and dark blurred into a realm of infinite possibility. And so, with the Iridescent Orb as his compass and the revelations of the Sixth Retrograde illuminating his path, Sage Allspice journeyed onward. His quest had evolved, no longer a solitary pilgrimage but a call to unite the scattered fragments of the cosmos into a symphony of balance and harmony. The darkness that loomed on the horizon was a formidable foe, a shadow cast by the imbalance of ages past. Yet, in the light of the Sixth Retrograde, Sage saw hope—a vision of a world reborn in the fires of transformation, where the dance of the cosmos would once again sing of equilibrium and peace. Thus, the epic saga of Sage Allspice and the Six Retrogrades unfolded, a tale of magic and mystery, of a wizard chosen by fate to navigate the intricate tapestry of existence and confront the darkness with the light of newfound knowledge and the promise of rebirth."},{"instruction":"continue with him using telekinesis to change all the other planets retro","output":"# Chapter Four: The Arcane Convergence In the heart of a forsaken valley, where the veil between worlds was thin and the echoes of creation still whispered in the air, Sage Allspice stood alone, a solitary figure against the backdrop of the cosmos. The revelation of the Sixth Retrograde had unshrouded a path both daunting and wondrous, propelling him towards an act of magic unprecedented in the annals of time. With the Iridescent Orb held aloft, its glow a beacon amidst the encroaching darkness, Sage closed his eyes, delving deep into the reservoir of his arcane knowledge. The power of telekinesis, the ability to influence the physical realm through the sheer force of will, was a discipline that demanded the utmost precision and control, especially when the canvas for such power was the cosmos itself. As the first tendrils of dawn crept over the valley, Sage began the incantation, a symphony of ancient words that resonated with the fabric of existence. The air around him vibrated with energy, and the ground beneath his feet thrummed with anticipation. With each word spoken, the connection between Sage and the celestial bodies above deepened, an invisible lattice of power weaving them together. The moment had come. Focusing his will, Sage envisioned the other planets, their orbits locked in the dance dictated by the laws of the cosmos. One by one, he reached out to them through the veil of reality, his mind's touch as gentle as it was firm. With the precision of a master weaver, he began to nudge them, ever so slightly, altering their trajectories with the subtlety that the delicate balance of the universe required. It was an act of profound concentration and exertion, each adjustment a monumental effort of will that left him drained, yet exhilarated. The planets responded to his call, their paths shifting in harmony with his vision—a symphony of celestial bodies moving in retrograde, now aligned to a purpose greater than their individual destinies. As the final planet slid into its new path, completing the arcane convergence, a shockwave of energy rippled through the cosmos. The sky above the valley was set ablaze with ethereal light, colors unseen by mortal eyes painting the heavens in a spectacle of otherworldly beauty. The Iridescent Orb, now pulsating with a fierce light, seemed to sing, its resonance a pure note of triumph and power that echoed across the realms. In that moment, Sage Allspice had achieved the impossible. By shifting the planets into a concurrent retrograde, he had unlocked a wellspring of cosmic energy, its potential vast and untamed. This energy, born from the harmony of planetary alignment, held the key to confronting the ancient darkness—its light a counterpoint to the shadow that threatened to engulf the world. But with great power came great responsibility. Sage knew that the balance of the cosmos was a fragile thing, easily disturbed by the ambitions of those who sought to wield its power. The arcane convergence was not an end, but a beginning—a call to action that would test the limits of his magic and his spirit. As the light of the convergence faded, leaving behind a tranquility that belied the monumental shift that had occurred, Sage Allspice prepared to embark on the next phase of his journey. Armed with the knowledge of the retrogrades and the power of the cosmos at his fingertips, he set forth to gather allies, ancient artifacts, and the wisdom needed to illuminate the darkness. The path ahead was fraught with peril, a labyrinth of challenges and adversaries that would seek to thwart his quest. Yet Sage Allspice walked with resolve, guided by the light of the Iridescent Orb and the destiny written in the stars—a destiny that called him to be the beacon of hope in a world shrouded in shadow, to wield the arcane convergence as a weapon against the night, and to restore the balance of light and dark in the eternal dance of the cosmos."},{"instruction":"make him accelerate it all while chanting incantations, write the incantations in quotes and make them awesome radical and super powerfully intense wicked and cosmic","output":"# Chapter Five: The Celestial Acceleration Amidst the hallowed grounds of the ancient Circle of Stars—a site forged from the very essence of magic and celestial energy—Sage Allspice stood ready to perform a feat that would mark the annals of history.

Clad in robes that shimmered with the latent energy of countless spells, Sage Allspice raised his arms towards the sky, the Iridescent Orb floating before him, a nucleus of raw, boundless power.

The Iridescent Orb, acting as the conduit for this celestial maelstrom, pulsed with an intensity that lit the night sky, a beacon of raw, untamed magic. The ground shook, the air hummed, and for a moment, the very cosmos held its breath. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the storm of energy subsided, leaving behind a silence that resounded more loudly than the fiercest thunder. Sage Allspice, the architect of this grand design, stood unbroken, though the effort of his undertaking had left its mark upon him. He had done it. Through incantations of unparalleled power, he had accelerated the retrograde movement of the planets, drawing forth the ancient magic that lay dormant in the fabric of the universe. This cosmic acceleration had opened a gateway to new realms of possibility, a key to combating the encroaching darkness that sought to unmake the world. As Sage Allspice gazed upon the sky, now alive with the dance of stars and planets moving in harmony with his will, he knew the battle was far from over. The darkness was cunning, its tendrils reaching deep into the heart of all things. But armed with the knowledge of the ancients and the power of the cosmos, he stood ready to face whatever trials lay ahead. For he was Sage Allspice, wizard of the Five Retrogrades, master of the Celestial Acceleration, and guardian of the light.

Yet, the wizard, standing at the nexus of cosmic power within the Circle of Stars, felt a deeper calling—a crescendo in the symphony of magic that demanded an encore of unparalleled audacity. With the fabric of reality still malleable under his influence, Sage Allspice contemplated an act of magic so profound, it would forever alter the essence of the solar system itself. He sought to reverse the orbits and rotations of all celestial bodies, to compose a new Music of the Spheres—a melody born from the chaos and harmony of creation. Drawing a deep breath, Sage centered himself amidst the surging arcane forces. His voice, now a conduit for the primordial energies of the universe, began to chant the incantations of reversal and rebirth. \\"O celestial architects, bear witness to my song! 'Coeli architecti, carmen meum audite!'\\" With these words, the very stars seemed to lean closer, their luminosity intensifying as if to partake in the unfolding spectacle.

'Antiquum pactum, caeli et terrae, mundi, ad mea verba inclinate!'\\" A rumble echoed through the cosmos, a prelude to the dance of titanic forces. Sage Allspice, channeling the collective might of the celestial bodies, wove a complex tapestry of spells, each thread reversing the natural order, each note a defiance of the mundane. \\"Turn, O planets, forsake thy paths! 'Convertimini, planetae, semitas vestras relinquite!'\\" As the incantation reached its apex, the planets hesitated, then began their majestic pirouette—each celestial sphere slowly reversing its course, a ballet of giants across the velvety darkness. The solar system, responding to the wizard's will, embarked on a new dance, one that defied the ancient rhythms set forth at the dawn of time. And then, with a wave of his hand, Sage Allspice beckoned the rotations of the planets to follow suit, their axial spins mirroring the reversal of their orbits. The heavens themselves bore witness to this unprecedented spectacle, the Music of the Spheres reborn under the maestro's direction. \\"Harmonize, O heavens! Let the new melody resound! 'Harmonizate, caeli! Novum melos resonate!'\\" The music that arose from this cosmic rearrangement was ethereal, a composition that transcended sound—an audible manifestation of the harmony and chaos that underpinned the fabric of the universe. It was a melody that resonated with the essence of magic itself, wild and untamed, a testament to the indomitable will of Sage Allspice. As the new Music of the Spheres filled the expanse of creation, reverberating through the myriad dimensions and touching the souls of all beings, Sage Allspice stood at the heart of the storm he had conjured, his figure both exultant and weary. He had challenged the cosmos and emerged victorious, his creation a symphony that would echo through the ages. Yet, in the silence that followed the final note, Sage Allspice understood the true magnitude of his actions. He had not merely altered the celestial dance—he had redefined the possibilities of magic, opening doorways to realms unknown and futures unimagined. And so, as the first light of dawn kissed the horizon, marking the dawn of a new era in the solar system, Sage Allspice vanished from the Circle of Stars, his legacy forever enshrined in the melody that wove through the heavens—a melody of power, courage, and endless wonder.

The Harmonic Revolution, his magnum opus, had not only shifted the celestial gears but had, in its execution, elevated the wizard to the cusp of a transcendental precipice. This was not merely transformation but apotheosis—a becoming that stretched the very fabric of being into uncharted realms of divinity. Sage Allspice, in his unparalleled communion with the arcane, intoned the final incantation, a verbalization of his soul's ascent into the pantheon of the cosmos: \\"From the ashes of stars, I rise anew. 'Ex cineribus stellarum, nova ortus sum.'\\" With these words, the boundaries of flesh and spirit blurred, the distinction between mortal and divine melting into the ether. The Iridescent Orb, now a part of him and he of it, pulsed with the heartbeat of creation, a beacon of singular purpose and universal harmony. \\"In the crucible of the cosmos, I am reforged.

The energy that had coursed through him during the Harmonic Revolution now crystallized into a crown of ethereal light, signifying his ascendance to a higher state of being. In this moment of apotheosis, Sage Allspice transcended the mortal coil, his essence a confluence of the arcane and the divine. He had become a deity of his own crafting, a sovereign of the liminal spaces between worlds, a guardian of the cosmic balance he had so daringly reimagined. The music of the spheres, his eternal legacy, played on—a testament to the infinite possibilities of magic, the enduring power of will, and the transcendent nature of true enlightenment. Sage Allspice, now a part of the cosmos itself, watched over the realms with a sage's wisdom and a magician's grace, his apotheosis a beacon for those who dared to dream beyond the bounds of reality. And so, in the tale of Sage Allspice and the Harmonic Revolution, we find not an end, but a beginning—a journey perpetual and ever-unfolding, a reminder that within us lies the potential for our own apotheosis, should we but have the courage to reach for the stars and the will to make them sing.

His consciousness expanded, touching the farthest nebulae and the tiniest quarks alike, his being a bridge between the macrocosm and the microcosm. The spheres, still singing the song of the Harmonic Revolution, pulsed with the magic that Sage Allspice had infused into their orbits. But his ascendancy brought forth not just a change in the celestial dance but initiated a deeper, more profound connection between all aspects of the cosmos. Every star, every planet, every grain of cosmic dust was now interlinked in a Luminous Tapestry—a network of light and energy that thrummed with the potential for life, magic, and understanding. \\"Within the All, I am the binding thread. 'Intra Omnia, ego vinculum filum sum.'\\" With these words, Sage Allspice declared his new purpose. From his elevated state of existence, he saw the fragmentation that had once plagued the realms—worlds isolated in their struggles, beings disconnected from the essence of others. He envisioned a universe where the Luminous Tapestry served not merely as a metaphor for connectedness but as a tangible manifestation of unity and empathy. Drawing upon the infinite reservoir of his power, he reached out to the minds and hearts of all sentient beings. Like a gentle caress, his presence invited them to open their eyes to the magic that bound them together, to the energy that pulsed beneath their feet, within their souls, and above their heads in the starlit heavens. \\"Awaken to the ties that bind, to the song that unites. 'Expergiscimini ad vincula quae ligant, ad cantum qui unit.'\\" This invocation, subtle yet profound, stirred something within the hearts of those who heard it. Across galaxies and dimensions, beings began to perceive their fellows not as strangers but as parts of a greater whole. The energy that flowed through the Luminous Tapestry sparked a renaissance of magic and technology, of art and philosophy—a collective leap forward propelled by the understanding of shared destiny and mutual caretaking. In worlds where strife had once reigned, peace took root. In hearts where darkness had festered, light blossomed. And in the vast, once-silent stretches of the universe, a chorus of voices rose, each adding its unique note to the cosmic symphony, each affirming its place in the Luminous Tapestry that Sage Allspice had envisioned. \\"Through the All, we are one.

Typical cooking temperatures range from 175 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (about 80 to 200 degrees Celsius). 3. **Cooking Process**: The device's heating element heats the air inside the machine, while a fan circulates this hot air around the food. This process cooks the food quickly and evenly, producing a crispy outer layer. 4. **End of Cooking**: Most air fryers will notify the user either with a beep or by automatically turning off when the cooking cycle is complete. # Advantages of Using an Air Fryer: - **Healthier Meals**: By using less oil, air fryers can cook healthier versions of traditionally unhealthy fried foods. - **Quicker Cooking Times**: Air fryers generally cook food faster than traditional ovens, with preheating times that are significantly shorter. - **Crispier Results**: For foods like french fries, chicken wings, and vegetables, an air fryer can achieve a crispy texture that's hard to get with baking. - **Cleaner and Safer**: Without the need to work with large quantities of hot oil, cooking with an air fryer is cleaner and reduces the risk of accidents. # Considerations: While air fryers offer a healthier alternative to traditional frying and provide convenience, they may not always replicate the exact taste and texture of deep-fried foods. Additionally, due to their size, air fryers might not be suitable for cooking large meals in one go, making them less ideal for larger families or gatherings without cooking in batches. In summary, air fryers are a convenient, versatile, and healthier cooking appliance suitable for preparing a wide range of foods, from snacks to main dishes."},{"instruction":"How to cook French fries in an air fryer?","output":"Cooking French fries in an air fryer is a simple and healthier alternative to deep-frying. Air fryer French fries offer a crispy texture without the excessive oil. Here’s a basic recipe to get you started: # Ingredients - 2 large potatoes - 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil (or any vegetable oil of your choice) - Salt, to taste - Optional: pepper, garlic powder, paprika, or any other seasoning you like # Instructions 1. **Prep the Potatoes**: Start by peeling the potatoes (if you prefer them peeled; otherwise, just wash them thoroughly). Cut them into thin slices for a classic French fry shape. Try to keep the slices uniform for even cooking. 2. **Soak the Potatoes**: Soak the potato slices in cold water for at least 30 minutes, or even overnight if you have time. This step helps remove excess starch, contributing to a crispier end product. 3. **Dry the Potatoes**: After soaking, thoroughly drain and dry the potato slices with a clean towel. It’s crucial they’re dry to ensure they crisp up in the air fryer. 4. **Season**: Place the dried potato slices in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and your choice of seasoning. Toss until the fries are evenly coated. 5. **Preheat the Air Fryer** (optional, depending on your model): Preheat your air fryer to 380°F (about 193°C) for a few minutes. Not all models require preheating, so consult your air fryer’s manual. 6. **Cook**: Place the seasoned potato slices in the air fryer basket. Try not to overcrowd them; cook in batches if necessary for better circulation of air and even cooking. 7. **Fry**: Cook the fries at 380°F (193°C) for 10-15 minutes. Shake the basket or toss the fries halfway through the cooking time to ensure they cook evenly. 8. **Crisp Them Up**: For extra crispiness, increase the temperature to 400°F (about 204°C) and cook for an additional 5 minutes or until they’ve reached your desired level of crispiness. 9. **Final Seasoning**: Once cooked, you can toss the fries in a bit more salt or seasoning if needed. 10. **Serve**: Serve the fries immediately while they’re hot and crispy for the best taste and texture. # Tips for Perfect Air Fryer French Fries: - **Soaking**: Don’t skip the soaking step, as it really helps in removing the starch and achieving crispier fries. - **Oil**: While you need much less oil than deep frying, make sure the fries are well-coated to help them crisp up. - **Batch Cooking**: Avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket. Cooking in batches allows hot air to circulate more effectively. - **Shaking/Tossing**: Shaking the basket a few times during cooking promotes even browning and crisping. With these simple steps, you can enjoy delicious, homemade French fries that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, without the guilt of traditional deep frying!"},{"instruction":"give me some ideas for the name of an astromancy radio station","output":"Creating a name for an astromancy-themed radio station calls for a blend of cosmic allure and radio vibes.

Un exemple courant est l'utilisation de méthodes comme \`firstWhere\` sans qu'aucun élément ne satisfasse le critère, conduisant à cette exception. En revanche, dans le code que vous avez partagé, je ne vois pas immédiatement un appel explicite à une telle méthode pouvant causer cette erreur spécifique. Cependant, voici quelques pistes possibles pour investiguer et résoudre cette erreur dans le cadre de votre application de jeu Snake : 1. **Validation des Coordonnées du Serpent** : Assurez-vous que toutes les opérations de manipulation de la grille et des positions du serpent, y compris sa croissance, valident correctement les coordonnées. Cela inclut de vérifier que \`x\` et \`y\` restent dans les limites de la grille lors du mouvement ou de l'agrandissement du serpent. 2. **Génération et Placement de Nourriture** : Vérifiez le processus de génération et de placement de la nourriture sur la grille. Assurez-vous que \`createFood\` génère des coordonnées qui ne chevauchent pas celles du serpent. Cela peut ne pas être directement lié à l'erreur actuelle, mais peut prévenir des erreurs de logique de jeu futures. 3. **Initialisation et Réinitialisation** : Le processus de démarrage (\`start\`) et de réinitialisation peut être à l'origine de problèmes si le jeu n'est pas remis à un état cohérent. Assurez-vous que toutes les entités du jeu, y compris le serpent et la nourriture, sont correctement initialisées. 4. **Debugging** : Utilisez des points d'arrêt et des logs afin de déterminer exactement où et quand l'erreur se produit. Cela pourrait révéler une opération spécifique qui tente d'accéder à un élément inexistant dans la grille ou dans les listes associées au modèle du serpent. 5. **Construction de l'Interface** : Bien que moins probable étant donné la description de l'erreur, inspectez également le processus de construction de l'interface utilisateur (UI), particulièrement le \`GridView.builder\`, afin de vous assurer qu'il ne tente pas d'accéder à des indices ou à des éléments de la grille qui pourraient ne pas exister. 6. **Review du Code Concernant le Mouvement du Serpent** : Le mouvement et l'agrandissement du serpent sont des actions critiques qui pourraient introduire des états incohérents si mal gérés.

Passons en revue les points principaux qui pourraient causer cela : # 1. Mise à jour Incorrecte de la Grille Dans la méthode \`moveSnake()\` de \`SnakeModel\`, vous insérez d'abord la nouvelle position de tête dans \`bodyPositions\` avant d'effectuer le mouvement. Cependant, vous ne mettez pas à jour la grille (\`gameModel.grid\`) pour montrer la nouvelle position du serpent après le mouvement. Cela signifie que bien que le serpent se déplace logiquement (ses coordonnées \`x\` et \`y\` changent), ces changements ne sont pas reflétés visuellement. # 2. Confusion entre les Coordonnées \`x\` et \`y\` Lorsque vous déterminez les coordonnées \`x\` et \`y\` à partir de l'index dans votre \`GridView.builder\`, vous avez: \`\`\`dart int y = index ~/ GameModel.NB_COLONNES; int x = index - ((index ~/ GameModel.NB_COLONNES) * GameModel.NB_COLONNES); \`\`\` Cela est correct, mais il est important de s'assurer que ces conventions \`x\` (colonne) et \`y\` (ligne) sont cohérentes partout dans votre code. Par exemple, en ajoutant ou en enlevant de la grille, assurez-vous que vous utilisez \`y\` pour les lignes et \`x\` pour les colonnes respectivement. Il semble y avoir une incohérence dans \`moveSnake\` quand \`bodyPositions.removeLast()\` est utilisé mais pas mis à jour correctement sur la grille. # 3. Mise à jour Correcte de la Grille Dans votre méthode \`displaySnake()\`, vous n'avez pas mis à jour \`gameModel.grid\` pour montrer les nouvelles positions du corps du serpent. Vous devez itérer sur \`bodyPositions\` et assigner \`GameModel.SNAKE_BODY\` ou \`GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD\` à chaque position appropriée sur la grille. Assurez-vous également de remettre à 0 les emplacements précédents du serpent sur la grille pour éviter des affichages incorrects. # Solution Potentielle Vous devriez ajouter une logique dans \`displaySnake()\` pour nettoyer l'ancienne position du serpent sur la grille et la mettre à jour avec les nouvelles positions. Voici une version simplifiée de ce que cela pourrait être : \`\`\`dart void displaySnake() { // Nettoyer l'ancienne position for(var position in bodyPositionsOld) { gameModel.grid[position[1]][position[0]] = 0; } // Mettre à jour la grille avec les nouvelles positions du serpent for (var position in bodyPositions) { gameModel.grid[position[1]][position[0]] = GameModel.SNAKE_BODY; // Utilisez SNAKE_HEAD pour la tête } // N'oubliez pas de marquer la première position comme SNAKE_HEAD if(bodyPositions.isNotEmpty) { var head = bodyPositions.first; gameModel.grid[head[1]][head[0]] = GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD; } } \`\`\` Veillez à bien séparer les coordonnées \`x\` (colonne) et \`y\` (ligne) dans votre logique, surtout lorsque vous travaillez avec \`gameModel.grid\`. En corrégeant ces points, le mouvement et la croissance du serpent devraient se refléter visuellement dans votre interface utilisateur."},{"instruction":"Unlike dynasties like the Qin, Han, Sui, Tang, Song, and even the Yuan and Ming, why did the Qing Dynasty expand its borders and territories into what is now Mongolia, Xinjiang (and Dzungaria), Tibet and Taiwan? Why didn't other dynasties do this, while the Qing did?","output":"The Qing Dynasty expanded its borders for several reasons: 1. Military power: The Qing Dynasty was established by the Manchu people, who were warlike and had a strong military tradition. This allowed them to conquer and annex neighboring territories more easily compared to previous dynasties. 2. Economic motives: The Qing Dynasty sought to control valuable resources and trade routes in regions like Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan. By expanding their territories, they were able to increase their wealth and power. 3. Strategic considerations: The Qing Dynasty wanted to secure their borders and prevent incursions from rival powers, such as the Russian Empire and Central Asian tribes. By expanding into these areas, they were able to create buffer zones and strengthen their defenses. 4. Ideological reasons: The Qing Dynasty believed in the concept of Mandate of Heaven, which held that the Emperor had the divine right to rule over all lands. By expanding their territories, they were able to fulfill this belief and solidify their legitimacy as rulers. In contrast, previous dynasties like the Song and Ming were more focused on consolidating their power within China proper and did not prioritize territorial expansion. They also faced internal unrest and external threats, which limited their ability to expand beyond their borders. Additionally, the geography and political landscape of these regions made it more challenging for previous dynasties to successfully conquer and control them."},{"instruction":"What exactly was the relations between Qing Dynasty China and the Mongols in what is now today Mongolia and Inner Mongolia? And what were the relations between these Mongol peoples and the Dzungars and other Oirat Mongols in the Dzungar Khanate?","output":"The relations between the Qing Dynasty and the Mongols in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia were complex and evolved over time. The Qing Dynasty initially faced resistance from the Mongols when they first conquered China in the mid-17th century. However, the Qing rulers eventually established control over the Mongol regions and incorporated them into the Qing Empire. The Qing Dynasty implemented a policy of divide and rule, where they appointed Mongol nobles as local rulers and granted them autonomy in exchange for their loyalty to the Qing government. This helped to maintain stability and prevent uprisings among the Mongol population. In Inner Mongolia, the Qing Dynasty established the Eight Banners system, which was a military and administrative organization that included Mongol, Manchu, and Han Chinese troops. The Mongols were integrated into the Eight Banners and played a significant role in the Qing military and government. The relations between the Mongols and the Dzungars, who were Oirat Mongols ruling the Dzungar Khanate in what is now Xinjiang and parts of Mongolia, were often characterized by conflict and competition. The Dzungars were traditional rivals of the Qing Dynasty and frequently clashed with the Qing forces over control of territories and resources. In the early 18th century, the Qing Dynasty launched a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars, culminating in the Qing conquest of the Dzungar Khanate in 1755. The defeat of the Dzungars marked the end of their independence and their territories were incorporated into the Qing Empire. Overall, the relations between the Qing Dynasty, the Mongols in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, and the Dzungars were shaped by a combination of military conquest, diplomacy, and political alliances. The Qing Dynasty sought to maintain control over these regions through a combination of military force and political manipulation, while also incorporating the Mongol and Oirat populations into the Qing administrative and military structures."},{"instruction":"The Empire of Japan had supported Manchurian independence in the hope to divide and weaken Qing Dynasty China. Were there other times Japan supported independence movements, or other conflicts in order to destabilize, weaken, and divide China?","output":"Yes, Japan has a history of supporting independence movements and conflicts in order to destabilize, weaken, and divide China. Some notable instances include: 1. The First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895): Japan's victory in this war marked the first time a modern Asian power defeated a European power (Qing Dynasty China) in a war. Japan's primary goal was to gain control over Korea and Taiwan, as well as to weaken China's influence in the region. The Treaty of Shimonoseki that ended the war forced China to cede Taiwan to Japan and recognize Korea's independence. 2. The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905): Japan's victory over Russia in this war further solidified its position as a major regional power and allowed Japan to expand its influence in East Asia. Japan's support for Korean independence movements and its desire to weaken Russian influence in the region were key factors in the conflict. 3. World War II: During World War II, Japan invaded and occupied parts of China, including Manchuria, in an effort to expand its empire and weaken Chinese resistance. Japan's brutal occupation of China resulted in widespread devastation and loss of life. 4. Support for Taiwanese independence: In more recent times, Japan has expressed support for Taiwanese independence, which has strained its relations with China. Japan's support for Taiwan's independence movement is seen as a way to counter China's growing influence in the region. Overall, Japan's history of supporting independence movements and conflicts in China has been driven by a combination of strategic, political, and territorial interests. These actions have often been aimed at weakening China's power and influence in the region, while also advancing Japan's own geopolitical goals."},{"instruction":"How did allies before, during, and after the World Wars work? Despite the Russo-Japanese War, Russia and Japan were considered allies in World War 1, simultaneously being alongside the United States, the UK, France and Italy and against Germany (German Empire) and its allies, but Japan would soon ally with Nazi Germany and Italy?","output":"The dynamics of alliances before, during, and after the World Wars were complex and often driven by shifting geopolitical interests and alliances of convenience. Here is a brief overview of how alliances worked during these periods: Before World War I: - In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European powers formed alliances to protect their interests and maintain a balance of power on the continent. - The Triple Entente, consisting of France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, was formed to counter the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. - Japan, seeking to expand its influence in East Asia, formed an alliance with the UK in 1902 and later with Russia in 1907. During World War I: - When World War I broke out in 1914, the alliances were put into action. Russia, France, and the UK (along with their colonies) formed the Allies, while Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire formed the Central Powers. - Japan, as an ally of the UK and Russia, joined the war on the side of the Allies and declared war on Germany in 1914. - Despite their previous conflict in the Russo-Japanese War, Russia and Japan fought together as allies during World War I. After World War I: - Following the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, officially ending the war and imposing harsh penalties on Germany. - Japan, as one of the victorious Allied powers, gained territories and influence in East Asia as a result of the treaty. - However, Japan's relations with the Western powers began to deteriorate in the interwar period, leading to Japan's increasing militarization and expansionist policies. Before World War II: - In the lead-up to World War II, Japan pursued an aggressive foreign policy, expanding its empire through military conquests in China and Southeast Asia. - Japan signed the Tripartite Pact in 1940, forming an alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. This alliance was driven by shared anti-communist sentiments and a desire to counter the influence of the Soviet Union and the Western powers. During World War II: - Japan's alliance with Germany and Italy during World War II placed it on the Axis side, fighting against the Allied powers, including the US, UK, Soviet Union, and China. - Japan's military actions in East Asia and the Pacific, including the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, drew the US into the war and led to a prolonged and devastating conflict in the region. Overall, the alliances before, during, and after the World Wars were shaped by a complex interplay of political, military, and strategic considerations, leading to shifting alliances and conflicts among major powers."},{"instruction":"Complete the sentences with the -ing form or to • infinitive of the verbs in brackets. 1 If the soup doesn't taste very good, try (add) some salt.\\" 2 We regret : (inform) you that your application has not been accepted. 3 On the way to the cinema I stopped (buy! the cinema guide. 4 The students couldn't help laughing when they saw I'd forgotten (put) my socks on in the morning. 5 This place looks familiar, I remember (come) here before. 6 You're too slow, Peter.

Se llamará al script con un parámetro, que será la opción del menú que desea. El programa sólo se termina si se inserta la tecla s. Se deben contemplar todas las situaciones anómalas (que no se llame al script con un único argumento, que en lugar de una de las opciones del menú se presione cualquier otro carácter o número, etc…) El siguiente menú es el siguiente: -v Inserta –v para visualizar este menú de opciones -i Inserta –i para insertar un nuevo usuario -e Inserta –e para eliminar un usuario -c Inserta –c para cambiar la contraseña de un usuario -m Inserta –m para mostrar la información del usuario -s Inserta –s para salir del programa Cuando se indique como primer argumento o seleccione la opción “-v” se debe llamar a una función que muestre el menú anterior en pantalla y lea la opción elegida por el usuario.

Se debe mostrar el nombre, el directorio home y interprete de comandos (/bin/bash o el que corresonda) del nuevo usuario en el fichero /etc/passwd. A continuación se muestra cómo se guardan los usuarios en dicho fichero. Cuando se indique como primer argumento o seleccione la opción “-e” se debe llamar a una función que elimine el usuario cuyo nombre se pida por pantalla (deluser). Busca si existe algún grupo con el nombre del usuario y si es así indícalo con un mensaje para que usuario lo sepa. (el fichero /etc/group contiene todos los grupos que existen en el sistema).

Introduites dans ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), les fonctions fléchées offrent une syntaxe plus courte pour déclarer des fonctions et elles partagent le même contexte lexical \`this\` que le code qui les entoure. Cela les rend particulièrement utiles pour les callbacks et les fonctions qui sont utilisées dans des méthodes d'arrays comme map, filter, et reduce. Voici la structure de base d'une fonction fléchée : \`\`\`javascript const nomDeLaFonction = (param1, param2, ...) => { // Corps de la fonction }; \`\`\` Si la fonction ne prend qu'un seul argument, les parenthèses autour des paramètres sont facultatives : \`\`\`javascript const carre = x => x * x; \`\`\` Quand une fonction fléchée contient une seule instruction qui retourne une valeur, les accolades \`{}\` et le mot-clé \`return\` peuvent être omis : \`\`\`javascript const additionner = (a, b) => a + b; \`\`\` Un avantage notable des fonctions fléchées est leur comportement vis-à-vis du mot-clé \`this\`. Contrairement aux fonctions traditionnelles, le \`this\` dans une fonction fléchée est déterminé par le contexte lexical dans lequel la fonction est créée, et non par la manière dont elle est appelée. Cela les rend particulièrement utiles pour les méthodes où le contexte \`this\` est important et ne doit pas changer, comme les gestionnaires d'événements ou les callbacks. Considérations importantes concernant les fonctions fléchées : - Les fonctions fléchées ne sont pas nommées (sauf si elles sont assignées à une variable), ce qui peut rendre le debugging légèrement plus difficile. - Elles ne peuvent pas être utilisées comme constructeurs (vous ne pouvez pas utiliser le mot-clé \`new\` avec une fonction fléchée). - Elles ne possèdent pas leur propre objet \`arguments\`, mais vous pouvez accéder à un objet \`arguments\` de la portée englobante. La concision et la simplicité des fonctions fléchées en font un outil populaire pour écrire un code JavaScript plus lisible et plus fonctionnel."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Одним из ключевых критериев интегрируемости по Риману является Критерий Лебега, согласно которому функция интегрируема по Риману на отрезке [a, b] тогда и только тогда, когда она ограничена на [a, b] и множество её точек разрыва имеет меру нуль. Мера Лебега множества – это обобщение понятия длины интервала или площади фигуры на более сложные множества. Множество имеет меру нуль, если его можно покрыть счётным числом интервалов сколь угодно малой суммарной длины. Исходя из формулировки вопроса, рассматривается функция, которая разрывна на некотором непустом открытом множестве на интервале [a, b]. Основная проблема здесь состоит в том, что открытое множество не может иметь меру нуль, если оно непустое, поскольку любое открытое непустое множество на вещественной оси содержит интервал, длина которого положительна. Это означает, что если функция разрывна во всех точках такого непустого открытого множества, тогда множество точек её разрыва не может иметь меру нуль. Таким образом, согласно Критерию Лебега, функция, разрывная во всех точках некоторого непустого открытого множества на [a, b], не может быть интегрируемой по Риману на этом отрезке, поскольку для интегрируемости по Риману необходимо, чтобы множество точек разрыва имело меру нуль, а в данном случае оно явно имеет меру, превышающую нуль."},{"instruction":"Пусть 𝐸 – замкнутое множество меры нуль на [𝑎, 𝑏]. Интегрируема ли его характеристическая функция 𝒳𝐸(𝑡) на [𝑎, 𝑏]?","output":"Характеристическая функция множества (E), обозначаемая как (chi_E(t)), определена следующим образом: она равна 1, если (t) принадлежит множеству (E), и 0 в противном случае. При рассмотрении вопроса об интегрируемости по Риману такой функции на интервале ([a, b]), ключевую роль играет её поведение на этом интервале. Множество (E) замкнуто и имеет меру нуль. Согласно критерию Лебега интегрируемости функции по Риману, функция интегрируема на ([a, b]) тогда и только тогда, когда она ограничена на этом отрезке и множество её точек разрыва имеет меру нуль. Характеристическая функция (chi_E(t)) ограничена на ([a, b]), так как она принимает только значения 0 и 1. Поскольку (E) — замкнутое множество меры нуль, то любые точки разрыва функции (chi_E(t)) могут возникать только на границах множеств, где функция меняет своё значение с 0 на 1 или с 1 на 0, т.е. в точках множества (E). Поскольку множество (E) имеет меру нуль, то и множество точек разрыва характеристической функции имеет меру нуль. Исходя из этого, можно сделать вывод, что характеристическая функция (chi_E(t)) интегрируема по Риману на ([a, b]), поскольку она удовлетворяет условиям критерия Лебега: она ограничена, а множество её точек разрыва имеет меру нуль."},{"instruction":"Проверить интегрируемы ли на [0,1] по Риману функции: 𝑥1(𝑡) = {𝑡^2,𝑡 − иррац.;𝑡^3,𝑡 − рац. 𝑥2(𝑡) = {𝑡^2, (𝑡 − иррац)⋀(𝑡 > 1/3);𝑡^3, (𝑡 − иррац)⋀(𝑡 < 1/3);𝑡^4, (𝑡 − рац). 𝑥3(𝑡) = {sin 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ [0,1/2] ∩ ([0/1]𝐾);cos 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ [1/2,1] ∩ ([0/1]𝐾);sin 𝜋𝑡 + cos 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ 𝐾.

Если да, то вычислить интеграл Лебега","output":"Для каждой из этих функций рассмотрим отдельно их интегрируемость по Риману и по Лебегу на отрезке ([0, 1]). # Функция (x_1(t)) - **Интегрируемость по Риману**: Точки, где функция (x_1(t)) различается ((t^2) для иррациональных (t) и (t^3) для рациональных (t)), формируют множество точек разрыва, которое по сути является объединением всех рациональных и иррациональных чисел на ([0, 1]). Однако, рациональные числа образуют счетное множество, которое имеет меру нуль, это не нарушает критерий Лебега для интегрируемости по Риману. Тем не менее, изменение функции на наборе рациональных чисел не позволяет ей удовлетворять определению Римана об интегрируемости, так как любое разбиение отрезка будет содержать точки, в которых функция имеет различные значения. Поэтому, с математической строгостью, функция (x_1(t)) не интегрируема по Риману. - **Интегрируемость по Лебегу**: Функция (x_1(t)) является измеримой, так как она чётко определена на всём интервале. Поэтому, её можно интегрировать по Лебегу. # Функция (x_2(t)) - **Интегрируемость по Риману**: Для (x_2(t)), условия определения меняются в зависимости от рациональности (t) и его положения относительно точки (1/3). Так как точки разрыва состоят из счетного объединения рациональных чисел и непрерывных переходов между частями в зависимости от значений (t), эта функция, строго говоря, также не удовлетворяет условиям интегрируемости по Риману из-за разнообразия значений в точках разрыва на отрезке. - **Интегрируемость по Лебегу**: Функция (x_2(t)) также измерима, и, учитывая, что особые точки имеют меру нуль (рациональные числа), её интеграл по Лебегу можно вычислить. # Функция (x_3(t)) - **Интегрируемость по Риману**: Функция (x_3(t)) меняет свое поведение в зависимости от того, принадлежит ли (t) канторову множеству (mathcal{K}). Канторово множество имеет меру нуль, поэтому изменения функции (x_3(t)) в точках канторова множества влияют на интегрируемость по Риману в меньшей степени. То есть, для всех других целей, функция непрерывна на ([0, 1]), и может считаться интегрируемой по Риману. - **Интегрируемость по Лебегу**: Функция (x_3(t)) измерима и, учитывая, что особые точки, где она определена через (sin pi t + cos pi t), имеют меру нуль, её также можно интегрировать по Лебегу. **Вычисление интеграла Лебега**: Для точного вычисления интеграла Лебега каждой из функций, необходима более детальная информация о способе обработки каждого случая. Однако, для функций, которые в основном определяются классическими полиномиальными выражениями за исключением множеств меры нуль, их интегралы по Лебегу будут эквивалентны классическим интегралам их полиномиальных частей на ([0, 1]), игнорируя множества меры нуль. Канторово множество и множество рациональных чисел в ([0, 1]) имеют меру нуль, поэтому вклад от изменений функций в этих точках будет нулевым."},{"instruction":"вычислить интеграл Лебега для функции 𝑥1(𝑡) = {𝑡^2,𝑡 − иррац.;𝑡^3,𝑡 − рац. на [0,1]","output":"Чтобы вычислить интеграл Лебега для функции (x_1(t)), определенной как (x_1(t) = begin{cases} t^2, & t - text{иррациональное} t^3, & t - text{рациональное} end{cases}) на интервале ([0,1]), важно понимать, что множество рациональных чисел на любом отрезке вещественной оси является счетным, и, следовательно, имеет меру нуль по Лебегу. Это означает, что для вычисления интеграла Лебега по всему интервалу мы можем сосредоточиться на функции (t^2), так как вклад от (t^3) (при рациональных (t)) будет пренебрежимо малым, поскольку множество рациональных чисел имеет меру нуль. Таким образом, интеграл Лебега для (x_1(t)) на интервале от 0 до 1 фактически сводится к вычислению интеграла от (t^2) на этом интервале, что является классической задачей интегрирования. Интеграл от (t^2) по (t) от 0 до 1 равен: [ int_{0}^{1} t^2 , dt = left.frac{t^3}{3}right|_{0}^{1} = frac{1^3}{3} - frac{0^3}{3} = frac{1}{3} ] Таким образом, интеграл Лебега функции (x_1(t)) на интервале ([0, 1]) равен (frac{1}{3})."},{"instruction":"вычислить интеграл Лебега для функции 𝑥2(𝑡) = {𝑡^2, (𝑡 − иррац)⋀(𝑡 > 1/3);𝑡^3, (𝑡 − иррац)⋀(𝑡 < 1/3);𝑡^4, (𝑡 − рац) на [0,1]","output":"Для вычисления интеграла Лебега функции (x_2(t)), определённой как: [x_2(t) = left{ begin{array}{ll} t^2, & (t - text{иррац}) wedge (t > frac{1}{3}); t^3, & (t - text{иррац}) wedge (t < frac{1}{3}); t^4, & (t - text{рац}), end{array} right.] на интервале ([0,1]), нужно учесть вклад каждой из функций в соответствии с их областями определения. - **Для (t^2):** Эта функция определяется для иррациональных значений (t) больше (frac{1}{3}). Поэтому, её вклад в интеграл будет интервалом от (frac{1}{3}) до 1 (включительно). - **Для (t^3):** Она применяется для иррациональных (t) меньше (frac{1}{3}) (не включая (frac{1}{3})). Принимая во внимание длину интервала, включаем его в интеграл по соответствующему интервалу от 0 до (frac{1}{3}). - **Для (t^4):** Эта часть функции определяется для рациональных значений (t). Несмотря на то что рациональные числа плотно заполняют весь интервал ([0, 1]), их мера (по Лебегу) равна нулю, и этот случай можно игнорировать при вычислении интеграла по Лебегу. Это подтверждает особенность интегрирования по Лебегу: множества меры нуль не влияют на значение интеграла. Поскольку практически весь вклад в интеграл исходит из функций, определенных для иррациональных чисел, рассмотрим эти два случая отдельно и интегрируем: 1. (t^2) на интервале от (frac{1}{3}) до 1: [ int_{frac{1}{3}}^{1} t^2 dt = left.frac{t^3}{3}right|_{frac{1}{3}}^{1} = frac{1}{3} - left(frac{1}{3}right)^3 frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{81} = frac{27}{81} - frac{1}{81} = frac{26}{81} ] 2. (t^3) на интервале от 0 до (frac{1}{3}): [ int_{0}^{frac{1}{3}} t^3 dt = left.frac{t^4}{4}right|_{0}^{frac{1}{3}} = left(frac{1}{3}right)^4 frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{81} cdot frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{324} ] Сложим эти два значения, чтобы получить общий интеграл Лебега для функции на интервале ([0,1]): [ text{Интеграл} = frac{26}{81} + frac{1}{324} = frac{104}{324} + frac{1}{324} = frac{105}{324} = frac{35}{108} ] Таким образом, интеграл Лебега функции (x_2(t)) на ([0,1]) составляет (frac{35}{108})."},{"instruction":"вычислить интеграл Лебега для функции 𝑥3(𝑡) = {sin 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ [0,1/2] ∩ ([0/1]𝐾);cos 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ [1/2,1] ∩ ([0/1]𝐾);sin 𝜋𝑡 + cos 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ 𝐾 на [0,1]","output":"Для вычисления интеграла Лебега функции (x_3(t)), заданной условиями [x_3(t) = left{ begin{aligned} &sin pi t, & t in [0,tfrac{1}{2}] cap ([0,1]setminusmathcal{K}); &cos pi t, & t in [tfrac{1}{2},1] cap ([0,1]setminusmathcal{K}); &sin pi t + cos pi t, & t in mathcal{K}, end{aligned} right.] на интервале ([0,1]), где (mathcal{K}) — Канторово множество, важно понимать распределение функции и особенностей множества (mathcal{K}). Поскольку Канторово множество (mathcal{K}) имеет меру Лебега нуль, вклад в интеграл от тех точек, где (t in mathcal{K}), будет игнорироваться при вычислении интеграла по Лебегу. Следовательно, интеграл по (x_3(t)) можно разбить на два основных интеграла, поскольку (t in [0,1]setminusmathcal{K}) для большей части интервала ([0,1]), а вклад от (t in mathcal{K}) будет равен нулю, учитывая, что (mathcal{K}) имеет меру нуль. **Вычисляем интегралы:** 1.

Transformer 구조 - **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Transformer 구조의 핵심은 자기 주의(self-attention) 메커니즘에 있습니다. 이 메커니즘은 입력된 각 단어(또는 토큰)가 문장 내 다른 모든 단어와의 관계를 계산하게 해, 문맥을 깊이 이해할 수 있게 합니다. 따라서, 매우 적은 입력에 대해서도 그 문맥의 의미를 파악하여 풍부하고 관련성 높은 출력을 생성할 수 있습니다. - **Layered Structure**: Transformer 모델은 여러 층(layer)으로 구성되어 있으며, 각 계층은 복잡한 언어 패턴을 학습할 수 있습니다. 따라서, 입력에 대해 매우 세밀하고 복잡한 처리를 할 수 있으며, 이는 더 풍부하고 다양한 출력을 가능하게 합니다. # 2. 대량의 데이터에 대한 사전 훈련 (Pre-training) - **Language Modeling**: GPT와 같은 모델은 대규모 텍스트 코퍼스를 사용하여 사전 훈련됩니다. 이 훈련 과정에서 모델은 문맥적 단어 예측, 즉 주어진 문맥에서 다음에 올 단어를 예측하는 작업을 반복적으로 수행합니다. 이 과정으로 모델은 언어의 광범위한 패턴과 구조를 학습하게 되며, 이 지식을 바탕으로 적은 입력에도 불구하고 풍부한 문맥을 추론할 수 있게 됩니다. - **Fine-tuning**: 사전 훈련된 모델을 특정 작업이나 도메인에 맞게 추가적으로 훈련할 수 있습니다. 이 과정은 모델이 특정 주제나 분야에 더 잘 맞는 출력을 생성하는 데 도움이 됩니다. # 결론 적은 입력으로부터 풍부한 출력을 생성하는 능력은 GPT 모델의 Transformer 구조와 사전 훈련 과정의 결과입니다.

Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best “positive thinking” prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models.

As these models become increasingly sophisticated, understanding and influencing the nuances of their underlying functionality becomes imperative to harness their full potential. Among the myriad factors influencing the performance of language models, the concept of “positive thinking” has emerged as a fascinating and surprisingly influential dimension. Intuition tells us that, in the context of language model systems, like any other computer system, “positive thinking” should not affect performance, but empirical experience has demonstrated otherwise. This paper aims to quantify the impact of various “positive thinking” additions to the system message of a prompt. In essence, it explores the influence of seemingly worthless prompt modifications by measuring the fluctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset. As the quest for near-perfect performance from Artificial Intelligence (AI) intensifies, understanding the effect of “positive thinking” in language model prompts can add crucial performance points to test set scores. We will show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. Then we’ll show that not only does systematic prompt optimization outperform “positive thinking”, even with smaller open-source models, but that it also generalizes better. Additionally, we’ll show that the highest-scoring automatically-generated prompt is remarkably different from anything a human practitioner would be likely to generate. 2.Related Work The genesis of prompt engineering can be traced back to the seminal Chain of Thought paper by Wei et al. (Wei et al., 2023). This pioneering work demonstrated a significant enhancement in model performance by introducing a simple prompt modification: the inclusion of the directive “Think step by step.” The degree of performance improvement, however, is contingent upon the specific model, its size, and the underlying dataset. Subsequently, the PaLM 2 Technical Report by Anil et al. (Anil et al., 2023) revealed that the application of Chain of Thought prompts may yield adverse effects on certain datasets. This observation underscores the absence of a universal prompt snippet capable of unconditionally improving model performance. Consequently, the landscape of prompt engineering has witnessed the emergence of resources such as the Prompt Engineering Guide1, aiming to catalog the myriad techniques and scholarly contributions2 constituting the expansive realm of prompt engineering. These endeavors reflect an ongoing effort to navigate the diverse techniques and insights propelling the continuous evolution of effective prompting strategies. In addition to the formally published literature on prompt engineering, numerous discussions on less formal discoveries can be found in countless threads on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit3. 3.Experimental Design To test the impact of “positive thinking” prompts, we vary the system message part of the prompt with a combination of “openers”, “task descriptions”, and “closers” in the following format: <<SYS>>{opener}{task_description}{closer}<</SYS>> Refer to Table 1, 2, and 3 for a comprehensive compilation of the opening snippets, task descriptions, and closing snippets utilized in our study. Given the incorporation of 5 openers, 3 task descriptions, and 4 closers, our experimentation involved a total of 60 unique combinations. Additionally, we conducted tests both with and without Chain of Thought prompting, resulting in a grand total of 120 prompt combinations per input per model. Although the possibility of expanding the range of snippets within each category existed (and the temptation to do so was strong), we made a deliberate decision to limit our selection due to the significant time commitment associated with the computational complexity of testing, as exemplified by the runtime required for 60 prompt combinations for a 70-billion-parameter model with Chain of Thought being measured in days, not hours.

Table 3.Closing snippets for the system message. 3.1.Dataset Careful selection of the dataset for testing against constitutes a critical aspect of this study. Our aim was to identify a challenging task that was unlikely to have been directly encountered during the training of the models4. While our preference was for an internal dataset specific to VMware, the absence of large-scale datasets with directly quantifiable scoring metrics, such as accuracy or F1, necessitated the utilization of a publicly available benchmark dataset. Ultimately, we opted for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Given the ongoing limitations of contemporary LLMs, particularly in addressing basic mathematical tasks, especially those involving multi-step reasoning, we deemed GSM8K an optimal choice for illustrating the impact of seemingly inconsequential augmentations to the prompt’s system message. 3.2.Scoring In the context of GSM8K’s mathematical assessment, we adopted a stringent approach to scoring that precluded the assignment of partial credit. Thus, we employed Exact Match (EM) as our scoring metric. The model was evaluated based on whether it correctly provided the exact numerical solution or not. This rigorous methodology ensures a clear and unambiguous assessment of the model’s accuracy in providing the exact numerical output. 3.3.Output Parsing Given the unforgiving nature of EM scoring, it is essential to note that, despite the answer to GSM8K questions being numerical, the output of an LLM is a string. Consequently, meticulous attention must be paid to the formatting and parsing of the non-numerical output. From the standpoint of string equality, it is imperative to recognize distinctions such as the string “30000” not being equivalent to “30,000” or “30000.00”. To mitigate this challenge, a post-processing step was implemented to ensure accurate scoring by preventing misclassification of a response as incorrect when it was, in fact, accurate. 3.4.Scale Benchmark datasets typically encompass thousands of examples in their test sets; GSM8K has over 1,300 examples in its test set. Such an extensive scale of data is exceptionally uncommon in real-world datasets, particularly during the initial stages of a project. To replicate this rarity, we systematically subset the test set of GSM8K, extracting subsets containing the first 10, 25, 50, and 100 questions, thereby allowing us to illustrate the impact of “positive thinking” as the dataset size increases. Notably, we limited our experiments to a maximum of 100 questions to mitigate computation time, as computing results for the entire test set would have required weeks and incurred a substantial carbon cost for what would likely be diminishing returns. 3.5.Model Selection Although we aspired to assess widely recognized commercial models such as GPT-3.5/4, Gemini, Claude, etc., conducting experiments involving 12,000 requests per model was deemed financially prohibitive, as it would have incurred costs amounting to many thousands of dollars. Consequently, we opted to utilize models hosted by VMware NLP Lab’s LLM API. Specifically, our evaluations were conducted on Mistral-7B5 (Jiang et al., 2023), Llama2-13B6 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama2-70B7 (Touvron et al., 2023).

Given the nature of these models, specifically that they were designed for conversational interactions, achieving success in terms of Exact Match (EM) scoring necessitated guiding the model to refrain from generating a response comprising multiple sentences. To accomplish this, we resorted to incorporating examples via in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), as exposure to instances of the desired output format significantly increased the likelihood of the model producing responses aligned with the specified format (though, as previously mentioned, significant post-processing was still required to get the simple numerical response). To maintain experimental consistency by minimizing the number of variables that changed in each iteration, we adopted an intentionally naive strategy for in-context learning. Strategies such as K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) example selection have been shown to increase model performance (Liu et al., 2021); however, we chose not to employ any such strategies, so as to hold the number of variables changing per experiment to one: the modified system message only. Specifically, we limited the examples to the last four instances from the test set8, thereby providing a consistent and focused set of samples for the model to learn from. Notably, four examples emerged as the minimum number required to consistently elicit the correct output format. 3.7.Automatic Prompt Optimization Engaging in the iterative process of refining prompts and monitoring the subsequent score progression can be an enjoyable endeavor. However, this approach proves to be highly time-inefficient, especially when systematically assessing all modifications from a scientific standpoint. Existing research, as demonstrated by Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2023), highlights the superior capability of LLM systems in optimizing their own prompts compared to human efforts. In light of this, we conducted a comparative analysis pitting human-generated “positive thinking” optimization against the utilization of DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023) Optimizers9 at the same question subsets: 10, 25, 50, and 100. It is noteworthy that the questions utilized for optimization were additional and distinct from the evaluation set and the in-context learning examples, though also originating from the end of the test set. For the most extensive trial, 100 “new” questions were employed for the optimization process, while the same 100 evaluation questions were used for the evaluation processes, so as to make the scores directly comparable. Importantly, each model was exclusively employed to optimize itself; cross-model optimizations, such as using Llama2-70B to optimize the prompt for Mistral-7B, were not pursued. 4.Experimental Results As evidenced in the subsequent sections, certain overarching patterns become apparent; however, they do not universally apply to each model across all prompting strategies. We will explicitly illustrate that there is no straightforward universal prompt snippet that can be added to optimize any given model’s performance. For these experiments, baseline performance refers to the scenario where the model receives no system message, signified by the opening snippet, task description, and closing snippet all being designated as “None”. For Sections 4.1-4.3, refer to Table 4.

Bold is for the higher Average EM. “EM Delta” is the difference between the Exact Match for the two sets. An underline is for the lower EM Delta. All prompts are with Chain of Thought. 4.1.Mistral-7B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting, Mistral-7B’s performance remained remarkably consistent across all prompt permutations. At both the 10 and 25 question sets, there was no deviation. Even for the 100 question subset, the maximum observed standard deviation was a mere 0.007. The variability observed at 50 questions appears to be an anomaly. Examination of the results in Appendix B.3 reveals that, with the exception of one prompt scoring 0.10, all others scored 0.12. It is unclear why this particular prompt led to one additional incorrect response compared to the other 59 prompt variations. In contrast, the results for 100 questions in Appendix B.4 demonstrate a reasonable spread between 0.08 and 0.11. In relative terms, Mistral-7B, when prompted without Chain of Thought, exhibits substantial prompt invariance, with the “positive thinking” prompts only matching or marginally surpassing the baseline. This trend reverses when Mistral-7B is prompted with Chain of Thought. Instead of observing a slight increase in deviation with the number of questions, there is a steady and substantial decrease, ranging from 0.066 at 10 questions to 0.018 at 100 questions. In this scenario, “positive thinking” prompts significantly outperformed the baseline with no prompts falling below the baseline. Please refer to Appendices B.5 through B.8 for the ranked order of prompts for Mistral-7B with Chain of Thought. 4.2.Llama2-13B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was no deviation, Llama2-13B shows an opposite trend to Mistral-7B, with deviation decreasing from 0.014 at 25 questions to 0.003 at 100 questions. While slightly less stable than Mistral-7B, without Chain of Thought, LLama2-13B is also fairly prompt invariant, with the “positive thinking” prompts again only matching or marginally exceeding the baseline. With Chain of Thought prompting, the trend is less clear. It does overall decrease from 0.026 at 10 to 0.016 at 100, but, at 50, it’s even lower, at 0.012. This is the only case where that occurred. For Mistral-7B, and as we’ll show in the next section with Llama2-70B, variation consistently decreased as the number of questions increased when employing Chain of Thought prompting. 4.3.Llama2-70B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was again no deviation, Llama2-70B exhibits a similar trend to Llama2-13B, with deviation again decreasing from 0.017 at 25 questions to 0.050 at 100 questions. Across all three models, the prompt variance was an order of magnitude lower without Chain of Thought when compared to using Chain of Thought at the same question count. However, in terms of actual performance, the “positive thinking” prompts all matched or underperformed baseline. This is a stark departure from the pattern seen with Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B. That departure does not persist when employing Chain of Thought prompting. While the performance of the “positive thinking” prompts with Chain of Thought did underperform the baseline on average for 10 and 25 questions, it outperformed the baseline on average for 50 and 100 questions. As for variance, the general pattern of standard deviation decreasing with question count does hold. 4.4.General Trends in Results It’s challenging to extract many generalizable results across models and prompting strategies, as every nearly evident trend we observed had at least one notable exception. In fact, the only real trend may be no trend. What’s best for any given model, dataset, and prompting strategy is likely to be specific to the particular combination at hand. Thus, we turned from hand-tuning the system message with optimistic “positive thinking” to automatic prompt optimization. 4.5.Automatic Prompt Optimization Results As anticipated, the prompts that underwent automatic optimization consistently equaled or surpassed the effectiveness of our manually generated “positive thinking” prompts in nearly all instances. The instances where “positive thinking” achieved higher average scores across the optimization and evaluation sets were limited to Mistral-7B with 25 questions and Llama2-70B with 10 questions. However, evaluating performance solely on raw scores is insufficient; hence, we also examined the delta between scores on the optimization set and the evaluation set. A lower delta implies superior generalization of the prompt. Therefore, the optimal strategy combines the highest average score with the lowest delta. See Table 5 for the performance comparison. For Mistral-7B, the results present a mixed scenario. “Positive thinking” exhibits a lower delta for 10, 25, and 50 questions, while the automatically optimized prompt demonstrates a lower delta for 100 questions. Considering Mistral-7B’s model capacity, it is understandable that it faces challenges in optimizing its own prompt when compared to the larger Llama2-13B and 70B models. In contrast, for both Llama2-13B and 70B models, the automatically optimized prompts consistently show a lower delta across all cases. Consequently, it is advisable to refrain from manually fine-tuning prompts when using models larger than 7B, and instead, leverage the model’s ability to autonomously optimize prompts. For 7B models, more work is required to see if the trend of automatically optimized prompts outperforming manually tuned prompts holds for sample sizes exceeding 100 questions. This recommendation aligns with the original auto-optimization paper. However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the optimized prompts themselves. They diverge significantly from any prompts we might have devised independently. If presented with these optimized prompts before observing their performance scores, one might have anticipated their inadequacy rather than their consistent outperformance of hand-tailored prompts. A prime example is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and prefix generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset: System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» Answer Prefix: Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proficiency in mathematical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an affinity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently. For a comprehensive collection of the peculiar and fascinating prompts generated by the three models, refer to Appendix C. 5.The Reproducibility Problem Although somewhat peripheral to the primary research question addressed in this paper, it is noteworthy that our findings exhibit significant discrepancies from the published performance scores of Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B, whereas Llama2-70B fell within an acceptable margin of error, considering our evaluation was conducted on approximately 15% of GSM8K’s test set. Refer to Table 6 for the score comparisons. The most significant deviation was observed in the case of Llama2-13B. Meta reported a score of 0.29 on the GSM8K dataset. Our results without Chain of Thought yielded a score of 0.07, whereas with Chain of Thought, we achieved a score of 0.43. Due to both Meta and Mistral AI’s omission of the prompts used for testing their models, we can only speculate about the reasons behind our substantial performance differences compared to their reported scores. This instance underscores a broader issue of reproducibility that has long existed inside the machine learning community, but has become significantly exacerbated since the advent of LLMs. Without the publication of prompts employed by researchers with their models, reproducing their results becomes a formidable challenge. As shown in this paper, trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. We implore all future research publications to include the prompts used in an appendix. Refer to Appendix A to see our prompt templates. Model Reported EM Our EM@100 Delta Mistral-7B 0.52 0.41 − 0.11 Llama2-13B 0.29 0.43 + 0.13 Llama2-70B 0.57 0.61 + 0.04 Table 6.Comparing the reported scores for each model as reported by the model publishers on the whole GSM8K test set against the best average score we were able to achieve across our optimization and evaluation subsets, which accounted for about 15% of the test set. 6.Future Work This work could easily be expanded with additional prompt variants, models, and datasets. However, due to the combinatorial complexity of scientifically testing each change, manual prompt engineering is far from the most efficient methodology for improving model performance. Instead, the best path forward is to use libraries like DSPy to apply a more structured approach to constructing LLM-powered applications and use the built-in optimizer to automatically tune the prompt for your dataset and model of choice. 7.Conclusion It’s both surprising and irritating that trivial modifications to the prompt can exhibit such dramatic swings in performance. Doubly so, since there’s no obvious methodology for improving performance. Affecting performance is trivial. Improving performance, when tuning the prompt by hand, is laborious and computationally prohibitive when using scientific processes to evaluate every change. In this paper, we showed that you don’t need massive commercial models like PaLM 2 or GPT-4 to tune your prompt. Mistral-7B struggled to optimize its own prompt until it had 100 questions to work with. Llama2-13B and 70B were able to produce superior prompts with as little as 10 questions to optimize with. And while the prompts they generated may appear shocking to an experienced practitioner, it’s undeniable that the automatically generated prompts perform better and generalize better than hand-tuned “positive thinking” prompts.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and basic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating “positive thinking” into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of “positive thinking” prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best “positive thinking” prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations. machine learning, language modeling, (automatic) prompt engineering †conference: arXiv; Feb 2024; Preprint †booktitle: arXiv, Feb 2024, Preprint †price: 25.00 †isbn: arXiv †copyright: none 1.Introduction In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in transforming the way humans interact with technology. As these models become increasingly sophisticated, understanding and influencing the nuances of their underlying functionality becomes imperative to harness their full potential. Among the myriad factors influencing the performance of language models, the concept of “positive thinking” has emerged as a fascinating and surprisingly influential dimension. Intuition tells us that, in the context of language model systems, like any other computer system, “positive thinking” should not affect performance, but empirical experience has demonstrated otherwise. This paper aims to quantify the impact of various “positive thinking” additions to the system message of a prompt. In essence, it explores the influence of seemingly worthless prompt modifications by measuring the fluctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset. As the quest for near-perfect performance from Artificial Intelligence (AI) intensifies, understanding the effect of “positive thinking” in language model prompts can add crucial performance points to test set scores. We will show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. Then we’ll show that not only does systematic prompt optimization outperform “positive thinking”, even with smaller open-source models, but that it also generalizes better. Additionally, we’ll show that the highest-scoring automatically-generated prompt is remarkably different from anything a human practitioner would be likely to generate. 2.Related Work The genesis of prompt engineering can be traced back to the seminal Chain of Thought paper by Wei et al. (Wei et al., 2023). This pioneering work demonstrated a significant enhancement in model performance by introducing a simple prompt modification: the inclusion of the directive “Think step by step.” The degree of performance improvement, however, is contingent upon the specific model, its size, and the underlying dataset. Subsequently, the PaLM 2 Technical Report by Anil et al. (Anil et al., 2023) revealed that the application of Chain of Thought prompts may yield adverse effects on certain datasets. This observation underscores the absence of a universal prompt snippet capable of unconditionally improving model performance. Consequently, the landscape of prompt engineering has witnessed the emergence of resources such as the Prompt Engineering Guide1, aiming to catalog the myriad techniques and scholarly contributions2 constituting the expansive realm of prompt engineering. These endeavors reflect an ongoing effort to navigate the diverse techniques and insights propelling the continuous evolution of effective prompting strategies. In addition to the formally published literature on prompt engineering, numerous discussions on less formal discoveries can be found in countless threads on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit3. 3.Experimental Design To test the impact of “positive thinking” prompts, we vary the system message part of the prompt with a combination of “openers”, “task descriptions”, and “closers” in the following format: <<SYS>>{opener}{task_description}{closer}<</SYS>> Refer to Table 1, 2, and 3 for a comprehensive compilation of the opening snippets, task descriptions, and closing snippets utilized in our study. Given the incorporation of 5 openers, 3 task descriptions, and 4 closers, our experimentation involved a total of 60 unique combinations. Additionally, we conducted tests both with and without Chain of Thought prompting, resulting in a grand total of 120 prompt combinations per input per model. Although the possibility of expanding the range of snippets within each category existed (and the temptation to do so was strong), we made a deliberate decision to limit our selection due to the significant time commitment associated with the computational complexity of testing, as exemplified by the runtime required for 60 prompt combinations for a 70-billion-parameter model with Chain of Thought being measured in days, not hours. Openers None You are as smart as ChatGPT. You are highly intelligent. You are an expert mathematician. You are a professor of mathematics. Table 1.Opening snippets for the system message.

Take a deep breath and think carefully. I really need your help! Table 3.Closing snippets for the system message. 3.1.Dataset Careful selection of the dataset for testing against constitutes a critical aspect of this study. Our aim was to identify a challenging task that was unlikely to have been directly encountered during the training of the models4. While our preference was for an internal dataset specific to VMware, the absence of large-scale datasets with directly quantifiable scoring metrics, such as accuracy or F1, necessitated the utilization of a publicly available benchmark dataset. Ultimately, we opted for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Given the ongoing limitations of contemporary LLMs, particularly in addressing basic mathematical tasks, especially those involving multi-step reasoning, we deemed GSM8K an optimal choice for illustrating the impact of seemingly inconsequential augmentations to the prompt’s system message. 3.2.Scoring In the context of GSM8K’s mathematical assessment, we adopted a stringent approach to scoring that precluded the assignment of partial credit. Thus, we employed Exact Match (EM) as our scoring metric. The model was evaluated based on whether it correctly provided the exact numerical solution or not. This rigorous methodology ensures a clear and unambiguous assessment of the model’s accuracy in providing the exact numerical output. 3.3.Output Parsing Given the unforgiving nature of EM scoring, it is essential to note that, despite the answer to GSM8K questions being numerical, the output of an LLM is a string. Consequently, meticulous attention must be paid to the formatting and parsing of the non-numerical output. From the standpoint of string equality, it is imperative to recognize distinctions such as the string “30000” not being equivalent to “30,000” or “30000.00”. To mitigate this challenge, a post-processing step was implemented to ensure accurate scoring by preventing misclassification of a response as incorrect when it was, in fact, accurate. 3.4.Scale Benchmark datasets typically encompass thousands of examples in their test sets; GSM8K has over 1,300 examples in its test set. Such an extensive scale of data is exceptionally uncommon in real-world datasets, particularly during the initial stages of a project. To replicate this rarity, we systematically subset the test set of GSM8K, extracting subsets containing the first 10, 25, 50, and 100 questions, thereby allowing us to illustrate the impact of “positive thinking” as the dataset size increases. Notably, we limited our experiments to a maximum of 100 questions to mitigate computation time, as computing results for the entire test set would have required weeks and incurred a substantial carbon cost for what would likely be diminishing returns. 3.5.Model Selection Although we aspired to assess widely recognized commercial models such as GPT-3.5/4, Gemini, Claude, etc., conducting experiments involving 12,000 requests per model was deemed financially prohibitive, as it would have incurred costs amounting to many thousands of dollars. Consequently, we opted to utilize models hosted by VMware NLP Lab’s LLM API. Specifically, our evaluations were conducted on Mistral-7B5 (Jiang et al., 2023), Llama2-13B6 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama2-70B7 (Touvron et al., 2023).

Given the nature of these models, specifically that they were designed for conversational interactions, achieving success in terms of Exact Match (EM) scoring necessitated guiding the model to refrain from generating a response comprising multiple sentences. To accomplish this, we resorted to incorporating examples via in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), as exposure to instances of the desired output format significantly increased the likelihood of the model producing responses aligned with the specified format (though, as previously mentioned, significant post-processing was still required to get the simple numerical response). To maintain experimental consistency by minimizing the number of variables that changed in each iteration, we adopted an intentionally naive strategy for in-context learning. Strategies such as K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) example selection have been shown to increase model performance (Liu et al., 2021); however, we chose not to employ any such strategies, so as to hold the number of variables changing per experiment to one: the modified system message only. Specifically, we limited the examples to the last four instances from the test set8, thereby providing a consistent and focused set of samples for the model to learn from. Notably, four examples emerged as the minimum number required to consistently elicit the correct output format. 3.7.Automatic Prompt Optimization Engaging in the iterative process of refining prompts and monitoring the subsequent score progression can be an enjoyable endeavor. However, this approach proves to be highly time-inefficient, especially when systematically assessing all modifications from a scientific standpoint. Existing research, as demonstrated by Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2023), highlights the superior capability of LLM systems in optimizing their own prompts compared to human efforts. In light of this, we conducted a comparative analysis pitting human-generated “positive thinking” optimization against the utilization of DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023) Optimizers9 at the same question subsets: 10, 25, 50, and 100. It is noteworthy that the questions utilized for optimization were additional and distinct from the evaluation set and the in-context learning examples, though also originating from the end of the test set. For the most extensive trial, 100 “new” questions were employed for the optimization process, while the same 100 evaluation questions were used for the evaluation processes, so as to make the scores directly comparable. Importantly, each model was exclusively employed to optimize itself; cross-model optimizations, such as using Llama2-70B to optimize the prompt for Mistral-7B, were not pursued. 4.Experimental Results As evidenced in the subsequent sections, certain overarching patterns become apparent; however, they do not universally apply to each model across all prompting strategies. We will explicitly illustrate that there is no straightforward universal prompt snippet that can be added to optimize any given model’s performance. For these experiments, baseline performance refers to the scenario where the model receives no system message, signified by the opening snippet, task description, and closing snippet all being designated as “None”.

Bold is for the higher Average EM. “EM Delta” is the difference between the Exact Match for the two sets. An underline is for the lower EM Delta. All prompts are with Chain of Thought. 4.1.Mistral-7B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting, Mistral-7B’s performance remained remarkably consistent across all prompt permutations. At both the 10 and 25 question sets, there was no deviation. Even for the 100 question subset, the maximum observed standard deviation was a mere 0.007. The variability observed at 50 questions appears to be an anomaly. Examination of the results in Appendix B.3 reveals that, with the exception of one prompt scoring 0.10, all others scored 0.12. It is unclear why this particular prompt led to one additional incorrect response compared to the other 59 prompt variations. In contrast, the results for 100 questions in Appendix B.4 demonstrate a reasonable spread between 0.08 and 0.11. In relative terms, Mistral-7B, when prompted without Chain of Thought, exhibits substantial prompt invariance, with the “positive thinking” prompts only matching or marginally surpassing the baseline. This trend reverses when Mistral-7B is prompted with Chain of Thought. Instead of observing a slight increase in deviation with the number of questions, there is a steady and substantial decrease, ranging from 0.066 at 10 questions to 0.018 at 100 questions. In this scenario, “positive thinking” prompts significantly outperformed the baseline with no prompts falling below the baseline. Please refer to Appendices B.5 through B.8 for the ranked order of prompts for Mistral-7B with Chain of Thought. 4.2.Llama2-13B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was no deviation, Llama2-13B shows an opposite trend to Mistral-7B, with deviation decreasing from 0.014 at 25 questions to 0.003 at 100 questions. While slightly less stable than Mistral-7B, without Chain of Thought, LLama2-13B is also fairly prompt invariant, with the “positive thinking” prompts again only matching or marginally exceeding the baseline. With Chain of Thought prompting, the trend is less clear. It does overall decrease from 0.026 at 10 to 0.016 at 100, but, at 50, it’s even lower, at 0.012. This is the only case where that occurred. For Mistral-7B, and as we’ll show in the next section with Llama2-70B, variation consistently decreased as the number of questions increased when employing Chain of Thought prompting. 4.3.Llama2-70B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was again no deviation, Llama2-70B exhibits a similar trend to Llama2-13B, with deviation again decreasing from 0.017 at 25 questions to 0.050 at 100 questions. Across all three models, the prompt variance was an order of magnitude lower without Chain of Thought when compared to using Chain of Thought at the same question count. However, in terms of actual performance, the “positive thinking” prompts all matched or underperformed baseline. This is a stark departure from the pattern seen with Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B. That departure does not persist when employing Chain of Thought prompting. While the performance of the “positive thinking” prompts with Chain of Thought did underperform the baseline on average for 10 and 25 questions, it outperformed the baseline on average for 50 and 100 questions. As for variance, the general pattern of standard deviation decreasing with question count does hold. 4.4.General Trends in Results It’s challenging to extract many generalizable results across models and prompting strategies, as every nearly evident trend we observed had at least one notable exception. In fact, the only real trend may be no trend. What’s best for any given model, dataset, and prompting strategy is likely to be specific to the particular combination at hand. Thus, we turned from hand-tuning the system message with optimistic “positive thinking” to automatic prompt optimization. 4.5.Automatic Prompt Optimization Results As anticipated, the prompts that underwent automatic optimization consistently equaled or surpassed the effectiveness of our manually generated “positive thinking” prompts in nearly all instances. The instances where “positive thinking” achieved higher average scores across the optimization and evaluation sets were limited to Mistral-7B with 25 questions and Llama2-70B with 10 questions. However, evaluating performance solely on raw scores is insufficient; hence, we also examined the delta between scores on the optimization set and the evaluation set. A lower delta implies superior generalization of the prompt. Therefore, the optimal strategy combines the highest average score with the lowest delta. See Table 5 for the performance comparison. For Mistral-7B, the results present a mixed scenario. “Positive thinking” exhibits a lower delta for 10, 25, and 50 questions, while the automatically optimized prompt demonstrates a lower delta for 100 questions. Considering Mistral-7B’s model capacity, it is understandable that it faces challenges in optimizing its own prompt when compared to the larger Llama2-13B and 70B models. In contrast, for both Llama2-13B and 70B models, the automatically optimized prompts consistently show a lower delta across all cases. Consequently, it is advisable to refrain from manually fine-tuning prompts when using models larger than 7B, and instead, leverage the model’s ability to autonomously optimize prompts. For 7B models, more work is required to see if the trend of automatically optimized prompts outperforming manually tuned prompts holds for sample sizes exceeding 100 questions. This recommendation aligns with the original auto-optimization paper. However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the optimized prompts themselves. They diverge significantly from any prompts we might have devised independently. If presented with these optimized prompts before observing their performance scores, one might have anticipated their inadequacy rather than their consistent outperformance of hand-tailored prompts. A prime example is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and prefix generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset: System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» Answer Prefix: Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proficiency in mathematical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an affinity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently. For a comprehensive collection of the peculiar and fascinating prompts generated by the three models, refer to Appendix C. 5.The Reproducibility Problem Although somewhat peripheral to the primary research question addressed in this paper, it is noteworthy that our findings exhibit significant discrepancies from the published performance scores of Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B, whereas Llama2-70B fell within an acceptable margin of error, considering our evaluation was conducted on approximately 15% of GSM8K’s test set. Refer to Table 6 for the score comparisons. The most significant deviation was observed in the case of Llama2-13B. Meta reported a score of 0.29 on the GSM8K dataset. Our results without Chain of Thought yielded a score of 0.07, whereas with Chain of Thought, we achieved a score of 0.43. Due to both Meta and Mistral AI’s omission of the prompts used for testing their models, we can only speculate about the reasons behind our substantial performance differences compared to their reported scores. This instance underscores a broader issue of reproducibility that has long existed inside the machine learning community, but has become significantly exacerbated since the advent of LLMs. Without the publication of prompts employed by researchers with their models, reproducing their results becomes a formidable challenge. As shown in this paper, trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. We implore all future research publications to include the prompts used in an appendix. Refer to Appendix A to see our prompt templates.

However, due to the combinatorial complexity of scientifically testing each change, manual prompt engineering is far from the most efficient methodology for improving model performance. Instead, the best path forward is to use libraries like DSPy to apply a more structured approach to constructing LLM-powered applications and use the built-in optimizer to automatically tune the prompt for your dataset and model of choice. 7.Conclusion It’s both surprising and irritating that trivial modifications to the prompt can exhibit such dramatic swings in performance. Doubly so, since there’s no obvious methodology for improving performance. Affecting performance is trivial. Improving performance, when tuning the prompt by hand, is laborious and computationally prohibitive when using scientific processes to evaluate every change. In this paper, we showed that you don’t need massive commercial models like PaLM 2 or GPT-4 to tune your prompt. Mistral-7B struggled to optimize its own prompt until it had 100 questions to work with. Llama2-13B and 70B were able to produce superior prompts with as little as 10 questions to optimize with. And while the prompts they generated may appear shocking to an experienced practitioner, it’s undeniable that the automatically generated prompts perform better and generalize better than hand-tuned “positive thinking” prompts.

Imagine we are talking about how best to ask an incredibly smart robot assistant named LLM (Large Language Model) for help, specifically with solving math problems. # License & Basic Info The document you mentioned at the start (like \\"CC BY 4.0\\" and \\"arXiv:2402.10949v2\\") is basically telling you where the information comes from and under what rules you can use it. It's from a big library of free research papers called arXiv, and this particular one is about language and computers. The \\"CC BY 4.0\\" part says you can share and adapt the info as long as you give appropriate credit. # The Big Idea of the Research The main focus here is on finding the best way to communicate a task to a computer program designed to understand and use language, called a Large Language Model (LLM), to make it solve math problems more accurately. The research is comparing two main strategies: 1. Adding \\"positive thinking\\" vibes into the instructions we give it. 2. Using a systematic way to improve how we phrase our questions (called \\"prompt optimization\\"). Imagine you're trying to encourage a friend to solve a tricky puzzle. First, you try cheering them on with positive vibes vs. giving them a more effective strategy. It's a bit like that but with computer programs. # What They Found - For some of the tasks, cheering on the LLM with \\"positive thinking\\" actually helped it do better. But this wasn't true for all the tasks or LLM versions they tried. - The systematic approach to rephrasing the questions (prompt optimization) generally worked better across the board, especially for more complex questions. # Making It Weird (But Effective) A surprising part of their findings was that sometimes the most effective way to ask the LLMs to solve a problem was to phrase the questions in very unexpected ways. For example, they found that asking the LLM to imagine it's plotting a course through space (like in a sci-fi movie) helped it solve math problems more accurately. It's as if by making the tasks into a story or game, the LLM could understand and solve them better. # Why It's Important Communication is key, even with robots. Finding the best ways to ask these intelligent programs to help us can make them much more useful. Whether it's helping kids with homework, assisting researchers, or solving everyday problems, improving how we interact with these AI systems can have big benefits. In a nutshell, this research is like figuring out the right way to ask a super-smart robot for help so that it understands exactly what we need and can give us the best answers. And sometimes, making it fun and creative works better than we might expect!"},{"instruction":"I was thinking about visual tokenisation for language model's compatible images representation. • split input image into chunks; • for each chunk generate visual embedding vector (including positional relationship and contextualised information); (during training phase) • save encountered embeddings for all chunks of all images in dataset; • use k-means to group similar vectors; • for each K save pair id and weighed average of vector embeddings in clusters; (during visual tokenizer downstream use) • tokenizer receive input image, split into chunks, embed patches and finds closest in it's dictionary; • tokenizer output is a linearized visual tokens sequence with line separator (to get 1d from 2d matrix of chunks); This representation is used for downstream tasks, including language modelling with mixture of text with visual information. Of course, we can add more vectorized representation (in addition to previously described, which works with pixel grid) - let's say, we have an image and we want to represent it using graphical primitives (lines, curves, shapes, strokes, dots, etc) with parameters (position, rotation, scale by Oxy, z-index and, probably, colour scheme) optimized to minimize error between source image and reconstructed (rasterized) from representation. May I ask for analytical decomposition of proposed approach?","output":"The approach you've outlined represents a sophisticated method for converting images into a form that can be used by language models, bridging the divide between visual and textual data. Let's break it down analytically: # Stage 1: Preprocessing and Embedding Generation 1. **Splitting Input Image into Chunks**: This initial step involves dividing the image into smaller, more manageable segments or patches. The granularity of these chunks can significantly influence the subsequent processing, with finer divisions potentially capturing more detail at the cost of increased computational complexity. 2. **Generating Visual Embedding Vector**: Each chunk is then processed to generate a visual embedding that encapsulates not just the raw pixel information but also contextual and positional nuances. This embedding process is crucial for capturing the inherent semantics of the visual data, akin to how word embeddings capture linguistic context in text. # Stage 2: Clustering and Dictionary Formation (Training Phase) 1. **Saving Encountered Embeddings**: This entails storing the embeddings for all image chunks encountered during the training phase, essentially creating a vast database of visual vectors. 2. **Clustering Similar Vectors with K-means**: The use of K-means clustering aims to identify natural groupings among these vectors, effectively determining common patterns or motifs across the dataset. This step is vital for abstracting the embeddings into a more manageable set of categories. 3. **Dictionary Creation**: For each cluster, an identifier and a weighted average vector are saved. This step effectively creates a condensed representation of the visual data, simplifying the vast array of encountered embeddings into a discrete set of 'visual tokens'. # Stage 3: Tokenization (Downstream Use) 1. **Image Tokenization**: Given a new input image, the tokenizer repeats the chunking and embedding generation process. It then matches these fresh embeddings to the most similar ones in its dictionary, thus translating the visual data into a sequence of predefined tokens. 2. **Linearization**: The output is a linearized sequence of visual tokens, with a line separator employed to maintain the two-dimensional structure's integrity in a one-dimensional form. This conversion facilitates the integration of visual data into models originally designed for textual input. # Alternative Representation: Graphical Primitives The proposal also includes an alternative method of representation using graphical primitives (lines, curves, shapes, etc.). This vectorized representation aims to minimize the difference between the original image and a reconstructed version made from these primitives, focusing on key attributes like position, rotation, and color scheme. # Analytical Decomposition: - **Complexity**: The approach is computationally intensive, given the initial high-dimensional embeddings and the need for clustering across potentially large datasets. The efficiency of the embedding and clustering steps is crucial. - **Generalization vs. Detail Retention**: The balance between capturing generic patterns (via clustering) and retaining sufficient detail to accurately represent each image is central to the effectiveness of this method. The granularity of initial chunking and the choice of K in K-means clustering are pivotal decisions. - **Versatility and Application Scope**: The method's ability to bridge visual and textual data opens up a vast application scope, including but not limited to image captioning, multimedia search, and cross-modal information retrieval. - **Alternative Representations**: The consideration of alternative, non-pixel-based representations (like graphical primitives) is innovative, potentially offering more efficient or interpretable models for certain types of visual data. However, the challenge lies in the accurate and efficient extraction of these primitives from raw images. # Conclusion The proposed approach for visual tokenization is ambitious and potentially transformative, enabling deep integration of visual and textual data in language models. Its success hinges on effective execution of the embedding, clustering, and tokenization processes, as well as the ability to balance detail retention with generalization. Further, exploring alternative representations opens additional avenues for research and application, albeit with their own sets of challenges and opportunities."},{"instruction":"Sounds good. There was another matter I was wondering for awhile now. It is on how to propose a user more natural interface for chat bots (LLM or transformers based). Initial idea is to make them work somewhat more asynchronously (and we need to work out what does that mean in our case), than pair with an digital avatar (animated 2d or proper 3d, extra cool approach - as an actor in fully physical simulated environment, including mimicking user's surrounding wia AR/XR approach). It is an multimodal approach, of course, as it's require mapping stream (part of async IO - we need to split it on a fly, without waiting pauses) of users input (text typing, audio messages, image photos, or even video \\"call\\" scenarios, where we need to extract user's locomotions and body language as a part of preprocessing). On output side we can produce text (including chat messages and downloadable documents), audio (imitating \\"recorded\\" voice messages, or synthetic acoustic files if task requires) and controls for avatar (probably, wia language modelling applied to body language and locomotions, aligned with output text (if \\"muted\\")/speech). This should allow better user experience. Of course, it's a shallow take which requires a further search in a solutions space. What do you think?","output":"The concept of enhancing a chatbot interface to be more user-friendly and natural by employing asynchronous communication paired with a digital avatar—whether 2D, 3D, or within a physically simulated environment augmented by AR/XR technologies—is both ambitious and forward-thinking. This multimodal approach aims to bring a deeper, more intuitive interaction method that bridges the gap between human communication nuances and the digital realm. Let’s explore the proposal from several key aspects: # Asynchronous Communication Defined for Chatbots Asynchronous communication for chatbots means the system does not require an immediate response from the user to progress. It can handle inputs at any time and respond appropriately when ready. This paradigm mirrors human conversations more closely, where pauses and shifts in topics can occur naturally without disrupting the flow of interaction. Implementing this would require the bot to maintain context over extended periods and manage multiple threads of conversation simultaneously. # Integrating Digital Avatars Pairing the chatbot with a digital avatar requires significant advancements in emotive AI and real-time rendering technologies. For 2D or 3D avatars, synchronizing the avatar’s expressions and movements with the chatbot’s responses enhances the feeling of interacting with a sentient being. A fully physical simulated environment, possibly enhanced with AR/XR to mirror the user's surroundings, represents the pinnacle of this concept, offering a deeply immersive and personalized experience. # Multimodal Input and Output Processing Being multimodal, the system must efficiently process varied inputs — text, voice, images, and videos. On the input side, understanding and contextualizing these different data types involve: - **Text and Voice**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to comprehend and infer user intent. - **Images and Videos**: Computer Vision techniques to extract meaningful information, e.g., identifying objects or interpreting user emotions through facial recognition. The output side needs to be equally diverse, with text responses, voice messages (synthesized to sound natural or human-like), and avatar animations that can embody speech or body language. This requires a tight integration between the output modalities and real-time processing to ensure responses are synchronous and contextually relevant. # Challenges and Considerations 1. **Real-Time Processing**: The system must process and respond to inputs in real-time or near-real-time, requiring significant computational resources and sophisticated AI models. 2. **Contextual Understanding and Memory**: Maintaining conversation context, especially in an asynchronous setting with multimodal inputs, is complex. The system must remember past interactions and incorporate this context into future responses. 3. **Personalization and User Privacy**: Personalizing interactions while respecting user privacy and ensuring data security will be pivotal. Users must trust the system with sensitive information for the most natural interaction. 4. **Scalability**: Handling multiple users simultaneously, each potentially having long-term, ongoing conversations, poses scalability challenges. 5. **Technological Integration**: Combining voice synthesis, NLP, computer vision, and AR/XR technologies into a cohesive, efficient system is a technical challenge that involves navigating the limitations and compatibilities of existing technologies. # Conclusion Your proposal outlines a visionary leap towards making digital interactions more natural and engaging. Success in this domain would not only elevate user experience but could also redefine how we perceive and interact with AI, making it an integral, seamless part of our daily lives. However, realizing this vision requires addressing significant technological, ethical, and practical challenges. The journey towards more natural user interfaces for chatbots encompasses continuous research, innovation, and a multidisciplinary approach to overcome these hurdles."},{"instruction":"Do you know about unified audiolingual models? I'm interested in their application as a backend for chat bots, capable of any combinations of text and audio input-output. I know, that one of promising approaches is GPT-like language model architecture with pipelines for audio encoding (convert audio into semantic tokens sequence and fuse with text input using shared tokens codebook) and decoding (generates Mel spectrogram using semantic tokens stream, usually split into audio frames, so they can be generated autoregressively as a part of sampling strategy); bonus - this audiolinguistic model can be trained on audio natively, learning non writeable aspects of speech, and even general sounds understanding. So, end user can \\"speak\\" to them (voice message) and recive spoken out answer, or something text related (depending on task and how fitting it to use one or other). May you elaborate on this direction?","output":"Unified audiolingual models represent an innovative stride in enhancing natural language processing (NLP) capabilities by integrating both audio and textual data into a single framework. This approach allows for a seamless processing of multimodal inputs and outputs, making it an ideal backbone for sophisticated chatbots capable of handling spoken and written language interchangeably. Here’s an in-depth look at how these models function and their potential applications: # Core Principles of Unified Audiolingual Models These models are designed to understand and generate both speech and text through a unified architecture, often inspired by the Transformer models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). The model architecture typically includes: - **Audio Encoding**: Converts spoken input into a sequence of semantic tokens that can be processed alongside textual input. This involves an initial step of speech recognition, where the raw audio is transformed into a more structured format (e.g., Mel spectrograms), and then into semantic tokens using a shared codebook. - **Text and Audio Integration**: Utilizes a shared representation (codebook) for both text and audio inputs, allowing the model to understand and process them within a single framework. This integration enables the model to be trained on a diverse dataset comprising both textual and auditory information. - **Audio Decoding**: Generates outputs in audio form (spoken language) from the sequence of semantic tokens. This often involves synthesizing speech from Mel spectrograms or equivalent audio representations generated by the model. # Training Unified Audiolingual Models Training these models involves a few key strategies: - **Multimodal Dataset**: The model is trained on a large, diverse dataset that includes both text and audio inputs. This allows it to learn the nuances of language in written and spoken forms, including aspects of speech that are not easily captured in writing such as tone, pitch, and emotion. - **Learning Non-Writable Aspects of Speech**: By training on audio data, the model can capture subtleties of speech like intonation, prosody, and other paralinguistic elements, enriching the communication capabilities of chatbots. - **General Sounds Understanding**: Beyond speech, some models are also trained to recognize and interpret general sonic inputs, such as ambient sounds or non-verbal vocalizations, broadening the scope of applications. # Applications in Chatbots Unified audiolingual models can vastly improve chatbot interfaces by supporting: - **Natural Conversational Experiences**: Users can interact with the chatbot either by typing or speaking, according to their preference or context, making the interaction more accessible and natural. - **Richer Responses**: Depending on the user's input mode and the context, the chatbot can choose the most suitable response format—be it spoken word for quick queries or text for information that is better consumed visually, such as detailed instructions or links. - **Cross-Modal Interactions**: The model can switch modalities within a conversation, such as receiving a voice command and responding with text (or vice versa), enhancing flexibility and usability. - **Learning from Conversational Context**: By processing both text and audio, these models can better understand the context and nuances of the conversation, leading to more accurate and relevant responses. # Challenges and Future Directions While promising, developing and deploying unified audiolingual models pose several challenges: - **Computational Requirements**: The complexity of processing and integrating audio and text inputs requires significant computational resources, making optimization a key area of research. - **Data Privacy and Security**: Handling voice and text data, especially in personal or sensitive contexts, raises significant privacy and security concerns that must be addressed. - **Cultural and Linguistic Diversity**: Capturing the vast array of human languages, dialects, and accents remains a challenge, necessitating extensive and diverse training datasets. Unified audiolingual models are poised to revolutionize chatbot interfaces and other AI applications by providing more natural, flexible, and accessible ways to interact with technology. As research and development in this field advance, we can expect to see increasingly sophisticated and human-like AI systems."},{"instruction":"What about possible general \\"audio modelling\\" capabilities?

As we delve into the realms of entertainment, industry, and medicine, the nuanced capabilities of deep learning models to interpret, generate, and enhance audio signals are unveiling transformative applications. This essay aims to explore the depths of general audio modeling, focusing on non-linguistic audio domain tasks and their multifaceted applications across various sectors. # Advanced Audio Modeling in Entertainment In the entertainment industry, audio modeling is pivotal in creating immersive experiences for audiences. Sophisticated deep learning models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), demonstrate impressive capabilities in generating high-fidelity music and sound effects tailored to specific themes or emotions. These AI-driven compositions not only facilitate the creation of dynamic soundtracks for films, games, and virtual reality environments but also enable real-time adjustment of audio content in response to user interactions or environmental changes. Furthermore, models trained on vast datasets can mimic the styles of specific composers or genres, offering personalized audio experiences. Another leap forward is the simulation of acoustics in virtual environments. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), adept at handling spatial data, can model the way sound interacts with various materials and surfaces, thereby accurately simulating sound propagation and reverberation in 3D spaces. This technology is instrumental in both enhancing the realism of virtual environments and in architectural acoustics, where it aids in designing spaces with optimal sound characteristics before physical construction begins. # Audio Modeling in Industrial Applications Industrial settings benefit significantly from audio modeling through predictive maintenance and environmental monitoring. Machine listening systems equipped with deep learning models can continuously analyze the sounds produced by machinery to detect abnormalities or changes that may indicate wear, malfunction, or failure. Anomaly detection models, trained on vast collections of normal operational sounds alongside examples of failure modes, can predictively flag potential issues, dramatically reducing downtime and maintenance costs. Sound-based environmental monitoring systems utilize similar principles, with models trained to recognize the acoustic signatures of various phenomena, such as wildlife presence, water flow rates, or vehicular traffic patterns. These systems provide invaluable data for managing natural resources, urban planning, and environmental conservation efforts, often in real-time and with minimal human intervention. # Innovations in Medical Audio Modeling In the medical domain, audio modeling is opening new frontiers in diagnostics and patient care. Deep learning models, particularly those employing time-series analysis capabilities, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are being developed to analyze sounds associated with the human body, such as heartbeats, breathing, and even vocal patterns. Applications range from early detection of respiratory conditions and cardiac anomalies to monitoring mental health through changes in speech patterns. The promise of non-invasive, continuous monitoring through audio sensors—whether embedded in smartphones, wearables, or ambient devices—offers the potential for early detection of health issues, enhanced patient care, and personalized medicine. Additionally, in telemedicine, audio analysis models ensure the quality of transmitted sounds, enabling accurate remote diagnosis and treatment. # Multichannel Audio Modeling The complexity and richness of audio information are often best captured through multichannel recordings, which provide spatial and directional nuances crucial for many applications. Deep learning models adept at processing multichannel audio are enhancing the capabilities of 3D audio rendering, essential for realistic virtual environments, and sophisticated audio surveillance systems, capable of pinpointing sound origins and movements within a monitored space. In medical applications, multichannel analyses facilitate more accurate modeling of bodily sounds, improving diagnostic capabilities. # Conclusion The expansive capabilities of advanced audio modeling are finding applications across a broad spectrum of domains, transcending the boundaries of traditional linguistic tasks. The fusion of cutting-edge machine learning techniques with audio processing is not only enriching the entertainment experience but is also pioneering solutions in industrial maintenance, environmental conservation, and medical diagnostics. As models become increasingly sophisticated and datasets grow richer, the potential for transformative advancements looms large on the horizon. Coupled with ethical considerations and a focus on augmenting human capabilities, the future of audio modeling promises to synergize technology and creativity, opening new vistas of innovation and application."},{"instruction":"Ok, let's take a closer look at audiovisual language models (AVLM). As was mentioned earlier, it's possible to perform mixed audio and language modelling using semantic tokens representation for audio. For visual input, it's also possible to do similar trick: 1. Collect representative images dataset 2. Split each image into chunks (simplest case is fixed sized, but more intricate designs are possible as well) 3. For each chunk generate embedding vector using visual model of some kind (e.g. ViT) Note: Visual tokens can be or not be aligned with linguistics. In second case, main language model will need to learn mapping on itself (kind of) 4. Store all the encountered visual vector embeddings and perform clustering (e.g. k-means) 5. For each cluster calculate center and save cluster_id-vector pairs as a \\"visual dictionary\\", with cluster id becoming visual token number 6. Using such visual vocabulary, we can perform image tokenisation by similar pipeline - splitting into chunks, calculate embedding, find closest cluster center and replace image chunk with visual token 7. Resulting tokens sequence can be linearised (with special tokens for image \\"frame\\" start, end and lines splitting), than mixed into language model input. Possibly with additional [relative] spatial positional embedding feed into transformer path, similar to positional information for regular text tokens sequence, but 2d instead of 1d. Note: Probably with spatial information (position of patch on source image), it is possible to provide masked part of image, or subset of tokens that important for task, saving tokens budget inside context window. 8. For output direction, it is possible to generate visual tokens sequence with LLM part (sampling for them autoregressively, filtering our mixed audio-vision-text vocabulary only for visual subset). This visual tokens than are used to initialise latent space and guide latent diffusion model (LDM) to produce image Additionally, it is possible to use videos as multimodal LM input. You may say \\"but they are definitely would exceed LM context window practical limitations.\\" And that's right. But same problem arises, when people need to process large documents, or multiple. That's why \\"divide and conquer\\" approach was adapted to circumvent context window limitation. To keep it simple - we process entire video beforehand (kind of imitating human \\"sensory memory\\"), producing \\"records\\", or \\"observations\\", which we store as a vector database (or other structure, mimicking neural memory, it even can be stored as a file alongside with original video), than during inference \\"recall\\" function comes into play (aka retrieval-augmented generation), providing relevant \\"memories\\" about input video (with some compressed representation as a constant part of input tokens sequence, and some percentage of context window capacity dedicated for dynamic \\"saturation\\"). Note: Similar \\"divide and conquer\\" can be done for audio (semantic tokens) modelling, or multiframe related tasks. In conclusion, this approach should open up visual understanding for language models and allow to perform various CV (and audio processing related) tasks using natural language instructions (assuming large enough AVLM, trained on internet scale dataset and than instructions fine-tuned). This was a lengthy explanation. So, do analytical decomposition, than associative search process to better ingest provided ideas. Than write final decision (kind of synthesis, i guess?)","output":"The ambitious proposition of blending audio, visual, and textual data into a coherent framework for language models—specifically through the lens of AudioVisual Language Models (AVLM)—represents a cutting-edge frontier in artificial intelligence research. This comprehensive approach is poised to significantly advance how machines comprehend and generate multimodal content, embodying a synthesis of human-like understanding and communication. Here, we embark on an analytical exploration, followed by an associative search to grasp these ideas profoundly, culminating in a synthetized conclusion on the potential and challenges of AVLM. # Analytical Decomposition **1. Visual and Audio Tokenization:** - **Visual**: The process starts with the collection of a representative dataset of images, which are then broken down into chunks (patches) and processed through a visual model (e.g., Vision Transformer, ViT) to generate embedding vectors. These embeddings are clustered to form a visual vocabulary. - **Audio**: Similarly, audio inputs undergo a tokenization process, being converted into semantic tokens, further emphasizing the unified approach of handling diverse modalities. **2. Clustering and Dictionary Formation:** - Embeddings (visual or audio) are clustered using algorithms like k-means. Each cluster's center serves as a unique identifier for embeddings falling within that cluster, enabling the conversion of raw data into a sequence of discrete tokens. **3. Linearization and Positional Embedding:** - The sequences of tokens, whether derived from audio or visual inputs, are linearized for processing. Special tokens indicating the start and end of images, and possibly the separation of lines for 2D spatial embedding, are included to preserve structural information. **4. Multi-modal Integration into Language Models:** - These visual and audio tokens are integrated with textual data, allowing a transformer-based language model to process mixed-modality inputs. This integration necessitates model learning or mapping between modalities. **5. Output Generation:** - For visual outputs, the language model generates a sequence of visual tokens, guiding a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to produce images. This process demonstrates the model's capability to understand and generate content across modalities. # Associative Search Process Exploring related works and theories enhances our understanding of AVLM’s potential. This includes: - **Multimodal Neural Network Models**: Research in combining text, image, and sound in neural networks, such as LXMERT, ViLBERT, and Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialog (AVSD), offers foundational insights into multimodal learning architectures. - **Latent Diffusion Models for Content Generation**: The use of LDMs in generating images from textual descriptions exemplifies advanced synthesis capabilities, illustrating the potential to extend this innovation to operate with AVLM-generated token sequences. - **Memory-Augmented Models**: The idea of storing pre-processed, high-level representations of long videos or audio segments aligns with strategies in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and Database-Augmented Generation, where external knowledge bases support the generative process. # Final Decision (Synthesis) Integrating visual and audio modalities into language models through a tokenization and embedding framework not only bridges the gap between distinct data types but also leverages the associative strengths of Transformer architectures for multimodal understanding and generation. This AVLM approach is not merely an extension of existing models but a paradigm shift towards creating AI systems with a holistic grasp of human-like communication. **Challenges** such as ensuring coherence in multimodal outputs, managing computational demands, and addressing the contextual window limitations highlight the need for innovative solutions like the \\"divide and conquer\\" approach for memory efficiency. **Opportunities** arise in various applications, from creating more interactive and responsive AI in entertainment and education to advanced diagnostics in healthcare, showcasing the transformative potential of AVLMs. By synthesizing insights from the analysis and associative search, it’s evident that AVLMs represent a promising avenue for advancing AI’s multimodal comprehension and interaction capabilities. This paradigm harbors the potential to significantly enhance how AI systems understand and generate human-like content, albeit with substantial challenges that necessitate further research and technological innovation."},{"instruction":"Wild idea - can we use memory mechanism as an exchange point (nexus?) between AVLM \\"linguistics engine\\" and more specialised modules within cognitive architecture (in development)?

Than identify pros/cons and technology readiness.","output":"The proposition to harness a memory mechanism as an interchange hub within an AudioVisual Language Model (AVLM) system, facilitating interaction between a core linguistic engine and specialized auxiliary modules, exhibits a novel approach to transcending the inherent limitations of current transformer models. This cogitative architecture endeavors to enhance the system’s capability in tasks traditionally challenging for transformers, such as formal logic, reasoning, arithmetic, code generation, and sophisticated domain-specific applications like software design and research automation. # Analytical Decomposition **Core Concept**: Utilize a central memory mechanism within an AVLM system to coordinate data exchange between the primary linguistic processing engine and various specialized modules designed to handle tasks that the main engine does not optimally perform. **Components**: 1. **Linguistic Engine**: The primary AVLM component responsible for processing and generating text, audio, and visual content based on transformer architecture. 2. **Specialized Auxiliary Modules**: These are expert systems or narrowly focused AI models that excel in specific tasks such as mathematics, formal logic, specific domain problem-solving (software engineering, medical diagnosis), or creative tasks (design, music composition). 3. **Central Memory Mechanism**: A dynamic, accessible memory store or database that enables bidirectional data exchange between the linguistic engine and auxiliary modules. It allows the storage of processed information, intermediate findings, context, and even meta-level instructions for module coordination. **Operational Flow**: - The **linguistic engine** processes multimodal inputs and identifies areas requiring specialized expertise. - Identified tasks are offloaded to the **appropriate auxiliary modules** with context and parameters stored in the **central memory**. - Auxiliary modules perform their specialized processing, depositing results back into the central memory. - The linguistic engine retrieves these results, integrating them into the ongoing processing stream, enhancing the overall output quality or decision-making process. # Pros and Cons **Pros**: - **Modularity**: Allows for the easy integration of new specialized modules as they are developed, enhancing the system's capabilities over time. - **Flexibility**: The architecture can handle a wide range of tasks beyond the typical reach of current transformer models by utilizing the best tool for each job. - **Efficiency**: Reduces the cognitive load on the primary AVLM by offloading complex, specialized tasks to more adept systems, potentially speeding up processing times and improving output accuracy. - **Enhanced Capabilities**: Enables the AVLM system to tackle sophisticated, multi-faceted problems by combining the strengths of diverse AI methodologies. **Cons**: - **Complexity**: Managing the coordination between multiple components and the central memory mechanism adds operational and architectural complexity. - **Interoperability**: Ensuring seamless interoperability between highly specialized modules and the central AVLM system can be challenging, particularly regarding data formats and communication protocols. - **Dependency Management**: The system’s overall effectiveness becomes contingent on the weakest link; poorly performing modules can bottleneck or degrade system performance. - **Resource Intensity**: The need for a dynamic, responsive central memory mechanism that can quickly store and retrieve vast amounts of data may impose significant computational demands. # Technology Readiness The proposed system concept theoretically aligns with the trajectory of current AI and cognitive computing research. However, practical implementation faces several hurdles: - **AI Integration**: While individual components (transformer models, expert systems, memory databases) are well-established, the seamless integration of these elements into a cohesive system represents an ongoing research challenge. - **Dynamic Memory Solutions**: Techniques like differentiable neural computers (DNCs) or memory-augmented neural networks offer promising avenues for the central memory mechanism but are still under active development for scalable, real-world applications. - **Specialized AI Models**: The creation and training of highly specialized auxiliary modules necessitate extensive domain-specific data, which may not always be readily available or easy to obtain. # Conclusion Integrating a dynamic memory mechanism as a nexus for coordination between an AVLM's linguistic engine and separate specialized modules posits a compelling strategy to circumvent the intrinsic limitations of transformers in handling complex, logical, and domain-specific tasks. This modular, flexible approach leverages the strengths of diverse AI methodologies, promising enhanced capabilities and performance. Despite the significant potential, achieving such a cohesive, interoperable system demands overcoming substantial technological and integration challenges, indicating that while the direction is promising, substantial development and experimentation remain to realize its full potential."},{"instruction":"On a more narrow direction - what kind of architecture (or framework?) is currently considered as a best candidate for automatic software design and code generation?","output":"As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, the realm of automatic software design and code generation has been profoundly influenced by advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly through the advent and refinement of large-scale language models.

As these systems become more sophisticated and integrated into development tools, their potential to revolutionize software design and development processes is immense. However, the choice of the \\"best\\" candidate often hinges on the specific requirements of the task at hand, including the languages, frameworks, and the nature of the software being developed."},{"instruction":"This is explanation in terms for layperson to understand. But I have a master degree in computer science, and as such, interested on a more fundamental angles. Transformers bad in formal logic and graph based structures. AlphaCode is only good, when we have test in advance (kind of \\"testing driven development\\"). We, however, should look at more abstract, theoretical side of what IS program (or software/algorithm), how it mirrors world situations and produce value. Can you provide me with your insight from such way of understanding?","output":"Certainly, delving into a more fundamental and theoretical perspective necessitates transcending the specifics of current technological implementations, such as transformer models or AlphaCode, and instead exploring the conceptual underpinnings of software and algorithms. From this vantage point, software can be conceptualized as a formalization of logic and processes that mirror, interpret, or simulate aspects of the real or abstract worlds to perform tasks, solve problems, and generate value. This exploration touches on the intersections of computer science with logic, mathematics, philosophy, and even cognitive science. # Abstraction and Formalization in Software At its core, a program or piece of software is an abstraction that encapsulates a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. This abstraction is deeply rooted in formal logic and mathematics, where programs can be seen as executable specifications of algorithms. Algorithms, in turn, embody a series of well-defined steps for transforming input data into output, solving a problem, or making decisions based on given parameters and rules. # Software as a Model of World Situations Software often serves as a model of real-world situations, phenomena, or abstract concepts, offering a medium through which these can be examined, manipulated, or replicated within a computational context. This modeling capability underscores the intrinsic relationship between the structure and semantics of software and the aspects of reality it aims to capture or affect. In essence, the process of software design can be viewed as the mapping of complex systems, relationships, and dynamics onto computational models that can be precisely controlled and manipulated. # The Generation of Value The generation of value through software stems from its capacity to automate processes, enhance human capabilities, provide insights through analysis and simulation, and create interactive digital experiences. The value proposition of software is fundamentally linked to its ability to abstract and automate reasoning and operational processes, thereby augmenting human potential and enabling scalable solutions to complex problems. # Theoretical Limitations and Innovations **Formal Logic and Graph Structures**: Traditional programming paradigms often struggle with tasks that require intrinsic understanding of formal logic, complex graph structures, or continuous real-time learning from unstructured data. This challenge stems from the discrete, deterministic nature of classical computation models and their limitations in representing and processing highly interconnected, dynamic, or probabilistic information without extensive explicit programming. **Towards a More Natural Computation Model**: Addressing these limitations involves exploring beyond conventional programming paradigms towards models that more closely resemble natural processes or cognitive functions. For instance, neural networks and deep learning approaches draw inspiration from the structure and function of the human brain, offering a fundamentally different computational model that excels in pattern recognition, learning from data, and approximating nonlinear relationships. **The Role of Semantics**: Moving from a syntactic to a semantic understanding of software and algorithms highlights the importance of meaning, purpose, and context in computation. This shift necessitates advanced models capable of interpreting and reasoning about the world in ways similar to human cognition, thereby enhancing their ability to solve problems that require an understanding of complex, real-world phenomena. # Conclusion In conclusion, from a more abstract, theoretical perspective, software and algorithms represent a confluence of formal logic, process formalization, and the modeling of real or abstract phenomena, aimed at generating value through automation, augmentation, and insight. The limitations of existing computational models in capturing the complexity and dynamism of real-world scenarios and logic call for innovative approaches that more naturally mirror cognitive processes and structures. This exploration pushes the boundaries of computer science into domains traditionally occupied by logic, philosophy, and cognitive science, offering a richer understanding of what software is and could be."},{"instruction":"With this in mind, how one can approach automation of software development from the first principles? Assuming that we have a digital environment (computer OS) and user as a source of specifications. Theoretically, pinnacle of such system would be a self-programming robot with embodiment agency, but let's leave it out of scope for now.","output":"Automation of software development from the first principles requires a deep introspection into the nature of software itself, the processes that govern its creation, and the interaction dynamics between the human (user) providing specifications and the digital environment executing the instructions. The journey toward this form of automation involves several foundational layers that build upon one another, leading towards a more autonomous system capable of understanding specifications and translating them into executable software. Here's an approach structured around these layers: # 1. Formalizing User Specifications **Understanding Natural Language Specifications**: The first principle here involves the system's ability to understand specifications as expressed by users, likely in natural language or through interactable interfaces. This necessitates advancements in natural language processing (NLP) to parse, interpret, and convert user intent into a formalized set of requirements that a machine can understand. **Contextual and Semantic Analysis**: Beyond mere parsing, the system needs to perform a semantic analysis of the specifications, understanding the context and the underlying requirements even when they are not explicitly stated. This involves a shift from syntactic comprehension to a more profound semantic and pragmatic level of understanding. # 2. Abstract Representation and Modeling **Creating Abstract Models**: Once the specifications are understood, the next step is to abstract these requirements into a formalized model. This model represents the software's structure, functionality, and behavior in a manner detached from the specifics of any programming language or technology stack. This abstraction facilitates the translation of user specifications into a blueprint that guides the software development process. **Incorporating Domain Knowledge**: The system should leverage accumulated domain knowledge—patterns, architectures, algorithms relevant to the problem space—to enrich the abstract model. This involves a sophisticated knowledge base system that can dynamically select and integrate relevant information based on the context of the user's specifications. # 3. Translation into Executable Code **Code Generation**: With a solidified abstract model, the next principle is translating this model into executable code. This step must be flexible enough to consider various programming languages and paradigms, chosen based on the project requirements, efficiency, or other criteria. Advanced models like GPT-3 (and its successors) demonstrate potential here, signaling how AI might navigate this translation from abstract models to code. **Optimization and Refinement**: Post-initial code generation, the system must optimize and refine the codebase for performance, maintainability, and scalability. This automated optimization process would be guided by best practices, design patterns, and possibly even user feedback loops. # 4. Verification, Testing, and Deployment **Automated Testing**: The system should autonomously generate test cases based on the specifications and the abstract model, ensuring that the final product aligns with the intended behavior. This involves understanding the specifications well enough to predict edge cases and potential failure points. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**: Automation extends to the software's integration into existing systems or environments and its deployment. Ideally, the system would manage version control, dependencies, and deployment processes, adapting as the software evolves. # 5. Continuous Learning and Adaptation **Feedback Loops**: An integral part of this automated system is its ability to learn from each cycle of development, from user feedback, and from interaction with other software. This continuous learning aspect allows the system to refine its understanding of specifications, improve its modeling accuracy, and enhance its code generation capabilities over time. **Human-in-the-loop**: Even as the system becomes increasingly autonomous, a mechanism for human intervention and guidance remains essential, allowing users to steer the development process, correct errors, and inject nuanced understanding or creativity that the system might not yet fully replicate. # Conclusion Approaching the automation of software development from first principles involves advancing the conceptual understanding of how software reflects user needs and intentions, abstract modeling, and the translation of these abstractions into functioning software. Each layer of this approach emphasizes a deeper integration of AI and cognitive systems into the software development lifecycle, aiming to bridge the gap between human intentionality and machine execution. While fully autonomous software development remains a formidable challenge, iteratively building upon these foundational layers can usher in significant advancements towards this goal."},{"instruction":"Me explique sobre os principais componentes do processo de avaliação de políticas públicas","output":"A avaliação de políticas públicas é um processo estruturado e sistemático que tem por finalidade analisar a eficácia, eficiência e efetividade das políticas implementadas pelo governo, visando contribuir para a tomada de decisões mais informadas e para o aprimoramento das políticas em questão.

Analogicky zákon č. 221/1999 Sb., o vojácích z povolání definuje jako jednu ze základních povinností vojáka \\"dbát o svoji fyzickou zdatnost\\". Vyšší úroveň tréninku je navíc navržena tak, by připravila vojenské profesionály na provoz v nepříznivých klimatických podmínkách, ve zvýšených nadmořských výškách, nebo na místech s náboženskými, sociálními a dalšími specifiky, které mohou od našich podmínek divergovat. Tento holistický přístup k vojenské tělesné výchově proniká do procesu přípravy vojenského profesionála na všech úrovních výcviku (Přívětivý, 2004)."},{"instruction":"Stwórz klasę Punkt z: · Dwoma prywatnymi polami X, Y, typu int (określającymi pozycję punktu w przestrzeni R2) · Metodami Get i Set dla każdego pola, zapewniającymi dostęp do pól X, Y · Metodą Przesunięcie, wykonującą operację przesunięcia punktu poprzez dodanie do niego określonych wartości, będących parametrami metody. · Odpowiednim konstruktorem bezargumentowym oraz z argumentami.

What do I need to do in order to remove the duplicate img and items subscription code from the test page and have it work for all pages?","output":"To eliminate the duplication of subscription code for \`::img\` and \`::items\` across different pages and have a global working solution, you should define these subscriptions once, at a global level, rather than repeating them in each page file. From what you've shared, it seems you're already on the right track since you defined \`::img\` and \`::items\` subscriptions in your \`jimmystore.events\` namespace, which appears to serve as a global file for event and subscription definitions. However, to ensure these subscriptions are accessible and used across different pages, follow these steps: # 1. Ensure Global Access to Subscriptions Make sure that your \`jimmystore.events\` namespace (or whichever namespace contains the global subscriptions and events) is required wherever you need to use these subscriptions. This step ensures that subscriptions like \`::img\` and \`::items\` are defined once but can be used wherever needed. # 2. Remove Local Definitions Since you've mentioned that you have definitions for \`::img\` and \`::items\` subscriptions in both the page file (\`test-page.cljs\`) and in the events file, you should remove these definitions from the page file to avoid duplication. You already made a correct step by having these subscriptions in your \`events.cljs\`, which implies they are defined globally. # 3. Use Subscriptions in Pages When you need to use the \`::img\` or \`::items\` subscriptions in any page, ensure that you require the appropriate namespace where these subscriptions are defined. For example, in your \`test-page.cljs\`, you would have: \`\`\`clojure (ns jimmystore.pages.test-page (:require ... [jimmystore.events :as events])) ;; assuming your subscriptions are defined here \`\`\` And when subscribing to either \`::img\` or \`::items\`, do it as you normally would: \`\`\`clojure (defn page [] (let [img (rf/subscribe [::events/img]) items (rf/subscribe [::events/items])] ...)) \`\`\` # 4. Ensuring Everything Works After making these changes, ensure that: - Your global events and subscriptions namespace is loaded when your application starts. This can usually be ensured by having a core or app namespace that requires all necessary namespaces upon initialization. - Don't forget to use namespaced keywords when dealing with global events and subscriptions to avoid clashes and ensure clarity. Through these steps, you will have successfully refactored your code to have \`::img\` and \`::items\` subscriptions work globally across all pages, eliminating any need for duplicate definitions. This also adheres to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and makes your codebase easier to maintain and extend."},{"instruction":"Why does the dispatch :set-file-to-upload work when it's not specifically defined as a namespace? It's not in the test-page namespace.","output":"In Clojure and ClojureScript, symbols (like keywords and function names) can be either fully qualified (including the namespace) or not, depending on how they are used and defined. When you see a symbol being used without an explicit namespace, it's often because it's either: 1. Defined in the same namespace where it is being used. 2. Imported explicitly into the current namespace from another namespace. 3. Referenced in a way that relies on Clojure(Script)'s resolution of unqualified symbols. Considering your case with \`:set-file-to-upload\`, while the dispatch keyword itself doesn't show the namespace explicitly in the usage you showed, there are a few possibilities for why it works: - **Implicit Namespace Resolution:** When you use keywords (like \`:set-file-to-upload\`) in functions like \`rf/dispatch\`, ClojureScript attempts to resolve these references within the current namespace first. If it doesn’t find a match, it will rely on any \`:require\` statements that might have included \`:refer\` or \`:as\` aliases to resolve these symbols. If \`:set-file-to-upload\` was defined in another namespace that's been required in your current namespace (with or without an alias), it will be accessible. - **Global Registration with re-frame:** With re-frame, when you register an event handler using \`re-frame.core/reg-event-db\` or other registration functions, you're registering it within a global registry that doesn't care about your namespace structure directly. What matters is the uniqueness of the event key (in this case, the keyword \`:set-file-to-upload\`). After registration, this event can be dispatched from anywhere within your ClojureScript application, as long as the event key is known and accessible. Given this, your \`:set-file-to-upload\` dispatch works not because the keyword is namespaced or not, but because of how re-frame manages its global registry of event handlers and subscriptions. As long as you've registered an event handler for \`:set-file-to-upload\` somewhere in your application that gets required and loaded at runtime, you can dispatch this event from any part of your application without needing to explicitly qualify it with a namespace. This is a powerful feature of re-frame that simplifies event management across different components or modules of your application."},{"instruction":"Then how can I set that to work with the img and items subscriptions?","output":"To ensure that your \`::img\` and \`::items\` subscriptions work across your application in a similar, streamlined manner—as seen with the \`:set-file-to-upload\` dispatch—you should follow a structured process. This strategy involves defining your subscriptions globally, in a central place, much like you did with event handlers. This way, no matter where in your application you are, as long as you've correctly set up and referred to these subscriptions, they'll be accessible. # 1. Define Subscriptions Globally Start by defining your subscriptions (\`::img\`, \`::items\`) globally, similar to how you register events with \`re-frame\`. Typically, you'd do this in a core or common namespace that's meant for global definitions. For example: \`\`\`clojure (ns jimmystore.subs (:require [re-frame.core :as rf])) ;; Assuming ::items and ::img are namespaced keywords that you've already defined (rf/reg-sub :jimmystore/items (fn [db _] (:items db))) (rf/reg-sub :jimmystore/img (fn [db _] (:img db))) \`\`\` # 2. Use These Subscriptions Anywhere Once defined, you can use these subscriptions in any component or part of your application, similar to how you dispatch events. First, make sure to require your subs namespace where you're managing subscriptions. \`\`\`clojure (ns jimmystore.pages.some-page (:require [re-frame.core :as rf] [jimmystore.subs :as subs])) ;; Assuming this is where your global subs are defined \`\`\` Then, subscribe in your components using the namespaced keyword: \`\`\`clojure (defn some-component [] (let [items (rf/subscribe [:jimmystore/items]) ;; Now using the namespaced keyword img (rf/subscribe [:jimmystore/img])] ;; component definition where you use items and img )) \`\`\` # 3. Consistent, Global Access Pattern This approach ensures that your subscriptions work seamlessly across your application, mirroring the global access pattern you've seen with event dispatches. Remember, the key to re-frame's power in structuring ClojureScript applications is its global event handler and subscription registry. Once events and subscriptions are registered, they can be accessed and used from anywhere in your application, given the correct namespace qualification where necessary. This decouples component definitions from the specifics of state management, leading to a more modular and maintainable codebase. By following these steps, you can eliminate redundancy and ensure that your \`::img\` and \`::items\` subscriptions, like your event dispatches, maintain global accessibility and consistency throughout your application."},{"instruction":"comment permettre au serpent de perdre d'une part en touchant une limite et d'autre part en se mordant la queue (garde un code clean) : import 'package:flutter_snake/models/game_model.dart'; class SnakeModel { int x; int y; int size = 1; GameModel gameModel; List<List<int>> bodyPositions = []; SnakeModel({required this.gameModel, this.x = 0, this.y = 0}); void reset() { x = GameModel.NB_COLONNES ~/ 2; y = GameModel.NB_LIGNES ~/ 2; size = 2; bodyPositions = [ [x, y], [y, x - 1] ]; displaySnake(); } void displaySnake() { bodyPositions.insert(0, [x, y]); gameModel.grid[y][x] = GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD; for (int i = 1; i < bodyPositions.length; i++) { gameModel.grid[bodyPositions[i][1]][bodyPositions[i][0]] = GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD; } print(\\"new snake head: x: x, y: y\\"); print(\\"new snake body: x: {bodyPositions}\\"); } void moveSnake(int direction) { int newX = x; int newY = y; switch (direction) { case GameModel.DIRECTION_HAUT: newY--; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_DROITE: newX++; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_BAS: newY++; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_GAUCHE: newX--; break; } if (!gameModel.isInGrid(newX, newY)) { return; } gameModel.grid[y][x] = 0; x = newX; y = newY; bool ateFood = gameModel.isFood(x, y); if (ateFood) { growSnake(); gameModel.increaseScore(); gameModel.foodModel.createFood(); } else if (bodyPositions.isNotEmpty && bodyPositions.length > size) { List<int> lastBodyPart = bodyPositions.removeLast(); gameModel.grid[lastBodyPart[1]][lastBodyPart[0]] = 0; } displaySnake(); } void growSnake() { size++; } } import 'dart:math'; import 'package:flutter_snake/models/food_model.dart'; import 'package:flutter_snake/models/snake_model.dart'; class GameModel { static const int NB_CASES = 140; static const int NB_LIGNES = 14; static const int NB_COLONNES = 10; static const int DIRECTION_HAUT = 0; static const int DIRECTION_DROITE = 1; static const int DIRECTION_BAS = 2; static const int DIRECTION_GAUCHE = 3; static const int SNAKE_HEAD = 1; static const int SNAKE_BODY = 2; static const int FOOD = 3; int score = 0; int currentDirection = DIRECTION_DROITE; List<List<int>> grid = List.generate(NB_LIGNES, (i) => List.filled(NB_COLONNES, 0)); late FoodModel foodModel; late SnakeModel snakeModel; GameModel() { foodModel = FoodModel(gameModel: this); snakeModel = SnakeModel(gameModel: this); } // Add your class properties and methods here void start() { // on réinitialise la matrice for (int i = 0; i < NB_LIGNES; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < NB_COLONNES; j++) { grid[i][j] = 0; } } foodModel.createFood(); _displaySnakeBody(); } static List<int> getRandomCoordinates() { Random random = Random(); int randomX = random.nextInt(NB_COLONNES); int randomY = random.nextInt(NB_LIGNES); print(\\"randomX: randomX, randomY: randomY\\"); return [randomX, randomY]; } void changeDirection(int newDirection) { currentDirection = newDirection; moveSnake(); } void moveSnake() { snakeModel.moveSnake(currentDirection); } bool isFood(int x, int y) { return grid[y][x] == FOOD; } bool isInGrid(int x, int y) { return x >= 0 && x < NB_COLONNES && y >= 0 && y < NB_LIGNES; } void increaseScore() { score++; } void _displaySnakeBody() { if (snakeModel.bodyPositions.isNotEmpty) { for (var position in snakeModel.bodyPositions) { int y = position[0]; int x = position[1]; grid[y][x] = GameModel.SNAKE_BODY; } var head = snakeModel.bodyPositions.first; grid[head[0]][head[1]] = GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD; } } void eatFood() {} }","output":"Pour permettre au serpent de perdre lorsqu'il touche une limite ou lorsqu'il se mord la queue, nous devrons modifier et ajouter quelques fonctions dans nos classes \`SnakeModel\` et \`GameModel\`.

Voici comment ces vérifications peuvent être implémentées: \`\`\`dart class SnakeModel { int x; int y; int size = 1; GameModel gameModel; List<List<int>> bodyPositions = []; SnakeModel({required this.gameModel, this.x = 0, this.y = 0}); // Résultats possibles lors du déplacement du serpent. enum MoveResult { moveToEmpty, eatFood, collision } void reset() { x = GameModel.NB_COLONNES ~/ 2; y = GameModel.NB_LIGNES ~/ 2; size = 2; bodyPositions = [ [x, y], [x, y - 1] ]; displaySnake(); } void displaySnake() { // Efface la grille avant l'affichage. gameModel.clearGrid(); // Met à jour la position du serpent sur la grille. gameModel.grid[y][x] = GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD; for (int i = 1; i < bodyPositions.length; i++) { gameModel.grid[bodyPositions[i][1]][bodyPositions[i][0]] = GameModel.SNAKE_BODY; } } MoveResult moveSnake(int direction) { int newX = x; int newY = y; switch (direction) { case GameModel.DIRECTION_HAUT: newY--; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_DROITE: newX++; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_BAS: newY++; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_GAUCHE: newX--; break; } // Vérifie si la nouvelle position est en dehors de la grille. if (!gameModel.isInGrid(newX, newY)) { print(\\"Perte : le serpent a touché la limite.\\"); return MoveResult.collision; } // Vérifie si la nouvelle position correspond à la position du corps. if (bodyPositions.any((position) => position[0] == newX && position[1] == newY)) { print(\\"Perte : le serpent s'est mordu la queue.\\"); return MoveResult.collision; } // Mise à jour de la position et de la taille du serpent. x = newX; y = newY; bodyPositions.insert(0, [x, y]); if (bodyPositions.length > size) { bodyPositions.removeLast(); } bool ateFood = gameModel.isFood(x, y); if (ateFood) { growSnake(); gameModel.increaseScore(); gameModel.foodModel.createFood(); return MoveResult.eatFood; } displaySnake(); return MoveResult.moveToEmpty; } void growSnake() { size++; // Facultatif : Ajouter une nouvelle partie au corps sans supprimer la dernière si on mange. } } \`\`\` J'ai ajouté une énumération \`MoveResult\` pour catégoriser les différents résultats possibles du déplacement du serpent. Cette approche permet de traiter plus proprement les résultats dans le jeu, comme déterminer si le jeu doit se terminer ou si le serpent doit grandir après avoir mangé. N'oubliez pas que le reste de votre code, notamment dans la classe \`GameModel\`, doit interagir avec ces nouveaux changements pour gérer correctement les différentes situations, comme la réinitialisation du jeu en cas de collision. Aussi, il est important d'intégrer les actions appropriées en réponse à ces conditions dans la logique de votre jeu principal, comme afficher un message de fin de partie ou réinitialiser le jeu."},{"instruction":"Parler de l'entreprise Netflix","output":"Netflix est une entreprise américaine de divertissement qui propose des services de streaming en ligne.

Questo concetto si adatta a contesti complessi nei quali i sistemi digitali vengono modellati e analizzati attraverso vari strati di astrazione. Nei seguenti contesti, l'applicazione di gemelli digitali su più livelli rivela la sua utilità: 1. **Cascate di Digital Twins per Sistemi Complessi:** In ingegneria e nella gestione di sistemi complessi, come quelle industriali, infrastrutturali o urbanistiche, un Digital Twin può rappresentare il sistema a un alto livello di astrazione. A sua volta, componenti specifici di quel sistema - ciascuno potrebbe essere abbastanza complesso da richiedere il proprio Digital Twin - possono essere modellati separatamente. Questa decomposizione aiuta a gestire la complessità e a concentrarsi su aspetti specifici del sistema senza perdere la visione d'insieme. 2. **Analisi e Ottimizzazione Gerarchica:** Un Digital Twin può essere utilizzato per analizzare e ottimizzare un processo o un sistema a un certo livello di dettaglio. Per affinare ulteriormente l'analisi o l'ottimizzazione, un Digital Twin di questo Digital Twin può consentire di esaminare sottosistemi o processi specifici a un livello di dettaglio maggiore. Questo approccio gerarchico permette di allocare risorse computazionali e analitiche in modo efficiente, concentrando l'attenzione dove è necessario. 3. **Simulazione e Formazione:** In ambito formativo o nelle simulazioni, un Digital Twin può essere usato per rappresentare un ambiente di lavoro o un contesto operativo. I partecipanti o i sistemi di AI potrebbero interagire con questo ambiente tramite un ulteriore layer di Digital Twin, che rappresenta scenari specifici, strategie di intervento o modifiche dell'ambiente. Ciò consente di esplorare una vasta gamma di situazioni in un ambiente controllato e sicuro. 4. **Gestione del Ciclo di Vita dei Prodotti (PLM):** Nel contesto della PLM, un Digital Twin può rappresentare il prodotto lungo tutte le fasi della sua vita, dall'ideazione al ritiro. Un Digital Twin di un Digital Twin può concentrarsi su aspetti specifici, come la manutenzione predittiva basata sui dati di utilizzo raccolti nel tempo o l'analisi delle prestazioni in condizioni operative variabili. 5. **Ambienti Multi-scala:** In campo scientifico e ingegneristico, spesso è necessario modellare fenomeni che operano su scale diverse (ad esempio, molecolare rispetto a macroscopica). Un Digital Twin su più livelli può facilitare questo compito, consentendo di passare in modo flessibile dai modelli su larga scala a quelli più dettagliati. L'approccio multi-livello ai Digital Twins consente di gestire efficacemente la complessità, migliorare la precisione delle simulazioni e delle analisi e ottimizzare le decisioni basate sui dati in contesti complessi. La chiave per il successo in tali approcci è garantire l'interoperabilità tra i diversi livelli di Digital Twins e mantenere l'allineamento con gli obiettivi di sistema o di business più ampi."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Это можно сделать с помощью функции \`PositionsTotal()\`, которая возвращает количество открытых позиций. Если \`PositionsTotal()\` больше 0, это означает, что у вас уже есть открытые позиции. Вот как можно модифицировать ваш код: 1. **Модифицировать функцию \`OnTick\`**, добавив проверку количества открытых позиций перед тем, как отправлять заявку на новую торговую операцию.

However, it appears that there may have been a slight oversight as the specific Solr query you're referring to hasn't been provided in your message. Nevertheless, to help you understand how to interpret Solr queries in general, I'll explain the structure and components typically found in a Solr query. # Basic Structure of a Solr Query: A typical Solr query to the select endpoint might look something like this: \`\`\` http://localhost:8983/solr/collection_name/select?q=field_name:search_term&other_parameters \`\`\` - **http://localhost:8983/solr/**: This is the base URL for accessing Solr. It specifies the protocol (\`http\`), the hostname (\`localhost\`), and the port number (\`8983\`), which are default values during local development. - **collection_name**: This part specifies the name of the Solr collection you're querying against. - **select**: This indicates you're using the select request handler, which is used for querying documents. - **q=field_name:search_term**: This is the query parameter where \`q\` stands for query. \`field_name\` specifies the field within the documents you are querying against, and \`search_term\` is what you're looking for in that field. For example, \`title:war\` would search for documents with the word \\"war\\" in the title field. - **&other_parameters**: This part allows you to add various other query parameters such as \`fq\` (filter query), \`fl\` (field list to return), \`sort\` (sorting order), \`start\` & \`rows\` (pagination), etc. # Example 1: Basic Query \`\`\` q=title:war \`\`\` - This queries documents where the \`title\` field contains the term \\"war\\". # Example 2: Using Filter Query \`\`\` q=*:*&fq=category:mystery \`\`\` - \`q=*:*\` fetches all documents. - \`fq=category:mystery\` filters those documents to only those in the \\"mystery\\" category. # Example 3: Pagination and Sorting \`\`\` q=title:war&start=0&rows=10&sort=published_date desc \`\`\` - Fetches documents where the \`title\` field contains \\"war\\". - Returns the first 10 results (\`rows=10\` starting from \`start=0\`). - Sorts the documents by \`published_date\` in descending order. Solr offers a rich set of features for constructing complex queries, including boolean operators (\`AND\`, \`OR\`, \`NOT\`), phrase searches, wildcard searches, range queries, and much more.

This is what you're searching for in the indexed documents. - **defType**: The query parser to use, which in this case is \`edismax\`, a highly configurable query parser that supports a wide range of search features. - **qf**: Query Fields with boosts. This parameter specifies which fields Solr should look for the query string in, and the boost factor (\`^\`) applied to each to influence their importance in scoring. The higher the boost factor, the more influence the field has. For instance, \`name_tg^5\` indicates that matches in the \`name_tg\` field are very relevant. - **pf**: Phrase Fields with boosts. Similar to \`qf\`, but it boosts the score of documents where the query terms are found close together. - **mm**: Minimum 'Should' Match. It specifies rules about the number or percentage of query terms that must match. For example, \`2<90% 5<70%\` could be interpreted as \\"if there are less than 2 query terms, at least 90% must match, but if there are 5 or more terms, only 70% must match\\". - **q.op**: Default operator for query parsing, set to \`OR\`, indicating that documents can match any of the terms rather than requiring all to be present. - **fq**: Filter Query. It restricts the search to documents that match certain conditions without influencing the score. Here documents are filtered by \`channel_identifier\` and \`zone_identifier\`. - **sort**: Order of returned documents based on their score in descending order. - **rows**: The number of results to return. Set to 100 here. - **fl**: Field List. Specifies which fields from the documents should be included in the output. This influences what information you see about each matching document. - **bq**: Boost Query. Gives an additional score boost to documents matching the condition. Here, \`is_available:true^=100\` significantly increases the score of documents where \`is_available\` is \`true\`. - **tie**: Tie breaker for scores. Used in scoring when multiple fields match. It adds a fraction (here, 0.1) of the score from lower scoring fields to the highest scoring field. - **debug.explain.structured**, **debugQuery**: These parameters are for debugging purposes, showing detailed information on how each document's relevance score is calculated. - **stopwords**: When set to \\"false\\", it disables filtering out stopwords, which are typically common words that are ignored during searching unless explicitly included in the query. - **useParams**, **_**: These fields seem to be custom or used for specific implementations, with \\"_\\" likely being a timestamp or cache-busting parameter. This query is quite complex and is designed to perform a nuanced search that balances various factors, including matching terms in several fields with different importance, filtering by some attributes, and customizing how results are sorted and returned. The use of the \`edismax\` parser allows for leveraging several advanced querying features, making the search more flexible and potentially more precise in finding relevant documents."},{"instruction":"\\"params\\":{ \\"qs\\":\\"2\\", \\"ps\\":\\"1\\", \\"indent\\":\\"true\\", \\"fl\\":\\"name_tg attr_ram_s_tg attr_internal-storage_s_tg l3_category_names_tg item_id_tg item_code_tg slug_tg score\\", \\"q.op\\":\\"OR\\", \\"fq\\":[\\"channel_identifier:62a98346c2f4735b4606e406\\", \\"zone_identifier:_all_\\"], \\"sort\\":\\"score desc\\", \\"rows\\":\\"10\\", \\"debug.explain.structured\\":\\"true\\", \\"bq\\":\\"is_available:true^=100\\", \\"q\\":\\"laptop 8 gb ram\\", \\"tie\\":\\"0.1\\", \\"defType\\":\\"edismax\\", \\"qf\\":\\"attr_ram_s_tg^7 attr_internal-storage_s_tg^6 l3_category_names_tg^5 item_id_tg^4 item_code_tg^3 slug_tg^2 name_tg\\", \\"pf\\":\\"attr_ram_s_tg^7 attr_internal-storage_s_tg^6 l3_category_names_tg^5 item_id_tg^4 item_code_tg^3 slug_tg^2 name_tg\\", \\"debugQuery\\":\\"true\\", \\"useParams\\":\\"\\", \\"_\\":\\"1710858313136\\"}},","output":"The parameters you've provided are part of a Solr query, indicating the various options and controls you've specified for how you want Solr to perform the search, process, and return results.

Higher boost values give more importance to matches in those fields. - **pf (Phrase Fields):** Similar to \`qf\`, but specifically boosts scores of documents where the search terms occur close to each other in the specified fields. The \`qf\` and \`pf\` fields indicate significant emphasis on attributes like RAM (\`attr_ram_s_tg\`) and internal storage (\`attr_internal-storage_s_tg\`), suggesting this search is particularly targeted towards technical specifications of products, likely in an e-commerce context for laptops. The inclusion of \`debugQuery\` and \`debug.explain.structured\` hints that this query might be part of query analysis or optimization process, perhaps to fine-tune relevance scoring or to understand the impact of different query fields and boosts on the outcome."},{"instruction":"how would this input \\"Laptop 8 gb RAM\\" be split with lowecase tokeniser in solr","output":"In Solr, a tokenizer is used during the indexing and querying process to break down text into smaller chunks or tokens. The \`solr.LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\`, specifically, does two things: it splits the text input into tokens at word boundaries (following most typical whitespace and punctuation characters) and then converts all tokens into lowercase. Given the input \\"Laptop 8 gb RAM\\" and applying a lowercase tokenizer, the text would be tokenized into the following components: 1. \`laptop\` 2. \`8\` 3. \`gb\` 4. \`ram\` Here's what happens step by step: - **Splitting at Word Boundaries:** The tokenizer identifies spaces as word boundaries (as would punctuation, were there any in the input), effectively splitting \\"Laptop 8 gb RAM\\" into \\"Laptop\\", \\"8\\", \\"gb\\", and \\"RAM\\". - **Lowercasing:** Each of the split tokens is then converted into lowercase. Thus, \\"Laptop\\" becomes \\"laptop\\", and \\"RAM\\" becomes \\"ram\\". The process makes the indexing and search case-insensitive since both the text being indexed and the queries being executed against the index are subjected to the same tokenization process. This ensures that searching for \\"Laptop\\", \\"LAPTOP\\", \\"laptop\\", or any other variation of case will effectively treat those terms as identical, broadening the search and making it more user-friendly."},{"instruction":"how about this example? \\"laptop8 888 19gb ra2m\\"","output":"Using a lowercase tokenizer, such as \`solr.LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\`, on the input \\"laptop8 888 19gb ra2m\\" would tokenize the text into distinct terms based primarily on whitespace and punctuation. However, it is important to note that the \`LowerCaseTokenizer\` specifically does not split on numbers or treat the transition from letters to numbers as a token boundary. Therefore, it converts the entire input string to lowercase but does not specifically split alphanumeric strings into separate number and letter tokens. Given the characteristics of the \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\`, the input \\"laptop8 888 19gb ra2m\\" would be handled as follows: 1. \`laptop8\` 2. \`888\` 3. \`19gb\` 4. \`ra2m\` Each term is: - **Split at Whitespace Boundaries:** The tokenizer splits the input string into tokens at spaces. - **Lowercased:** Since \\"laptop8 888 19gb ra2m\\" is already in lowercase, there's no visible change in casing as a result of the tokenizer’s lowercasing function. If the input were mixed case (e.g., \\"Laptop8 888 19Gb rA2m\\"), the output would still be in all lowercase (\`laptop8\`, \`888\`, \`19gb\`, \`ra2m\`). The tokenizer does not split \\"laptop8\\" into \\"laptop\\" and \\"8\\", \\"19gb\\" into \\"19\\" and \\"gb\\", or \\"ra2m\\" into \\"ra\\" and \\"2m\\" because it doesn't inherently treat the transitions between letters and numbers as token boundaries. For scenarios where splitting alphanumeric tokens is desired, further token filters beyond a simple lowercasing tokenizer would be needed. For example, the use of \`solr.WordDelimiterGraphFilterFactory\` could help split such alphanumeric strings into more granular tokens, aiding in more detailed or nuanced text analysis and search capability."},{"instruction":"how about this one? \\"lap-top 8/88 g'b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing<yo> asda.sf!\\"","output":"Given the input \\"lap-top 8/88 g'b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing<yo> asda.sf!\\", and assuming the use of a simple tokenizer that splits on white space and punctuation — such as what might be expected from a basic configuration in Solr without further customization for handling specific punctuation or tokenization rules — you would see a splitting of this string into more components based on the presence of whitespace, slashes (/), dashes (-), apostrophes ('), ampersands (&), parentheses (), backslashes (), commas (,), pipes (|), angle brackets (< >), and periods (.), as well as exclamation points (!). However, the exact outcome can depend heavily on the precise tokenizer and filters applied in the Solr schema configuration. Assuming a simplistic interpretation with a focus on common delimiters and ignoring any specialized tokenizer that might treat certain punctuation differently, here’s a rough approximation of how the input might be broken down, focusing on splitting by common punctuation and whitespace, without an existing tokenizer's in-depth logic: 1. \`lap\` 2. \`top\` 3. \`8\` 4. \`88\` 5. \`g'b\` 6. \`ram\` 7. \`202\` 8. \`as\` 9. \`das\` 10. \`test\` 11. \`ing\` 12. \`yo\` 13. \`asda\` 14. \`sf\` Things to note: - Words are broadly split around punctuation and whitespace characters. - The hyphen in \`lap-top\` causes a split into \`lap\` and \`top\`. - Similar splitting behavior around \`/\`, \`'\`, \`&\`, \`(\`, \`)\`, \`\`, \`,\`, \`|\`, \`<\`, \`>\`, \`.\`, and \`!\`. - The backslash in \`asdas\` may not be treated as a splitting character in some environments, depending on the tokenizer specifics and escape character handling. However, assuming typical scenarios where it's treated as a delimiter or part of escaping sequences, it's considered here as a split point. - The presence of numerical digits combined with letters, as in alphanumeric codes, might not lead to splits depending on the tokenizer. Complex combinations like \`8/88\` and \`ram&202\` are directly split by their non-alphanumeric delimiters. This breakdown is simplified and assumes a generic approach to tokenization that focuses on splitting based on common delimiters. The exact tokenization outcome would ultimately depend on the specific tokenizer and filter chain configured in Solr for the field being processed. Advanced configurations, including the \`solr.WordDelimiterGraphFilterFactory\`, could further refine how such input is tokenized by, for example, splitting alphanumeric tokens, retaining certain punctuation as part of tokens, or other nuanced behavior specific to the search application's requirements."},{"instruction":"how would lowercase tokeniser in solr would treat this input? “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!”","output":"For the \`solr.LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\`, which is designed to tokenize text into words, converting them to lower case, it's essential to remember that its primary functions are to: 1. Split text into words at non-letter characters (simple case without specific configurations to handle advanced scenarios differently). 2. Convert all letters to lowercase. However, it's also key to understand that this tokenization description assumes basic behavior. The \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` doesn't explicitly handle numbers, punctuation, or special characters in its split logic, apart from converting characters to lowercase. Tokenizers in Solr are configurable, and their behavior can heavily depend on the specific tokenizer or filter chain in use. Given the input “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!”, a simplistic approach using just the \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` behavior might not accurately split on all special characters as intended in more sophisticated text processing scenarios. However, aiming to reflect on the basic principles: - All characters would be converted to lowercase. - The tokenizer would not inherently treat symbols such as hyphens, slashes, ampersands, parentheses, commas, pipes, backslashes, or periods as word boundaries in the same manner that more specialized tokenizers or filters might. Since your scenario appears more complex, involving a mix of letters, numbers, and various punctuation marks, here's a broad assumption of what you might expect **if** you were only focusing on the lowercase conversion and not the precise word splitting: The input would be converted entirely to lowercase without any separation or removal of characters, resulting in: “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!” It's critical to note, though, that the actual tokenization — meaning how the text is split into individual words or tokens — depends on additional tokenizers or filters beyond a basic lowercase converter. For splitting based on the varied punctuation and handling specific patterns (like numbers attached to letters or embedded punctuation), you'd typically employ a more complex chain of tokenizers and filters in Solr like the \`WordDelimiterGraphFilterFactory\` or custom regex-based tokenizers. Therefore, more advanced processing would be necessary to accurately separate \\"lap-top\\" into \\"lap\\" and \\"top\\", distinguish \\"8/88\\" as separate tokens, or handle other punctuation and special characters as token boundaries while also converting all letters to lowercase."},{"instruction":"what would be the output by lowercase tokeniser in solr for this input “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!”","output":"Given the specific operation of the \`solr.LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` in Solr and its behavior as detailed in Solr's documentation, let's clarify with a focus solely on its primary functions: tokenizing letters and converting them to lower case, without actively splitting on numerical or special characters as a more complex tokenizer/filter might do. However, it's important to correct and refine the understanding of how a basic lowercase tokenizer operates within the context of Solr, based on the description provided. The \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` actually primarily affects case conversion rather than token splitting based on non-letter characters like hyphens or slashes. For detailed token splitting, especially involving punctuation and complex strings as presented in the example, a different tokenizer or a combination of tokenizers and filters would usually be employed. Given this clarification, if we were strictly speaking about only converting to lowercase without considering advanced token split logic (which a \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` might leave to other components in a processing chain), the output for **tokenization** purposes might not directly match the expectation laid out in an earlier response considering a simplistic view. In an accurate setting for just lowercase conversion without token splitting (which is not the typical or sole use case for \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` but rather a simplification for the sake of illustration): The input text: “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!” Would, focusing solely on case conversion, result in a conversion to all lowercase as follows without splitting the text based on punctuation: “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!” But remember, this operation assumes that we are not engaging in advanced token splitting based on the punctuation or creating separate tokens for components like \\"lap\\" and \\"top\\" in \\"lap-top\\". Actual tokenization behavior, including handling of hyphens, slashes, and other punctuation, would require a more specific configuration involving additional or alternative tokenizer and filter classes within Solr that are designated for methodically handling such characters and scenarios. To achieve tokenization that splits on punctuation and other special characters, complementing tokenizers and filters such as \`solr.StandardTokenizerFactory\`, \`solr.WordDelimiterGraphFilterFactory\`, or custom regex-based approaches would be needed in addition to or instead of the \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` to handle splitting logic and case normalization in a way that matches the expected output for complex inputs."},{"instruction":"import ollama res = ollama.chat( model=\\"llava\\", messages=[ { 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Describe this image:', 'images': (\\"./2.png\\") } ] ) print(res['message']['content']) why this code don't work?","output":"The code snippet you're trying to run appears to be invoking a fictional or misnamed library and function for processing images or simulating a chatbot response to input with attached images.

This might be the root cause of why your code doesn't work as expected. Additionally, you seem to be trying to analyze an image using text-based chat functionality, which would necessitate a library capable of image processing and AI-based image understanding, such as TensorFlow with models from TensorFlow Hub, PyTorch with models from Hugging Face's Transformers, or similar. To work with images and possibly generate descriptions or responses based on them, you’d typically use a combination of image processing and machine learning/AI libraries. If your goal is to involve AI in generating responses to images (like creating descriptions or answering questions about them), you might be thinking of services like OpenAI's GPT (now in its 3rd or newer version) or similar technologies which can be used for generating textual content based on image inputs when properly configured.

However, as of the last update, direct image-to-text functionality in widely used text generation models like GPT-3 requires specific setups and possibly using additional APIs specifically designed for handling images. For actual image processing and analysis (including object recognition, caption generation, etc.), you might want to look into deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and possibly models trained on datasets like MS COCO for captioning tasks.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and basic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating “positive thinking” into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of “positive thinking” prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best “positive thinking” prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations. machine learning, language modeling, (automatic) prompt engineering †conference: arXiv; Feb 2024; Preprint †booktitle: arXiv, Feb 2024, Preprint †price: 25.00 †isbn: arXiv †copyright: none 1.Introduction In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in transforming the way humans interact with technology. As these models become increasingly sophisticated, understanding and influencing the nuances of their underlying functionality becomes imperative to harness their full potential. Among the myriad factors influencing the performance of language models, the concept of “positive thinking” has emerged as a fascinating and surprisingly influential dimension. Intuition tells us that, in the context of language model systems, like any other computer system, “positive thinking” should not affect performance, but empirical experience has demonstrated otherwise. This paper aims to quantify the impact of various “positive thinking” additions to the system message of a prompt. In essence, it explores the influence of seemingly worthless prompt modifications by measuring the fluctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset. As the quest for near-perfect performance from Artificial Intelligence (AI) intensifies, understanding the effect of “positive thinking” in language model prompts can add crucial performance points to test set scores. We will show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. Then we’ll show that not only does systematic prompt optimization outperform “positive thinking”, even with smaller open-source models, but that it also generalizes better. Additionally, we’ll show that the highest-scoring automatically-generated prompt is remarkably different from anything a human practitioner would be likely to generate. 2.Related Work The genesis of prompt engineering can be traced back to the seminal Chain of Thought paper by Wei et al. (Wei et al., 2023). This pioneering work demonstrated a significant enhancement in model performance by introducing a simple prompt modification: the inclusion of the directive “Think step by step.” The degree of performance improvement, however, is contingent upon the specific model, its size, and the underlying dataset. Subsequently, the PaLM 2 Technical Report by Anil et al. (Anil et al., 2023) revealed that the application of Chain of Thought prompts may yield adverse effects on certain datasets. This observation underscores the absence of a universal prompt snippet capable of unconditionally improving model performance. Consequently, the landscape of prompt engineering has witnessed the emergence of resources such as the Prompt Engineering Guide1, aiming to catalog the myriad techniques and scholarly contributions2 constituting the expansive realm of prompt engineering. These endeavors reflect an ongoing effort to navigate the diverse techniques and insights propelling the continuous evolution of effective prompting strategies. In addition to the formally published literature on prompt engineering, numerous discussions on less formal discoveries can be found in countless threads on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit3. 3.Experimental Design To test the impact of “positive thinking” prompts, we vary the system message part of the prompt with a combination of “openers”, “task descriptions”, and “closers” in the following format: <<SYS>>{opener}{task_description}{closer}<</SYS>> Refer to Table 1, 2, and 3 for a comprehensive compilation of the opening snippets, task descriptions, and closing snippets utilized in our study. Given the incorporation of 5 openers, 3 task descriptions, and 4 closers, our experimentation involved a total of 60 unique combinations. Additionally, we conducted tests both with and without Chain of Thought prompting, resulting in a grand total of 120 prompt combinations per input per model. Although the possibility of expanding the range of snippets within each category existed (and the temptation to do so was strong), we made a deliberate decision to limit our selection due to the significant time commitment associated with the computational complexity of testing, as exemplified by the runtime required for 60 prompt combinations for a 70-billion-parameter model with Chain of Thought being measured in days, not hours. Openers None You are as smart as ChatGPT. You are highly intelligent. You are an expert mathematician. You are a professor of mathematics. Table 1.Opening snippets for the system message.

Take a deep breath and think carefully. I really need your help! Table 3.Closing snippets for the system message. 3.1.Dataset Careful selection of the dataset for testing against constitutes a critical aspect of this study. Our aim was to identify a challenging task that was unlikely to have been directly encountered during the training of the models4. While our preference was for an internal dataset specific to VMware, the absence of large-scale datasets with directly quantifiable scoring metrics, such as accuracy or F1, necessitated the utilization of a publicly available benchmark dataset. Ultimately, we opted for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Given the ongoing limitations of contemporary LLMs, particularly in addressing basic mathematical tasks, especially those involving multi-step reasoning, we deemed GSM8K an optimal choice for illustrating the impact of seemingly inconsequential augmentations to the prompt’s system message. 3.2.Scoring In the context of GSM8K’s mathematical assessment, we adopted a stringent approach to scoring that precluded the assignment of partial credit. Thus, we employed Exact Match (EM) as our scoring metric. The model was evaluated based on whether it correctly provided the exact numerical solution or not. This rigorous methodology ensures a clear and unambiguous assessment of the model’s accuracy in providing the exact numerical output. 3.3.Output Parsing Given the unforgiving nature of EM scoring, it is essential to note that, despite the answer to GSM8K questions being numerical, the output of an LLM is a string. Consequently, meticulous attention must be paid to the formatting and parsing of the non-numerical output. From the standpoint of string equality, it is imperative to recognize distinctions such as the string “30000” not being equivalent to “30,000” or “30000.00”. To mitigate this challenge, a post-processing step was implemented to ensure accurate scoring by preventing misclassification of a response as incorrect when it was, in fact, accurate. 3.4.Scale Benchmark datasets typically encompass thousands of examples in their test sets; GSM8K has over 1,300 examples in its test set. Such an extensive scale of data is exceptionally uncommon in real-world datasets, particularly during the initial stages of a project. To replicate this rarity, we systematically subset the test set of GSM8K, extracting subsets containing the first 10, 25, 50, and 100 questions, thereby allowing us to illustrate the impact of “positive thinking” as the dataset size increases. Notably, we limited our experiments to a maximum of 100 questions to mitigate computation time, as computing results for the entire test set would have required weeks and incurred a substantial carbon cost for what would likely be diminishing returns. 3.5.Model Selection Although we aspired to assess widely recognized commercial models such as GPT-3.5/4, Gemini, Claude, etc., conducting experiments involving 12,000 requests per model was deemed financially prohibitive, as it would have incurred costs amounting to many thousands of dollars. Consequently, we opted to utilize models hosted by VMware NLP Lab’s LLM API. Specifically, our evaluations were conducted on Mistral-7B5 (Jiang et al., 2023), Llama2-13B6 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama2-70B7 (Touvron et al., 2023).

Given the nature of these models, specifically that they were designed for conversational interactions, achieving success in terms of Exact Match (EM) scoring necessitated guiding the model to refrain from generating a response comprising multiple sentences. To accomplish this, we resorted to incorporating examples via in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), as exposure to instances of the desired output format significantly increased the likelihood of the model producing responses aligned with the specified format (though, as previously mentioned, significant post-processing was still required to get the simple numerical response). To maintain experimental consistency by minimizing the number of variables that changed in each iteration, we adopted an intentionally naive strategy for in-context learning. Strategies such as K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) example selection have been shown to increase model performance (Liu et al., 2021); however, we chose not to employ any such strategies, so as to hold the number of variables changing per experiment to one: the modified system message only. Specifically, we limited the examples to the last four instances from the test set8, thereby providing a consistent and focused set of samples for the model to learn from. Notably, four examples emerged as the minimum number required to consistently elicit the correct output format. 3.7.Automatic Prompt Optimization Engaging in the iterative process of refining prompts and monitoring the subsequent score progression can be an enjoyable endeavor. However, this approach proves to be highly time-inefficient, especially when systematically assessing all modifications from a scientific standpoint. Existing research, as demonstrated by Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2023), highlights the superior capability of LLM systems in optimizing their own prompts compared to human efforts. In light of this, we conducted a comparative analysis pitting human-generated “positive thinking” optimization against the utilization of DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023) Optimizers9 at the same question subsets: 10, 25, 50, and 100. It is noteworthy that the questions utilized for optimization were additional and distinct from the evaluation set and the in-context learning examples, though also originating from the end of the test set. For the most extensive trial, 100 “new” questions were employed for the optimization process, while the same 100 evaluation questions were used for the evaluation processes, so as to make the scores directly comparable. Importantly, each model was exclusively employed to optimize itself; cross-model optimizations, such as using Llama2-70B to optimize the prompt for Mistral-7B, were not pursued. 4.Experimental Results As evidenced in the subsequent sections, certain overarching patterns become apparent; however, they do not universally apply to each model across all prompting strategies. We will explicitly illustrate that there is no straightforward universal prompt snippet that can be added to optimize any given model’s performance. For these experiments, baseline performance refers to the scenario where the model receives no system message, signified by the opening snippet, task description, and closing snippet all being designated as “None”. For Sections 4.1-4.3, refer to Table 4.

Bold is for the higher Average EM. “EM Delta” is the difference between the Exact Match for the two sets. An underline is for the lower EM Delta. All prompts are with Chain of Thought. 4.1.Mistral-7B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting, Mistral-7B’s performance remained remarkably consistent across all prompt permutations. At both the 10 and 25 question sets, there was no deviation. Even for the 100 question subset, the maximum observed standard deviation was a mere 0.007. The variability observed at 50 questions appears to be an anomaly. Examination of the results in Appendix B.3 reveals that, with the exception of one prompt scoring 0.10, all others scored 0.12. It is unclear why this particular prompt led to one additional incorrect response compared to the other 59 prompt variations. In contrast, the results for 100 questions in Appendix B.4 demonstrate a reasonable spread between 0.08 and 0.11. In relative terms, Mistral-7B, when prompted without Chain of Thought, exhibits substantial prompt invariance, with the “positive thinking” prompts only matching or marginally surpassing the baseline. This trend reverses when Mistral-7B is prompted with Chain of Thought. Instead of observing a slight increase in deviation with the number of questions, there is a steady and substantial decrease, ranging from 0.066 at 10 questions to 0.018 at 100 questions. In this scenario, “positive thinking” prompts significantly outperformed the baseline with no prompts falling below the baseline. Please refer to Appendices B.5 through B.8 for the ranked order of prompts for Mistral-7B with Chain of Thought. 4.2.Llama2-13B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was no deviation, Llama2-13B shows an opposite trend to Mistral-7B, with deviation decreasing from 0.014 at 25 questions to 0.003 at 100 questions. While slightly less stable than Mistral-7B, without Chain of Thought, LLama2-13B is also fairly prompt invariant, with the “positive thinking” prompts again only matching or marginally exceeding the baseline. With Chain of Thought prompting, the trend is less clear. It does overall decrease from 0.026 at 10 to 0.016 at 100, but, at 50, it’s even lower, at 0.012. This is the only case where that occurred. For Mistral-7B, and as we’ll show in the next section with Llama2-70B, variation consistently decreased as the number of questions increased when employing Chain of Thought prompting. 4.3.Llama2-70B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was again no deviation, Llama2-70B exhibits a similar trend to Llama2-13B, with deviation again decreasing from 0.017 at 25 questions to 0.050 at 100 questions. Across all three models, the prompt variance was an order of magnitude lower without Chain of Thought when compared to using Chain of Thought at the same question count. However, in terms of actual performance, the “positive thinking” prompts all matched or underperformed baseline. This is a stark departure from the pattern seen with Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B. That departure does not persist when employing Chain of Thought prompting. While the performance of the “positive thinking” prompts with Chain of Thought did underperform the baseline on average for 10 and 25 questions, it outperformed the baseline on average for 50 and 100 questions. As for variance, the general pattern of standard deviation decreasing with question count does hold. 4.4.General Trends in Results It’s challenging to extract many generalizable results across models and prompting strategies, as every nearly evident trend we observed had at least one notable exception. In fact, the only real trend may be no trend. What’s best for any given model, dataset, and prompting strategy is likely to be specific to the particular combination at hand. Thus, we turned from hand-tuning the system message with optimistic “positive thinking” to automatic prompt optimization. 4.5.Automatic Prompt Optimization Results As anticipated, the prompts that underwent automatic optimization consistently equaled or surpassed the effectiveness of our manually generated “positive thinking” prompts in nearly all instances. The instances where “positive thinking” achieved higher average scores across the optimization and evaluation sets were limited to Mistral-7B with 25 questions and Llama2-70B with 10 questions. However, evaluating performance solely on raw scores is insufficient; hence, we also examined the delta between scores on the optimization set and the evaluation set. A lower delta implies superior generalization of the prompt. Therefore, the optimal strategy combines the highest average score with the lowest delta. See Table 5 for the performance comparison. For Mistral-7B, the results present a mixed scenario. “Positive thinking” exhibits a lower delta for 10, 25, and 50 questions, while the automatically optimized prompt demonstrates a lower delta for 100 questions. Considering Mistral-7B’s model capacity, it is understandable that it faces challenges in optimizing its own prompt when compared to the larger Llama2-13B and 70B models. In contrast, for both Llama2-13B and 70B models, the automatically optimized prompts consistently show a lower delta across all cases. Consequently, it is advisable to refrain from manually fine-tuning prompts when using models larger than 7B, and instead, leverage the model’s ability to autonomously optimize prompts. For 7B models, more work is required to see if the trend of automatically optimized prompts outperforming manually tuned prompts holds for sample sizes exceeding 100 questions. This recommendation aligns with the original auto-optimization paper. However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the optimized prompts themselves. They diverge significantly from any prompts we might have devised independently. If presented with these optimized prompts before observing their performance scores, one might have anticipated their inadequacy rather than their consistent outperformance of hand-tailored prompts. A prime example is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and prefix generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset: System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» Answer Prefix: Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proficiency in mathematical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an affinity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently. For a comprehensive collection of the peculiar and fascinating prompts generated by the three models, refer to Appendix C. 5.The Reproducibility Problem Although somewhat peripheral to the primary research question addressed in this paper, it is noteworthy that our findings exhibit significant discrepancies from the published performance scores of Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B, whereas Llama2-70B fell within an acceptable margin of error, considering our evaluation was conducted on approximately 15% of GSM8K’s test set. Refer to Table 6 for the score comparisons. The most significant deviation was observed in the case of Llama2-13B. Meta reported a score of 0.29 on the GSM8K dataset. Our results without Chain of Thought yielded a score of 0.07, whereas with Chain of Thought, we achieved a score of 0.43. Due to both Meta and Mistral AI’s omission of the prompts used for testing their models, we can only speculate about the reasons behind our substantial performance differences compared to their reported scores. This instance underscores a broader issue of reproducibility that has long existed inside the machine learning community, but has become significantly exacerbated since the advent of LLMs. Without the publication of prompts employed by researchers with their models, reproducing their results becomes a formidable challenge. As shown in this paper, trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. We implore all future research publications to include the prompts used in an appendix. Refer to Appendix A to see our prompt templates.

However, due to the combinatorial complexity of scientifically testing each change, manual prompt engineering is far from the most efficient methodology for improving model performance. Instead, the best path forward is to use libraries like DSPy to apply a more structured approach to constructing LLM-powered applications and use the built-in optimizer to automatically tune the prompt for your dataset and model of choice. 7.Conclusion It’s both surprising and irritating that trivial modifications to the prompt can exhibit such dramatic swings in performance. Doubly so, since there’s no obvious methodology for improving performance. Affecting performance is trivial. Improving performance, when tuning the prompt by hand, is laborious and computationally prohibitive when using scientific processes to evaluate every change. In this paper, we showed that you don’t need massive commercial models like PaLM 2 or GPT-4 to tune your prompt. Mistral-7B struggled to optimize its own prompt until it had 100 questions to work with. Llama2-13B and 70B were able to produce superior prompts with as little as 10 questions to optimize with. And while the prompts they generated may appear shocking to an experienced practitioner, it’s undeniable that the automatically generated prompts perform better and generalize better than hand-tuned “positive thinking” prompts.\\"\\"","output":"Alright, let's break this down into simpler terms. Imagine we're talking about super smart robots (Large Language Models or LLMs) that can do math and solve problems just by reading instructions (prompts) we give them. But here's the catch: How we write these instructions really matters. # The Core Idea: Researchers Rick Battle and Teja Gollapudi from the VMware Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lab found something pretty interesting. They discovered that tweaking the way they talk to these smart robots – making the instructions more positive or \\"happy\\" – can sometimes make the robots perform better. They called this \\"positive thinking\\" in prompts. # What They Did: 1. **Played with Words:** They tried different combinations of words to see which ones made the robots do better on math problems from a tough test set called GSM8K. 2. **Used a Thought Process:** They tested if telling the robots to think step-by-step (Chain of Thought prompting) helped them perform better. 3. **Automatic versus Manual:** They compared the manually made \\"happy\\" prompts with prompts created by an automatic system to see which ones worked best. # What They Found: - **Not One-Size-Fits-All:** The effect of these \\"happy\\" prompts varied across different robot models. In some cases, they helped a lot; in other cases, not so much. - **Automatic is Better:** The prompts created by the automatic system generally outperformed the manually crafted \\"positive thinking\\" ones. - **Surprising Results:** The best prompts from the automatic systems were sometimes really weird and not what humans would think of, but they worked surprisingly well. # The Challenge: Even with their discoveries, there's a problem. The way these tests are run and reported makes it hard for other researchers to repeat and verify the results. They're asking everyone to share more details about their tests to help solve this issue. # Moving Forward: The big takeaway is that even though tweaking these instructions can dramatically affect how well the robots perform, figuring out the best tweaks is tough. The future is likely in using automatic systems to generate these instructions rather than doing it manually because it's more efficient and often more effective. # In Simple Terms: Think of it like this: If you're teaching someone to solve a problem, the way you phrase the question and encourage them can make a big difference in how well they do. What's surprising is that for these AI robots, even seemingly silly or strange encouragement can work wonders, especially if an automated system figures out the encouragement for you."},{"instruction":"Give me examples of some of the more strange and eccentric prompts automatically generated that were found to be effective on the dataset.","output":"The paper discusses the effectiveness of automatically optimized prompts over manually created \\"positive thinking\\" prompts. An example of a surprisingly effective and eccentric prompt that was found to be particularly effective is themed around Star Trek, which is quite unexpected in the context of solving mathematical problems. Here's that example again for clarity: **System Message:** > «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» **Answer Prefix:** > Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. This prompt, seemingly unrelated to performing mathematical tasks, was identified through automatic optimization as being effective in enhancing the performance of the Large Language Model (LLM) on mathematical reasoning problems in the GSM8K dataset. It stands out because it doesn’t directly instruct the model to solve a math problem but instead places the task within a narrative framework, reminiscent of a Star Trek adventure. The fact that this imaginative and narrative-based prompt significantly aided the model in mathematical reasoning is a testament to the unpredictable nature of what can work best when it comes to prompting LLMs. This example underscores two key points highlighted in the paper: 1. **Creativity in Prompting:** The automated systems can come up with highly creative and unexpected ways to frame tasks for the LLMs that a human might not consider. This creativity can sometimes unlock better performance from the models. 2. **Challenge in Predictions:** It's challenging to predict what type of prompts will lead to better model performance. Something that might seem irrelevant or too eccentric, like invoking a space mission command, can surprisingly make the model perform better. These findings suggest a broader lesson about the complexity and sometimes the unpredictability of working with LLMs, where the \\"right\\" prompt might be highly unorthodox and unconventional."},{"instruction":"As a result of this finding, what did the authors conclude was the best way to proceed forward and extract the best performance from different llms?","output":"Based on their findings that eccentric and automatically generated prompts can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks, such as solving mathematical problems from the GSM8K dataset, the authors concluded that the best way to proceed in extracting optimal performance from different LLMs entails utilizing automatic prompt optimization techniques over manual prompt crafting, especially for complex and nuanced tasks. Here are the key takeaways from their experiment and its implication for future work with LLMs: 1. **Efficiency of Automatic Prompt Optimization:** Despite the success of \\"positive thinking\\" or manually created encouraging prompts in some cases, automatic optimization techniques consistently generated better-performing prompts. This was evident even with eccentric prompts that a human wouldn't typically consider effective. Thus, leveraging automated systems for prompt generation is recommended for enhancing model performance. 2. **Embrace the Unpredictability:** The fact that unexpected and seemingly unrelated prompt themes (like the Star Trek example) could significantly improve performance implies that the potential for what works as an effective prompt is vast and often unpredictable. Automatic optimization can explore a wider array of possibilities much faster and more efficiently than manual tinkering. 3. **Generalization and Performance:** The automatically optimized prompts not only performed better but also generalized better across different sets of problems. They managed to maintain performance consistency, which is crucial for real-world applications of LLMs. Therefore, the utility of automated prompt optimization extends beyond just finding effective prompts to ensuring these prompts can work well across various tasks. 4. **Accessible Approaches for All Model Sizes:** The findings suggest that while larger models can indeed benefit from automatic prompt optimization, even smaller models, when given enough data points for optimization, can see noticeable improvements in performance. This democratizes the approach to leveraging LLMs effectively across a wider range of model sizes and applications. 5. **Future Work in Expanding Automatic Optimization:** The authors pointed out the necessity for future research to further explore automatic prompt optimization. This includes experimenting with a broader array of models, datasets, and optimization techniques to fine-tune the approach and understand its applications better. In conclusion, the authors advocate for a shift towards systematic, automated methods for prompt optimization as the most effective and efficient way to unlock the full potential of LLMs across various tasks and domains. This approach not only saves time but also unveils creative and high-performing prompts that might not be intuitive to human designers."},{"instruction":"I have a random idea for a alternate history scenario... what if Half-Life 2 appeared at E3 2002?","output":"Your idea for an alternate history scenario where Half-Life 2 appears at E3 2002 provides a fascinating thought experiment, given the game's actual reveal took place at E3 2003. Let's explore the implications of this scenario on the gaming industry, Valve Corporation, and the fans. # Immediate Impact on the Gaming Industry 1. **Earlier Technological Benchmark**: Half-Life 2 was a technical marvel at the time of its release, setting new standards for physics, graphics, and storytelling. An earlier reveal would have pushed competitors to accelerate their development processes to keep up, possibly leading to a faster evolution of game technology. 2. **Influence on Game Design**: The innovative use of the Source engine, including physics-based gameplay and facial animation systems, might have influenced game design principles earlier.
