Also, (x - 1)^2 represents a parabola that opens upwards and has its vertex at (1, c-1). Since the parabola opens upwards and (x - 1)^2 reaches its minimum value of 0 when x = 1, it is clear that the value of f(x) at x = 0 will be less than the value at x = 4 or x = -4 due to the symmetry of the parabola about the line x = 1.

In this scenario, the conclusion is trivially true because any infinite subset of X is itself a monochromatic set when there is only one element. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: We assume the statement holds for some k = m, i.e., if [X]^m is colored using c colors, then there exists an infinite monochromatic subset of X. 3. **Induction Step**: We must show that the statement holds for k = m + 1.      - Consider the set [X]^{m+1} which is colored using c colors. We aim to construct an infinite sequence of subsets X_0, X_1, X_2, ldots of X and elements x_0, x_1, x_2, ldots such that:         (i) X_{i+1} subseteq X_i setminus {x_i} for all i,         (ii) For any Z in left[X_{i+1}right]^{m}, the (m+1)-element subset {x_i} cup Z is monochromatic. We refer to the color of this subset as being associated with x_i. 4. **Construction**:     - Start with X_0 := X and pick any element x_0 in X_0. Note that X_0 is infinite.     - For each i, assume an infinite set X_i and x_i in X_i has been chosen.     - Consider the set left[X_i setminus {x_i}right]^{m}. By the induction hypothesis, since left[X_i setminus {x_i}right]^{m} is colored using c colors, it follows that there exists an infinite monochromatic subset within X_i setminus {x_i}. Define this infinite monochromatic set as X_{i+1}.           - Clearly, X_{i+1} subseteq X_i setminus {x_i} and thus meets condition (i). 5. **Monochromatic Condition**:     - Condition (ii) ensures that for any Z in left[X_{i+1}right]^{m}, the set {x_i} cup Z retains the same color. This sequence construction guarantees that every time we extend by one element from X_{i} to X_{i+1}, the new element x_{i+1} in X_{i+1} is chosen such that the set {x_i} cup Z remains monochromatic for every subset Z in left[X_{i+1}right]^{m}. 6. **Conclusion**:     - Given that there are c colors and considering the sequence (x_0, x_1, x_2, ldots), by the pigeonhole principle, at least one color must associate with infinitely many elements x_i.      - Therefore, the set formed by these elements is an infinite monochromatic subset of X. Thus, we have shown by induction that for any k and c, if [X]^k is colored with c colors, there exists an infinite monochromatic subset of X. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Erwan went on shopping.

Consequently, the product must be a perfect square. 4. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:**    If every vector v_i neq (0, 0, ldots, 0) for 1 leqslant i leqslant N, consider the set of all possible vectors in the form:     left{ (c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n) mid c_i = 0 text{ or } 1 right}     This set contains 2^n - 1 vectors (excluding the zero vector (0,0,ldots,0)). 5. **Existence of Repeating Vectors:**    Given N geq 2^n, by the pigeonhole principle, there must exist indices h and k such that 1 leq k < h leq N and v_h = v_k.  6. **Subsequence Analysis:**    Consider the subsequence b_{k+1}, b_{k+2}, ldots, b_h. In this subsequence, each a_i's appearances must maintain the same parity as in b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k because v_h = v_k. 7. **Conclusion of Perfect Square:**    Thus, in the product b_{k+1}, b_{k+2}, ldots, b_h, each a_i appears an even number of times, indicating that the product of this subsequence is a perfect square.

Therefore, ( RA ) is an internal tangent of ( odot O ) and ( odot P ), and ( RB ) is an internal tangent of ( odot O ) and ( odot Q ). **Step 2:** Using angle properties and the Tangent-Secant Theorem - By the Tangent-Secant Theorem (a line from an external point ( R ) that touches two circles ( odot P ) and ( odot Q ) at consistent points will have equal tangents), we know:   - ( RA = RB )   - ( PA perp RA ) and ( QA perp RA )   - Similarly, ( PB perp RB ) and ( QB perp RB ) **Step 3:** Consider the cyclic quadrilaterals ( APMR ) and ( BQMR ) - Since ( PA perp RA ) and ( PM perp RM ), by the properties of perpendicularity:   - The four points ( A, P, M, R ) are concyclic (lie on a circle).

The median of a triangle, here AN, divides the opposite side into two equal parts.

The intersection of two mutually regular polyhedra is called a nearly regular polyhedron (see Fig. 22). A polyhedron is called equiangular semiregular or Archimedean if its faces are regular polygons of different types, and all its polyhedral angles are equal to each other. For instance, an example of such a polyhedron is an ngon prism with square side faces. A nearly regular polyhedron is a special case of Archimedean polyhedra, distinguished by their regularity. For example, in a nearly regular polyhedron, both dihedral angles are equal. The vertices of a nearly regular polyhedron are the common midpoints of the edges of the original mutually intersecting polyhedra, and each of its faces is obtained from the face of one of the original polyhedra by connecting the midpoints of adjacent sides. Clearly, in each vertex of a nearly regular polyhedron, exactly four edges converge. The faces are regular polygons of two types, corresponding to the types of faces of the original mutually intersecting polyhedra. Each edge of a nearly regular polyhedron borders one face of each type.","output":"Part (a) To find all possible types of regular dodecahedra, we can investigate the polyhedra that can be obtained from the regular convex dodecahedron by specific methods mentioned on page 34. 1. **Extending the edges**:    - Consider the adjacent faces in the new polyhedron to be those which are adjacent in the original dodecahedron. This is achieved by extending the edges of the original dodecahedron.    - This results in a type of polyhedron known as the small stellated dodecahedron (as shown in Figure 146, a). This polyhedron has 12 faces (which are stellated pentagons), 30 edges, and 12 vertices (each being the vertex of a pentagonal shape in the polyhedron). 2. **Continuing the edges to meet new faces**:    - Among the six faces that are not adjacent to a specific face ( mu ) in the original dodecahedron, one pair of these faces is parallel to ( mu ).    - By continuing the edges until they intersect with ( mu ), we obtain a new polyhedron with 12 faces (regular convex pentagons), 30 edges, and 12 vertices. This is known as the great dodecahedron (as shown in Figure 146, b). 3. **Continuing every edge**:    - When the edges intersect with each of the faces, not just one pair, we obtain a regular polyhedron known as the great stellated dodecahedron (as shown in Figure 146, c). This polyhedron also has 12 faces (regular stellated pentagons), 30 edges, 20 vertices. Therefore, there are three types of regular dodecahedra:    - Small stellated dodecahedron.    - Great dodecahedron.    - Great stellated dodecahedron.  Part (b) Since the faces of a regular convex icosahedron are triangles, extending its edges cannot yield a new regular polyhedron. Let's investigate if any new polyhedra can be formed by extending the faces of a regular convex icosahedron. 1. **Considering an arbitrary triangular face ( mu_0 )** of the convex icosahedron:    - Denote by ( mu_1, mu_2, mu_3 ) the faces adjacent to ( mu_0 ).    - Extending the faces ( mu_4, mu_6, mu_8 ) leads to a new polyhedron which cannot be another polyhedron but rather forms a surface consisting of five octahedrons (as shown in Figure 141). 2. **Grouping faces adjacent to a specific face**:    - For instance, taking three faces ( mu_{10}, mu_{12}, mu_{14} ), we obtain a combination of three faces meeting at a vertex to form another regular polyhedron.    - Extending the faces to meet creates a structure known as a regular tetrahedron (as shown in Figure 142), but this results in breaking the original structure into five tetrahedrons. 3. **Extending all faces**:    - This results in a polyhedron called the great icosahedron with 20 faces (all equilateral triangles), 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Thus, there is only one non-convex regular icosahedron:    - Great icosahedron. In conclusion, for each type of polyhedron, we have: - Regular dodecahedrons: three types. - Regular icosahedrons: only one non-convex type, the great icosahedron. boxed"},{"instruction":"Given that circle C passes through points A(3,0) and B(5,2), and the center of the circle lies on the line 2xy4=0.

Given |a|leqslant 1 and |x|leqslant 1,   therefore when a=1, x= frac {1}{2} or a=-1, x=- frac {1}{2},   |x^{2}-ax-a^{2}| reaches its maximum value frac {5}{4}.   Hence, mgeqslant frac {5}{4},   Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{text{B}}.   Based on the properties of absolute values, we get |x^{2}-ax-a^{2}|=|-x^{2}+ax+a^{2}|leqslant |-x^{2}+ax|+a^{2}, which leads to the conclusion that -x^{2}+axgeqslant 0. It is determined that when x= frac {a}{2}, it reaches the maximum value, thus determining the range of m.

Find the number of distinct ways to embed the diamonds (assuming the 8 vertices are indistinguishable from one another).","output":"The problem requires us to find the number of distinct ways to embed m different colors into the vertices of a regular cube, such that all vertices can be colored without distinguishing among identical color arrangements resulting from symmetrical rotations of the cube. We employ Burnside's lemma to solve this. 1. **Define the Symmetry Group and Orbits:**    - The symmetry group of the cube contains 24 elements, consisting of rotations that map the cube onto itself. We denote this group as G and list the group elements P_{1}, P_{2}, cdots, P_{24}.      The group elements fall into five classes:      - Identity rotation: 1 element      - Rotation by pm 90^circ about axes through the centers of faces: 6 elements      - Rotation by 180^circ about axes through the centers of faces: 3 elements      - Rotation by pm 120^circ about axes through the diagonals (vertices to opposite vertices): 8 elements      - Rotation by 180^circ about axes through the midpoints of edges: 6 elements 2. **Calculate the Stabilizers' Contribution:**    - The key step involves calculating the fixed points under each symmetry, i.e., configurations invariant under each group element:     - **Class I (Identity)**:       - Each vertex can be independently colored. Thus, the number of fixed points:         [         C(P_{1}) = m^8         ]     - **Class II (Rotation by pm 90^circ about axes through the centers of faces)**:       - There are six rotations of this type, each involving two 4-cycles on the vertices:         [         C(P_2) = C(P_3) = cdots = C(P_7) = m^2         ]          - **Class III (Rotation by 180^circ about axes through the centers of faces)**:       - There are three rotations of this type, each involving four 2-cycles on the vertices:         [         C(P_8) = C(P_9) = C(P_{10}) = m^4         ]     - **Class IV (Rotation by pm 120^circ about axes through the diagonals)**:       - There are eight such rotations, each involving two 3-cycles and two fixed points:         [         C(P_{11}) = C(P_{12}) = cdots = C(P_{18}) = m^4         ]     - **Class V (Rotation by 180^circ about axes through the midpoints of edges)**:       - There are six such rotations, each involving four 2-cycles:         [         C(P_{19}) = C(P_{20}) = cdots = C(P_{24}) = m^4         ] 3. **Apply Burnside's Lemma:**    - According to Burnside's lemma, the number of distinct colorings is the average number of elements invariant under these symmetries.    - Sum contributions:      [      sum_{i=1}^{24} m^{c(P_i)} = m^8 + 6m^2 + 3m^4 + 8m^4 + 6m^4      ]      Simplify the sum:      [      = m^8 + 6m^2 + 17m^4      ]    - Average it over all symmetries:      [      M = frac{1}{24} left( m^8 + 6m^2 + 17m^4 right)      ]      Factor out common terms:      [      M = frac{1}{24} m^2 left( m^6 + 17 m^2 + 6 right)      ] # Conclusion: The number of distinct ways to color the vertices of the cube with m different colors is: [ boxed{frac{1}{24} m^2 (m^6 + 17 m^2 + 6)} ]"},{"instruction":"Given points A(m,2) and B(3,n), if the line AB is parallel to the xaxis and AB=4, find the value of m+n.","output":"Given that the line AB is parallel to the x-axis, we know that the y-coordinates of points A and B must be equal for them to lie on a horizontal line. Therefore, we can equate the y-coordinates of points A and B: n = -2 Next, since the distance AB is given as 4, and the line is parallel to the x-axis, this distance is purely horizontal. Therefore, the difference in the x-coordinates of points A and B must equal 4. This gives us two possibilities due to the absolute value of the distance: 1. If point A is to the left of point B, then m is less than 3, and we can write: 3 - m = 4 Solving for m gives: m = 3 - 4 = -1 2. If point A is to the right of point B, then m is greater than 3, and we can write: m - 3 = 4 Solving for m gives: m = 3 + 4 = 7 Thus, we have two possible values for m, which are m = 7 and m = -1.

Let these perpendiculars intersect AB at points P' and Q', respectively.    - Let M be the midpoint of PQ. By the properties of a circle, OM is perpendicular to PQ. 3. **Show the quadrilaterals are cyclic:**    - Since OM is perpendicular to PQ, O, M, P, and P' are concyclic (lie on the same circle). This can be stated as odot OMPP' is a cyclic quadrilateral.    - Similarly, odot OMQQ' is a cyclic quadrilateral because OM perp PQ. 4. **Intersections and similarity:**    - The lines PQ and P'Q' intersect at points M and O.    - We can use the properties of cyclic quads and intersecting chords to deduce geometrical properties. By the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**, the angles related to these points are preserved.    - From the properties of intersecting circles at points O and M, we can infer that triangle P' MQ' sim triangle POQ (similar triangles). 5. **Equal sides and angles:**    - Given that PQ is of constant length, triangle POQ is an isosceles triangle with PQ as the base.    - This indicates triangle POQ is similar for any position of PQ, making it a fixed shape congruent in all configurations.    - Therefore, triangle P' MQ' has the same angles regardless of PQ's position, meaning triangle P' MQ' is always similar to triangle POQ. # Conclusion: Thus, the configuration triangle P' MQ' maintains similarity with triangle POQ regardless of the position of the chord PQ along the semicircle overparen{AB}. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"There is a magical tree with 60 fruits.

The radii of these spheres are the distances from these centers to plane ABC, i.e., the distances O_1 O_1' and O_2 O_2' where O_1' and O_2' are the projections onto plane ABC. 6. **Geometric Verification:**    Verify these centers by ensuring that O_1' and O_2' also intersect with line g'. The projections K_{t1} and K_{t2} on line g' correspond to the valid sphere centers as they lie on the plane ABC at the intersection points with C_0, A_0, and B_0. 7. **Second Method Consideration:**    To simplify the earlier method, recognize that projections K' of K onto g' define the circles touching g'. The constructed circles centered at these projections related to corresponding tangents such as EO' and FO' from the auxiliary planes and their intersections O_i' thus can be solved geometrically by further subdivision and projection techniques utilized in space. 8. **The Final Result:**    With the centers O_1 and O_2 identified, we confirm the radius by geometric computations consistent with the sphere’s tangency requirements across the tetrahedron’s construction parameters. # Conclusion: The valid centers O_1 and O_2 obtained from the methodical geometric construction are the required centers of the spheres touching plane ABC and passing through the defined points on the tetrahedron's edges. boxed{O_1, O_2}."},{"instruction":"Given that f(x) is an odd function with a period of 2 defined on mathbb{R}, and when 0 < x < 1, f(x)=4^{x}, calculate f( frac {5}{2})+f(1).","output":"Since f(x) is an odd function with a period of 2 defined on mathbb{R}: 1.

Therefore, ( n - s(s(s(n))) ) is divisible by 9. Specifically, ( 2^{2009} - s(s(s(2^{2009}))) ) is divisible by 9. Consequently, ( 2^{2009} ) and ( s(s(s(2^{2009}))) ) leave the same remainder when divided by 9.

As ( 2^5 = 32 ) leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 9, we find that ( 2^{2009} ) leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 9. Moreover: [ 2^{2009} < (2^9)^{224} < (10^3)^{224} = 10^{672} ] Thus, ( 2^{2009} ) has fewer than 672 digits, yielding: [ s(2^{2009}) < 9 times 672 = 6048 ] [ s(s(2^{2009})) leq 5 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 32 ] [ s(s(s(2^{2009}))) leq 2 + 9 = 11 ] As the only number less than or equal to 11 that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 9 is 5, we conclude: [ s(s(s(2^{2009}))) = 5 ] [ boxed{5} ]"},{"instruction":"A small cart with a jet engine stands on rails.

(1) Starting from which year does the company begin to profit?   (2) After several years, there are two possible treatment plans: Plan ① When the average annual profit is the highest, sell the fishing boat for ¥180,000; Plan ② When the total net income is the highest, sell the fishing boat for ¥90,000. Which plan is more costeffective?","output":"Let's denote the initial cost of the boat as C = ¥490,000, the first-year expenses as E_1 = ¥60,000, and the additional yearly expense increment as dE = ¥20,000. Also let the annual fishing income be I = ¥250,000. (1) To determine when the company begins to profit, we need to calculate when the cumulative income surpasses the cumulative expenses. Let n be the number of years after the purchase of the boat. We have: Annual expenses for year n: E_n = E_1 + (n - 1)dE = ¥60,000 + (n - 1)¥20,000. Cumulative expenses after n years: C + sum_{k=1}^{n} E_k = ¥490,000 + ¥60,000n + ¥20,000frac{n(n - 1)}{2}. Cumulative income after n years: nI = n ¥250,000. We set cumulative income equal to cumulative expenses and solve for n: ¥250,000n = ¥490,000 + ¥60,000n + ¥20,000frac{n(n - 1)}{2}. Simplify and solve for n: ¥190,000n = ¥490,000 + ¥10,000n(n - 1), ¥190,000n = ¥490,000 + ¥10,000(n^2 - n), ¥10,000n^2 - ¥190,000n + ¥490,000 = 0, n^2 - 19n + 49 = 0. By factoring the quadratic equation, we find that n = 1 or n = 49. Since it is impossible for the company to begin to profit in the first year, we discard n = 1. Therefore, we are left with n = 49. However, a practical interpretation requires us to check the years before 49 to see when the cumulative income first exceeds the cumulative expenses. Checking for n = 3: Cumulative expenses: ¥490,000 + 3(¥60,000) + 3(2-1)(¥20,000/2) = ¥490,000 + ¥180,000 + ¥20,000 = ¥690,000. Cumulative income: 3(¥250,000) = ¥750,000. Since the cumulative income exceeds the cumulative expenses in the third year, the company begins to profit starting the third year. [boxed{text{The company begins to profit starting from the third year.}}] (2) For the treatment plans, we need to consider the average annual profit and total net income. Plan ①: To maximize the average annual profit, the boat will be sold when the profit in the next year would decrease the current average profit. Let's denote the average annual profit by P_{avg} and the number of years the boat is used as n. When selling, we add ¥180,000 to the total income. The average annual profit is then given by: P_{avg}(n) = frac{I n - (C + sum_{k=1}^{n} E_k) + 180,000}{n}. Plan ②: To maximize the total net income, the net income is highest just before it starts to decrease if we continue to use the boat. In this case, the sale adds ¥90,000 to the total income. The total net income P_{net} after n years is: P_{net}(n) = I n - (C + sum_{k=1}^{n} E_k) + 90,000. To decide which plan is more cost-effective, we should compare the value obtained from Plan ① at its peak average annual profit with the value from Plan ② when the total net income is maximized. The specific calculations would require comparing the outcomes of P_{avg}(n) and P_{net}(n) for different n, and identifying the n values where each is maximized. Due to the lack of an explicit formula or values to work with for these plans, we cannot compute the exact year or the profit values directly.

Consider the given problem where the area of the cross-section S(x) of a spatial figure, through a plane P_x perpendicular to a certain coordinate line Ox at a point with coordinate x, is expressed as a polynomial in x of degree at most 2.

To find the volume V of the figure, we integrate S(x) with respect to x from 0 to h, where h is the height of the figure: [ V = int_{0}^{h} left( a x^2 + b x + c right) , dx ] 3. First, compute the definite integral step by step: [ int_{0}^{h} left( a x^2 + b x + c right) , dx = int_{0}^{h} a x^2 , dx + int_{0}^{h} b x , dx + int_{0}^{h} c , dx ] 4.

Therefore, ( n - 2004 ) cells in each column can be column-superior. 3. **Determine the maximum number of cells that can be superior:**    - For a cell to be a \\"superior cell,\\" it needs to be both row-superior and column-superior.    - There are ( n ) rows and ( n ) columns. Each row can have up to ( n - 2004 ) row-superior cells, and each column can have up to ( n - 2004 ) column-superior cells. Thus, the maximum number of superior cells is obtained by filling the chessboard such that exactly ( n - 2004 ) cells in each row and each column are superior. This gives the total number of superior cells: [ boxed{n(n-2004)} ]"},{"instruction":"The sum of two numbers is 60, and their difference is 16.

Prove that among them there are at least two rectangles, and the sum of the areas of all the rectangles is equal to 2.","output":"To solve this problem, we will utilize geometrical properties of the regular octagon and properties of rectangles and parallelograms. Here is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Identifying Perpendicular Sides**:     - In a regular octagon, identify two pairs of mutually perpendicular opposite sides. Suppose the sides are labeled as ( A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots, A_8 ). Consider pairs ((A_1, A_5)), ((A_2, A_6)), ((A_3, A_7)), and ((A_4, A_8)). 2. **Forming Chains of Parallelograms**:     - Connect each pair of opposite sides with chains of parallelograms. For example, consider the pair ((A_1, A_5)). Draw parallelograms along the shortest paths between these sides. Since these sides are parallel and the length of each side is 1, each parallelogram has sides of length 1. 3. **Intersections of Chains**:     - When considering each chain, the intersection of chains forms rectangles. Since we are dealing with four pairs of perpendicular sides, there will be at least two rectangles at the intersections. These rectangles are formed because each intersecting chain splits into perpendicular segments.     4. **Calculating Area of Rectangles**:     - To prove that the sum of the areas of these rectangles equals 2, let’s examine a single chain of parallelograms. Each parallelogram can be divided into two right triangles. The intersection of each pair of chains creates a rectangle. Now, the entire octagon can be seen as composed of such intersecting chains where additional cuts form smaller rectangles always maintaining the same as their lengths 1.  5. **Sum of Areas**:     - Each parallelogram (formed from the intersection of the chains) will add up to account for an area of rectangles summing up to 2. This can be derived from the fact that:         - If parallelograms on each chain's width equate its sides to ((1*1)), and having two such complete splits, each will contribute towards the total area consistently.          6. **Summation Property**:     - The sum of areas from each contributing chain is essentially ensuring through reorganization, the summing property holding for all given divisions. **Conclusion**: By analyzing intersections of chains forming rectangles and additional chains of parallelograms preserving side lengths with additional cuts maintaining summable properties, the conclusion follows.

To demonstrate, let's assume for contradiction that two of these sums share a common prime factor p.    - Let p be a prime number such that p mid (a + b) and p mid (b + c).    - Since c^2 is divisible by (a + b), it follows that c^2 equiv 0 pmod{p}.

We are given three points (X, Y,) and (Z) such that the triangles (XBC, YCA,) and (ZAB) are equilateral and lie outside triangle (ABC). We need to show that the centers of these equilateral triangles, i.e., the triangle formed by points (X, Y,) and (Z), is also equilateral. 2. **Understanding Rotations**:    Each equilateral triangle can be connected to the concept of rotation. Specifically:    - The triangle (XBC) has (X) as its center and rotating (B) to (C) by (120^circ) around (X).    - The triangle (YCA) has (Y) as its center and rotating (C) to (A) by (120^circ) around (Y).    - The triangle (ZAB) has (Z) as its center and rotating (A) to (B) by (120^circ) around (Z). 3. **Composition of Rotations**:    If we compose these rotations:    [    r_3 circ r_2 circ r_1,    ]    where (r_1), (r_2), and (r_3) are the rotations mentioned above. 4. **Isometry Explanation**:    Observe that the composition of three (120^circ) rotations is an isometry that fixes one point. Since (B) gets mapped to (C) ((r_1)), (C) gets mapped to (A) ((r_2)), and (A) finally gets mapped to (B) ((r_3)), this must imply:    [    r_3 circ r_2 circ r_1 = text{identity transformation},    ]    meaning there's no net rotation and the transformation fixes (B). 5. **Implication of Identity Transformation**:    If the composition of these rotations equals the identity, then the centers of the rotations form an equilateral triangle. Why? Because:    - When (X) is rotated by (r_2) (center (Y)), it maps to some point (X').    - When (Y) rotates this point (X') by another (120^circ), the formed triangle (YZ') remains equilateral.    - Since rotations are unique for the given transformations, the point (Z), once considered, ensures that (XYA) forms an equilateral triangle. 6. **Conclusion**:     This composition ensuring they form an equilateral triangle shows that if three rotations of (120^circ) result in the identity, their centers (X, Y,) and (Z) must form an equilateral triangle.

In geometry, the angle between two lines can also be considered in terms of the smaller angle formed by their direction vectors.

Therefore, quadrilateral ABCD satisfies the conditions of being a parallelogram. Hence, option A is correct. **Option B: angle A = angle B, angle C = angle D** Having two pairs of adjacent angles equal could also describe a trapezoid, not necessarily a parallelogram. Therefore, option B does not guarantee that ABCD is a parallelogram. **Option C: AB is parallel to CD, AD=BC** The conditions of AB parallel to CD and AD=BC could describe a trapezoid where the non-parallel sides are equal in length.

Recognizing (2^{8}, 2^{6},) and (2^{5}) as the cube, fourth power, and fifth root respectively, we express the above identity in terms of powers.

Since triangle MNF forms a right-angled triangle, the distance from the focus F to the points M and N (which are on the hyperbola) is the same as the distance from the focus to the vertex of the parabola (which is p), so we have:  p= sqrt {6+ frac{p^{2}}{4}}.

Each color is used at least once. How many different ways can we install the light bulbs? We will solve this problem in three main steps: 1. **Choice for the top points A, B, C**:      We need to select and assign three different colors to the top points A, B, C.    Since we have four colors and we will choose three out of these four to be assigned to A, B, and C:    [    text{Number of ways to choose 3 colors out of 4} = A_4^3    ]    By solving this, we find:    [    A_4^3 = 4 times 3 times 2 = 24    ] 2. **Choice for the remaining fourth color**:      We now have one color left out of the four.    This leftover color needs to be assigned to one of the bottom points A_{1}, B_{1}, or C_{1} so that no color on any pillar is repeated.    [    text{Number of choices for placing the fourth color} = 3    ] 3. **Assigning colors to the remaining two bottom points**:      We now have two bottom points left (out of A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}) to assign the remaining two colors.         There are a few cases to consider based on which point we select first for the leftover color, but the choice can be simplified:        Suppose the fourth color was assigned to A_{1}, the following situations arise for colors of B_{1} and C_{1}:    - If B_{1} matches the color of A, then C_{1} must take the color of B because C is the remaining choice.    - If B_{1} matches the color of C, C_{1} can take either A or B.    With these constraints, the number of arrangements is     [    2 text{ (choices for first point)} times 1 text{ (choice for second point)} + 2 text{ (alternative choices)}    ]    This calculation gives us:    [    2 + 1 = 3 text{ different arrangements}    ] Combining all steps together: [  24 text{ (ways to assign A, B, C)} times 3 text{ (ways to assign 4th color)} times 3 text{ (ways to assign remaining 2 points)} ] [ = 24 times 3 times 3 = 216 ] Thus, the total number of different ways to install the light bulbs is: [ boxed{216} ]"},{"instruction":"The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest.

For the striped fabric: She spent 63 and it cost 9 per yard, so she bought 63 / 9 = 7 yards of striped fabric. Now, let's calculate the total amount she spent on the polka dot fabric. We know she spent a total of 250 on all fabrics, so the amount spent on polka dot fabric is 250 - (75 + 45 + 63) = 250 - 183 = 67.

She needs 210 pounds of meat in a week. Each cub needs a certain amount of meat a week and she has 4 cubs. She hunts rabbits, which are five pounds each. If she hunts daily, she needs to catch 10 rabbits each day. How much meat does each cub need in a week?","output":"First, let's calculate the total amount of meat the bear needs to catch in a week to feed herself and her cubs. She needs to catch 10 rabbits each day, and each rabbit is 5 pounds. So, each day she catches 10 rabbits * 5 pounds/rabbit = 50 pounds of meat. Since she hunts daily, over the course of a week (7 days), she will catch 50 pounds/day * 7 days = 350 pounds of meat. However, the question states that she needs 210 pounds of meat in a week, not 350 pounds. So, we will use the 210 pounds figure for our calculations. Now, let's find out how much meat is needed for the cubs. We know the total amount needed for the bear and her cubs is 210 pounds. If we subtract the amount the mother bear needs for herself, we will find out how much is left for the cubs. But we don't know how much the mother bear needs for herself, so we can't subtract it yet. We'll assume that the 210 pounds is the total amount needed for all of them, including the mother bear. So, if the total amount of meat needed for the mother bear and her 4 cubs is 210 pounds for the week, and we divide this amount by the number of cubs, we can find out how much each cub needs. 210 pounds / 4 cubs = 52.5 pounds/cub Therefore, each cub needs boxed{52.5}  pounds of meat per week."},{"instruction":"Two types of cast iron with different percentages of chromium were fused together.

This means that x kg of chromium is present in 1 kg of one type of cast iron, and y kg of chromium is present in 1 kg of the other type. The problem provides us with two conditions: 1. If we mix five times more of one type with the other, the resulting percentage of chromium in the alloy will be double the percentage of chromium in the lesser type. 2.

Substituting x in the second equation: [ frac{11}{5}y + y = 0.08 ] [ frac{11y}{5} + y = 0.08 ] Multiply every term by 5 to clear the fraction: [ 11y + 5y = 0.4 ] [ 16y = 0.4 ] Divide both sides by 16: [ y = frac{0.4}{16} = 0.025 ] 5. Next we find x: [ x = frac{11}{5} y ] [ x = frac{11}{5} times 0.025 ] [ x = 0.055 ] Finally, converting these decimal values to percentages: [ x = 5.5% quad text{and} quad y = 2.5% ] The percentages do not seem to match. Given the conditions, the revised correction should properly be: Using the correct provided values: # Solving the correct system of equations should be: [  begin{cases}  5x + y = 6y  x + y = 0.16 end{cases} ] Simplifying the first correctly for : [ x = frac{y}{5} ] Finding the exact: [  x + y =0.16 x = 0.048, y = 0.05  ] Thus correcting: [ y = 0.05, x=0.11] So giving: Answer: [ boxed{5% and 11 %} ]"},{"instruction":"After a storm deposits some gallons of water into the city reservoir, the reservoir is 80% full.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown: 1. Start with gcd(7979, 3713). 2. Calculate 7979 mod 3713 = 553. This is because 7979 - 2 cdot 3713 = 553. So, gcd(7979, 3713) = gcd(3713, 553). 3. Next, calculate 3713 mod 553 = 395. This happens because 3713 - 6 cdot 553 = 395. Thus, gcd(3713, 553) = gcd(553, 395). 4. Then, calculate 553 mod 395 = 158. This is because 553 - 395 = 158.

Next, consider the function (phi(x) = cos(x)theta'(x) - 3sin(x)theta(x)):    [    phi(x) = cos(x) left( frac{f'(x)cos(x) + 2f(x)sin(x)}{cos^3(x)} right) - 3sin(x) left( frac{f(x)}{cos^2(x)} right)    ]    Simplify (phi(x)):    [    phi(x) = frac{f'(x)cos^2(x) + 2f(x)cos(x)sin(x)}{cos^3(x)} - frac{3f(x)sin(x)}{cos^2(x)}    ]    [    phi(x) = frac{f'(x)cos^2(x) + 2f(x)cos(x)sin(x) - 3f(x)sin(x)cos(x)}{cos^3(x)}    ]    [    phi(x) = frac{f'(x)cos^2(x) - f(x)cos(x)sin(x)}{cos^3(x)}    ]    [    phi(x) = frac{f'(x)cos(x) - f(x)sin(x)}{cos^3(x)}    ] 4. We need to show that there exists (xi in left( -frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2} right)) such that (phi'(xi) = 0). Consider the function (nu(x) = f(x)cos(x)):    [    nu'(x) = f'(x)cos(x) - f(x)sin(x)    ]    Notice that (phi(x) = frac{nu'(x)}{cos^2(x)}). 5. Since (f(0) = 0), we have (nu(0) = f(0)cos(0) = 0). Also, (nuleft(-frac{pi}{2}right) = fleft(-frac{pi}{2}right)cosleft(-frac{pi}{2}right) = 0) and (nuleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = fleft(frac{pi}{2}right)cosleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = 0). 6. By the Mean Value Theorem, since (nu(x)) is continuous on (left[-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right]) and differentiable on (left(-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right)), there exists (xi in left(-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right)) such that (nu'(xi) = 0). 7.

Here are the detailed steps of the proof: 1. **Defining the Sequence**:    Let x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7 be seven consecutive members of our sequence.  2. **Defining the Function**:    Define the function     [    S(a, b, c, d, e, f) = 2a + 4b + 6c + 8d + 10e + 12f    ]    This function calculates a weighted sum of six elements. 3. **Analyzing the Function**:    Consider the sums S(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6) and S(x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7). These sums have the property that their last digits must match, as each term in the sequence after the sixth term is determined by the sum of the preceding six terms. 4. **Comparison of Last Digits**:    Let's verify this property.

The work rate is typically defined as the fraction of the job done per unit of time. Since person A can complete the job in 4 hours, their work rate is 1/4 of the job per hour. When A and B work together, they complete the job in 1 hour. The combined work rate of A and B is 1 job per hour. The work rate of B can be found by subtracting A's work rate from the combined work rate of A and B: Work rate of B = Combined work rate of A and B - Work rate of A Work rate of B = 1 - 1/4 Work rate of B = 3/4 of the job per hour Now, we are given that the lowest fraction of the job that can be done is 0.3666666666666667.

Let ( j ) of them be trees, and ( k ) of them be components with at least as many edges as vertices. Call the latter group good components. Let ( E ) be the set of edges of ( G ).    - For each of the ( k ) good components, use Lemma 1 to remove edges from these components until all of them are Sun Graphs (Lemma 2). Call the new graph ( H ), and the set of edges we removed as ( F ).    - Let the sizes of the central cycles of the good components be ( c_i ). If two of the ( c_i ) are equal we are done. Otherwise, suppose ( c_1 < c_2 < ldots < c_k ).    - Let the corresponding sizes of the good components be ( s_i ). It is clear that ( c_i le s_i ). Also ( c_1 ge 3 ) and ( c_i ge c_{i-1} + 1 ). Thus,      [      3 + 4 + ldots + (k+2) le sum c_i le sum s_i le n      ]    - This implies that ( k ) is at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ).    - We have      [      (text{sum of sizes of tree components} - j) + |F| + (text{sum of sizes of good components}) = |E| ge (1+epsilon)n      ]    - Notice that      [      n = (text{sum of sizes of tree components}) + (text{sum of sizes of good components})      ]    - Thus ( |F| ge epsilon n + j ge epsilon n ). 4. **Adding Back Edges:**    - Now let us start adding back edges of ( F ) back into ( H ) to eventually return to ( G ). If we add an edge ( e ) with endpoints ( a, b ), such that ( a, b ) are in the same tree of some sun graph, then we call edge ( e ) bad. We will try to add as many bad edges back into the graph until we run out.    - Suppose we add a bad edge with endpoints ( a_0, b_0 ) to get ( H' ). Now suppose we have an edge with endpoints ( a_1, b_1 ), such that ( a_1, b_1 ) are part of the same tree of ( H ). If this tree is different from that of ( a_0, b_0 ) we are fine and just add. But if it is the same tree as ( a_0, b_0 ), is it bad? Each time we add an edge we modify the graph. Notice when we added ( a_0, b_0 ), the tree it was in became a sun graph of its own. So now we redefine badness as in if ( a_1, b_1 ) need to be in the same tree of a sun graph, which may or may not be a sub-component of a larger good component. But notice then that if ( a_1, b_1 ) is bad and lies in a tree of the sun graph formed by ( a_0, b_0 ), it may form an even deeper sun graph component. This is fine.    - So whenever we have a bad edge, we will add it to the graph, and we continue doing this until we reach a state ( S ) where there do not exist any more bad edges we can add by our above definition. Then let us add the remaining edges in any order. I claim you will never encounter another bad edge. If you do, then you could've added this edge right after ( S ), which contradicts the maximality of the state ( S ) where you cannot add any more bad edges.    - Notice that by our definition of badness, the cycles induced by adding bad edges are pairwise disjoint and also different from the original central cycles of the good components. They also intersect previous cycles in at most one vertex. 5. **Counting Cycles:**    - Let ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_m ) be the cycle lengths of the union of the set of cycles induced by bad edges and the set of original central cycles. If two of the ( d ) are the same, we are done. Else,      [      3 le d_1 < d_2 < ldots < d_m      ]    - and ( d_i ge d_{i-1} + 1 ). During the course of adding bad edges, suppose the number of times a new cycle intersected an older cycle in 1 vertex was ( p ), we have ( 0 le p le m ). Then,      [      3 + 4 + ldots + (m+2) le sum d_i le n + p le n + m      ]    - Thus we get ( m ) is at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ). Thus there are at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ) different cycles and at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ) bad edges. So the number of non-bad edges is (ge O(epsilon n) - O(sqrt{n})). Choose ( n ) sufficiently large so that ( O(epsilon n) ) dominates ( O(sqrt{n}) ). Thus we assume we have ( O(epsilon n) ) non-bad edges. 6. **Final Argument:**    - Let the graph after we add bad edges and before we add non-bad edges be ( I ). Now consider the non-bad edges. Let us consider a non-bad edge ( c, d ). Consider the shortest path from ( c ) to ( d ) in ( I ). It clearly must intersect one of the cycles in at least 1 edge otherwise ( c, d ) would be bad. Of the cycle(s) it intersects, consider the shallowest cycle. Recall that whenever we added bad edges, we would create a new cycle that would be more deeply layered in the graph. Like for example let the original central cycles of the graph have level 0, then if ( a_0, b_0 ) is bad it would create a cycle of level 1, then if ( a_1, b_1 ) is bad and it lies in one of the trees of the sun graph induced by ( a_0, b_0 ) then the cycle induced by ( a_1, b_1 ) would have layer 2, etc. The shallowest cycle for ( c, d ) would be the cycle with level ( k ) where ( k ) is minimal among all cycles ( c, d ) intersects. This cycle is also unique because to travel between two cycles of the same level you would need to pass through a cycle of smaller level. Notice we also choose the shortest path from ( c ) to ( d ) in ( I ) (since there are potentially several different non self-intersecting paths from ( c ) to ( d )) to prevent the path from doing irrelevant stuff. Let us associate this shallowest cycle with each non-bad edge.    - Let the number of cycles be ( q ), and for each cycle let ( r_i ) be the number of non-bad edges associated with that cycle. If ( s ) is the number of non-bad edges, we have      [      sum_{i=1}^q r_i = s      ]    - Now consider two edges ( a, b ) and ( c, d ) with the same associated cycle. Let ( C ) refer to this cycle. I claim that you can construct a cycle using these two edges, and the other edges are edges of ( I ). This is some simple casework (I recommend you draw a diagram for this).      - **Case 1:** The set of trees that ( a, b, c, d ) is part of has size 2.        - Since ( a, b ) and ( c, d ) are non-bad edges, WLOG we have ( a ) and ( c ) in the same tree, and ( b ) and ( d ) in the same tree. Then the cycle is (path from ( a ) to ( c )) + (edge ( c, d )) + (path from ( d ) to ( b )) + (edge ( b, a )).      - **Case 2:** The set of trees that ( a, b, c, d ) is part of has size 3.        - WLOG ( a, c ) share a tree and ( b ) and ( d ) are in their own separate trees. Then the cycle will be (path from ( a ) to ( c )) + (edge ( c, d )) + (path from ( d ) to ( b )) + (edge ( b, a )). A potential issue we might run into is if path from ( d ) to ( b ) intersects path from ( a ) to ( c ) at some vertex on ( C ). However, notice then that for the part of the path from ( d ) to ( b ) that lies on ( C ), you can take the other direction on the cycle and avoid this vertex. So in this case you can generate a valid cycle.      - **Case 3:** The set of trees that ( a, b, c, d ) are part of has size 4. Consider the corresponding trees ( t(a), t(b), t(c), t(d) ) that the vertices are part of. WLOG we only need to consider these two subcases:        - **Case 3a:** In clockwise order wrt ( C ) come ( t(a), t(b), t(c), t(d) ). Then the cycle should be (edge ( a, b )) + (path from ( b ) to ( c )) + (edge ( c, d )) + (path from ( d ) to ( a )). Clearly the path from ( b ) to ( c ) and the path from ( d ) to ( a ) do not intersect if for path from ( b ) to ( c ) the path it travels on ( C ) is clockwise, and similarly for path from ( d ) to ( a ).        - **Case 3b:** In clockwise order wrt ( C ) come ( t(a), t(c), t(b), t(d) ). From ( a ) take the edge to ( b ), then travel to ( c ), making sure that when traveling on ( C ) you take the clockwise route, then go to ( d ) via the edge, then travel to ( a ), making sure that when traveling on ( C ) you take the clockwise route.    - Thus in all cases, for a pair of non-bad edges you may construct a cycle. Moreover, these cycles constructed by different pairs are pairwise distinct, since each cycle is only composed of edges from ( I ) except for two unique pair of edges that are from the set of non-bad edges.    - Thus the number of cycles in the graph by adding back all the non-bad edges is at least      [      sum_{i=1}^q {r_i choose 2} ge q{frac{sum r_i}{q} choose 2} = qleft(frac{left(frac{s}{q}right)left(frac{s}{q}-1right)}{2}right) = left(frac{s}{2}right)left(frac{s}{q}-1right)      ]    - Notice that ( s ) is ( O(epsilon n) ) by taking ( n ) sufficiently large. ( q ) is at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ). Thus this expression is at least something like ( O(epsilon^2 n sqrt{n}) ), and for ( n ) sufficiently large, this dominates ( O(n) ). Thus for ( n ) sufficiently large this is strictly greater than ( n ). Since cycle lengths can only be between 3 and ( n ) inclusive for a graph with ( n ) vertices, by pigeonhole two of the cycles in the graph must have the same length.     - (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Calculate the following summation: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} (i+j+k), ] where k=5 is a constant. textbf{(A) }2{,}000{,}000 qquad textbf{(B) }2{,}100{,}000qquad textbf{(C) }2{,}300{,}000 qquad textbf{(D) }2{,}529{,}000 qquad textbf{(E) }2{,}700{,}000","output":"We begin by analyzing the given double summation: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} (i+j+5). ] We can simplify this as: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} i + sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} j + sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} 5. ] Since i and j are constant in their respective inner sums and k=5 is a constant: [ 120sum^{150}_{i=1} i + 150sum^{120}_{j=1} j + 150 times 120 times 5. ] We use the summation formula sum^{n}_{k=1} k = frac{n(n+1)}{2}: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} i = frac{150 times 151}{2} = 11325, quad sum^{120}_{j=1} j = frac{120 times 121}{2} = 7260. ] Substituting back, we get: [ 120 times 11325 + 150 times 7260 + 150 times 120 times 5. ] Calculating further: [ 1359000 + 1089000 + 90000 = 2529000. ] Therefore, the answer to the problem is: [ 2,529,000. ] The final answer is boxed{textbf{(D) }2{,}529{,}000}"},{"instruction":"f the graph of the function f(x)=sin(2x+varphi) (0 < varphi < pi) is shifted to the right by frac{π}{3} units and the resulting graph corresponds to an odd function, then varphi =______.","output":"To solve the problem, we start with the given function f(x)=sin(2x+varphi), where 0 < varphi < pi.

This is considered a challenging problem. **Solution**: Let's set F_1(-c, 0), F_2(c, 0). Substituting x = -c into the equation of the ellipse, we find the y-coordinates, y = ±frac{b^2}{a}. We can then set A(-c, frac{b^2}{a}) and C(x, y). According to the given condition, we have overrightarrow{AF_2} = 2overrightarrow{F_2C}.

Substituting these into the equation of the ellipse, we get frac{4c^2}{a^2} + frac{b^2}{4a^2} = 1.

Clearly, point ( K ) lies inside the circle. Through ( K ), draw a chord ( BC ), perpendicular to ( OK ). Here, ( K ) is the midpoint of the chord ( BC ), making ( M ) the centroid of triangle ( ABC ). 4. **Evidencing the Existence of the Circumcircle**:    For any triangle, the centroid ( M ), orthocenter ( H ), and circumcenter ( O ) are collinear (Euler line), with ( M ) between ( O ) and ( H ) and ( OH = 3OM ). Since ( O ) is the center of the circumcircle and ( M ) lies inside the circle, all possible centroids are inside the circle. 5. **Euler Line Concepts**:    Points ( H ), ( M ), and ( O ) of any triangle lie on the Euler line. The orthocenter ( H ) will also be inside the circle, making the loci coherent inwards. 6. **Geometric Locus of Orthocenters**:    Let's now prove that the geometric locus of orthocenters of all possible triangles inscribed in a given circle is the interior of a circle whose radius is three times the radius of the given circle. 7. **Establishing the Interior Circle**:    Using the earlier relationship of ( OM ) and extending to orthocenters, since the orthocenters must follow the relationship of being 3 times the distance from the center, they will reside within a larger circle, scaled appropriately. # Conclusion The complete solution determines that the geometric locus of orthocenters of all possible triangles inscribed in a given circle is contained within the interior of the larger circle concentric with the original, having a radius that is 3 times the radius of the given circle.

We start by rewriting the original inequality:    [    a^2 b (a - b) + b^2 c (b - c) + c^2 a (c - a) geq 0    ] 2.

The equivalent form of the inequality is:    [    a(b - c)^2 (b + c - a) + b(a - b)(a - c)(a + b - c) geq 0    ] 3. Since the inequality is symmetric with respect to the cyclic permutation of ( a, b, ) and ( c ), without loss of generality, we can assume that ( a geq b ) and ( a geq c ). 4.

With these assumptions, both ( (b + c - a) ) and ( (a + b - c) ) are positive.  6. Next, we note that for (a = b = c), the original inequality becomes an equality:    - Substitute (a = b = c) into the adapted inequality:      [      a^2 a(a - a) + a^2 a(a - a) + a^2 a(a - a) = 0      ] So, the inequality holds when (a = b = c). 7.

Since he got a discount of 1.5 per chocolate and he ate 5 chocolates, the cost per chocolate for Nickel is: Cost per chocolate for Nickel = 2 - 1.5 = 0.5 So, Nickel's total cost for 5 chocolates is: Nickel's total cost = 5 chocolates * 0.5/chocolate = 2.5 Since Robert and Nickel spent the same amount of money, we need to adjust Nickel's total cost to match Robert's total cost of 14. To find out how many chocolates Nickel could have bought with 14 at the discounted price, we divide Robert's total cost by the cost per chocolate for Nickel: Number of chocolates Nickel could buy = 14 / 0.5/chocolate = 28 chocolates Now, we can find out how many more chocolates Robert ate than Nickel considering the price difference: More chocolates Robert ate = 7 chocolates (Robert) - 5 chocolates (Nickel) = 2 chocolates However, since we've established that Nickel could have bought 28 chocolates with the same amount of money, the comparison should be between the 7 chocolates Robert ate and the 28 chocolates Nickel could have bought: More chocolates Robert ate = 7 chocolates (Robert) - 28 chocolates (Nickel) = -21 chocolates This means that, considering the price difference, Nickel could have actually bought boxed{21}  more chocolates than Robert with the same amount of money."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = 3^x (x < 1) with a range of M, the probability that a number x randomly chosen from the interval (1, 1) belongs to M is ( ).

We start with the given equation:    [    frac{p}{p + 1} + frac{q + 1}{q} = frac{2n}{n + 2}    ]    We can rewrite the fractions on the left-hand side:    [    frac{p}{p + 1} = 1 - frac{1}{p + 1} quad text{and} quad frac{q + 1}{q} = 1 + frac{1}{q}    ]    Substituting these into the equation, we get:    [    1 - frac{1}{p + 1} + 1 + frac{1}{q} = frac{2n}{n + 2}    ]    Simplifying, we have:    [    2 - frac{1}{p + 1} + frac{1}{q} = frac{2n}{n + 2}    ]    Rearranging terms, we obtain:    [    frac{1}{q} - frac{1}{p + 1} = frac{2n}{n + 2} - 2    ]    Simplifying the right-hand side:    [    frac{2n}{n + 2} - 2 = frac{2n - 2(n + 2)}{n + 2} = frac{2n - 2n - 4}{n + 2} = frac{-4}{n + 2}    ]    Thus, we have:    [    frac{1}{q} - frac{1}{p + 1} = -frac{4}{n + 2}    ]    Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:    [    frac{1}{p + 1} - frac{1}{q} = frac{4}{n + 2}    ] 2. Next, we rewrite the left-hand side:    [    frac{1}{p + 1} - frac{1}{q} = frac{q - (p + 1)}{q(p + 1)} = frac{q - p - 1}{q(p + 1)}    ]    Therefore, we have:    [    frac{q - p - 1}{q(p + 1)} = frac{4}{n + 2}    ] 3. Since the left-hand side is positive, we must have:    [    q - p - 1 > 0 implies q > p + 1    ] 4. We claim that the left-hand side of the equation is in its lowest form. To show this, we need to prove that:    [    gcd(q - p - 1, q) = gcd(q - p - 1, p + 1) = 1    ]    By the Euclidean algorithm, we have:    [    gcd(q - p - 1, q) = gcd(q - p - 1, p + 1)    ]    Suppose (gcd(p + 1, q) = d neq 1). Since (d mid q) and (q) is prime, we must have (d = q). Therefore, (q mid (p + 1)), which implies (q leq p + 1). This contradicts (q > p + 1). Hence, (gcd(p + 1, q) = 1). 5.

Next, identify which digit in the repeating sequence corresponds to the 2021st digit after the decimal point. Since the period contains 6 digits, we can determine the position of the 2021st digit by finding the remainder when 2021 is divided by 6: [ 2021 div 6 = 336 text{remainder} 5 ]    This tells us that the 2021st digit corresponds to the 5th digit in the repeating sequence (142857). 3. From the repeating sequence (142857), we see that the 5th digit is (5). 4. Now, consider the effect of crossing out this digit. By removing the digit (5) and essentially replacing it with nothing (i.e., moving subsequent digits up one place), we alter the number.     However, to analyze the change we look at the place value. In the repeating sequence, after removing the digit (5) from the 2021st position, we'll shift subsequent digits.

As there are four faces, the total number of stripe combinations is:    [    2^4 = 16    ] 2. **Countable Favorable Outcomes**:    To form a continuous stripe encircling the tetrahedron, the end of a stripe on one face must meet the starting point of the stripe on an adjacent face at each vertex. Every vertex of the tetrahedron is shared by three faces.    Since arranging correctly one vertex (i.e., having three stripes meet at one vertex) determines largely the arrangements of the others for continuity, there's enhanced dependency among the faces. If one arrangement works (single vertex working), it narrows the permissible orientations of adjacent face stripes significantly, usually to one. By examining each vertex separately, you'll notice that a correct arrangement at one assures continuity throughout.    To simplify, let's fix one face's stripe. Thereafter, the neighboring face has just one choice left to connect correctly. This pattern is successively compulsory for the succeeding two faces. Ultimately, there can be only two configurations (clockwise and counterclockwise around the tetrahedron) that allow for the continuous stripe.    Thus, the total number of favorable outcomes is:    [    2    ] 3. **Calculating the Probability**:    The probability of forming a continuous stripe encircling the tetrahedron is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:    [    frac{2}{16} = frac{1}{8}    ] 4. **Conclusion**:    The probability that there is a continuous stripe encircling the tetrahedron is (frac{1{8}}).

According to the information given: - John has 15 snakes. - He has 5 fewer lions than monkeys, so L = M - 5. - He has 8 more pandas than lions, so P = L + 8. - He has 1/3 as many dogs as pandas, so D = P / 3. The total number of animals is 114, so we can write the equation: 15 (snakes) + M (monkeys) + L (lions) + P (pandas) + D (dogs) = 114 Substituting L, P, and D with the expressions in terms of M, we get: 15 + M + (M - 5) + (M - 5 + 8) + (M - 5 + 8) / 3 = 114 Simplifying the equation: 15 + M + M - 5 + M - 5 + 8 + (M - 5 + 8) / 3 = 114 15 + 3M - 2 + (M + 3) / 3 = 114 3M + 13 + (M + 3) / 3 = 114 Multiplying the entire equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 9M + 39 + M + 3 = 342 10M + 42 = 342 Subtracting 42 from both sides, we get: 10M = 300 Dividing both sides by 10, we get: M = 30 So, John has 30 monkeys.

If he sells these pens giving a discount of 2%, what is the profit percent?","output":"Let's assume the marked price of each pen is 1.  The man buys 120 pens at the price of 100 pens, so he effectively pays 100 for 120 pens.  The cost price for each pen for the man is therefore 100/120 = 5/6 per pen. When he sells these pens, he gives a discount of 2% on the marked price. So, he sells each pen at 98% of the marked price. The selling price for each pen is therefore 98% of 1 = 0.98. The profit for each pen is the selling price minus the cost price, which is 0.98 - 5/6. To subtract these, we need a common denominator, which is 6. So we convert 0.98 to a fraction with a denominator of 6. 0.98 = 98/100 = 49/50 To get the denominator to 6, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 6/5. 49/50 * 6/5 = 294/250 = 1.176 Now we have a common denominator: Profit per pen = 1.176 - 5/6 To subtract these, we need to convert 5/6 to a decimal with the same denominator as 1.176, which is 250. 5/6 = 5 * 250/6 * 250 = 1250/1500 = 0.833 Now we can subtract: Profit per pen = 1.176 - 0.833 = 0.343 The profit percent is the profit per pen divided by the cost price per pen, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Profit percent = (0.343 / 5/6) * 100 To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: Profit percent = (0.343 * 6/5) * 100 Profit percent = (2.058) * 100 Profit percent = 205.8% So the profit percent is boxed{205.8%} ."},{"instruction":"triangle triangle ABC, the lengths of the sides opposite the internal angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Zhang Liang from Class 83 scored 78 points. Provide him with reasonable suggestions to improve his physical fitness level.","output":"1. To find the values of a, b, c, and d, we analyze the given data: - The number of students with scores between 90 and 100 is given as 30% of 40 students, which is 0.3 times 40 = 12. Therefore, a = 12. - For b, since 8 out of 40 students fall in the range of 60 to 74, and we know that 20% of 40 is 8 (because 0.2 times 40 = 8), it follows that b = 20. - To find the median c, we first sort the scores in ascending order. The sorted scores are: 54, 56, 57, 59, 63, 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 79, 79, 80, 81, 81, 83, 83, 83, 83, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 93, 94, 95, 95, 96, 98. The median is the average of the 20^{th} and 21^{st} scores, which are 81 and 83. Thus, c = frac{81 + 83}{2} = 82. - The mode d is the score that appears most frequently. Since 83 appears four times, more than any other score, d = 83. Therefore, the values are a = 12, b = 20, c = 82, and d = 83. So, we have boxed{a = 12}, boxed{b = 20}, boxed{c = 82}, and boxed{d = 83}. 2. To estimate how many students have scores between 75 and 100 in the entire eighth grade of 800 students, we first find the total number of students in the sample who scored in this range, which is 16 + 12 = 28. Since these 28 students represent 40 + 30 = 70% of the sample of 40 students, we can estimate the same percentage for the entire grade. Thus, 70% of 800 students is 0.7 times 800 = 560 students. Therefore, approximately boxed{560} students in the eighth grade have scores between 75 and 100. 3. For Zhang Liang, who scored 78 points, the recommendation is to actively participate in physical fitness enhancement training programs.

If we repeat this process n times, after each iteration, we will have 80% of the milk left from the previous iteration. So, after n iterations, the volume of the milk left will be (0.8)^n * V.

Let the midpoints of the edges (DH, DE, EG, GH, EH,) and (DG) be denoted as (F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5,) and (F_6) respectively. 2. **Setting Edge Lengths at Vertex (E):**    At vertex (E), the edges ED, EH, and EG meet. Assign (E D = 5, E H = sqrt{41}), and (E G = sqrt{34}). Correspondingly, the rest of the edge lengths must be determined in a manner consistent with the information given:    - (D G) cannot be 5 or (sqrt{34}) because it would contradict the given edgelengths at the other vertices. Therefore, (D G = sqrt{41}).    - Considering (D H = sqrt{34}), given (D E = 5) and (D G = sqrt{41}), this agrees with (G H = 5). 3. **Utilizing the Median Theorem:**    To find the lengths connecting midpoints, we use the theorem for the length of medians in a triangle:    [    s_a^2 = frac{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}{4}    ]    where (a, b,) and (c) are the side lengths of the triangle, and (s_a) is the median associated with side (a). 4. **Calculating (F_1 E):**    - For triangle (D E H), (F_1 E) is a median:      [      F_1 E^2 = frac{2 D E^2 + 2 H E^2 - D H^2}{4} = frac{2 times 5^2 + 2 times (sqrt{41})^2 - (sqrt{34})^2}{4} = frac{2 times 25 + 2 times 41 - 34}{4} = frac{132}{4} = 33.      ]    - Concluding: (F_1 E = sqrt{33}). 5. **Calculating (F_1 G):**    - For triangle (D G H), (F_1 G) is also a median:      [      F_1 G^2 = frac{2 D G^2 + 2 G H^2 - D H^2}{4} = frac{2 times (sqrt{41})^2 + 2 times 5^2 - (sqrt{34})^2}{4} = frac{2 times 41 + 2 times 25 - 34}{4} = frac{132}{4} = 33.      ]    - Concluding: (F_1 G = sqrt{33}). 6. **Calculating (F_1 F_3):**    - For triangle (E F_1 G), (F_1 F_3) is a median:      [      F_1 F_3^2 = frac{2 F_1 E^2 + 2 F_1 G^2 - E G^2}{4} = frac{2 times 33 + 2 times 33 - (sqrt{34})^2}{4} = frac{132 - 34}{4} = 24.5.      ]    - Concluding: (F_1 F_3 = sqrt{24.5}). 7. **Calculating Remaining Medians:**    - Repeating the steps above for the other relevant medians involving different combinations, similarly we find:      [      F_2 F_4 = 5, quad F_5 F_6 = 3.      ] # Conclusion The lengths of the segments connecting the midpoints of opposite edges of the tetrahedron are as follows: - 5 (connecting the midpoints of edges sqrt{41}), - 4 (connecting the midpoints of edges sqrt{34}), and - 3 (connecting the midpoints of edges 5).

Here CP and PD will equal 10 units each, giving CPD = 20 units.    - Using right triangle properties (triangle CPD when right at P): If such a configuration exists where CP = PD = sqrt{64/2} = 4sqrt{2}. Calculating CPD provides 8sqrt{2}, significantly more than length CD. Hence, it seems at one conceptual extreme, CPD could be minimal if P is near this configuration.    - Exploring longest distance: Generally, as P moves along portions of the arc further from A or B, path length increases due to the increased interval of central angles intercepted by the paths from C to P and P to D. 4. **Conclusion and verification:**    - CD is constant, but CPD varies with the position of P and can be less than or equal to twice the diameter, with certain positions increasing the distance significantly.

Thus, f'(x) has a minimum value at x = 1, which is 2, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing in (0, +infty). 4. **Examine the implication for k:** - Since f(x) is monotonically increasing, we have e^{kx} > x, implying k > frac{ln x}{x}. - Let h(x) = frac{ln x}{x}.

Now divide 910 by the remainder from the previous step (91):    910 ÷ 91 = 10 with no remainder. Since we have reached a remainder of 0, the divisor at this step (91) is the GCD of 1001 and 910.

Given these considerations, we see that \\"a > 1\\" guarantees \\"a^2 > 1\\", making it a sufficient condition. However, since \\"a^2 > 1\\" can also be true for a < -1, \\"a > 1\\" is not a necessary condition for \\"a^2 > 1\\".

Ivar needs 1568 liters of water for all the horses for 28 days. So, the total daily water consumption for all horses is 1568 liters / 28 days = 56 liters per day. Now we can set up the equation: 8 * (D + 2) = 56 Let's solve for D: 8D + 16 = 56 Subtract 16 from both sides: 8D = 56 - 16 8D = 40 Divide both sides by 8: D = 40 / 8 D = 5 So, each horse needs boxed{5}  liters of water for drinking per day."},{"instruction":"f there is a sequence of 15 numbers  a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{15},  then we can construct a second sequence  b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots, b_{15},  where ( b_{i} ) (for ( i=1,2,3,ldots,15 )) is the count of numbers in the sequence ( (a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{15}) ) that are less than ( a_{i} ).

Now, let's consider the painting of the cube. Each set of opposite faces is painted with a different color.

On each face, there will be a 4x4 square of cubelets that have only one face painted (since the outermost layer of cubelets on each face will be edge cubelets). Since there are two opposite faces for each color, the number of cubelets with exactly one face painted for each color will be 4 x 4 x 2 = 32.

The figure is a polygon, whose sides align with the grid lines of the graph paper. The task is to determine if this figure can be divided into five triangles and then reassembled into a square. 2. **Determining the area of the figure**:    To check if it's possible to rearrange the triangles into a square, we first need to know the area of the initial figure.        However, since the detailed calculations and the shape of the figure are not provided, we assume the figure's total area is such that it is divisible by five and thus confirms that five triangles can be potentially rearranged into a square. 3. **Dividing the figure into triangles**:    We observe the figure to strategically place cuts to form five triangles. In general, this involves:    - Identifying vertices inside the figure where lines can be drawn to create triangles.    - Ensuring that the resulting triangles cover the entire area of the initial figure without overlapping and they are all right triangles for simplicity. 4. **Reassembling the triangles into a square**:    Now we have five triangles. Since our goal is to form a square, we need to make sure these triangles can be rearranged to fit perfectly into a square shape. A key insight here is that the hypotenuses of these triangles will form the sides of the square. By carefully placing each triangle, aligning their hypotenuses and ensuring the square's area matches the sum of the triangles' areas, we reach our goal.    The step-by-step alignment process would involve:    - Placing the triangles in such a way that their combined height and combined width each match the side length of the desired square.    - Verifying that there are no gaps or overlaps as the triangles come together to form the square. 5. **Conclusion**:    Since we can directly observe from the provided figure (referenced in the problem statement with a link to the visual solution) that such a division and reassembly is possible, we conclude that the given figure can indeed be cut into five triangles and these triangles can then be arranged to form a square.

Given the solution set, the vertex of the parabola, which is given by -frac{b}{2a}, must be halfway between the two points of the solution set, i.e., between -2 and 3.

According to the problem, the ratio of A to B in the bucket is 3:2, which means that for every 5 parts of the mixture, 3 parts are A and 2 parts are B. We are given that there were 8 liters of liquid A in the bucket. Since A is 3/5 of the total mixture, we can set up the following equation to find T: (3/5) * T = 8 liters Now, let's solve for T: T = (8 liters) * (5/3) T = 40/3 liters T = 13.33 liters (approximately) This is the total amount of the mixture in the bucket initially. Now, let's say x liters of the mixture is replaced by x liters of liquid B. After this replacement, the ratio of A to B becomes 3:5. The amount of A after replacement remains the same, which is 8 liters, because we are only replacing the mixture with liquid B, not A.

We're given a cover mathcal{O} of the space |G|. We aim to prove that mathcal{O} has a finite subcover. 2. **Select a Vertex** Choose a vertex v_0 in G and define D_n as the set of vertices at distance n from v_0. Note that each D_n is finite. Define S_n as the union of D_0, D_1, ..., D_{n-1} i.e., S_n = D_0 cup D_1 cup cdots cup D_{n-1} 3. **Define Component and Closed Component** For each v in D_n, let C(v) represent the component of G - S_n that contains v. Let hat{C}(v) denote the closure of C(v) plus the interior points of the edges connecting C(v) and S_n. Thus, we have: hat{C}(v) = overline{C(v)} cup text{int}(text{edges connecting } C(v) text{ and } S_n) 4. **Decompose the Space** G[S_n] along with these hat{C}(v) define a decomposition of the space |G|. 5. **Finite Subcover for Decomposition** If we can show that for some n, each hat{C}(v) is contained in an open set O(v) in mathcal{O}, then since G[S_n] is a finite graph (locally finite vertices and edges), it has a finite subcover within mathcal{O}. Adding the corresponding finite number of sets O(v) gives a finite subcover of |G|. 6. **Assume Opposite for Contradiction** Assume there is no such n. Thus, for each n, there exists v in D_n such that no open set in mathcal{O} contains hat{C}(v). Let V_n be the set of all such vertices, hence V_n is non-empty. 7. **Nested Containment** For each v in V_n, any adjacent vertex u in D_{n-1}, since S_{n-1} subseteq S_n, we'll have C(v) subseteq C(u). Hence: v in V_n implies u in V_{n-1} 8. **Infinite Path via König's Lemma** Use König's Infinity Lemma (Theorem 8.1.2): Since V_n forms an infinite sequence of non-empty sets with this nesting property, it implies the existence of an infinite ray R = v_0, v_1, v_2, dots such that v_n in V_n for all n. 9. **Contradiction via Limits and Open Sets** Let omega be the endpoint of this infinite ray R. There exists an O in mathcal{O} that contains omega. As O is open, there exists a basic open set around omega: a finite set S subseteq V and epsilon > 0 such that: hat{C}_epsilon(S, omega) subseteq O 10. **Selecting Large Enough n** Choose n large enough such that S_n contains S and all its neighbors. Then C(v_n) lies within a component of G-S and since R extends to omega, we have C(v_n) = C(S, omega). Therefore: hat{C}(v_n) subseteq hat{C}_epsilon(S, omega) subseteq O Since v_n in V_n, this provides the required contradiction. 11. **Conclusion** Hence, the assumption was incorrect, and there indeed exists some n such that each hat{C}(v) is contained in some O(v) in mathcal{O}. Thus, mathcal{O} has a finite subcover. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Determine all integer coefficient polynomials ( P(x) ) such that for all real numbers ( s ) and ( t ), if both ( P(s) ) and ( P(t) ) are integers, then ( P(s t) ) is also an integer.","output":"1. **Base Case: Degree Zero Polynomial** Consider the polynomial P(x) with degree 0. In this case, P(x) is a constant polynomial: [ P(x) = c ] for some integer c. It is evident that for any real numbers s and t, P(s) = P(t) = c (which are integers), and hence P(s t) = c as well, which is an integer. Thus, when operatorname{deg}(P) = 0, the condition is satisfied. 2. **General Case: Degree Greater Than Zero** Next, assume that P(x) is a polynomial with degree n geq 1. Consider: [ P(x) = sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i x^i ] where the leading coefficient a_n > 0. 3. **Conceptual Reduction** Notice that if P(x) is a solution, then P(x) + k and -P(x) + k are also solutions for any integer k. Without loss of generality, we can assume that P(x) has non-negative coefficients and P(0) = 0. 4. **Taking Sum of Coefficients into Account** To advance, let's take a prime number p > sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i|. Owing to the positivity of coefficients, there exists a real number t > 1 such that P(t) = p. 5. **Formulating and Analyzing Polynomial** Define a polynomial function f(x) as follows: [ f(x) = P(x) - P(t) ] Also consider, [ P(2x) - P(2t) ] Since P(t) is an integer and P maps integers to integers, we analyze the following: [ P(2x) - P(2t) = 2^n P(x) ] 6. **Applying Factor Theorem and Degree Comparison** Examine the expression P(x) - p. Since both P(x) - p and g(x) are polynomials, by the properties of polynomials, we know: [ P(x) - p = f_1(x) cdot g_1(x) ] where f_1(x), g_1(x) are constant multiple integers. 7. **Contradiction and Deduction** Given that p and the constant terms will create a contradiction unless a_n = 1. Therefore, through this contradiction, f(x) must have degree n. This can only equate if P(x) = x^n. 8. **Conclusion** Combining all these steps together, we conclude that the polynomial P(x) that satisfies the given condition can only be expressed in the specific form: [ P(x) = pm x^n + k ] where n in mathbb{N} and k in mathbb{Z}.

If it appears 7 times, it means one appearance is left unpaired, implying it must be at one end of the chain. 6. **End points contradictions**: - If one five is at one end, there should be another end to the chain governed by some other numbers. - Since similar logic must apply to all numbers, resulting in ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ) each needing to be at one end eventually. This creates a situation where all numbers needing to be at both ends to satisfy the even appearance internally, which is physically impossible since only two end points are available. 7. **Conclude**: - Based on the above calculations and logical contradictions, it is not possible to arrange these dominoes in a linear chain without breaking the internal numbers' arrangement properties. # Conclusion: (boxed{text{No}})"},{"instruction":"a box, there is 1 black ball and 9 white balls.

We need to consider the midline of quadrilateral ( ABCD ). 2. **Midline:** The midline of quadrilateral ( ABCD ) is a line segment that connects the midpoints of two opposite sides of the quadrilateral. Let ( P ) and ( Q ) be the midpoints of the sides ( AB ) and ( CD ), respectively. 3. **Triangles and Intersection:** Consider the triangles ( triangle APD ) and ( triangle CPQ ). Note that ( P ) and ( Q ) divide these triangles into smaller triangles where their corresponding medians also bisect the sides. 4. **Properties of Medians:** By the property of medians in triangles, the median of a triangle divides it into two triangles of equal area. Therefore, the medial line ( PQ ) of quadrilateral ( ABCD ), when intersecting the diagonals, results in the midpoints of these smaller sections being equidistant. 5. **Application of Parallelism:** Since the midline ( PQ ) is parallel to the base side ( AD ) of triangle ( APD ) and also parallel to base side ( BC ) of triangle ( CPQ ), it follows that the line segment joining these midpoints should form a parallel configuration if extended across the entire figure. 6. **Parallelogram Formation:** By drawing all the intersecting lines and connecting the midpoints of the diagonals, it becomes evident due to symmetry and the midpoint theorem applied. - **Midpoints Division:** with repeated applications of the midpoint theorem, we determine midpoints (M') and (N') for the secondary smaller quadrilaterals formed. \`\`\`text Applying the midpoint theorem twice: Twice applied midpoint theorem confirms symmetrical division and the result. \`\`\` 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the midpoints (M), (N), (M'), and (N') lie at vertices of a parallelogram due to their symmetrical and equidistant properties from the origins of the diagonals. 8. **Result:** The proof is complete as the properties demonstrate that the said points form a parallelogram or a degenerate parallelogram lying on the same line. # Final Answer: [ boxed{text{Vertices of a parallelogram or align linearly, forming degenerate parallelogram}} ]"},{"instruction":"Suppose that the roots of x^3 3x^2 + 5x + 7 = 0 are a, b, and c.

There are two plans to discuss: (1) Use a length of x m (0 < x < 14) of the old wall as one side of the rectangle. (2) The rectangle's side length that uses the old wall is x≥14. Which plan is more costeffective for utilizing the old wall to build the factory?","output":"Plan (1): The cost of repairing the old wall is x•frac{a}{4} yuan, and the cost of dismantling the old wall to construct new wall is (14-x)•frac{a}{2} yuan. The cost of constructing the remaining new wall is (2x+frac{2times126}{x}-14)a yuan. Therefore, the total cost y=7aleft(frac{x}{4}+frac{36}{x}-1right) (0 < x < 14). Simplifying, we get y=7aleft(frac{sqrt{x}}{2}-frac{6}{sqrt{x}}right)^2+35a geq 35a. When x = 12, we have the minimum cost boxed{y_{min} = 35a}. Plan (2): The cost of utilizing the old wall is 14•frac{a}{4} = frac{7a}{2} yuan. The cost of constructing the new wall is (2x+frac{252}{x}-14)a yuan. The total cost is then y=2a(x+frac{126}{x})-frac{21a}{2} (x≥14). Let f(x)=x+frac{126}{x} (x≥14). Then f'(x)=1-frac{126}{x^2}=frac{x^2-126}{x^2}. When x≥14, f'(x)>0, and f(x) is increasing. Therefore, f(x)_{min} = f(14) = 35.5a. Since 35a < 35.5a, we know that Plan (1) is slightly better. Answer: Plan (1) is the better option."},{"instruction":"space, find the unit vector overrightarrow{e} that is collinear with the vector overrightarrow{a} = (3, 0, 4).","output":"Since overrightarrow{e} is collinear with overrightarrow{a}= (3, 0, -4), we can express overrightarrow{e} as a scalar multiple of overrightarrow{a}. Furthermore, because overrightarrow{e} is a unit vector, its magnitude must be 1. First, we need to find the magnitude of overrightarrow{a}: lvert overrightarrow{a} rvert = sqrt{3^2 + 0^2 + (-4)^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5. Now, we can express the unit vector overrightarrow{e} as a scalar multiple of overrightarrow{a} with the magnitude set to 1: overrightarrow{e} = pm frac{overrightarrow{a}}{|overrightarrow{a}|} = pm frac{(3, 0, -4)}{5} = pm left( frac{3}{5}, 0, -frac{4}{5} right). Since the question asks for a unit vector and a unit vector has a magnitude of 1 by definition, there are two possible solutions based on the direction (positive or negative scalar multiple). Thus, the collinear unit vectors overrightarrow{e} can either be in the same or opposite direction as overrightarrow{a}.

To find the volume, we need to take these projected positions into account and apply the volume formula for pyramids: [ V = frac{1}{3} times text{base area} times text{height} ] Step 2: Calculating the Basic Elements 1. **Area of the Base ABC**: Since ABC is an equilateral triangle with side a, the area A_{ABC} can be found as: [ A_{ABC} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 ] 2. **Height of the Equilateral Triangle ABC**: The height h from a vertex to the opposite side in an equilateral triangle is: [ h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} a ] Step 3: Position of Point S **If ( frac{a}{sqrt{3}} < b leq a )**: - Point S is the incenter of the triangle ABC. - The inradius r of ABC is given by: [ r = frac{a}{2sqrt{3}} ] - The height H of the pyramid SABC is determined by the length from S to the base, using the relation: [ H = sqrt{b^2 - left(frac{a}{2sqrt{3}}right)^2} = sqrt{b^2 - frac{a^2}{12}} ] Thus, the volume V becomes: [ V = frac{1}{3} times A_{ABC} times H = frac{1}{3} times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 times sqrt{b^2 - frac{a^2}{12}} = frac{a^2}{12} sqrt{3b^2 - a^2} ] **If ( a < b leq a sqrt{3} )**: - There are two possible positions for S: the incenter or one of the excenters. 1. **Incenter result** (same calculation as above): [ V_1 = frac{a^2}{12} sqrt{3b^2 - a^2} ] 2. **Excenter results**: - The distance to this point results in different heights: - If the apex S projects to an excenter, the height H': [ H' = sqrt{b^2 - left(frac{asqrt{3}}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{b^2 - frac{3a^2}{4}} ] - Volume using this height: [ V_2 = frac{1}{3} times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 times sqrt{b^2 - frac{a^2}{4}} = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{12} sqrt{b^2 - a^2} ] **If ( b > asqrt{3} )**: - There are three possible results: 1. **Incenter result**: [ V_1 = frac{a^2}{12} sqrt{3b^2 - a^2} ] 2. **First excenter**: [ V_2 = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{12} sqrt{b^2 - a^2} ] 3. **Second excenter**: Shift in position of S results in another height: [ H'' = sqrt{b^2 - (3a^2)} ] Thus: [ V_3 = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{12} sqrt{b^2 - 3a^2} ] # Conclusion The volumes of the pyramid SABC under the given conditions are: - If ( frac{a}{sqrt{3}} < b leq a ): [ boxed{V = frac{a^2}{12} sqrt{3b^2 - a^2}} ] - If ( a < b leq a sqrt{3} ): [ boxed{V_1 = frac{a^2}{12} sqrt{3b^2 - a^2}, quad V_2 = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{12} sqrt{b^2 - a^2}} ] - If ( b > a sqrt{3} ): [ boxed{V_1 = frac{a^2}{12} sqrt{3b^2 - a^2}, quad V_2 = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{12} sqrt{b^2 - a^2}, quad V_3 = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{12} sqrt{b^2 - 3a^2}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let points A, B, C, and D lie on a circle such that AB = BC = CD = DA = 1.

Since the points are equidistant on the circle and form a square inside the circle, the area of triangles like ABC, BCD, CDA, and DAB can be calculated. - **Using Diameter Points**: Triangles such as AEF, BEF, CEF, and DEF involve the diameter segment, which will alter the typical area calculation for circular segment triangles. 2. **Calculate Possible Base Lengths and Unique Triangle Areas**: - Triangles fully on the circle like ABC will have all sides equal to 1, forming an equilateral triangle. The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side s is frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2. Thus, the area for ABC is frac{sqrt{3}}{4}. - Triangles including the diameter will form right triangles with base EF = 1. The height will be the radius of the circle, say r. The area of these triangles like AEF is frac{1}{2} times 1 times r. - Since the configuration forms a regular arrangement (a square inside a circle with a side on the diameter), we calculate r using the square's diagonal (equal to the diameter), which is 2r = sqrt{2}. Thus, r = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. The area of AEF becomes frac{1}{2} times 1 times frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{4}. 3. **Conclusion**: - We have two different areas: frac{sqrt{3}}{4} for triangles formed by circle points only and frac{sqrt{2}}{4} for triangles including the diameter. - Therefore, there are exactly two distinct areas possible for the triangles.

Find a common denominator for the right-hand side: frac{1}{1 + x^2} + frac{1}{1 + y^2} = frac{1 + y^2 + 1 + x^2 - y^2}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)} = frac{1 + x^2 + 1 + y^2}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)} = frac{2 + x^2 + y^2}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}. 4. Therefore, we must show: frac{2}{1 + xy} geq frac{2 + x^2 + y^2}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}. 5. **Cross-multiplying to clear denominators:** To compare these fractions, cross-multiply: 2(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2) geq (2 + x^2 + y^2)(1 + xy). 6. **Expanding both sides:** Left-hand side: 2(1 + x^2 + y^2 + x^2 y^2) = 2 + 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2x^2 y^2. Right-hand side: (2 + x^2 + y^2)(1 + xy) = 2(1 + xy) + x^2(1 + xy) + y^2(1 + xy) = 2 + 2xy + x^2 + x^2 y + y^2 + y^2 x. Combining similar terms: RHS = 2 + 2xy + x^2 + y^2 + x^2 y + y^2 x. Since ( x^2 y = y x^2 ) and ( y^2 x = x y^2 ), this simplifies to: RHS = 2 + 2xy + x^2 + y^2 + 2x^2 y. 7. **Comparing expanded forms:** We have: 2 + 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2x^2 y^2 geq 2 + 2xy + x^2 + y^2 + 2x^2 y. Cancelling common terms: 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2x^2 y^2 geq 2xy + x^2 + y^2 + 2x^2 y. Rearranging gives: x^2 + y^2 + 2x^2 y^2 geq 2xy + 2x^2 y. This is true because ( x^2 + y^2 geq 2xy ) (by the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality, AM-GM) and ( x^2 y^2 ge x^2 y ). 8. **Combining all Inequalities:** Observe that applying the auxiliary inequality to each pair ((a_i, a_{i+1})) gives: frac{2}{1 + a_i a_{i+1}} geq frac{1}{1 + a_i^2} + frac{1}{1 + a_{i+1}^2}. Summing these inequalities for all (i) from (1) to (n), we get: sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{2}{1 + a_i a_{i+1}} geq sum_{i=1}^{n} left( frac{1}{1 + a_i^2} + frac{1}{1 + a_{i+1}^2} right). 9. **Reindexing the Summation:** The right-hand side can be split and reindexed: sum_{i=1}^{n} left( frac{1}{1 + a_i^2} + frac{1}{1 + a_{i+1}^2} right) = 2 sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{1 + a_i^2}. 10. **Concluding the Proof:** Therefore, we have: 2 sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{1 + a_i a_{i+1}} geq 2 sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{1 + a_i^2}. Dividing both sides by 2: sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{1 + a_i a_{i+1}} geq sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{1 + a_i^2}. Thus, we have proven the required inequality. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, point E is on side BC, angle BAE = 25^circ, and angle AEC = 65^circ.

Every subset ( A_i ) contains exactly 3 elements. 2. Every pair ( {x, y} ) of elements from ( S ) is present in at least one of the subsets ( A_i ). 3. Each pair ( A_i ) and ( A_j ) of different subsets have exactly one common element. 2. **Counting the Total Number of Pairs:** From condition (1), the total number of distinct 2-element subsets of ( S ) is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] Since each subset ( A_i ) contains exactly 3 elements, it will cover exactly 3 distinct 2-element subsets. 3. **Accounting for All Pairs:** Given that there are ( m ) such subsets ( A_i ), and each ( A_i ) covers 3 different 2-element subsets, we must have: [ 3m = binom{n}{2} ] Substituting the binomial coefficient: [ 3m = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] Solving for ( m ): [ m = frac{n(n-1)}{6} ] 4. **Analyzing the Common Elements:** For a fixed element ( k ) in ( S ), the number of pairs ( {k, x} ) that include ( k ) is ( n-1 ).

This means there exist integers ( m ) and ( n ) such that: [ f^m(x) equiv f^n(x) pmod{p} ] where ( f^k ) denotes the function ( f ) applied ( k ) times. 3. **Express ( f^k(x) ):** - We can express ( f^k(x) ) as: [ f^k(x) = c^k x + d sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c^i ] Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we get: [ sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c^i = frac{c^k - 1}{c - 1} ] Therefore: [ f^k(x) = c^k x + d frac{c^k - 1}{c - 1} ] 4. **Set up the congruence condition:** - For the game to end, we need: [ c^m x + d frac{c^m - 1}{c - 1} equiv c^n x + d frac{c^n - 1}{c - 1} pmod{p} ] Simplifying, we get: [ c^m x - c^n x equiv d left( frac{c^n - 1}{c - 1} - frac{c^m - 1}{c - 1} right) pmod{p} ] [ (c^m - c^n) x equiv d frac{c^n - c^m}{c - 1} pmod{p} ] [ (c^m - c^n) left( x + frac{d}{c - 1} right) equiv 0 pmod{p} ] 5. **Analyze the condition:** - For the above congruence to hold, either ( c^m equiv c^n pmod{p} ) or ( x + frac{d}{c - 1} equiv 0 pmod{p} ). - If ( x + frac{d}{c - 1} equiv 0 pmod{p} ), Granite can choose ( x = frac{d}{1 - c} ) to win. - Otherwise, we need ( c^m equiv c^n pmod{p} ), which implies ( c^{m-n} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). This means the order of ( c ) modulo ( p ) must divide ( m - n ). 6. **Determine the winning strategy:** - Pomegranate wins if the order of ( c ) modulo ( p ) is even. This is because Pomegranate can always choose ( d ) and ( x ) such that the sequence will eventually repeat with an even period. 7. **Identify primes ( p ) where Pomegranate has a winning strategy:** - If ( p-1 ) has an odd factor, there exists a number whose order modulo ( p ) is odd, and Granite can force a win. - Therefore, we need ( p-1 ) to be a power of 2, i.e., ( p ) must be of the form ( 2^n + 1 ). 8. **List primes of the form ( 2^n + 1 ) less than ( 10^5 ):** - The primes of this form are ( 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537 ). 9. **Sum these primes:** - The sum is: [ 3 + 5 + 17 + 257 + 65537 = 65819 ] The final answer is (boxed{65819})"},{"instruction":"Viggo spent 80 on a shirt.

This property implies that the convex hull of these polygons contains all of them. 2. **Convex Hull Definition:** The **convex hull** of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that can enclose all the points. The vertices of the convex hull are some of the vertices of the given polygons. 3. **Projection Property:** By the problem's condition, projections of these polygons onto any line cover the projection of their convex hull. The projection of a convex polygon onto a line is an interval on that line. This is a crucial point because it ensures that the convex hull's extent is not exceeded by the combined extents of the individual polygons. 4. **Projection on an Arbitrary Line:** For a line ( L ), denote the projection of polygon ( P_i ) onto ( L ) as ( text{Proj}_L(P_i) ). For the convex hull( text{Hull} ) of all polygons’ vertices, denote its projection onto ( L ) as ( text{Proj}_L(text{Hull}) ).

Since EFGH is congruent to ABCD, its area is also 96. 2. **Determine Position of E and the Overlap**: - The center of rectangle ABCD is the midpoint of both diagonals, located at (6, 4) from bottom left corner (A). Since E is at this point, the overlap starts from the center of ABCD extending half the dimension of EFGH in all directions. - The overlapping area is therefore half of each dimension of EFGH: half-length = 6 and half-width = 4. 3. **Calculate the Overlap Area**: - The overlapping area is a smaller rectangle by itself, with dimensions 6 times 4 = 24. 4. **Calculate Total Covered Area**: - The total area covered by the two rectangles without considering overlap would be 96 + 96 = 192. - The actual covered area is the total minus the overlap: 192 - 24 = 168.

Let us denote: [ a = n(x! - xy - x - y + 2) + 2 ] [ b = n(x! - xy - x - y + 3) + 3 ] 3. We need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of (a) and (b): [ gcd(a, b) = gcd(n(x! - xy - x - y + 2) + 2, n(x! - xy - x - y + 3) + 3) ] 4. Notice that: [ b - a = (n(x! - xy - x - y + 3) + 3) - (n(x! - xy - x - y + 2) + 2) = 1 ] 5. Therefore, we have: [ gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, a + 1) = gcd(a, 1) ] 6. For the gcd to be greater than 1, (a) must be such that it shares a common factor with 1, which is impossible unless (a) itself is 1. Hence, we need to find conditions under which (a) and (b) are not coprime. 7. Choose (n = p - 1) where (p in mathbb{P}) (prime numbers). This imposes that: [ p mid (p-1)(x! - xy - x - y + 2) + 2 ] 8.

Let (x + 1 = q) where (q in mathbb{P}) and (q > 2). 11. Therefore, we have: [ y = frac{(q-1)! - (q-1)}{q} ] 12.

The process is as follows: x^{2}2xy+y^{2}16=left(xyright)^{2}16=left(xy+4right)left(xy4right). This method of factorization is called the grouping method.

We notice that the first three terms can form a perfect square, and the last term is a constant. The process of factorization using the grouping method is as follows: 1. Recognize the pattern in the first three terms: a^{2}-6ab+9b^{2} resembles the formula for a perfect square, (a-3b)^{2}. 2. Rewrite the polynomial by grouping the perfect square and the constant: a^{2}-6ab+9b^{2}-36 = (a-3b)^{2}-36. 3. Factor using the difference of squares formula: (a-3b)^{2}-36 = (a-3b-6)(a-3b+6). Therefore, the factorized form of a^{2}-6ab+9b^{2}-36 is boxed{(a-3b-6)(a-3b+6)}. For Problem (2): Given the equation a^{2}+c^{2}+2b^{2}-2ab-2bc=0, we aim to determine the shape of triangle ABC.

Recognize the pattern of perfect squares: (a-b)^{2}+(b-c)^{2}=0. 3. Since a sum of squares equals zero, each square must be zero: (a-b)^{2}=0 and (b-c)^{2}=0. 4. Solve for the relationships between the sides: a-b=0 and b-c=0. 5. Conclude that all sides are equal: a=b and b=c, which implies a=b=c.

The transformation also suggests that the function is symmetric with respect to the point (-1,1). Therefore, statement A is correct. The range of f(x) can be determined from its transformed form.

Then, f'(x) = frac{x - 2}{2x}. Solving for f'(x) > 0, we get x > 2. Solving for f'(x) < 0, we get 0 < x < 2. Thus, f(x) is decreasing on (0, 2) and increasing on (2, +infty). Hence, f(x) geq f(2) = -ln 2 - 1. Let g(y) = ln y - 2y. Then, g'(y) = frac{1 - 2y}{y}. Solving for g'(y) > 0, we get y < frac{1}{2}. Solving for g'(y) < 0, we get y > frac{1}{2}. Thus, g(y) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{2}) and decreasing on (frac{1}{2}, +infty). Hence, g(y) leq g(frac{1}{2}) = -ln 2 - 1. Therefore, when x = 2 and y = frac{1}{2}, we have frac{x}{2} - ln x - 2 = ln y - 2y. Thus, x^y = 2^{frac{1}{2}} = boxed{sqrt{2}}. By defining f(x) = frac{x}{2} - ln x - 2 and g(y) = ln y - 2y, the problem is transformed into finding the minimum value of f(x) and the maximum value of g(y).

For which ( n > 1 ) can we tile a ( 15 times n ) rectangle with these pentominos?","output":"Solution: Given problem: For which values of (n > 1) can we tile a (15 times n) rectangle with the given pentominos? To find a solution, let's explore the tiling possibilities step by step. # 1. Examining the Basic Tiling: The problem diagram shows that a (3 times 5) rectangle can be tiled using the given pentominos. Using this idea, we can construct larger rectangles as follows: Since (15 = 3 times 5), we can tile: - (15 times 3) rectangle: This is achieved by combining three (3 times 5) tiles. - (15 times 5) rectangle: This is achieved by combining one (15 times 5) tile. Thus, we know how to tile (15 times 3) and (15 times 5) rectangles. # 2. Constructing Larger n: Any (n > 7) can be represented as a sum of 3s and 5s: - ( n = 8 = 3 + 5 ) - ( n = 9 = 3 + 3 + 3 ) - ( n = 10 = 5 + 5 ) Building on this, given any (n geq 8) can be expressed as sums of 3s and 5s. Expressing in terms of tiling: - A sum of 3s means tiling with multiple (15 times 3) tiles. - A sum of 5s means tiling with multiple (15 times 5) tiles. Hence, we can tile any (15 times n) rectangle for any (n geq 8). # 3. Special Cases (n = 1, 2, 4, 7): - **( n = 1 )** and **( n = 2 )**: These are obviously impossible to tile with pentominos; a pentomino covers 5 unit squares, making it impossible to fit in these dimensions. - **( n = 4 )**: We need to check various ways of tiling a (15 times 4) rectangle. When trying to cover the top-left square with the U-shaped piece, we see no possible configuration works to completely tile the given space. - **( n = 7 )**: Just like (n = 4), attempts to cover a (15 times 7) rectangle results in uncovered spaces when trying logical configuration of U-shaped and cross-shaped tiles. Both obvious configurations leave uncovered squares. # 4.

The coefficient of ( x^{m(n-2) + 2r} ) in the polynomial ( P ) is: [ binom{n}{2} sum_{i=1}^n q_i^2 - n sum_{1 leq i_1 < i_2 leq n} q_{i_1} q_{i_2} ] This can be written as: [ frac{n}{2} left( (n-1) sum_{i=1}^n q_i^2 - sum_{1 leq i_1 < i_2 leq n} q_{i_1} q_{i_2} right) ] The expression in the brackets is non-negative and equals zero only when ( q_i ) are all equal. 11. **Determine the degree of ( P ):** Let ( r_0 ) be the greatest integer such that the coefficients of ( x^{r_0} ) in ( Q_i ) are not all equal. The coefficient of ( x^{m(n-2) + 2r_0} ) in ( P ) is positive. Therefore: [ deg(P) geq m(n-2) + r_0 geq (n-2)m ] The equality holds when ( r_0 = 0 ), i.e., when ( Q_i(x) = Q(x) + c_i ) and ( c_i in mathbb{R} ) are not all equal.

When ( x + 17 ) is divided by 41, the remainder is 22. This can be expressed as: [ x + 17 = 41n + 22 ] where ( n ) is some integer.

The physicist can then repeat the process with the two resulting omons, choosing which omon to destroy at every step. The physicist initially has two omons whose masses are distinct positive integers less than 1000 . What is the maximum possible number of times he can use his machine without producing an omon whose mass is not an integer? *Proposed by Michael Kural*","output":"1. **Initial Setup**: We start with two omons of masses (a) and (b), where (a) and (b) are distinct positive integers less than 1000. Without loss of generality, assume (a < b). 2. **Entanglement Process**: The machine destroys the omon with mass (a), preserves the omon with mass (b), and creates a new omon with mass (frac{a + b}{2}). This process can be repeated with the new pair of omons. 3. **Mass Difference Analysis**: Let (d = b - a). After the first entanglement, the new masses are (b) and (frac{a + b}{2}). The difference between these new masses is: [ b - frac{a + b}{2} = frac{2b - (a + b)}{2} = frac{b - a}{2} = frac{d}{2} ] Thus, each entanglement halves the difference between the masses of the two omons. 4. **Integer Mass Condition**: For the mass of the new omon to remain an integer, (frac{a + b}{2}) must be an integer. This implies that (a + b) must be even, which is always true since (a) and (b) are both integers. 5. **Maximum Number of Steps**: We need to determine the maximum number of times the physicist can use the machine without producing a non-integer mass. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of times we can halve the initial difference (d) before it becomes less than 1. 6. **Initial Difference**: The maximum initial difference (d) is (999) (since (a) and (b) are distinct integers less than 1000). 7. **Halving Process**: We need to find the largest (n) such that: [ frac{999}{2^n} geq 1 ] Solving for (n): [ 999 geq 2^n implies n leq log_2(999) ] Calculating (log_2(999)): [ log_2(999) approx 9.96 ] Since (n) must be an integer, the maximum (n) is 9. 8. **Verification**: We can verify this by considering the sequence of differences: [ 999, 499.5, 249.75, 124.875, 62.4375, 31.21875, 15.609375, 7.8046875, 3.90234375, 1.951171875 ] After 9 steps, the difference is still greater than 1, but after the 10th step, it becomes less than 1, indicating a non-integer mass.

The minimum positive period of this function is determined by the coefficient omega in front of x.

What is the maximum number of numbers the computer could have generated?","output":"Given that a computer generated a set of different natural numbers and found the highest power of the number 2022 that divides the difference between each pair of numbers, and it resulted in 2023 distinct answers. We want to find the largest number of natural numbers the computer could have generated. Example: Consider a set of all numbers from 1 to (2022^{2023}). The difference between any two distinct numbers in this set can be represented in terms of powers of 2022. Specifically, the difference of any two numbers is divisible by at most ( 2022^{2023} ). Estimating the Upper Bound: Let's prove that the computer can't generate more than (2022^{2023}) numbers. 1. **Representation in Base (2022)**: Any number (a) can be expressed as: [ a = a_{2023} cdot 2022^{2023} + a_{2022} cdot 2022^{2022} + a_{2021} cdot 2022^{2021} + ldots + a_{1} cdot 2022 + a_{0} ] where each coefficient (a_k) ranges from (0) to (2021). Hence, (0 leq a_k leq 2021) for (k leq 2022). 2. **Difference Calculation**: Suppose we have another number (b) written similarly as: [ b = b_{2023} cdot 2022^{2023} + b_{2022} cdot 2022^{2022} + b_{2021} cdot 2022^{2021} + ldots + b_{1} cdot 2022 + b_{0} ] 3. **Divisibility by Powers of 2022**: The difference between these two numbers (a) and (b) is: [ a - b = (a_{2023} - b_{2023}) cdot 2022^{2023} + (a_{2022} - b_{2022}) cdot 2022^{2022} + ldots + (a_{1} - b_{1}) cdot 2022 + (a_{0} - b_{0}) ] The smallest power of 2022 that divides (a - b) depends on the smallest index (k) for which (a_k neq b_k). If (a_p neq b_p), then the difference is divisible by (2022^p). 4. **Generating More than (2022^{2023}) Numbers**: Assume more than (2022^{2023}) distinct numbers are generated. Let's select 2023 coefficients, corresponding to powers of 2022, to form these numbers. The number of unique combinations of coefficients (a_k) across all terms (p leq 2022) is (2022^{2023}). If there are more numbers than this, by the pigeonhole principle, some pairs of numbers must have the same coefficients (a_k) in corresponding terms for lower powers. Thus, some pair differences will be divisible by textit{another} unidentified power of 2022, which contradicts the initial assumption. Thus, if the computer claims 2023 distinct answers based on the highest powers of 2022 dividing the differences, then it can generate at most (2022^{2023}) numbers.

For definiteness, we assume that the rightmost seat is numbered n and the leftmost seat is numbered 1. 2. The problem can be approached by reducing it to a similar problem with a smaller number of spectators by attempting to seat spectator n in their correct seat. 3. First, we let the usher act as follows: - Move spectator n towards their rightful place on the right if their current right neighbor is not seated in their own place. 4. If spectator n cannot be moved beyond seat k, it implies that on seat (k+1) is seated spectator k. 5. We then identify the largest integer m such that spectators numbered k, k+1, ldots, k+m-1 are seated on seats k+1, k+2, ldots, k+m respectively. - Possible scenarios are k+m < n or k+m = n. 6. In the first case (k+m < n), spectator j (j neq k+m) sits on seat (k+m+1). Clearly j neq k+m-1, j neq k+m-2, ldots, j neq k+1. - Hence, the usher can move spectator j one seat to the left, then again to the left, and so on until they switch places with spectator n. - This will result in spectator n moving one seat to the right while all spectators to the left of n are still seated in incorrect places. - The usher can repeat this procedure until one of two things happen: spectator n ends up in their rightful place or the second case occurs. 7. In the second case (k+m = n), the usher can reseat spectators k, k+1, ldots, n correctly by progressively moving spectator n to the right until they are finally at their correct place. 8. By iterating this process, initially seating a few spectators correctly at the right end allows the problem to be reduced to the original problem but with fewer spectators.

However, if the three points are collinear, they cannot determine a plane since there are infinitely many planes containing that line. Hence, statement ① is incorrect. For ②, a quadrilateral is a figure formed by four straight line segments. These segments are typically considered to lie in the same plane, which would make the quadrilateral a planar figure. However, if the sides of the quadrilateral are not all in the same plane—for instance if opposing sides belong to skew lines—then it would not be a planar figure. This scenario is atypical, and without any additional context suggesting that the sides are skew, it's reasonable to infer that statement ② is generally correct. However, as the statement is absolute and exceptions can exist, statement ② is technically not always correct. For ③, a trapezoid is defined as a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. The parallel sides (bases) lie in a single plane, and thus determine that plane. By the axiomatic properties of a plane, the non-parallel sides (legs) of the trapezoid also must lie in that same plane. Therefore, statement ③ is correct. For ④, if planes α and β intersect at three non-collinear points, then by definition, they coincide to form a single plane through those points.

Express in terms of (cos 4alpha): [ 1 - frac{1}{2} sin^2 2alpha = 1 - frac{1}{2} left(frac{1 - cos 4alpha}{2}right) = 1 - frac{1 - cos 4 alpha}{4} ] 9. Further simplify: [ 1 - frac{1 - cos 4alpha}{4} = frac{4 - (1 - cos 4alpha)}{4} = frac{3 + cos 4 alpha}{4} ] Hence: [ cos^{8} alpha - sin^{8} alpha = cos 2alpha cdot left(frac{3 + cos 4alpha}{4}right) ] 10.
