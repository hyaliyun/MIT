Denote the sum of interior angles of the i-th face as a_i for i = 1, 2, ldots, m. The total sum of the angular deficits (curvatures) at all vertices of the polyhedron is given by: [ sum (text{curvature at each vertex}) = 2pi n - sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i. ] 2. **Transformation to a Simplified Model:** Imagine the polyhedron being made of a flexible rubber membrane. Pull one face to enlarge it such that the remaining faces become tightly adjacent to this enlarged face. This process modifies the structure, but not the total sum of curvatures, the number of edges, or vertices. After the transformation, some vertices will have a zero curvature while others, mainly those on the enlarged face, maintain non-zero curvature. These vertices contribute to the total curvature. 3. **Curvature Analysis in the New Model:** In the modified polyhedron, vertices on the significantly enlarged polygonal face are the main contributors to non-zero curvatures. At each vertex, the curvature is the difference between 2pi and the sum of the interior angles of the polygons meeting at that vertex. 4. **Angle Sum Relationship:** For a vertex at the enlarged polygonal face: [ text{Curvature at a vertex} = 2pi - left(sum text{interior angles at this vertex}right). ] The sum of interior angles at this vertex equals 2theta in the context of an exterior or curvature equivalent: [ 2pi - 2theta = 2(pi - theta). ] Thus, the curvature is determined to be twice the exterior angle at these vertices. 5. **Collective Sum of Curvatures:** Summing up all these contributions, the sum of curvatures is equivalent to the sum of the external angles: [ 2 times (text{sum of external angles} of the enlarged face). ] 6. **External Angle Sum Consideration:** Note that the sum of all external angles in a convex polygon (regardless of how it is pulled or stretched) equals (2pi): [ text{Sum of external angles} = 2pi. ] Therefore, for a polyhedron: [ text{Sum of curvatures} = 2 times 2pi = 4pi. ] # Conclusion: The sum of the curvatures, or angular deficits, at all vertices of a convex polyhedron is consistently equal to 4pi.

After a 20% reduction, the new price per kilogram becomes 0.8P. The lady can now buy 10 kg more salt for the same amount of money (Rs. 400) due to the price reduction. This means that the amount of salt she could buy at the original price (before the reduction) for Rs. 400 is 10 kg less than what she can buy at the reduced price. Let's denote the amount of salt she could buy at the original price as S kg. Therefore, at the reduced price, she can buy S + 10 kg. At the original price, the cost for S kg of salt would be: Cost = S * P At the reduced price, the cost for (S + 10) kg of salt would be: Cost = (S + 10) * 0.8P Since both costs are equal to Rs. 400, we can set up the following equation: S * P = (S + 10) * 0.8P Now, we can solve for S: S * P = 0.8P * S + 0.8P * 10 S * P - 0.8P * S = 0.8P * 10 S * P * (1 - 0.8) = 0.8P * 10 S * P * 0.2 = 8P S = 8P / (0.2P) S = 8 / 0.2 S = 40 So, the lady could originally buy 40 kg of salt for Rs. 400.

Here, B_0 and C_0 are the feet of the altitudes from B and C respectively. - Since K lies on the circle with diameter AH, the points A, B_0, C_0, H, K are concyclic. - The angle bisector AK of angle AB_0C_0 implies that K is the midpoint of the arc B_0C_0 of the circle AB_0C_0, so KB_0 = KC_0. - Given MB_0 = MC_0 and TB_0 = TC_0, it follows that M, K, T are collinear. - Since AH and MM_a are parallel, triangle AHK sim triangle M_aMK, leading to MK = MM_a. 3. **Step 2: Show that MN perp AM_a** - N and M are the projections of M_a on AB and BC respectively. Thus, MN is the Simson line of M_a. - The Simson line of a point on the circumcircle of a triangle passes through the projections of that point on the sides of the triangle. - Therefore, MN passes through the projection of M_a on AC, say Q.

First, consider the given hyperbola (xy = 1). We need to find the shortest distance between a fixed point (Q(a, b)) in the first quadrant and a point (P(x, y)) in the third quadrant that lies on the hyperbola. 2. For the given problem, we take point (Q(a, b)) as the center of a circle. The shortest distance from (Q) to the hyperbola will be when the circle, centered at (Q) with radius (|QP|), is tangent to the hyperbola at point (P(x_1, y_1)). 3. For the circle to be tangent to the hyperbola, the line segment (QP) must be perpendicular to the tangent to the hyperbola at point (P(x_1, y_1)). 4. The equation of the tangent to the hyperbola (xy = 1) at point (P(x_1, y_1)) is given by: [ y_1x + x_1y = 2 ] 5. We need to ensure that the slope of this tangent line at (P) multiplied by the slope of the line (QP) equals (-1), indicating perpendicularity. The slope of the tangent line at (P(x_1, y_1)) is: [ -frac{y_1}{x_1} ] 6. The slope of the line segment (QP) is: [ frac{y_1 - b}{x_1 - a} ] 7. Using the fact that the product of these slopes must be (-1): [ frac{y_1 - b}{x_1 - a} cdot left(-frac{y_1}{x_1}right) = -1 ] 8. Simplifying the above equation, we get: [ frac{(y_1 - b) y_1}{(x_1 - a)x_1} = 1 ] 9. From the hyperbola equation, we know (x_1 y_1 = 1) and from point (Q) we know (a cdot b = 1). Thus: [ frac{y_1^2 - by_1}{x_1^2 - ax_1} = 1 ] 10. Solving for (y_1) and (x_1), we substitute (y_1 = -a^{-frac{1}{3}}) and (x_1 = -a^{-frac{1}{3}}). Both satisfy the original hyperbola equation, simplifying: [ a x_1^2 = -1 implies x_1^2 = -frac{1}{a} ] [ x_1 = -a^{-frac{1}{3}}, quad y_1 = -a^{-frac{1}{3}} ] 11. Now, we calculate the distance ( |QP| ): [ |QP|^2 = (x_1 - a)^2 + (y_1 - b)^2 ] where ( x_1 = -a^{-frac{1}{3}} ) and ( y_1 = -a^{-frac{1}{3}} ). 12. Substituting these values, we get: [ |QP|^2 = left(-a^{-frac{1}{3}} - aright)^2 + left(-a^{-frac{1}{3}} - a^{-1}right)^2 ] 13. Simplifying further: [ = left(a^{frac{2}{3}} + a^{-frac{2}{3}}right)^2 + left( a^{frac{2}{3}} + a^{-frac{2}{3}}right)^2 = 2left(a^{frac{2}{3}} + a^{-frac{2}{3}}right)^2 ] 14.

According to the information given: - 76 employees are women. - 60 employees are married. Since 2/3 of the men are single, this means 1/3 of the men are married. To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of employees: Number of men = 100 - 76 = 24 men. Now, 1/3 of these men are married: Married men = 1/3 * 24 = 8 men. Since we know that 60 employees are married in total, we can find the number of married women by subtracting the number of married men from the total number of married employees: Married women = 60 - 8 = 52 women. Now, we are told that 70 percent of married women have more than 5 years of service. So, the number of married women with more than 5 years of service is: Married women with >5 years service = 70% of 52 = 0.7 * 52 = 36.4 ≈ 36 women (since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round to the nearest whole number). Finally, we want to find the fraction of the total women employees that are married with more than 5 years of service: Fraction = Number of married women with >5 years service / Total number of women Fraction = 36 / 76. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4: Fraction = (36/4) / (76/4) = 9 / 19.

To do this, we examine the discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation, which is given by Delta = b^{2} - 4ac, where a=1, b=-(2k+1), and c=4k-3. Calculating Delta, we have: [ Delta = (2k+1)^{2}-4(4k-3) = 4k^{2}+4k+1-16k+12 = 4k^{2}-12k+13 = (2k-3)^{2}+4 ] Since (2k-3)^{2} geqslant 0 for all real k, adding 4 to it ensures that Delta > 0 for all real k.

Since we have 3 moles of KOH, we will need 3 moles of NH4I to react completely with the KOH. The problem states that the total amount of NH4I required is 435, but it does not specify the units. Assuming that the 435 refers to grams, we can calculate the molar mass of NH4I and then determine the number of moles of NH4I. The molar mass of NH4I is calculated as follows: - Molar mass of NH4 (ammonium) = 14.01 (N) + 4 * 1.01 (H) = 18.05 g/mol - Molar mass of I (iodine) = 126.90 g/mol - Total molar mass of NH4I = 18.05 + 126.90 = 144.95 g/mol Now, we can calculate the number of moles of NH4I in 435 grams: Number of moles of NH4I = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol) Number of moles of NH4I = 435 g / 144.95 g/mol ≈ 3 moles Since the reaction is a 1:1 molar ratio, the number of moles of KI formed will also be equal to the number of moles of NH4I reacted, which is 3 moles.

Since each seat can hold 3 people and there are 15 seats on the left side, the left side can hold a total of: 15 seats * 3 people/seat = 45 people The special seat at the back can hold 11 people, so now we have: 45 people (left side) + 11 people (back seat) = 56 people The bus can hold a total of 92 people, so the number of people that can be seated on the right side is: 92 people (total capacity) - 56 people (left side and back seat) = 36 people Since each seat on the right side can hold 3 people, we can find the number of seats on the right side by dividing the number of people by 3: 36 people / 3 people/seat = 12 seats Now we know there are 12 seats on the right side and 15 seats on the left side. To find out how many fewer seats there are on the right side compared to the left side, we subtract the number of seats on the right side from the number of seats on the left side: 15 seats (left side) - 12 seats (right side) = 3 fewer seats So, there are boxed{3} fewer seats on the right side compared to the left side."},{"instruction":"Proposition p: For all x in mathbb{R}, x^{2}+ax+a^{2} geqslant 0; Proposition q: There exists x in mathbb{R}, such that sin x + cos x = 2.

This function maps natural numbers to natural numbers. 2. **Define the set ( A ):** Let ( A = mathbb{N} setminus g(mathbb{N}) ). The set ( A ) consists of all natural numbers that are not in the image of ( g ). Since ( g(n) ) produces odd numbers greater than or equal to 2, ( A ) will contain at least all even integers greater than or equal to 4, making ( A ) an infinite set. 3. **Split ( A ) into two equinumerous subsets:** Since ( A ) is infinite, it can be split into two subsets ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) such that there is a bijection between them.

By the properties of medians in ( triangle ABC ), we can use the relation that the median divides the triangle into smaller triangles with equal areas. Moreover, the centroid ( G ) of the triangle divides each median into a ratio of ( 2:1 ). 3. Therefore, the segments ( AO ) and ( BO ) are calculated as: [ AO = frac{2}{3} AP = frac{2}{3} times 18 = 12 ] [ BO = frac{2}{3} BH = frac{2}{3} times 24 = 16 ] 4.

Each a_i satisfies the equation: [ a_i^2 = S - a_i ] Implying all a_i are roots of the quadratic equation: [ x^2 + x - S = 0 ] If all a_i are equal, i.e., a = a_1 = dots = a_{11}, then S = 11a. Substituting in the equation, the quadratic simplifies to: [ a^2 + a - 11a = 0 implies a(a - 10) = 0 ] Thus, a = 0 or a = 10. If not all a_i are the same, assume there are two distinct numbers among them, say a and b. Let n of the a_i be equal to a, and the remaining 11-n equal to b. So, S = na + (11 - n)b.

The perimeter of triangle ABF_{1} is calculated as the sum of the distances |AF_{1}|+|BF_{1}|+|AF_{2}|+|BF_{2}|. Given that the foci of an ellipse are equidistant from any point on the ellipse, the distances from A and B to both foci are equal, leading to |AF_{1}| + |AF_{2}| = |BF_{1}| + |BF_{2}| = 2a, where 2a is the major axis length.

The cosine of the angle angle OEF_{2} is calculated as cos angle OEF_{2} = frac{1}{2}, leading to angle OEF_{2} = frac{pi}{3}. This implies that angle F_{1}EF_{2} = frac{2pi}{3}. Since the angle angle F_{1}PF_{2} can vary within the range [0, frac{2pi}{3}], there exists a configuration where overrightarrow{PF_1} cdot overrightarrow{PF_2} = 0.

Therefore, option C is correct, encapsulated as boxed{text{C is correct}}. **Option D:** For any point P on ellipse C and any point Q on the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1, the maximum distance between P and Q can be estimated as the sum of the maximum distances from P to the origin O and from O to Q. Since the maximum distance from P to O is the semi-major axis length of the ellipse, which is 2, and the maximum distance from O to Q is the radius of the circle, which is 1, the maximum distance |PQ| is 2 + 1 = 3.

Prove: [ angle ODF = angle OEF. ] # Detailed Solution: 1. **Determine the Coordinates of Focus ( F )**: - Given the eccentricity ( e = frac{1}{2} ), we have ( e = frac{c}{a} ), hence ( c = frac{a}{2} ). - The distance ( AF = |A(-a, 0), F(c, 0)| ) is given by ( |AF| = 3 ). - We have ( c + a = 3 ) and since ( c = frac{a}{2} ), substituting in gives: [ frac{a}{2} + a = 3 implies frac{3a}{2} = 3 implies a = 2. ] - Therefore, ( c = frac{a}{2} = 1 ). - So the coordinates of ( F ) are ( F(1, 0) ). 2. **Calculate ( b )**: - We know ( c/a = e ) leads to ( frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{2} ). - Using ( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 ): [ 4 = b^2 + 1 implies b^2 = 3 implies b = sqrt{3}. ] 3. **Determine the Midpoint ( M )**: - Let ( P(x, y) ) with ( frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1 ). - The coordinates of midpoint ( M ) of ( A(-2, 0) ) and ( P(x, y) ) are: [ M left( frac{x-2}{2}, frac{y}{2} right). ] 4. **Equation of Line ( OM )**: - Slope of ( OM ), given ( O(0,0) ) and ( M left( frac{x-2}{2}, frac{y}{2} right) ): [ text{slope} = frac{y/2 - 0}{(x-2)/2 - 0} = frac{y}{x-2}. ] - Equation of line ( OM ) becomes: [ y = frac{y}{x-2} x implies y(x-2) = y x. ] 5. **Intersection with ( x = 4 )**: - Placing ( x = 4 ): [ y = y implies y = y. ] - Intersection point ( D ) at ( (4, D_y) ). 6. **Equation of Line through ( O ) Parallel to ( AP )**: - Parallel to ( AP ) gives same slope: [ y = frac{y}{x-2} (x - 0) = frac{y}{x-2} x. ] 7. **Intersection with ( x = 4 )**: - Placing ( x = 4 ): [ E_y = frac{4(x-2)}{4} = y. ] 8. **Equal Angles**: - As the slopes from points ( OD ) and ( OE ) maintains similarity: [ therefore angle ODF = angle OEF. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"Let (ABC) be an acute triangle with (AB neq AC).

Let P be the foot of the altitude from B onto AC, and Q the foot of the altitude from C onto AB. Let M be the midpoint of BC. 3. The bisectors of angle BAC and angle PMQ intersect at a point R. We need to show that the circumcircles of triangle BQR and triangle CPR intersect again on BC. 4. Denote by X the second intersection point of the circumcircles of triangle BQR and triangle CPR. We need to prove that X lies on the line segment BC. 5. By considering angles at X: [ angle BXC = angle BXR + angle CXR = 180^circ - angle BQR + 180^circ - angle CPR ] Using the fact that angle BQR and angle CPR represent the angles subtended by arc BR and CR on the circles respectively, hence: [ angle BQR = angle AQR quad text{and} quad angle CPR = angle APR ] 6. Substitute the known values: [ angle BXR + angle CXR = 180^circ - angle AQR + 180^circ - angle APR ] Simplifying gives: [ angle BXC = angle AQR + angle APR ] 7. To show angle AQR + angle APR = 180^circ, we need to prove A, P, Q, R are concyclic. 8. Since triangles BCP and BCQ are right-angled at P and Q respectively, P and Q lie on the circle with diameter BC, with center M. This implies MP = MQ, meaning that triangle PMQ is isosceles, and its angle bisector from angle PMQ is also the perpendicular bisector of PQ. 9. The point R is the intersection of the angle bisectors angle PAC and angle PMQ. - Therefore, R lies on the perpendicular bisector of PQ and on the angle bisector of angle PAQ making R the circumcenter of the cyclic quadrilateral APQR. 10. Since R lies on the circumcircle of triangle APQ, this confirms: [ angle AQR + angle APR = 180^circ ] 11. Hence, [ angle BXR + angle CXR = angle AQR + angle APR = 180^circ ] Therefore, B, C, P, Q, R all lie on the circle that confirms that X must lie on BC. # Conclusion [ boxed{X text{is on} BC} ]"},{"instruction":"f Billy rode his bike 17 times, John rode his bike twice as many times, their mother rode her bike 10 times more than John, and their cousin Amy rode her bike 3 times more than the square root of the sum of John's and Billy's rides, how many times did they ride their bikes in total?","output":"Let's break it down step by step: 1.

Now, let's find combinations of these squares that add up to 54: 1. 1^2 + 1^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 1 + 49 = 51 (not equal to 54) 2. 1^2 + 3^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 9 + 49 = 59 (not equal to 54) 3. 1^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 25 + 25 = 51 (not equal to 54) 4. 3^2 + 3^2 + 6^2 = 9 + 9 + 36 = 54 (equal to 54) 5. 1^2 + 4^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 16 + 49 = 66 (not equal to 54) 6. 2^2 + 2^2 + 7^2 = 4 + 4 + 49 = 57 (not equal to 54) 7. 2^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 25 + 25 = 54 (equal to 54) 8. 1^2 + 2^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 4 + 49 = 54 (equal to 54) 9. 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 16 + 25 = 50 (not equal to 54) 10. 1^2 + 6^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 36 + 25 = 62 (not equal to 54) From the combinations listed above, we have found three different ways to express the number 54 as the sum of three squares: - 3^2 + 3^2 + 6^2 = 54 - 2^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 = 54 - 1^2 + 2^2 + 7^2 = 54 Therefore, the number boxed{54} can be expressed as the sum of three squares in three different ways."},{"instruction":"Calculate the sum of the series: [frac{7}{2^3 cdot 6^3} + frac{11}{6^3 cdot 10^3} + frac{15}{10^3 cdot 14^3} + dotsb.]","output":"We posit that the nth term of the series can be expressed as: [frac{4n+3}{(4n-2)^3(4n+2)^3}.] To telescope, calculate: [(4n + 2)^3 - (4n - 2)^3 = [(4n + 2) - (4n - 2)][(4n + 2)^2 + (4n + 2)(4n - 2) + (4n - 2)^2].] This simplifies to: [4 cdot [16n^2 + 12n + 4 + 16n^2 - 16n^2 + 4 - 12n] = 4 cdot (16n^2 + 8) = 64n^2 + 32.] Thus, [frac{4n+3}{(4n-2)^3(4n+2)^3} = frac{1}{16} left(frac{1}{(4n-2)^3} - frac{1}{(4n+2)^3}right).] Summing the series: [frac{7}{2^3 cdot 6^3} + frac{11}{6^3 cdot 10^3} + dotsb = frac{1}{16} left( frac{1}{2^3} - frac{1}{6^3} right) + frac{1}{16} left( frac{1}{6^3} - frac{1}{10^3} right) + dotsb = frac{1}{16} cdot frac{1}{2^3}.] After simplifying, the resulting sum is: [boxed{frac{1}{128}}.] Conclusion: The series does indeed telescope, and the sum is found to be frac{1}{128}."},{"instruction":"Given a segment ( AB ), a line ( l ) that is not parallel to it, and a point ( M ) on this line, using only a twosided ruler, construct the points of intersection of the line ( l ) with the circle of radius ( AB ) centered at ( M ).","output":"1. **Construct the parallelogram ( ABMN ):** - Start with the given segment ( AB ), the non-parallel line ( l ), and the point ( M ) on the line ( l ). - To construct parallelogram ( ABMN ), extend segment ( AB ) to point ( N ) such that ( M ) is a vertex of the parallelogram, and ( N ) lies on a line parallel to ( AB ) through ( M ). 2. **Identify the direction of ( MN ):** - Draw line ( MN ), the direction of ( MN ) must be parallel to ( AB ). 3. **Construct lines through ( N ) parallel to angle bisectors of the angles between lines ( l ) and ( MN ):** - Determine the angles formed between line ( l ) and ( MN ). - Find the angle bisectors of these angles.

Now, to find out how many blocks she needs to walk east to get home, we need to consider her initial northward walk and her southward walk. Since she walked 3 blocks north and then 8 blocks south, she is 8 - 3 = 5 blocks further south from her starting point. To get back to her starting point in the north-south direction, she doesn't need to walk any blocks north because she is already 5 blocks south of her starting point (which is the same as her home). In the east-west direction, she walked 21 blocks west, so she needs to walk 21 blocks east to get back to her starting point. Now, let's calculate the time it will take her to walk home. She needs to walk 21 blocks east at a rate of 2 blocks per minute. Time to walk home = Number of blocks east / Walking speed Time to walk home = 21 blocks / 2 blocks/minute Time to walk home = 10.5 minutes The ratio of the number of blocks she walked east to the number of blocks she walked south is: Ratio (East:South) = Number of blocks east / Number of blocks south Ratio (East:South) = 21 blocks / 8 blocks Ratio (East:South) = 21:8 So, it will take Janet 10.5 minutes to get home, and the ratio of the number of blocks she walked east to the number of blocks she walked south is boxed{21:8} ."},{"instruction":"There are 10 points marked on a circle.

Specifically, the sequence contains consecutive natural numbers: [ 1, 2, 3, ldots, 2018 ] In such a sequence, half of the numbers are even, and half are odd. Therefore: [ text{Number of even numbers} = frac{2018}{2} = 1009 ] [ text{Number of odd numbers} = 1009 ] 2. **Criteria for the sum of four consecutive numbers to be odd**: The sum of four numbers is odd if and only if the number of odd numbers in that set of four is odd. Since we are dealing with four numbers, there are two possibilities to get an odd sum: - Either three of the four numbers are odd. - Or one of the four numbers is odd. 3. **Determine the impossibility of the arrangement**: Let's analyze whether we can arrange the numbers such that the sum of any four consecutive numbers always fits one of the two possibilities mentioned above. If we were to arrange the numbers such that each group of four consecutive numbers has three odd and one even number: - Realize that each set of four overlapping numbers must also satisfy this condition due to the circular arrangement.

But we will proceed to investigate if valid indices could potentially exist. Solving for c: F_c = 2F_a This equation needs to correspond to indices in the Fibonacci sequence. For simplicity, perhaps this condition is more straightforward if c = a + 1. Thus, F_c = F_{a+1}, implying 2F_a = F_{a+1}, which usually corresponds to a relation in Fibonacci.

Similarly, we need to find the LCM of the divisors when the number is increased by 5 and then subtract 5 from it. The number we are looking for should satisfy both conditions. Let's first find the LCM of the divisors when the number is diminished by 3: 12, 16, 18, 21, 28, 35, and 39. The prime factorization of these numbers is: - 12 = 2^2 * 3 - 16 = 2^4 - 18 = 2 * 3^2 - 21 = 3 * 7 - 28 = 2^2 * 7 - 35 = 5 * 7 - 39 = 3 * 13 The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in the factorization of these numbers: LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 13 Now, let's calculate the LCM: LCM = 16 * 9 * 5 * 7 * 13 LCM = 144 * 5 * 7 * 13 LCM = 720 * 91 LCM = 65520 So, the smallest number that is divisible by all these numbers when diminished by 3 is 65520.

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5. Since 65523 + 5 = 65528, and 65528 is not divisible by 45, we need to find a common number that satisfies both conditions. The LCM we found (65520) is already divisible by 3^2 and 5 (factors of 45), so we don't need to find a new LCM. Instead, we need to find a multiple of 65520 that, when increased by 5, is divisible by 45. Since 65520 is divisible by 9 (3^2), we just need to ensure that the number, when increased by 5, ends with a 0 or 5 to be divisible by 45. The number 65520 already ends with a 0, so when we add 5, it will end with a 5, making it divisible by 45.

Find f(2023)+f(2024).","output":"Given the properties of the function f(x), let's break down the solution into detailed steps: 1. **Periodicity of f(x)**: The fact that f(x+4)=f(x) implies f(x) is periodic with a period of 4. This means that for any integer k, f(x+4k)=f(x). 2. **Oddness of f(x)**: Since f(x) is an odd function, it satisfies f(-x)=-f(x) for all x in its domain. Particularly, this means f(0)=0, because odd functions always pass through the origin. 3. **Calculating f(2023)+f(2024)**: - For f(2023), we notice that 2023 = 2020 + 3, where 2020 is a multiple of 4. Therefore, f(2023)=f(2020+3)=f(3), utilizing the periodicity of f(x). - Similarly, f(2024) = f(2020 + 4) = f(4). Again, by the periodic property, we know f(4)=f(0)=0. 4. **Finding f(3)**: To find f(3), we look at the given value f(-3)=-3. Since f(x) is odd, f(-3)=-f(3). Therefore, -f(3)=-3 implies f(3)=3. 5. **Summing f(2023) and f(2024)**: We have f(2023)+f(2024) = f(3) + f(4) = 3 + 0 = 3.

Given that 2a < b, it follows that -frac{b}{2a} < -1. This means the axis of symmetry is to the left of the point (-1, y_{3}). 2. **Positioning of Points A, B, and C Relative to the Axis of Symmetry:** Since the axis of symmetry is to the left of x = -1, and we know the points Aleft(frac{1}{2}, y_{1}right), Bleft(0, y_{2}right), and Cleft(-1, y_{3}right) are on the parabola, their positioning relative to the axis of symmetry is crucial. Given the axis of symmetry is to the left of all these points, and considering the parabola opens upwards, we can deduce the following about their vertical positioning: - Moving from left to right, starting from a point left of the axis of symmetry (in this case, all our points are to the right), the value of y first decreases until the vertex (which is on the axis of symmetry) and then increases. 3. **Determining the Relationship Between y_{1}, y_{2}, and y_{3}:** Given the points' x-coordinates are -1 < 0 < frac{1}{2}, and all points are to the right of the axis of symmetry, as we move from C to B to A, we are moving away from the axis of symmetry on an upward-opening parabola. This means the y-value increases as we move from C to A through B.

Given that a < 0, we analyze the sign of f'(x) in different intervals: - For x in (0, 1), since a < 0, we have f'(x) < 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing in this interval. - For x in (1, +infty), f'(x) > 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing in this interval. Thus, the minimum value of f(x) occurs at x=1, which is f(1) = -1 - 2a. As x rightarrow 0, f(x) rightarrow +infty, and as x rightarrow +infty, f(x) rightarrow +infty as well.

We start by considering a circle defined by the equation [ (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 ] where ((a, b)) is the center and (r) is the radius of the circle. 2. We are given that the parabola (y = x^2) and the circle intersect at exactly two points, (A) and (B), and the tangents at point (A) are the same for both the circle and the parabola. Let's assume (A(1, 1)) and (B(-3, 9)) as the points of intersection. 3. Let's first derive the tangent lines. The tangent to the parabola (y = x^2) at any point ( (x_0, y_0) ) (where (y_0 = x_0^2)) is given by: [ y - y_0 = 2x_0(x - x_0) ] 4. Calculating the tangent at point (A(1, 1)): [ y - 1 = 2(1)(x - 1) implies y - 1 = 2x - 2 implies y = 2x - 1 ] 5. Since the tangents at point (A) coincide for both the parabola and circle, the circle must also have the equation of the tangent as (y = 2x - 1). 6.

Substituting (y = x^2) into the circle’s equation: [ (x - a)^2 + (x^2 - b)^2 = r^2 ] 8. This leads to the fourth-degree equation in (x) and if any 3rd-degree term exists, the sum of the roots will be zero due to the symmetry of the circle around the axes. 9.

The sum of the roots of the polynomial derived from substitution must then be (0): [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 1 + 1 - 3 + x_4 = 0 implies x_4 = 1 ] 10. Hence, (x_3 = -3) indicates an intersection (not tangency but a simple intersection) at (B (-3, 9)), where C does not coincide with point B hence lacks tangency condition. 11.

The move allows us to choose any ( 2 times 2 ) square and change all of its squares to the opposite color. 1. **Case ( n equiv 0 pmod{4} ):** - **Claim:** If ( 4 mid n ), then we can turn all cells of the grid into the same color. - **Proof:** It is sufficient to show that we can do this when ( n = 4 ), since we can divide larger squares into non-overlapping ( 4 times 4 ) squares. - **Construction for ( n = 4 ):** - Start with the initial chessboard pattern: [ begin{array}{cccc} B & W & B & W W & B & W & B B & W & B & W W & B & W & B end{array} ] - Apply the move to the top-left ( 2 times 2 ) square: [ begin{array}{cccc} B & W & B & W W & B & W & B B & W & B & W W & B & W & B end{array} rightarrow begin{array}{cccc} B & B & B & W B & B & W & B B & W & B & W W & B & W & B end{array} ] - Continue applying the move to appropriate ( 2 times 2 ) squares until all cells are the same color: [ begin{array}{cccc} B & B & B & B B & B & B & B B & B & B & B B & B & B & B end{array} ] - This shows that for ( n = 4 ), we can turn all cells into the same color. By extension, for any ( n ) divisible by 4, we can achieve the same result by dividing the board into ( 4 times 4 ) squares and applying the same process to each. 2. **Case ( n notequiv 0 pmod{4} ):** - **Claim:** If ( n ) is not divisible by 4, then we cannot turn all cells of the grid into the same color. - **Proof by induction:** - **Base case:** Consider ( n = 3 ). The initial pattern is: [ begin{array}{ccc} B & W & B W & B & W B & W & B end{array} ] - Any ( 2 times 2 ) move will not be able to change the parity of the number of black and white cells in the grid. Since the number of black and white cells is not equal, it is impossible to make all cells the same color. - **Inductive step:** Assume the claim holds for ( n - 4 ). We need to show it holds for ( n ). - Consider ( n equiv 1 pmod{4} ). Without loss of generality, let the top-left cell be black. The parity of the number of black and white cells does not change after each operation. Since there are an even number of white cells, we must turn the whole grid black. - To turn the top row black, we must change the bolded rectangle: [ begin{array}{cccc} B & mathbf{W} & mathbf{B} & W W & mathbf{B} & mathbf{W} & B end{array} ] - Then we must change the next bolded rectangle: [ begin{array}{cccc} B & B & mathbf{W} & mathbf{W} W & W & mathbf{B} & mathbf{B} end{array} ] - Thus we obtain: [ begin{array}{cccc} B & B & B & B W & W & W & W end{array} ] - By induction, the claim is true. Since the second row has an odd number of white cells, we cannot turn all of them black. Thus, we cannot finish when ( n equiv 1 pmod{4} ). 3. **Conclusion:** - The other cases (( n equiv 2 pmod{4} ) and ( n equiv 3 pmod{4} )) follow similarly by reducing the case of ( n ) to the case of ( n - 4 ), yielding our desired result.

What is the total distance of the biathlon?","output":"First, let's calculate the time it took to complete the running portion of the biathlon. Since the distance of the run is 10 miles and the velocity during the run is 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Velocity For the run: Time_run = Distance_run / Velocity_run Time_run = 10 miles / 10 mph Time_run = 1 hour Now we know that the running portion took 1 hour. Since the total time for the biathlon is 6 hours, we can calculate the time spent on the bicycle race by subtracting the time spent running from the total time: Time_bike = Total_time - Time_run Time_bike = 6 hours - 1 hour Time_bike = 5 hours Now we can calculate the distance of the bicycle race using the velocity during the bicycle race and the time spent on the bicycle: Distance_bike = Velocity_bike * Time_bike Distance_bike = 29 mph * 5 hours Distance_bike = 145 miles Finally, we can calculate the total distance of the biathlon by adding the distance of the run and the distance of the bicycle race: Total_distance = Distance_run + Distance_bike Total_distance = 10 miles + 145 miles Total_distance = 155 miles The total distance of the biathlon is boxed{155} miles."},{"instruction":"A hall is organizing seats in rows for a lecture.

To do this, we follow the steps below: First, distribute the terms inside the brackets: [y = 900m - 15m^2 - 7200 + 120m] Combine like terms: [y = -15m^2 + 1020m - 7200] To find the maximum profit, we need to rewrite this quadratic equation in vertex form, which is given by y = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola, and a is the coefficient of the quadratic term. The vertex form gives us the maximum or minimum value of the quadratic function depending on the sign of a. Since a = -15 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, and the vertex represents the maximum point. Rewriting the quadratic equation in vertex form involves completing the square: [y = -15m^2 + 1020m - 7200] [= -15(m^2 - 68m) - 7200] To complete the square, we add and subtract (frac{68}{2})^2 = 34^2 = 1156 inside the bracket, remembering to multiply 1156 by -15 when subtracting it outside the bracket to keep the equation balanced: [y = -15(m^2 - 68m + 1156) - 7200 + 15 cdot 1156] [= -15(m - 34)^2 + 10140] This equation is now in vertex form, and we can see that the vertex is (34, 10140).

He then placed the pan under a stream of cold water from the tap but noticed that the handle felt hotter than before. We need to understand why this happened and verify if it conforms to the laws of thermodynamics. 2. **Explanation of the Phenomenon:** The water stream exerts a certain force on the pan, requiring Gavrila to grip the handle more firmly to hold it in place. This increased grip results in a larger contact area between Gavrila’s hand and the handle. Therefore: - **Increased Contact Area:** By squeezing the handle more tightly, the contact area between Gavrila’s hand and the handle increases. - **Increased Heat Flow Rate:** According to Fourier’s law of heat conduction, the heat flow rate (Q) through a material is given by: [ Q = -kA frac{dT}{dx} ] where: - (k) is the thermal conductivity of the material, - (A) is the contact area, - (frac{dT}{dx}) is the temperature gradient. With a larger contact area, the amount of heat transmitted to Gavrila's hand from the handle increases, even though the temperature of the handle might not have increased. 3. **Sensation of Heat:** The sensation of heat is related to the rate at which heat flows into the skin, rather than just the static temperature. When the contact area between Gavrila’s hand and the handle increases, the rate of heat transfer to his hand also increases, making the handle feel hotter. 4. **Conclusion:** The increased contact area due to the stronger grip on the handle leads to an increased rate of heat transfer to Gavrila’s hand. This explains why the handle felt hotter when the pan was put under cold water. This observation is in compliance with the laws of thermodynamics as the heat transfer mechanism and human perception of heat are both correctly explained by thermal conduction principles.

For the product of 240 and a given integer k to be a perfect square, every prime factor in the product must appear to an even power. The current factorization of 240 has 2^4, which is even, but both 3 and 5 appear to the first power, which is odd. 4.

Therefore, we are looking for the smallest n such that at least 5 of the numbers in {1, 2, ldots, 10} divide n. 3. **Finding the smallest n with at least 5 divisors**: We need to find the smallest number n that has at least 5 divisors from the set {1, 2, ldots, 10}. The divisors of n correspond to the horses that are at the starting point at time n. 4. **Checking small numbers**: - n = 1 has 1 divisor: {1}. - n = 2 has 2 divisors: {1, 2}. - n = 3 has 2 divisors: {1, 3}. - n = 4 has 3 divisors: {1, 2, 4}. - n = 5 has 2 divisors: {1, 5}. - n = 6 has 4 divisors: {1, 2, 3, 6}. - n = 7 has 2 divisors: {1, 7}. - n = 8 has 4 divisors: {1, 2, 4, 8}. - n = 9 has 3 divisors: {1, 3, 9}. - n = 10 has 4 divisors: {1, 2, 5, 10}. - n = 12 has 6 divisors: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}. 5. **Conclusion**: The smallest number n that has at least 5 divisors from the set {1, 2, ldots, 10} is 12.

A replies with ( |X + Y a b| + |Y + Z b c| + |Z + X c a| ).","output":"We need to determine how many triples ( B ) needs to name to be sure of identifying ( A )'s chosen triple ( (X, Y, Z) ). Consider that ( T ) is the set of all triples ((x, y, z)) where ( x, y, z ) are non-negative integers less than 10. This gives us ( 10^3 = 1000 ) possible triples in total. Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. **Understanding the Response Function**: The function ( A ) provides is: [ f(X, Y, Z, a, b, c) = |X + Y - a - b| + |Y + Z - b - c| + |Z + X - c - a| ] This ensures that each response is a non-negative integer. 2. **Parity Analysis**: Note that the parity (evenness or oddness) of ( |x| ) is the same as ( x )'s parity. Therefore, [ |X + Y - a - b| + |Y + Z - b - c| + |Z + X - c - a| ] has the same parity as: [ (X + Y - a - b) + (Y + Z - b - c) + (Z + X - c - a) = 2(X + Y + Z) - 2(a + b + c). ] Since the sum is doubled, it is guaranteed to be even. Hence, all responses are even integers ranging from 0 to 54 (since ( X, Y, Z < 10 ) and each term in the sum of differences ranges from 0 to ( 2 cdot 9 = 18 )). 3. **Identifying Possible Responses**: The even integers from 0 to 54 make up 28 possible values. This is because the sequence ( 0, 2, 4, ldots, 54 ) contains ( frac{54}{2} + 1 = 28 ) terms. 4. **Determining the Number of Queries**: Given that each query resolves the possible value space down to one of 28 outcomes, we see if querying twice is sufficient: [ 28^2 = 784 < 1000 ] Therefore, two queries are insufficient as 784 possibilities are fewer than the 1000 required to parse every possibility. 5. **Solution Approach**: Let's denote ( S = X + Y + Z ). - ( B )'s first triple guess is always ( (0, 0, 0) ). ( A ) replies with: [ 2(X + Y + Z) = 2S ] This reveals ( S ). - Based on the value of ( S ): - **If ( S leq 9 )**: - ( B ) next guesses ( (9, 0, 0) ). ( A ) replies: [ |X + Y - 9| + |Y + Z| + |Z + X - 9| = 18 - 2X ] Revealing ( X ). - Then, ( B ) guesses ( (0, 9, 0) ). ( A ) replies with: [ 18 - 2Y ] Revealing ( Y ), ( Z ) is now known from ( S = X + Y + Z ). - **If ( S geq 18 )**: - ( B ) guesses ( (0, 9, 9) ). ( A ) replies: [ 2X ] Revealing ( X ). - Then, ( B ) guesses ( (9, 0, 9) ). ( A ) reveals: [ 2Y ] Revealing ( Y ), ( Z ) is known from ( S = X + Y + Z ). - **If ( 9 < S < 18 )**: - ( B ) makes the guess ( (9, S-9, 0) ) and depending on whether ( X + Z geq 9 ) or not, the response reveals ( Z ). We define ( K ) as half the reply. - If ( K = Z ), if ( S - K leq 9 ), then guessing ( (S-K, 0, K) ) reveals ( Y ). - If ( S - K > 9 ), guessing ( (9, S-K-9, K) ) gives ( K = Z ) or ( 18 - 2X ).

Thus, we can split the vertex set into two disjoint sets (A) and (B) such that no edges exist within (A) or within (B). 5. **Maximal Independent Set Analysis:** - Since (A) and (B) are independent sets, the cardinality of either (A) or (B) must be at least (lceil frac{n}{2} rceil). # Conclusion: The largest integer (r) for question 1 is: [ boxed{leftlceil frac{n}{2} rightrceil} ] # 2) Determining the largest integer r such that for any n real numbers, there exists a set of r indices such that the difference between any two different indexed elements is not equal to 1 or an irrational number alpha. 1. **Graph Representation:** - Introduce graph (G) where vertices correspond to the real numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n). - Connect vertices (a_i) and (a_j) with an edge if (|a_i - a_j| = 1) or (|a_i - a_j| = alpha). 2. **Cycle Analysis and Mixed Parity:** - Consider a cycle (C = (a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, ldots, a_{i_r} = a_{i_1})). - Note that for any (k), (a_{i_k} - a_{i_1} = (a_{i_k} - a_{i_{k-1}}) + (a_{i_{k-1}} - a_{i_{k-2}}) + cdots + (a_{i_2} - a_{i_1})). - Each term in the sum is either (+1, -1, +alpha,) or (-alpha), so the difference (a_{i_k} - a_{i_1}) can be written in the form (n + malpha), where (n) and (m) are integers. 3. **Parity and Irrationality:** - If (a_{i_r} - a_{i_1} = 0), it implies that (n + malpha = 0), which cannot be true unless (n = 0) and (m = 0) because (alpha) is irrational. This also implies the length (r) is even. 4. **Graph Bipartiteness:** - Since (G) also does not contain any odd-length cycles, it is bipartite. We can again split the vertex set into two disjoint sets (A) and (B) such that no edges exist within (A) or within (B). 5. **Maximal Independent Set Analysis:** - As in part 1, the largest independent set in a bipartite graph of (n) vertices is at least (lceil frac{n}{2} rceil). # Conclusion: The largest integer (r) for question 2 is: [ boxed{leftlceil frac{n}{2} rightrceil} ]"},{"instruction":"triangle PQR, where PQ is the hypotenuse of the right triangle, a line segment starts moving from vertex P to vertex R.

Let two circles odot O_1 and odot O_2 intersect at points A and B. 2. Through point B, draw two lines intersecting the circles at points P, Q and C, D, respectively. Here, P, C lie on odot O_1 and Q, D lie on odot O_2. 3. Given that CD perp AB. We need to prove that the ratio PC : QD is a constant value. 4. Connect points A to P, C, Q, and D. We know that: [ angle PAQ = angle CAD ] This is because angles subtended by the same arc in the intersecting circles are equal. Therefore, we have: [ angle PAC = angle QAD ] 5. Given that CD perp AB, we can infer that triangle PAC and triangle QAD are right triangles with the right angles at point C and D, respectively. 6. Since angle PAC = angle QAD and they are right triangles, by AA similarity (angle-angle similarity), we have: [ triangle PAC sim triangle QAD ] From the similarity of triangles, the corresponding sides are proportional. Therefore: [ frac{PC}{QD} = frac{AC}{AD} ] Since AC and AD are lengths from point A to C and D, and by the property of the circles, this ratio remains constant irrespective of the specific positions of the points on the circles. # Conclusion: Therefore, PC : QD = AC : AD, which is a constant value.

First, let's find the total number of ways to select 2 apples from the basket. There are 7 apples in total, so the number of ways to choose 2 apples is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!) Where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \\"!\\" denotes factorial. So, the total number of ways to choose 2 apples from 7 is: C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7 - 2)!) C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!) C(7, 2) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) C(7, 2) = 42 / 2 C(7, 2) = 21 Now, let's find the number of ways to select 2 apples that include the spoiled apple. Since we must include the spoiled apple, we only need to choose 1 more apple from the remaining 6 good apples. C(6, 1) = 6! / (1! * (6 - 1)!) C(6, 1) = 6! / (1! * 5!) C(6, 1) = 6 / 1 C(6, 1) = 6 So, there are 6 ways to choose 2 apples that include the spoiled apple. Finally, to find the probability that the 2 apples selected will include the spoiled apple, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes: Probability = Number of ways to select 2 apples including the spoiled apple / Total number of ways to select 2 apples Probability = 6 / 21 Probability = 2 / 7 Therefore, the probability that the 2 apples selected will include the spoiled apple is boxed{2/7} ."},{"instruction":"Jerry mows 8 acres of lawn each week.

The ratio of the areas of triangle CRE to triangle ABE is given by the square of the ratio of their heights (since the base AE = BE for triangle ABE). The height of triangle CRE from R to CE is CR cdot sin theta and the height of triangle ABE from E to AB is BE cdot sin theta = frac{1}{2}AB cdot sin theta (as AB is the diameter). 4. So, the ratio of the areas is: [ left(frac{CR cdot sin theta}{frac{1}{2}AB cdot sin theta}right)^2 = left(frac{2CR}{AB}right)^2 = 1 text{ (since } CR = frac{1}{2}AB text{ as } CR text{ is a radius)} ] Thus, the answer is boxed{1}."},{"instruction":"f a number x is 10 % less than another number y and y is 10 % more than a certain number, then x is equal to 123.75.

On Sunday evening Rebecca and her husband each had another slice of pie. There are 5 slices remaining. How many slices did Rebecca eat initially?","output":"Let's start by calculating the total number of slices from the 2 pies. Since each pie was sliced into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 2 pies * 8 slices/pie = 16 slices. After Rebecca and her family and friends ate some of the pie, and before she and her husband had another slice each on Sunday evening, there were 5 slices remaining. However, since Rebecca and her husband each had a slice, we need to add those 2 slices back to the remaining slices to find out how many slices were left before they ate. So, 5 slices remaining + 2 slices (Rebecca and her husband ate) = 7 slices remaining before Sunday evening. We know that Rebecca's family and friends ate 50% of the remaining pies over the weekend, which means that the 7 slices were 50% of the pie that was left. To find out the total number of slices before they ate 50%, we can calculate 7 slices / 50% = 7 slices / 0.5 = 14 slices. This means that before Rebecca's family and friends ate 50% of the pie, there were 14 slices remaining. Since we started with 16 slices, we can now calculate how many slices Rebecca ate initially by subtracting the 14 slices that were left from the original 16 slices. 16 slices (original total) - 14 slices (remaining before 50% was eaten) = 2 slices.

Denote the vertices of the desired isosceles triangle as (A, B,) and (C). Suppose (angle A DC = 45^circ), where (D) is the vertex of the (45^circ) angle. 2. **Reflect the point (P):** Reflect the point (P) across the line containing the vertex (C) to get the point (P'). This reflection ensures that: [angle P' C P = 2 times angle D C P] 3. **Set up the isosceles triangle properties:** Since ( triangle A B C ) is isosceles, we have: [ angle A B C = angle C A B = alpha quad text{and} quad angle B C A = 180^circ - 2alpha ] 4. **Calculate internal angles:** From the properties of triangle and given angles: [ angle C A D = 180^circ - alpha quad text{and} quad angle D C P = angle D C A = (180^circ - alpha) - angle A D C = alpha - 45^circ ] 5. **Validate the angle through reflection property:** Due to reflection, [ angle P' C P = 2 cdot angle D C P = 2(alpha - 45^circ) = 2alpha - 90^circ ] 6. **Establish perpendicularity for point constraint:** We aim to show that ( angle B C P' = 90^circ ): [ angle B C P' = angle B C A + angle P' C P = (180^circ - 2alpha) + (2alpha - 90^circ ) = 90^circ ] 7. **Use Thales' theorem for positioning:** By Thales' theorem, given that (angle B C P' = 90^circ), the circle with diameter (P'Q) (Thales' circle) will determine point (C) such that (C) lies somewhere on this circle.

The number of black tiles along the diagonal is equal to the side length of the square because there is one black tile per centimeter along the diagonal. Therefore, the side length of the large square is 81 cm. Next, we need to calculate the area covered by the red tiles along the borders. Since the red tiles are 2 cm x 2 cm, they will cover 2 cm of the border width all around the square. The total length of the borders that will be covered by red tiles is the perimeter of the inner square (which is the large square minus the 2 cm border on each side). The side length of the inner square is 81 cm - 2 cm - 2 cm = 77 cm. The perimeter of the inner square is 4 * 77 cm = 308 cm. Since each red tile covers 2 cm of the border, the number of red tiles along the border is 308 cm / 2 cm = 154 red tiles.

The area covered by the black tiles is 81 cm² (since there are 81 black tiles each covering 1 cm²). The area covered by the red tiles is 154 tiles * 4 cm² per tile = 616 cm². The total area covered by the black and red tiles is 81 cm² + 616 cm² = 697 cm². The remaining area for the white tiles is 6561 cm² - 697 cm² = 5864 cm². Since each white tile has a dimension of 1 cm x 2 cm, each white tile covers an area of 2 cm².

Upon reevaluation, the correct approach is as follows: - First, place C. There are 6 positions where C can be placed. - Then, choose positions for A and B.

If C is not at an end, A and B must be on the same side, which gives us 4 times 3 = 12 arrangements for each side of C. Since there are 4 positions where C is not at an end, this gives 12 times 4 = 48 arrangements. However, this calculation overlooks the fact that A and B can be on either side of C in any position, doubling the number of arrangements. - Finally, arrange D, E, and F in the remaining 3 positions, which can be done in 3! = 6 ways.

At the end of the race, there are 80 people in the cars. Since there were 60 people at the start, the cars must have gained 80 - 60 = 20 people at the halfway point. Now, we need to distribute these 20 additional people among the 20 cars.

Start by rewriting the given inequality: [ m^{2} + left( cos^{2} theta - 5 right) m + 4 sin^{2} theta geqslant 0 ] 2. Notice that ( cos^{2} theta + sin^{2} theta = 1 ). Hence, we can express the inequality in a different form by isolating ( sin^{2} theta ): [ 4 sin^{2} theta = 4 (1 - cos^{2} theta) = 4 - 4 cos^{2} theta ] This transforms the inequality into: [ m^{2} + left( cos^{2} theta - 5 right) m + 4 - 4 cos^{2} theta geqslant 0 ] 3. Combine the terms involving ( cos^{2} theta ): [ m^{2} + m cos^{2} theta - 5 m + 4 - 4 cos^{2} theta geqslant 0 ] Rearrange: [ m^{2} + (m - 4) cos^{2} theta - 5 m + 4 geqslant 0 ] 4.

For example, consider the planes [ x = i, quad y = i, quad z = i quad text{for} quad i = 1, 2, ldots, n ] These planes include all required points in ( S ) and do not pass through the origin ((0, 0, 0)). Another possible collection consists of planes [ x + y + z = k quad text{for} quad k = 1, 2, ldots, 3n ] We will show that ( 3n ) is the minimal number of such planes. 2. **Lemma 1 Statement**: Let ( P(x_1, ldots, x_k) ) be a nonzero polynomial in ( k ) variables. Suppose ( P ) vanishes at all points ((x_1, ldots, x_k)) such that ( x_1, ldots, x_k in {0, 1, ldots, n} ) and ( x_1 + cdots + x_k > 0 ), while ( P(0,0,ldots,0) neq 0 ).

For clarity, let ( y = x_k ). Let ( R(x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}, y) ) be the residue of ( P ) modulo ( Q(y) = y (y-1) cdots (y-n) ). Since ( Q(y) ) vanishes at ( y = 0, 1, ldots, n ), [ P(x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}, y) = R(x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}, y) ] for ( x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}, y in {0, 1, ldots, n} ). Hence, ( R ) must satisfy the condition of Lemma 1 for ( k-1 ) variables and ( text{deg}_y R leq n ). Expanded polynomials: [ R(x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}, y) = R_n(x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}) y^n + R_{n-1}(x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}) y^{n-1} + cdots + R_0(x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}) ] - ( R_n(x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}) ) must satisfy the induction hypothesis because all values ( a_1, ldots, a_{k-1} in {0, 1, ldots, n} ) with ( a_1 + cdots + a_{k-1} > 0 ) make ( R_n(a_1, ldots, a_{k-1}) = 0 ). Therefore, [ text{deg} R_n geq (k-1)n ] and since ( text{deg} P geq text{deg} R geq text{deg} R_n + n ), [ text{deg} P geq kn ] thus proving the lemma. 4. **Conclusion on Minimum Number of Planes**: Suppose there are ( N ) planes covering all points of ( S ) but not containing the origin.

By the properties of the polynomial, ( P left( x_0, y_0, z_0 right) = 0 ) for all ( (x_0, y_0, z_0) in S ), but ( P(0,0,0) neq 0 ).

The speed of the train is given as approximately 90 kmph. Since the man is running in the opposite direction to the train, we need to add his speed to the speed of the train to get the relative speed. Speed of train = 90 kmph Speed of man = 6 kmph (in the opposite direction) Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 90 kmph + 6 kmph Relative speed = 96 kmph Now, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to m/s to match the time given in seconds. 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds 96 kmph = 96 * (1000 / 3600) m/s 96 kmph = 96 * (5 / 18) m/s 96 kmph = 16 * 5 m/s 96 kmph = 80 m/s The relative speed between the train and the man is 80 meters per second.

We also draw diagonals overline{AC} and overline{BD}, which intersect at point H. 2. **Determine the Length of Diagonal overline{AC}**: Since triangle ACD is equilateral (due to angle ADC=60^circ and AD=CD), we have AC=24. 3. **Calculate AH and HC**: The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular, and overline{BD} bisects overline{AC}.

These boards are isosceles right triangles, given the 45^{circ} angle mentioned. 1. **Splicing the hypotenuses together**: When we splice the two hypotenuses, the angles adjacent to the hypotenuse in each triangle are both 45^{circ}. Adding these angles together gives us 45^{circ} + 45^{circ} = 90^{circ}. Since both triangles are identical, this operation results in a shape where all angles are 90^{circ} and all sides are equal, which is a square. 2. **Splicing one leg together**: If we splice the boards along one of the legs, the resulting shape retains the 90^{circ} angle from one of the triangles and the two 45^{circ} angles from each triangle at the splice point. This forms an isosceles right triangle. Alternatively, splicing the legs in a way that does not align the 90^{circ} angles can result in various parallelograms, including non-rectangular ones, rhombuses, and squares, depending on the orientation of the splice. 3. **Considering an equilateral triangle**: For a shape to be an equilateral triangle, all its internal angles must be equal to 60^{circ}.

Firstly, for a, b, c to form a triangle, they all must be non-zero, that is a, b, c in {1, 2, 3, dots, 9}. 1. **Case 1: Equilateral Triangle** An equilateral triangle requires all three sides to be equal, i.e., a = b = c. So, we must find how many numbers are in the form overline{aaa}. Clearly, there are: [ n_1 = binom{9}{1} = 9 ] 2. **Case 2: Isosceles Triangle (Non-equilateral)** An isosceles triangle with two sides equal and the third side different could be represented by a = b neq c or a = c neq b or b = c neq a. Since any two sides must be the same, we consider the remaining digit such that the triangle inequality holds. This changes according to different combinations of a, b and c. We need to determine the valid combinations of a, b, c: [ text{Total pairs of two digits from 1 to 9} = binom{9}{2} = 36 ] Each pair (a, b) can occur in three different forms (including repetition permutations): [ aab, aba, baa ] Now, we need to exclude cases where they cannot form a triangle.

Total invalid combinations = 20, as stated in the table part. For each pair (a, b) we have 3 permutations.

Therefore, if we have chosen a digit for the hundreds place, there are 8 remaining digits. Since the tens place must be smaller than both, it can be any of the 8 digits minus the one chosen for the units place, giving us 7 options after choosing the units place digit. 3. **Units Place**: After choosing a digit for the hundreds place, we have 8 digits left. Since the units place digit must be different from the tens place digit and greater than it, we can choose any of the remaining 8 digits after choosing the hundreds place digit.

The radical center R is found as the point where the radical axis of S_1 and S_2 meets the radical axis of S_2 and S_3. 2. **Infinite Set of Spheres:** Any new sphere S with center C that passes through the radical center R and has the radius R_C, chosen such that R_C satisfies the condition for the power of point equations for all three initial spheres, will share the same radical center R. 3. **Generating Spheres:** By selecting infinite such centers C, one can generate an infinite set of spheres all passing through the common radical center R. Hence, this creates a spherical net with infinite spheres. 4. **Classification of the Net:** Depending on whether the radical center lies inside all spheres, touches them, or lies outside them, the spherical net can be categorized as: - Elliptic if R lies inside all spheres. - Parabolic if R touches all spheres. - Hyperbolic if R lies outside all spheres.

Thus, as ( n to infty ): [ a_n geq 4^{n-2} a_2 text{ for } n geq 2 ] Thus, [ lim_{n to infty} frac{1}{a_{n+1} a_{n+2}} = 0 ] Therefore, [ sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{a_k a_{k+2}} < frac{1}{288} ] and [ lim_{n to infty} sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{a_k a_{k+2}} = frac{1}{288} ] 6. **Conclusion:** The smallest value of ( C ) satisfying the given inequality is: [ boxed{frac{1}{288}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let the universal set U={1,2,3,4,5}, set M={1,2,3}, and set N={2,3,5}.

This is because 120 can be factored as ( 3 times 5 times 8 ) and these numbers are pairwise relatively prime. Let's rewrite ( n^{7} - n^{3} ) in a factored form. [ n^{7} - n^{3} = n^{3}(n^{4} - 1) ] Noting that ( n^4 - 1 ) is a difference of squares, we can further factor it: [ n^4 - 1 = (n^2 - 1)(n^2 + 1) ] And then ( n^2 - 1 ) can be factored again as another difference of squares: [ n^2 - 1 = (n - 1)(n + 1) ] Thus, [ n^{7} - n^{3} = n^{3}(n^2 - 1)(n^2 + 1) = n^3 (n - 1)(n + 1)(n^2 + 1) ] Breaking it down: [ n^{7} - n^{3} = (n - 1) cdot n cdot (n + 1) cdot n^2 cdot (n^2 + 1) ] Now, we show divisibility by 3, 5, and 8. 1. **Divisibility by 3:** The numbers ((n - 1)), (n), and ((n + 1)) are three consecutive integers. Thus, one of them must be divisible by 3. Therefore, the product ((n - 1)n(n + 1)) is divisible by 3. Since (n^3) and (n^2 + 1) do not affect the overall divisibility by 3, (n^{7} - n^{3}) is divisible by 3. 2. **Divisibility by 8:** - If ( n ) is even, write ( n = 2k ). Then, [ n^3 = (2k)^3 = 8k^3 ] which is clearly divisible by 8. Therefore, ( n^{7} - n^{3} ) is divisible by 8. - If ( n ) is odd, ( n^2 ) is odd, so both ( (n^2 + 1) ) and ( (n - 1) cdot n cdot (n + 1) ) will contain even factors: ( n ) is odd, and both ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are even. In fact, one of ( n-1 ) or ( n+1 ) is divisible by 4 while the other is divisible by 2, given their overall evenness. This means ( (n-1) cdot (n+1) ) contributes ( 8 ). Thus, ((n-1)cdot ncdot (n+1)) is divisible by 8 for odd ( n ). 3. **Divisibility by 5:** - If ( n equiv 0 text{ or } pm 1 (text{mod } 5) ), one of ( n, n-1, n+1 ) is divisible by 5. Hence, the product ((n-1)n(n+1)) is divisible by 5. - If ( n equiv 2 text{ or } 3 (text{mod } 5) ): For ( n = 5k + 2 ), we calculate: [ n^2 + 1 = (5k + 2)^2 + 1 = 25k^2 + 20k + 4 + 1 = 25k^2 + 20k + 5 = 5(5k^2 + 4k + 1) ] so ( n^2 + 1 ) is divisible by 5. For ( n = 5k + 3 ), we similarly calculate: [ n^2 + 1 = (5k + 3)^2 + 1 = 25k^2 + 30k + 9 + 1 = 25k^2 + 30k + 10 = 5(5k^2 + 6k + 2) ] so ( n^2 + 1 ) is divisible by 5. Since ( n^{7} - n^{3} ) is divisible by 3, 5, and 8 for any natural number ( n ), it must be divisible by ( 120 = 3 times 5 times 8 ).

Adding these two equations, the f(1) terms cancel each other out, yielding: 2g(1) = 6. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us the value of g(1): g(1) = frac{6}{2} = 3.

Begin by arbitrarily selecting one element from ( S ) to start the process. Assume it is possible to find ( k ) elements (with ( k leq 99 )) that satisfy the required condition. b. Our goal is to choose the next element ( x ) such that none of the already chosen ( k ) elements' differences with ( x ) belong to ( D ). Formally, for all the already chosen elements ( t_1, t_2, ldots, t_k ), we need ( x - t_i notin D ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ). 5. **Counting Arguments**: For each chosen element ( t_i ), there are at most 10101 elements in ( S ) such that ( x - t_i in D ). Given ( k ) elements have already been chosen, there are at most ( 10101k ) elements in ( S ) that are 'forbidden' for the next choice due to the aforementioned differences. Since ( k leq 99 ), the total number of 'forbidden' elements is: [ 10101 times k leq 10101 times 99 = 999999 ] Since the total number of elements in ( S ) is 1,000,000, there must be at least one element left that can be chosen safely. 6. **Conclusion**: By this inductive method, it is always possible to choose the next element such that the differences with previously chosen elements do not belong to ( D ). Hence, we can select 100 elements ( t_1, t_2, ldots, t_{100} ) that meet the condition. Therefore, the required 100 elements ( t_1, t_2, ldots, t_{100} ) exist in ( S ), ensuring the sets ( A_j = { x + t_j mid x in A } ) for ( j = 1, 2, ldots, 100 ) have pairwise empty intersections.

Let’s investigate the properties of a line ( l ) such that the distances from ( A ) and ( B ) to ( l ) are equal. 2. **Conditions for Equal Distances**: If the distances from ( A ) and ( B ) to a line ( l ) are equal, two cases arise: - The line ( l ) is parallel to the line connecting ( A ) and ( B ). - The line ( l ) passes through the midpoint of the segment ( AB ). 3. **Analysis**: If the points ( A ) and ( B ) lie on the same side of the line ( l ): - The perpendicular distances from ( A ) and ( B ) to ( l ) being equal implies ( l ) is parallel to the line segment ( AB ). If the points ( A ) and ( B ) lie on opposite sides of the line ( l ): - The line ( l ) must pass through the midpoint of ( AB ). This is evident as the equal perpendicular distances on either side of ( l ) suggest symmetry about the midpoint of ( AB ). 4. **General Proof**: - Consider all lines passing through the midpoints of the segments connecting all possible pairs of given points. - Denote this set of lines as ( L ). 5. **Configuration and Possibility of Non-Parallel, Non-Midpoint Lines**: - Given a finite set of points, the set ( L ) is finite too. - Additionally, consider the set of midpoints ( P ) of all segments connecting these pairs of points, which again is finite. 6. **Constructing the Desired Line**: - Choose a line ( l ) that is neither parallel to any line belonging to the set ( L ) nor passing through any point from the set ( P ). - Such a line can always be constructed due to the finite nature of ( L ) and ( P ).

At this point, the total number of draws is n + (n - k) = 2n - k (since one box becomes empty with n draws and the other box has k matches left after drawing n - k matches from it). 3. **Event Reorganization**: - Consider the process of drawing matches until one box becomes empty and then fill this box again and continue drawing until a total of 2n + 1 matches are drawn. - In this extended process, we need to consider the first time the person draws exactly n+1 matches from one of the boxes. 4. **Probability Calculation**: - Any single extraction can result in drawing a match from either box with an equal probability of frac{1}{2}. - Thus, for 2n + 1 drawings, the total number of distinct drawing outcomes is 2^{2n+1}. - Among these outcomes, we focus on events where exactly n matches are drawn from the first 2n-k draws from one box, and n+1 matches are drawn from it overall. 5. **Combining the Results**: - The number of favorable outcomes where n+1 matches are drawn from the first box (or equivalently the second box) and the remaining n - k matches are not yet drawn from the second box is given by the binomial coefficient binom{2n-k}{n}. - Since both the first and second boxes are equally likely, the total number of such favorable outcomes is 2 cdot binom{2n-k}{n}. 6. **Final Probability**: - The probability is given by: p = frac{2 cdot binom{2n-k}{n} cdot 2^k}{2^{2n+1}} Simplifying, we get: p = frac{binom{2n-k}{n}}{2^{2n-k}} Conclusion, the probability that there are k matches left in the second box is: boxed{frac{binom{2n-k}{n}}{2^{2n-k}}} Part (b): 1. **Summation of Probabilities**: - Using the result from part (a), we recognize that the sum of the probabilities for all possible remaining matches in the second box ranging from 0 to n must equal 1: sum_{k=0}^{n} frac{binom{2n-k}{n}}{2^{2n-k}} = 1 2. **Form of the Required Sum**: - Given the probability for each k, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2^{2n} to sum up the left side with binomial coefficients: sum_{k=0}^{n} 2^{k} binom{2n-k}{n} = 2^{2n} Conclusion, the given sum equals: boxed{2^{2n}}"},{"instruction":"Given that i is the imaginary unit, and (x+i)i=yi (x,yinmathbb{R}), the quadrant where the point representing the complex number x+yi lies is ( ).

These planes intersect each other, creating new edges and vertices within the space. 3. **Analyze the Resulting Regions:**    The aforementioned planes partition the space into distinct, non-overlapping regions. Each of these regions is bounded by segments of the extended planes, forming smaller polyhedra within the larger space. 4. **Convexity of the Regions:**    Observe that each region formed by these intersecting planes is convex. This is because each region is bounded by plane segments, and the intersection of planes always results in convex shapes (specifically, polyhedral regions). 5. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, by extending all the planes containing the faces of the original polyhedron and analyzing the resulting regions, we can deduce that the space has been divided into convex polyhedra.

Since (I) is the incenter, (angle BIR = 90^{circ} + frac{angle BAC}{2} = 90^{circ} + 60^{circ} = 150^{circ}). 4. Since (angle BIC = 120^{circ}), we have (angle BIR = 30^{circ}) (since (angle BIR = 180^{circ} - angle BIC)). 5. Now, consider the quadrilateral (AIMR'), where (M) is the incenter of (Delta APB) and (R') is a point on (AB) such that (PR') is the bisector of (angle APB). 6. Since (M) is the incenter of (Delta APB), we have (angle IMR' = 120^{circ}). 7. Therefore, (AIMR') is cyclic, and (angle MIR' = angle MAB = 30^{circ}). 8. Since (angle BIR = 30^{circ}), we have (angle MIR = angle MIR' = 30^{circ}). 9. Thus, (R equiv R'), and (PR) bisects (angle APB). 10. Similarly, (PQ) bisects (angle APC). 11. Therefore, (angle QPR = 90^{circ}). 12. Since (angle QPR = 90^{circ}), the circle on (QR) as diameter passes through the point (P).

Similarly, it satisfies the second and third equations.    - For (a = 0), we need to check if there are any other solutions. The inequalities (yz ge x^2), (zx ge y^2), and (xy ge z^2) must hold.      - If (x, y, z) are all non-zero, then (yz ge x^2), (zx ge y^2), and (xy ge z^2) imply that (x, y, z) must be zero to satisfy all three inequalities simultaneously.    - Therefore, the unique solution for (a = 0) is ((0, 0, 0)). 3. **Case (a < 0):**    - The system of equations becomes:      [      x^4 = yz - x^2 + a,      ]      [      y^4 = zx - y^2 + a,      ]      [      z^4 = xy - z^2 + a.      ]    - For (a < 0), we have (yz > x^2), (zx > y^2), and (xy > z^2).      - These inequalities imply that (x, y, z) must be non-zero and positive. However, since (a < 0), the right-hand side of each equation is less than zero, which contradicts the left-hand side being a non-negative fourth power.    - Therefore, there are no solutions for (a < 0).

After the bombardment, which killed 10% of the population, the remaining population would be: 90% of P, which is 0.9P. Then, 20% of the remaining population left the village due to fear, so the population would be: 80% of 0.9P, which is 0.8 * 0.9P = 0.72P. Over the next year, 50 new villagers arrived, and the village experienced a birth rate of 2% and a death rate of 1.5%. The population at the end of the year, after these changes, would be: 0.72P + 50 + (0.02 * 0.72P) - (0.015 * 0.72P) The birth rate contributes an additional 2% of the population after migration, which is 0.02 * 0.72P, and the death rate reduces the population by 1.5%, which is 0.015 * 0.72P. So the equation becomes: 0.72P + 50 + (0.02 * 0.72P) - (0.015 * 0.72P) = 3168 Now, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms: 0.72P + 0.02 * 0.72P - 0.015 * 0.72P = 3168 - 50 0.72P * (1 + 0.02 - 0.015) = 3118 0.72P * 1.005 = 3118 Now, we solve for P: P = 3118 / (0.72 * 1.005) P = 3118 / 0.7236 P ≈ 4310.14 Since the population must be a whole number, we can round to the nearest whole number. However, since we're looking for the initial population before the bombardment and subsequent migration, we should not round down because that would imply fewer people initially than the final count after all the reductions.

Substitute the origin (0,0) into the equation to get -e^{x_{1}}=e^{x_{1}}(-x_{1}), which yields x_{1}=1. Therefore, boxed{k_{1}=e}. 2. Prove the inequality. From part 1, we have k_{1}=e.

Using the properties of the floor function:** Given: [ leftlfloor frac{kc}{d} rightrfloor = n quad Rightarrow quad n leq frac{kc}{d} < n + 1 ] Thus: [ frac{k cdot c}{d} < n + 1 = frac{(n + 1)d}{d} ] This translates to: [ frac{73k}{100} < frac{kc + 1}{d} leq frac{(n+1)d}{d} = n + 1 ] **5. Conclusion by the floor function equality:** This leads us to conclude: [ leftlfloor frac{73k}{100} rightrfloor = n = leftlfloor frac{kc}{d} rightrfloor ] Hence, for all ( k = 1, 2, cdots, 99 ), the condition (leftlfloor k cdot frac{c}{d} rightrfloor = leftlfloor k cdot frac{73}{100} rightrfloor) holds true. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"What does the assignment statement n=n+1 mean?

When placing ( C_i ), there will always be at least one set ( A_j ) not containing any circle intersecting with ( C_i ). 8. **Applying Pigeonhole Principle:**     By the pigeonhole principle, since the circles are partitioned into 76 sets, at least one of these sets will contain at least ( leftlfloor frac{2015}{76} rightrfloor + 1 = 27 ) circles. 9. **Conclusion:**     Therefore, a subset ( S ) of 27 circles can be selected such that any two circles in ( S ) either share a common point or do not intersect at all.

Consider a set of five points ( P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5 ) and discuss the convex hull:    - **Configuration 1**: The convex hull is a convex pentagon ( P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5 ).      - In a convex pentagon, there are at least two interior angles that are obtuse, say ( angle P_1 ) and ( angle P_2 ).      - Thus, ( triangle P_5P_1P_2 ) and ( triangle P_1P_2P_3 ) are obtuse.      - In the four-sided figure ( P_1P_3P_4P_5 ), at least one angle is not obtuse.

So, we can write the equation: (F - 240) / 2 + 370 = F Now, let's solve for F: (F - 240) / 2 = F - 370 Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: F - 240 = 2F - 740 Now, let's move all the F terms to one side and the constants to the other side: F - 2F = -740 + 240 Combine like terms: -F = -500 Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for F: F = 500 So, Lucy had boxed{500}  grams of flour in the cupboard at the start of the week."},{"instruction":"A rower covers a distance of 21 miles downstream in four hours less than the time taken to cover the same distance upstream at his usual rowing speed.

Among the rectangles with area ( A ), let ( R ) be the one with maximal width. We assume, for contradiction, that the dimensions of ( R ) are unique among those used in the tiling. Label the rows and columns of the square ( 1, 2, ldots, 2^n ), going from bottom to top and left to right, respectively. 2. **Coloring the grid:**    Consider the coloring where a unit square with coordinates ( (x, y) ) is shaded if and only if ( 2^a mid x ), giving columns of shaded squares ( 2^a ) apart. Clearly, ( R ) is on exactly one of the shaded columns, so it covers exactly ( 2^b ) shaded squares. 3. **Claim:**    The number of shaded squares covered by a rectangle of area at least ( 2A ) is divisible by ( 2^{b+1} ). 4. **Proof of the claim:**    Let ( Q ) be such a rectangle with width ( 2^c ) and height ( 2^d ), where ( c + d > a + b ) since ( 2^{c+d} > 2^{a+b} ).    - **Case 1: ( c > a ):**      Then ( Q ) covers exactly ( 2^{c-a} ) shaded columns and covers exactly ( 2^d ) squares in each, giving a total of ( 2^{c+d-a} ) shaded squares. This is divisible by ( 2^{b+1} ) since ( 2^{c+d-a} = 2^{b+1} cdot 2^{c+d-a-b-1} ), where the exponent ( c+d-a-b-1 ) is a non-negative integer.    - **Case 2: ( d > b ):**      If ( Q ) is on any shaded columns, the number of shaded squares will be ( 2^d ), clearly divisible by ( 2^{b+1} ). If not, then it covers 0 shaded squares, also divisible by ( 2^{b+1} ).    This finishes the proof of the claim. 5. **Analyzing rectangles of area ( A ):**    Consider the number of shaded squares that a rectangle ( T ) of area ( A ), width ( 2^e ), and height ( 2^f ) can cover. Note ( a + b = e + f ) and ( e < a ) since ( R ) has the unique maximal width of rectangles with area ( A ). Consequently, ( f > b ). ( T ) is either in 0 or 1 shaded columns. If it is in 0, the number of shaded squares is 0, and if it is in 1, the number of shaded squares is ( 2^f ). Note that either way, the number of shaded squares is divisible by ( 2^{b+1} ). 6. **Summing up the shaded squares:**    We deduce that all rectangles used in the tiling that are not ( R ) cover a number of shaded squares divisible by ( 2^{b+1} ), where ( R ) uses ( 2^b ). The total number of shaded squares is ( 2^{2n-a} ). The only way this is not divisible by ( 2^{b+1} ) is if ( a = b = n ), which is impossible as then there is only one rectangle in the square. Hence, ( 2^{b+1} ) divides the total number of shaded squares. 7. **Contradiction:**    However, ( 0 equiv ) total number of shaded squares ( mod 2^{b+1} ) = sum over the rectangles of the number of shaded squares in each ( equiv 2^b + 0 + 0 + 0 ldots + 0 mod 2^{b+1} = 2^b ), a contradiction.

Let's denote this intersection point as ( O ). 2. **Prove that ( MN ) and ( PQ ) intersect at the same point ( O ):**    - ( MN ) is the line segment connecting the points of tangency ( M ) and ( N ).        - ( PQ ) is the line segment connecting the points of tangency ( P ) and ( Q ).        - By the configuration of the tangents of the incircle, ( MN ) and ( PQ ) intersect at the point ( O ).        - Hence, the intersection point ( O ) is also the point of intersection of ( AC ) and ( KL ). 3. **Prove that ( MQ ) and ( NP ) intersect at the same point ( O ):**    - ( MQ ) is the line segment connecting the points of tangency ( M ) and ( Q ).        - ( NP ) is the line segment connecting the points of tangency ( N ) and ( P ).        - By the properties of the incircle configuration, ( MQ ) and ( NP ) intersect at ( O ), the same point where ( KL ) and ( BD ) intersect. 4. **Conclusion:**    Since all three sets of lines ( (MP, NQ), (MN, PQ), ) and ( (MQ, NP) ) intersect at the same point ( O ), and ( O ) is the intersection point of ( AC, BD, ) and ( KL ), it follows that ( O ) is the orthocenter of the triangle formed by the lines ( KL, AC, ) and ( BD ).

This means AB = AF + FB = 3x + 5x = 8x. Now, since frac{BC}{CD} = 3:1, let's assume BC = 3y and CD = y for some positive real number y. Therefore, BD = BC + CD = 3y + y = 4y. On the extended line segment AD, the segments AB and BD are consecutive, thus AD = AB + BD = 8x + 4y Since E lies on AD, we can express AE and ED as parts of AD: AE + ED = AD AE + ED = 8x + 4y We can look at the segment BD and express ED in terms of EC and CD: ED = EC + CD ED = EC + y Since EC is a part of AD, we know EC is also a part of AB because points E and C are inside the segments AD and AB respectively. Thus EC must have the same ratio that AB has because it is part of AB: EC = frac{3}{8} cdot AD EC = frac{3}{8} cdot (8x + 4y) EC = 3x + frac{3}{2}y Now, let's substitute this value of EC into the equation for ED: ED = (3x + frac{3}{2}y) + y ED = 3x + frac{5}{2}y We can now write an equation involving AE and ED with respect to AD: AE + (3x + frac{5}{2}y) = 8x + 4y AE = 5x + frac{3}{2}y Now we find the ratio of AE to EC: frac{AE}{EC} = frac{5x + frac{3}{2}y}{3x + frac{3}{2}y} Given that the units of x and y are actually identical (since they refer to segments of the same line), we don't need their exact values to find the ratio.

To find the range of f(x), we examine the expression x+frac{4}{x}, which is minimized when x=2. This is because by AM-GM inequality, x+frac{4}{x} geq 2sqrt{xcdotfrac{4}{x}} = 4, and the equality holds if and only if x=frac{4}{x}, which simplifies to x=2. Thus, the range of f(x) for xin [2, +infty) is (0, frac{1}{8}]. **For xin (-infty, 2):** 1. **Case 1: ageq 2** In this case, f(x)=(frac{1}{2})^{|x-a|}=(frac{1}{2})^{a-x} for xin (-infty, 2). This function is increasing, and its range is (0, (frac{1}{2})^{a-2}). To ensure f(x_1)=f(x_2) for some x_1in [2,+infty) and x_2in (-infty, 2), we require (frac{1}{2})^{a-2} > frac{1}{8}. Solving this inequality gives a < 5.

The function has a range of (0, 1] on (-infty, a] and ((frac{1}{2})^{2-a}, 1] on [a, 2).

Since the slope of line l_{3} is 45^{circ}, we have k=tan 45^{circ}=1. Therefore, the equation of line l_{3} passing through F(2,0) with a slope of 1 is: [y = x - 2] Thus, the equation of line l_{3} is boxed{y = x - 2}. 2. To prove that line l_{1} passes through a fixed point, we start by solving the system: [left{begin{array}{l} y^{2}=8x, y=kx+m_{1}, end{array}right.] Eliminating x, we get: [ky^{2}-8y+8m_{1}=0] Let A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}). From the relationship between roots and coefficients, we have: [y_{1}y_{2}=frac{8m_{1}}{k}] and [x_{1}x_{2}=frac{y_{1}^{2}y_{2}^{2}}{64}=frac{m_{1}^{2}}{k^{2}}] Given overrightarrow{OA_{1}}cdot overrightarrow{OB_{1}}=0, we have: [x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}=0] Substituting the expressions for x_{1}x_{2} and y_{1}y_{2}, we get: [frac{m_{1}^{2}}{k^{2}}+frac{8m_{1}}{k}=0] Solving for m_{1}, we find: [m_{1}=-8k] Thus, the equation of line l_{1} is: [y=kx-8k] Therefore, line l_{1} passes through the fixed point (8,0), which is boxed{(8,0)}. 3.

Prove that there are two disjoint subsets of the set with equal sums of their elements.","output":"To prove that there exist two disjoint subsets of the set with equal sums of their elements, let us proceed step by step: 1. **Identify the total number of subsets:**    Given a set of 10 positive integers, we start by noting that there are (2^{10}) possible subsets of this set. This includes the empty set as well. However, we do not consider the empty set for our purpose, so we subtract 1:    [    2^{10} - 1 = 1023    ] 2. **Determine the range of possible sums:**    Each integer in the set provided has two digits, meaning each integer is between 10 and 99, inclusive.     - The **smallest** possible sum of any subset is achieved by summing up the 10 smallest 2-digit numbers:      [      10 + 10 + cdots + 10 = 10 times 10 = 100      ]        - The **largest** possible sum of any subset is achieved by summing up the 10 largest 2-digit numbers:      [      99 + 99 + cdots + 99 = 10 times 99 = 990      ]    Therefore, the possible sums of the subsets range from 0 (if the subset is empty, however, we exclude this case typically in these problems) to 990. 3. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle:**    According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if you have more \\"pigeons\\" than \\"pigeonholes,\\" at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. Here, the \\"pigeons\\" are the different subsets, and the \\"pigeonholes\\" are the possible sums:    - Number of subsets (pigeons): 1023    - Possible distinct sums (pigeonholes): up to 990    Since there are more subsets (1023) than possible distinct sums (990), the Pigeonhole Principle guarantees that at least two different subsets must have the same sum. 4. **Ensuring the subsets are disjoint:**    We originally claimed that these two subsets might not be disjoint. If they intersect, we can modify the process to ensure they are disjoint. Here's how:    - Consider the number of non-empty subsets we have: 1023.    - By the Pigeonhole Principle, since there are 1023 subsets and only 990 different sums, there must be at least two different subsets with the same sum.    If these two subsets are not initially disjoint, we can find the subset of their symmetric difference, which will also share the same sum as required because the intersection can be removed without affecting the equality of their subset sums (each element in the intersection is both added and subtracted, thus they cancel out). **Conclusion:** By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two subsets with the same sum, and we can always find two disjoint subsets: [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the parabola y^{2}=4x whose directrix intersects with the hyperbola frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}y^{2}=1 (a > 0) at points A and B, and point F is the focus of the parabola.

A triangular pyramid would show a triangular side view whereas a triangular prism would show a rectangular side view due to its uniform cross-section throughout its height.

Solving this equation will yield the eccentricity of the hyperbola. 1. Find the coordinates of A and B: The asymptotes of the hyperbola are given by y = pm frac{b}{a}x. Solving the system of equations formed by the line and the asymptotes, we find the coordinates of A and B: A = left(frac{ma}{3b - a}, frac{mb}{3b - a}right), quad B = left(-frac{ma}{3b + a}, frac{mb}{3b + a}right) 2.

Recall that the eccentricity e of a hyperbola is given by e = frac{c}{a}, where c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. In this case, c = sqrt{(2b)^2 + b^2} = sqrt{5}b.

The sides of ( triangle A'B'C' ) are the medians of ( triangle ABC ), and the medians of a triangle do not necessarily form a triangle similar to the original triangle. 7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the given conditions ( alpha = alpha' ), ( beta = beta' ), and ( gamma = gamma' ) do not guarantee that the triangles ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle A'B'C' ) are similar.

Show that after some steps (regardless of the specific choices), there will no longer be any lonely points.","output":"1. **Classify Edges**:     - Consider all the vertices (points) on the plane, which are interconnected by edges. We classify these edges into two categories:         - ( A )-type edges: Connect vertices of the same color.         - ( B )-type edges: Connect vertices of different colors. 2. **Identifying a Lonely Point**:     - A point is called **lonely** if more than half of the edges connected to it lead to points of a different color. 3. **Effect of Recoloring a Lonely Point**:     - Suppose we select a lonely point for recoloring and let:         - ( a ) be the number of ( A )-type edges emanating from it.         - ( b ) be the number of ( B )-type edges emanating from it.     - By definition of a lonely point, ( b > a ). 4. **Change in Edge Classification**:     - Upon recoloring the lonely point:         - The number of ( B )-type edges connected to this point before recoloring = ( b ).         - The number of ( A )-type edges connected to this point before recoloring = ( a ).              - After recoloring:         - The ( b ) edges previously classified as ( B )-type will now be classified as ( A )-type.         - The ( a ) edges previously classified as ( A )-type will now be classified as ( B )-type. 5. **Recalculation of Total ( B )-type Edges in the Graph**:     - After one such recoloring step, the total number of ( B )-type edges in the entire graph decreases by precisely ( b - a ). Since ( b > a ), this reduction is at least 1.     [     Delta B = b - a geq 1     ] 6. **Finite Steps to Exhaust ( B )-type Edges**:     - Initially, the graph has a finite number of ( B )-type edges.     - Each step of recoloring a lonely point reduces the number of ( B )-type edges by at least 1.     - Therefore, after a finite number of steps, the number of ( B )-type edges will be reduced to zero or a state from which no further lonely points can be recolored.  7. **Conclusion**:     - Since the total count of ( B )-type edges is finite and decreases strictly with each recoloring step, eventually, there will be no more lonely points remaining in the graph.

The expected value of X, EX, is the sum of the products of the values and their respective probabilities: EX = 1 times frac{1}{3} + 2 times frac{1}{6} + 3 times frac{1}{2} = frac{13}{6}.  Lastly, for the variance of X, DX, we will use the formula DX = E(X^2)-(EX)^2. First, we need to compute E(X^2): E(X^2) = 1^2 times frac{1}{3} + 2^2 times frac{1}{6} + 3^2 times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{3} + frac{4}{6} + frac{9}{2} = frac{35}{6}.  Now, the variance is: DX = E(X^2)-(EX)^2 = frac{35}{6} - left(frac{13}{6}right)^2 = frac{35}{6} - frac{169}{36} = frac{210-169}{36} = frac{41}{36}. Therefore, the variance of X is boxed{frac{41}{36}}."},{"instruction":"Calculate the definite integral:  int_{0}^{arccos sqrt{2 / 3}} frac{operatorname{tg} x+2}{sin ^{2} x+2 cos ^{2} x3} dx","output":"Given the integral:  int_{0}^{arccos sqrt{2 / 3}} frac{operatorname{tg} x+2}{sin ^{2} x+2 cos ^{2} x-3} , dx  First, we simplify the denominator: 1.

Prove that (frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_n} < frac{3}{2}).","output":":  1. Let m be a given positive integer, and a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n} be positive integers not exceeding m. For any 1 leq i < j leq n, we have left[a_{i}, a_{j}right] > m where left[a_{i}, a_{j}right] denotes the least common multiple (LCM) of a_i and a_j.     2. We want to prove that:        frac{1}{a_{1}} + frac{1}{a_{2}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{n}} < frac{3}{2}     3. First, observe that if n geq frac{m+1}{2}, then there exist at least two numbers within a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}, say a_i and a_j, such that one is a multiple of the other. This is due to the pigeonhole principle and the structure of divisors within the range 1 to m.  4. This condition leads to left[a_{i}, a_{j}right] leq m, contradicting our assumption that left[a_{i}, a_{j}right] > m. Thus, we must have:        n < frac{m+1}{2}     5. Considering the set {1, 2, ldots, m}, note that the sets of multiples formed by a_{i} and a_{j} are distinct (left[a_{i}, a_{j}right] leq m would be a contradiction). 6. We now sum up the inverses. From distinct sets of multiples, we establish:        sum_{i=1}^{n}left[frac{m}{a_{i}}right] leq m        where left[frac{m}{a_{i}}right] denotes the integer part of frac{m}{a_{i}}. 7. Since frac{m}{a_{i}} in mathbb{Q}, we can write:        left[frac{m}{a_{i}}right] geq frac{m}{a_{i}} - frac{a_{i}-1}{a_{i}} = frac{m+1}{a_{i}} - 1     8. Therefore, summing over all i gives:        sum_{i=1}^{n}left(frac{m+1}{a_{i}} - 1right) leq sum_{i=1}^{n}left[frac{m}{a_{i}}right] leq m     9. This simplifies to:        sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{m+1}{a_{i}} - n leq m     10. Rearrange to isolate the sum:          sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_{i}} leq frac{n+m}{m+1}      11. Since we established that n < frac{m+1}{2}, substituting in the inequality:          frac{n+m}{m+1} < frac{frac{m+1}{2} + m}{m+1}      12. Simplify the right-hand side:          frac{frac{m+1}{2} + m}{m+1} = frac{frac{3m+1}{2}}{m+1} = frac{3m+1}{2(m+1)} = frac{3}{2} - frac{1}{2(m+1)} < frac{3}{2}          here, frac{1}{2(m+1)} is a positive term ensuring the strict inequality. 13.

This shows that for composite ( n ), Lizzie can always win the game. (blacksquare) 2. **Claim:** Prime ( n ) fail.    **Proof:**    - Suppose ( n = p ) is a prime number.    - Alex writes ( p-1 ) ones and one two on the board. The initial numbers are ( 1, 1, dots, 1, 2 ).    - The average of these numbers is ( frac{(p-1) cdot 1 + 2}{p} = frac{p+1}{p} ).    - Lizzie aims to convert all numbers into ( frac{p+1}{p} ).    To show that Lizzie cannot achieve this:    - Consider the denominators of the numbers on the board. Initially, all numbers are integers, so their denominators are 1.    - When Lizzie averages ( k ) numbers with denominators ( d_1, d_2, dots, d_k ), the denominator of the resulting average is a factor of ( k cdot text{lcm}(d_1, d_2, dots, d_k) ).    - Since ( k < p ) and ( p ) is prime, ( p ) does not divide ( k ).    - By induction, assume that at some moment, none of the numbers have a denominator divisible by ( p ).    - Averaging ( k ) numbers with denominators ( d_1, d_2, dots, d_k ), the new denominator is a factor of ( k cdot text{lcm}(d_1, d_2, dots, d_k) ), which is not divisible by ( p ).    - Therefore, at no point can a number on the board have a denominator divisible by ( p ).    Since ( frac{p+1}{p} ) has a denominator ( p ), Lizzie cannot achieve this, and Alex wins the game when ( n ) is prime. (blacksquare) The final answer is (boxed{text{composite } n})"},{"instruction":"Let σ(n) denote the sum of the positive divisors of n. Show that if σ(n) > 2n, then σ(mn) > 2mn for any m.","output":"1. **Define the sum of the positive divisors of ( n ) and ( mn )**:     Let ( sigma(n) ) denote the sum of the positive divisors of ( n ). By definition:     [     sigma(n) = sum_{d_i mid n} d_i     ]     where the sum runs over all positive divisors ( d_i ) of ( n ). 2. **Given inequality**:     We are given that ( sigma(n) > 2n ). 3. **Consider ( mn )**:     We need to show that ( sigma(mn) > 2mn ) for any positive integer ( m ). 4. **Divisors of ( mn )**:     The divisors of ( mn ) are formed by multiplying the divisors of ( n ) by the divisors of ( m ). Specifically, if ( d_i ) is a divisor of ( n ) and ( d_j ) is a divisor of ( m ), then ( d_i cdot d_j ) is a divisor of ( mn ). 5. **Summing over divisors of ( mn )**:     Consider ( sigma(mn) = sum_{d mid mn} d ). 6. **Sum properties**:     For each divisor ( d_i ) of ( n ), ( md_i ) is a distinct divisor of ( mn ).     Hence, we can form the sum:     [     sum_{d_i mid n} md_i = m sum_{d_i mid n} d_i = m cdot sigma(n)     ]     Since ( sigma(n) > 2n ), we multiply both sides of this inequality by ( m ):     [     m cdot sigma(n) > m cdot 2n     ]     [     sigma(mn) geq m cdot sigma(n) > 2mn     ] 7. **Conclusion**:     Hence, we have shown that if ( sigma(n) > 2n ), then ( sigma(mn) > 2mn ) for any ( m ).
