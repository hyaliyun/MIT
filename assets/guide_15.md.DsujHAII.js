As the 2010s began, Nvidia quickly healed the wound by recalling all of its defective products from the market. This time, the company would strike a multi-billion-dollar deal with Intel. However, the entire destiny of the company would truly change with a decision made in 2014. After attempts at creating their own console, like the Nvidia Shield, and several unsuccessful attempts at expansion, the board of directors made a radical decision to restrict its product line to three main areas: automotive electronics, mobile devices, and video games."},{"instruction":"Nvidia'nın durdurulamaz yükselişini bilgisayarların ana işletim birimi olan cpu yerine grafik işleme birimleri olan gpu'ların kullanılmasıydı.

The freezing you experience is likely due to the way your code is structured and how it interacts with the page. Here are a few potential problems and tips on how to address them: 1. **Infinite Recursive Calls without Base Case**: Your \`openbox()\` function calls itself at the end without a clear stopping condition. This could lead to a stack overflow or at least excessive memory usage which might be causing the freeze. 2. **Excessive and Rapid DOM Manipulation**: Your script frequently updates the DOM (for displaying logs, clicking buttons, etc.) and also clears and reloads the page periodically. This can be heavy on the browser, especially on pages that are already resource-intensive. 3. **Frequent Use of \`setTimeout\` and \`setInterval\`**: Your script uses these timers to delay actions and repeatedly execute code. If used without care, they can cause unforeseen behavior especially if they overlap or don't get the chance to complete before the page reloads. 4. **Dependence on Specific DOM Elements**: Your code heavily relies on the presence and order of DOM elements (like \`.open-btn\` or \`.close\`). Any change in the page structure can lead to your script not finding these elements and attempting to perform actions (like \`.click()\`) on undefined, which could contribute to script errors and freezing. # How to Solve or Mitigate Freezing - **Implement a Clear Exit Condition**: For any recursive function like \`openbox()\`, ensure there's a clear condition under which the function does not call itself again, to avoid infinite recursion. - **Throttle DOM Updates**: Instead of updating the log container or attempting clicks in rapid succession, consider adding more deliberate delays (\`await sleep(...)\`) between these actions to give the browser time to catch up and render changes smoothly. - **Refine Use of Timers**: Ensure that any \`setTimeout\` or \`setInterval\` calls do not clash or stack in a way that can cause rapid, repeated actions without pauses. It's also worth ensuring that these timers are cleared or managed (using \`clearTimeout\` or \`clearInterval\`) when they're no longer needed. - **Check Element Presence and State**: Before interacting with a DOM element (e.g., clicking a button), verify that it exists and is in the expected state (e.g., not disabled). This prevents errors that could disrupt the script flow. - **Error Handling**: Wrap potentially risky operations (such as JSON parsing or DOM manipulations) in \`try-catch\` blocks to gracefully handle errors without breaking the entire script. - **Performance Considerations**: Remember that running such a script, especially in a never-ending loop or with tight intervals, can be demanding on the browser. Consider if there are more efficient ways to achieve your goals or if some operations can be simplified or omitted. Given the nature of the script and the site it's intended for, always remember to respect the site's terms of service and consider the ethical implications of automating interactions, especially in environments that might consider such actions as unfair or against the rules."},{"instruction":"создание контейнера запускающего часть директории на отдельном порту по команде","output":"Для создания контейнера, который запускает часть директории на отдельном порту по команде, можно воспользоваться Docker.

Duck is delighted to be given such a responsibility. Duck already knows Percy and he quickly befriends Toby, Bertie and Terence, who tells Duck to take extra special care with Annie and Clarabel. Duck is very gentle with them and both coaches are left very impressed with the Great Western Engine and remark on what a pleasure it is to go out with him. When Thomas returns from the works, Annie and Clarabel tell him how well Duck had managed on the line. Thomas does not feel jealous, as he is just happy to be back home. Although Thomas feels better, he is not in complete working order. The repairs have left his handbrake very stiff, meaning it can feel like his brakes are hard-on when they are actually not. Because of this, Thomas begins to overrun the station platform, which causes him a great deal of embarrassment. Eventually, Thomas’ crew learn to compensate for the handbrake and they stop in just the right place. However, when Thomas’ fireman falls ill one day, a relief man takes his place. After Thomas arrives at the junction, the relief fireman couples him to Annie and Clarabel. He then joins the driver and stationmaster on the platform while they wait for Henry’s passenger train to arrive. Unfortunately, the relief has forgotten about Thomas’ defective handbrake. When Henry starts to approach the platform, Thomas’ wheels start to move as his brakes are not completely on and he cannot stop or whistle a warning without his crew. Thomas has left everyone, including the guard, stranded on the platform and runs off without his crew in his cab. Thomas, Annie and Clarabel gather speed out of the junction station. Both empty coaches want Thomas to stop but he is unable to stop himself and has plenty of steam and keeps going. Soon, an alarm goes out about the runaway train. The junction signalman sees what had happened and phones to stop the runaway train. Luckily, an engine inspector makes a plan, boards Harold the helicopter and flies to a station where Thomas is due to pass by. When Thomas reaches the station, he is very tired and is moving far slower than normal. Then, he sees Harold landing near the next station. The inspector then makes it to the platform and, when Thomas passes, he scrambles aboard his cab and screws his brakes hard-on. Having finally been brought to a stop, both Thomas and the inspector are very relieved and thank Harold, who tells them that it was no problem. The inspector tells Thomas that they must make sure this never happens again. Feeling exhausted, Thomas agrees with him.","output":"Title: *Thomas and the Comedy of Errors* Scene 1: Troublesome Handbrakes One groggy morning on the Island of Sodor, Thomas wakes up feeling as if he’s chugged a gallon of sludge instead of steam. The workmen try everything - from cooing sweet nothings to his boiler to attempting an engine massage (yes, that’s a thing now) - but nothing works. The Fat Controller, in a panic that could rival a cat on hot bricks, calls Edward to haul Thomas to the works. He then summons Duck to take over Thomas’ duties, who’s more excited than Sir Topham Hatt at an all-you-can-eat buffet. Scene 2: Duck’s New Fans Duck, now the belle of the ball, quickly charms the wheels off everyone, including Percy, Toby, and an oddly enthusiastic piece of agricultural machinery named Terence. Annie and Clarabel, who were initially wary about getting a new engine beau, end up singing Duck’s praises. When Thomas trundles back from the works, he’s greeted with tales of Duck’s gallantry. Thomas feels no jealousy, only a swelling pride - and a persistent ache in his handbrake. Scene 3: Thomas’ Slippery Slope Despite feeling physically better, Thomas’ repairs have left his handbrake stiffer than the Fat Controller’s upper lip. This results in several comical mishaps, including overshooting platforms and giving passengers unexpected exercise as they leap after the train. After a few tweaks by his crew, things seem to be going smoother. That is until... Scene 4: The Runaway Train A relief fireman, presumably hired for his ability to whistle show tunes rather than his actual job knowledge, forgets about Thomas’ dodgy handbrake. During a station stop, Thomas, feeling the sudden urge for adventure - or perhaps just unable to hold himself back - becomes a runaway train, leaving his crew eating his dust. Annie and Clarabel, finding themselves unwitting participants in Thomas’ unscheduled express service, are horrified. They pass messages back and forth, \\"Tell him to stop!\\" \\"I can’t, you tell him!\\" creating a frenzy of panic that could only be described as ‘coaches losing their composure’. Scene 5: Harold to the Rescue The alarms go off. The signalman almost spills his tea - a true disaster. Amid the chaos, an engine inspector commandeers Harold like a scene straight out of an action movie, complete with dramatic background music (played by a nearby band of musical sheep). As Thomas slows down, feeling the effects of his unplanned marathon, Harold and the inspector perform a daring mid-station landing. The inspector, with the grace of an Olympic gymnast, leaps into Thomas’ cab and applies the brakes with a mighty thud. Scene 6: The Aftermath Exhausted but grateful, Thomas thanks Harold, who modestly brushes off the thanks, claiming he was in the area for a \\"leisurely spin\\" anyway. The inspector, meanwhile, gives Thomas a stern but fatherly lecture about the importance of handbrake maintenance and not giving their team heart attacks. Thomas, feeling sheepish but relieved, promises to never again take his crew - or his brakes - for granted. In the meantime, Duck, back to his regular duties, overhears Thomas’ tale and can’t help but quip, \\"Well, it seems you’ve really put the 'brake' into 'breakout star', haven’t you, Thomas?\\" The engines all share a laugh, even Thomas, who’s just happy to be stationary - at least for now."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It's likely these terms are intended to reference specific versions or iterations of a mathematical software, models, or perhaps even datasets, but without specific context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer on performance. Furthermore, \\"WizardMath\\" does not correspond to any well-known mathematical software, framework, or model recognizable as of the last update. If this query pertains to models or versions of software in a specific domain (e.g., machine learning, data science, educational software), there could be a few general considerations: 1. An iteration labeled \\"70b 1.0\\" might suggest a broader or more developed basis (70 billion parameters or elements, for instance) compared to \\"7b 1.1\\" (7 billion parameters), which could imply a potential for better performance or more nuanced capabilities due to the increase in complexity or coverage. 2. However, version numbers (e.g., 1.0 vs 1.1) usually indicate iterations of development, where a higher secondary number (the '1' in 1.1) could suggest improvements, optimizations, or bug fixes over the earlier version (1.0). These could include performance improvements even if the base (the 'b' part) indicates a potentially less complex model. Without specific details on what \\"WizardMath\\" refers to, it's important to note that higher complexity or newer versions of software/models do not always directly translate to \\"better\\" in a universal sense. \\"Better\\" can depend on the context, such as accuracy, efficiency, resource consumption, or suitability for a specific task. If you can provide more context or correct the terminology, I might be able to offer a more precise answer or direct you towards relevant resources."},{"instruction":"<svg

\`android:width\`和\`android:height\`定义了这个图形在设备上的实际尺寸，这里是24dp（设备独立像素）。 - \`android:viewportWidth\`和\`android:viewportHeight\`定义了画布的尺寸。\`VectorDrawable\`中的所有坐标都是基于这个画布来定位的。这里，视图窗口也设置为24x24。 \`VectorDrawable\`允许你通过指定路径（\`path\`）来绘制复杂的形状。例如，\`android:pathData=\\"M2,2h20v20h-20z\\"\`指定了一个路径，它创建了一个起点在(2,2)、宽20、高20的矩形。 通过使用\`VectorDrawable\`，你可以轻松地为Android应用创建适应不同屏幕尺寸和分辨率的图形，无需为每种屏幕分辨率准备不同的位图资源，从而减小应用的体积并提高其性能。在实际应用中，你可以定义更复杂的图形和动画，利用SVG路径数据（\`pathData\`属性）来描绘形状和图案。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a

本書は、「マルクスの国家論」というタイトルを冠していない。このことからもわかるように、マルクスに国家論があるのか否かを裁断することは本書の目的ではない。かつてのマルクス主義者がそうしてきたように、マルクス国家論の再構築を意図しているわけではないのだ(このことは第一章で詳述するが、ちなみに言えばマルクスの「経済理論」なるものもじつは存在しない)。むしろ、フーコーが半ば挑発的に指摘したように、私たちは、リベラルからマルクス主義者までの左派に共通する「国家の問題にたいする過大評価」、つまりあの独特な「国家嫌悪」から距離をとる必要がある。「国家はそれ自体、権力の自律的源泉ではない」(Foucault2004b邦訳9頁)。ヴェーバーの有名な定式にあるように、近代の国家は、たしかに「正当な暴力行使を独占し」、中央集権的なかたちをとっている。しかし、国家は、あくまでも権力関係のひとつの支点にすぎないのである。「国家の歴史は、人間たちの実践自体を出発点とし、人間たちのおこないや考え方を出発点として作りあげることができるのでなければならない」(Foucault2004a邦訳4頁)。第二章でみるように、マルクスは当初、ヘーゲル法哲学の批判を出発点として、法や法律そして国家といった政治的領域を考察しようとした。しかし、ほどなくして経済学研究に着手すると、国家の問題からいったん距離を置きつつ、諸個人の特定のふるまいによって生み出される「物質的な生活諸関係」の総体を批判しようと試みる。マルクスやフーコーがそうしたように、私たちもまた国家の自律性・中心性というものに抗する必要があるのだ。 とはいえ、国家の問題をさしあたり括弧にいれることは、国家の批判を放棄することではまったくない。ここに「国家に抗するマルクス」というタイトルに込めた二つめの意味がある。マルクスが「国家に抗した」のは、文字通りの意味に受け取られなければならない。すなわちマルクスは、たんに「資本主義」のみならず、いや「資本主義」と同時に国家を克服し廃絶しようとしていたのである。したがって、マルクス(主義)の「国家死滅」テーゼを同時代のプルードンやバクーニンといったアナキズムの思想からことさらに差別化することは慎むべきなのだ(Basso2015,176)。マルクスの思想は、国家の廃絶を主張したという意味では、むしろアナキズムの潮流に位置づけることもできる。この一見すると単純なことがらを強調することにはおおきな意味がある。本書で詳しくみていくように、マルクスの資本主義批判には国家批判が不可欠である。むしろ国家批判なくしては、資本主義システムそのものを批判することはできないと言ってよい。それはなにも、国家介入が「増大した」ケインズ主義時代や昨今の新自由主義時代の資本主義に限ったことではない。つまり、アドルノが「総体性としての社会」(Adorno1968,60)という概念を用いながら簡潔に示したように、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判は、たんに経済的領域のみならず、資本主義社会システムをトータルに批判したものであった。この社会システムには、商品や貨幣、資本によって編成された市場システムという権力関係のみならず、法や法律、国家といった権力関係も含まれるのである。 フーコーもこう述べている。「国家の問題が大事ではない、と言いたいわけではありません。そうではなくて、権力関係の問題は、したがって権力関係を分析するにあたっての分析対象は、国家の枠組みを超えた地点まで及ばなければならない、ということが言いたいのです」(Foucault1994邦訳3頁)。”翻译为中文","output":"“经常有人说没有权力分析的马克思，国家论不充分，现在是制定这样理论的时候了。但是，给自己提供一个国家论真的那么重要吗？”（福柯2004b日文译本第10页）。马克思有国家论吗？因为马克思的主要著作《资本论》中不存在系统的国家论，所以在活跃于1970年代的法国哲学家米歇尔·福柯时期，“马克思主义国家论”的激烈争论曾经发生。背后的原因是，西欧国家进入低增长时代，社会经济领域中国家介入成为一个重大争议点。对企业活动的财政支出、对失业者和保健医疗的社会保障，包括现今的中央银行金融政策在内，我们依然无法逃脱以国家作为参考坐标来思考问题。不仅如此，比起福柯和新左翼的马克思主义者活跃的时代，我们更迫切需要问题化国家。 本书没有冠以“马克思的国家论”为标题。由此可见，判断马克思是否有国家论并非本书的目的。如同过去的马克思主义者所做的那样，本书并不打算重建马克思国家论（这一点将在第一章详述，顺便说一下，事实上所谓的马克思的“经济理论”也并不存在）。相反，正如福柯半挑衅性地指出的那样，我们需要从左翼，从自由主义者到马克思主义者共通的“对国家问题的过高评价”即那种独特的“国家厌恶”中保持距离。“国家本身不是权力的一个自主的来源”（福柯2004b日文译本第9页）。正如韦伯著名的定义所说，近代国家确实“独占了合法的暴力行使”，并采取中央集权的形式。然而，国家只是权力关系的一个支点。“国家的历史必须能够以人类的实践自身为出发点，以人们的行为和思考方式为基础来建立”（福柯2004a日文译本第4页）。正如我们将在第二章中看到，马克思最初是以批评黑格尔法哲学为出发点，试图考察法律、法律以及政治领域中的国家等问题。然而，不久之后他开始进行经济学研究，暂时与国家问题保持距离，试图批判由个体行为产生的“物质生活关系”的总和。就像马克思和福柯那样，我们也需要反对国家的自主性和中心性。 然而，暂时搁置国家问题并非放弃对国家的批判。这就是“反抗国家的马克思”这一标题所蕴含的第二重意义。马克思“反抗国家”应该被理解为字面意义。也就是说，马克思不仅仅是试图克服并废除“资本主义”，而是同时试图克服并废除国家。因此，应该谨慎地将马克思（主义）的“国家消亡”论述与同时代的普鲁东或巴枯宁等无政府主义思想区分开来（巴索2015，176）。马克思的思想，就主张废除国家而言，实际上可以定位于无政府主义思潮之中。强调这一看似简单的事实是非常有意义的。正如本书将详细探讨的那样，马克思的资本主义批判不可避免地包含了国家批判。没错，没有国家批判，批判资本主义系统本身就是不可能的。这不仅限于“国家干预增加”的凯恩斯主义时代和当今的新自由主义时代的资本主义。换句话说，正如阿多诺使用“作为整体的社会”（Adorno1968，60）这一概念所简明指出的那样，马克思的政治经济批判不仅仅批判了经济领域，而是总体批判了资本主义社会系统。这个社会系统不仅包括商品、货币、资本组织起来的市场体系这样的权力关系，还包括法律、法规、国家等这样的权力关系。 福柯也是这么说的：“我并不是要说国家问题并不重要。而是说，权力关系的问题，因此在分析权力关系时的分析对象，必须超出国家框架的范畴。”（福柯1994日文译本第3页）。"},{"instruction":"请将“繰り返しになるが、国家の問題から距離をとることは国家の批判を棚上げすることではない。つまり、マルクス主義のキー概念である資本や階級を重視して国家を軽視することを意味しないのだ。むしろ、国家の問題をたんに回避してしまうことは、かつてのマルクス主義がそうであったように、国家を階級還元主義的あるいは道具主義的にとらえるという罠に陥ることにる。「権力の役割は、本来的には、生産関係を維持することにあり、生産力の発展および所有形態が可能にした階級支配を長続きさせるためのものであるとされる」(Foucault1997邦訳77頁)。こうした「経済主義」モデルにもとづいて、左派はしばしば、国家権力を介した生産関係の変革や支配階級の打倒を追求してきた。しかし、国家権力を掌握して管理しようとしても、そして、たとえその担い手が労働者階級や左派勢力であったとしても、権力関係それ自体を消滅させることはできない。したがって、私たちは「国家の自律性」という外観に抗しつつ、国家を含む権力関係の総体、すなわち国家を不可欠な構成要素とする資本主義社会システムを、より緻密に分析する必要があるのだ。 とはいえ、なぜマルクスの資本主義ならびに国家の批判に立ち返らなければならないのか、読者は疑問に思われるかもしれない。フーコーが『言葉と物』で述べたように、「マルクス主義は、一九世紀の思考において、水のなかの魚のようなものであって、それは他のいかなる場所においても呼吸することができなかった」(Foucault1996)。フーコーじしんは、リカードらの古典派経済学とともにマルクス主義の言説を近代西欧の「認識論的配置」の内部に位置づけて、「史的唯物論」のパラダイムを拒否したのである。じじつ、ミヒャエル・ハインリッヒも述べているように、「史的唯物論」の「歴史的決定論は、資本主義の終焉とプロレタリア革命を自然必然的に生じる出来事であるとみなしていた」(Heinrich2004,23)。本書もまた、こうした伝統的な「マルクス主義」を批判の対象とする。モイシュ・ポストンはこう定式化している。「伝統的マルクス主義は、資本主義を労働の視点から分析し、資本主義社会を階級関係から、つまり生産手段の私的所有と市場経済によって構造化された階級関係という観点から本質的に特徴づけるような理論的アプローチ」のことである(Postone1993,7)。こうした見方は、しばしばマルクス主義批判者も共有するものだとはいえ、それに対してマルクスの「真の解釈」を対置するだけでは不十分である。伝統的マルクス主義はたんなる理論的誤謬ではない。「マルクス主義とは、いわば権力諸関係の総体というか、権力のメカニズムと権力の力学の総体なのです」(Foucault1994邦訳74頁)。つまりそれは、二〇世紀の資本主義社会において、社会主義者や左派の「世界観」を提供し、独自の権力メカニズムを作り上げたのでる。じじつ、伝統的マルクス主義は、高揚する労働運動に対して「世界についての包括的な指針」を提供し、労働者階級のアイデンティティを構築する必要性から体系化されてきた(Heinrich2004,22f)。私たちはフーコーにならって、伝統的マルクス主義が演じてきた権力を相対化し、「政治的想像力の貧困化」に歯止めをかけなければならない。 だが、じつはマルクスとフーコーの距離はかんがえられているほど遠いものではない。たしかに、マルクスに言及しないことを左派から非難されたフーコーは、「マルクスが決定的な真理の所有者と見なされてはならない」と警鐘を鳴らしていた(Foucault1994邦訳78頁)。しかし私たちにとって、フーコーによる権力関係の分析は、マルクスの資本主義的生産関係の分析と基本的にはおなじ位相にある。フーコー自身、次のように述べている。「マルクスが資本についての分析のなかで労働者の貧困という問題に出会ったとき、彼は何をしたでしょう。そうした貧困を自然的欠如ないし謀られた搾取の結果とみなそうとする通常の説明を、彼は拒否しました。[…]マルクスは、搾取の告発にかえて、生産の分析を始めたのです。いくつかの違いを除けば、私がやりたかったのは大体それと同様のことになります」(Foucault1994邦訳3頁)。”翻译为中文","output":"重申一遍，与国家问题保持距离并不意味着搁置对国家的批评。也就是说，这并不意味着重视马克思主义的关键概念资本和阶级而忽视国家。相反，仅仅回避国家问题，就像过去的马克思主义那样，会陷入将国家视为阶级还原主义或工具主义的陷阱。“权力的角色本质上在于维持生产关系，以及使得由生产力的发展和所有制形态所可能的阶级统治持续下去”（福柯1997年日文译本第77页）。基于这种“经济主义”模型，左翼经常追求通过国家权力介入来改变生产关系和推翻统治阶级。然而，即使掌握了国家权力并进行管理，即使其承担者是工人阶级或左翼势力，也无法消除权力关系本身。因此，我们需要反对“国家的自治性”这一外观，更细致地分析包括国家在内的权力关系总体，也就是说，将国家作为不可或缺的组成部分的资本主义社会系统。 那么，为什么我们必须回到马克思的资本主义及其对国家的批评呢？读者可能会产生疑问。正如福柯在《话语与物》中所述，“马克思主义在19世纪的思想中就像鱼儿在水中一样，它无法在其他任何地方呼吸”（福柯1996）。福柯本人将马克思主义论述与里卡多等古典经济学一道，定位于现代西方的“认识论配置”内，并拒绝了“历史唯物论”的范式。事实上，正如迈克尔·海因里希所说，“历史唯物论”的“历史决定论将资本主义的终结和无产阶级革命视为自然必然发生的事件”（海因里希2004，第23页）。本书同样批判这种传统的“马克思主义”。莫西·波斯通如是定义：“传统马克思主义是一种理论方法，它从劳动的视角分析资本主义，并从生产手段的私有制及市场经济所构造的阶级关系的视角，本质上对资本主义社会进行了特征化”（波斯通1993，第7页）。尽管这种观点经常被马克思主义批评者所共享，但仅仅提出马克思的“真实解读”作为对应是不够的。传统马克思主义不仅仅是理论上的错误。“马克思主义可以说是权力关系总体，或者说，权力机制和权力动力学的总体”（福柯1994年日文译本第74页）。也就是说，它在20世纪的资本主义社会中为社会主义者和左翼提供了一种“世界观”，构建了其独特的权力机制。事实上，传统的马克思主义提供了对飙升的劳动运动的“全面指导”，并从构建工人阶级身份的需要中得到了体系化（海因里希2004，第22页及以下）。我们必须跟随福柯，相对化传统马克思主义所扮演的权力角色，防止“政治想象力贫乏”。 但实际上，马克思和福柯之间的距离并没有想象中的那么远。确实，由于福柯没有提及马克思而受到左翼的批评，他曾警告说，“马克思不应被视为决定性真理的拥有者”（福柯1994年日文译本第78页）。然而，对我们来说，福柯对权力关系的分析在本质上与马克思对资本主义生产关系的分析处于相同的层面上。福柯自己说：“当马克思在对资本进行分析时遭遇到工人贫困问题时，他做了什么？他拒绝了将这种贫困视为自然缺陷或者有预谋的剥削结果的常规解释。[...] 代替对剥削的指控，马克思开始了对生产的分析。除了一些差异外，我想要做的大致就是相同的事情”（福柯1994年日文译本第3页）。"},{"instruction":"请将“もっとも、第三章と第四章でみるように、法や法律、そして国家といった政治的領域の理解について、フーコーとマルクスには無視できないほど大きな違いが存在する。また、伝統的マルクス主義と大きく異なるマルクス自身のポリティカル・エコノミー批判の方法をふまえるならば、『資本論』関連草稿において展開された「史的唯物論」を再構成することも可能である。とはいえ、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判とフーコーの権力分析には、あまり着目されて来なかった共通点が存在する。本書が注目するのは、両者が「政治の批判」において採用したアプローチの独自性にほかならない。このことに関連して、エティエンヌ・バリバールは『群集の恐れ―マルクス以前と以後の政治と哲学』という著作のなかで次のように述べている。 それゆえ、フーコーが政治を構成する仕方は、その方法論的個人主義が喚起するかもしれないいくつかの見かけにもかかわらず、政治の自律性の再構成とは無縁である。なるほど、多少とも安定した社会的諸形態や、ふるまいの諸規範が構成されたものであるのに対し、権力関係は大いに構成するものとして理解されている。けれども、権力関係は、意識的なものであれ無意識的なものであれ、一つの意志として、あるいは諸々の意志の衝突としては、決して考えられていない。[…]したがってまた、このことは、権力諸関係や服属化が、支配と隷属(正当なものであれ不当なものであれ、法律を押しつけること)との関係においてではなく、物質的かつ精神的な諸々のテクノロジーとして解釈される仕方と結びついている。(Balibar1997) マルクス以後の政治哲学では、伝統的マルクス主義の「経済主義」モデルにたいして、しばしば「政治の自律性」が対置されてきた。たとえば、ポスト・マルクス主義の代表者であるラクラウとムフは、伝統的マルクス主義の「経済決定論」を批判する文脈で、賃労働資本関係を、たんなる階級闘争ではなく、むしろ生産関係や階級関係にたいして外在的な「闘争の場」として把握する(Laclau&Mouffe1985,79)。近年のポピュリズム論でも、ラクラウは徹底して「政治的なものそれ自体の存在論的な構成」を探求している。「人民の構築というすぐれた政治的行為」は、異質性を前提とした敵対性の境界を構成するが、敵対関係それ自体は生産諸関係に内在したものではない。むしろ、「政治的なもの」は、生産諸関係と生産諸関係に外在的なアイデンティティとのあいだで構成されるという(Laclau2007,Ch.5)。こうしてラクラウ は、商品や貨幣、資本といった「経済的領域」から「政治的領域」を存在論的に分離することで「政治の自律性」を再構成するのである。 なるほど、伝統的マルクス主義の権力作用を相対化しようとする点で、私たちはポスト・マルクス主義の問題意識を共有している。しかし本書が擁護したいのは、「政治の自律性」ではなく、むしろ「政治の他律性」というテーゼである。ただし「政治の他律性」とは、たんに法律やイデオロギーといった政治的上部構造が、「第一審級」(ホール)あるいは「最終審級」(アルチュセール)としての経済的土台によって規定されるという意味ではない。つまり、究極的な「経済の自律性」を主張するわけでもなければ、国家の強制力や物理的暴力、その他の支配従属諸関係を過小評価するわけでもない。むしろ、ポスト・マルクス主義とは異なる意味において、マルクスにおける「政治的なもの」の位相を積極的に考察するための概念装置である。エレン・ウッドが掲げた「政治的マルクス主義」もこの文脈において理解することができるだろう。ウッドによれば、資本主義における政治的領域と経済的領域の分離は、たんなる諸領域の区分を意味するのではなく、諸領域の結合あるいは絡み合いとして、つまり一連の権力諸関係として把握されなければならない(Wood1995,Ch.1)。伝統的マルクス主義は、生産諸関係を維持し再生産する「機能」として「政治的領域」を理解するが、こうした経済主義モデルは断固として退けなければならないのだ。とはいえ、ニコス・プーランザスがそうしたように、フーコーに反対して階級的力関係や国家の中心的役割を強調することはできない(Poulantzas1978)。マルクス国家論を体系化することや、敵対性やアイデンティティの構築といったかたちで「政治の自律性」を再構成することは本書では禁欲される。フーコーの権力分析がそうであったように、私たちは「他律性」といういわば消極的で受動的なかたちで「政治的領域」を再構成し、マルクスの政治批判ひいては未完の国家批判を遂行する必要がある。”翻译为中文","output":"尽管如此，正如我们将在第三章和第四章中看到的那样，福柯和马克思在对法律、法律以及国家等政治领域的理解上存在着不容忽视的重大差异。此外，如果基于与传统马克思主义明显不同的马克思自身的政治经济批判方法，那么重构《资本论》相关草稿中展开的“历史唯物论”也是可能的。然而，马克思的政治经济批判和福柯的权力分析之间，存在着一些至今未受到足够关注的共同点。本书关注的是，双方在“政治批判”中采取的方法独特性。与此相关，艾蒂安·巴利巴尔在其著作《群众的恐惧——马克思之前和之后的政治与哲学》中提到： 因此，虽然福柯对政治的构建方式可能因其方法论个人主义而引起的某些外象，但与政治自主性的重构无关。确实，与某种程度上稳定的社会形态或行为规范相比，权力关系被大量理解为构成性的。然而，权力关系无论是作为一种有意识的还是无意识的形式，从来都不被视为一种意志或多种意志的冲突。（巴利巴尔1997） 在马克思之后的政治哲学中，针对传统马克思主义的“经济主义”模型，常常提出了“政治自主性”的对立。例如，作为后马克思主义的代表人物拉克劳和姆菲在批判传统马克思主义的“经济决定论”语境中，将雇佣劳动与资本关系理解为一个非简单地归于阶级斗争，而是作为外在于生产关系和阶级关系的“斗争场”（拉克劳&姆菲1985，79）。在近年的民粹主义论述中，拉克劳深入探讨了“政治本身的本质构成”。 “构建人民的卓越政治行为”构成了基于差异性的敌对边界，但敌对关系本身并非内在于生产关系。相反，“政治的”是在生产关系和外在于生产关系的身份之间构建的（拉克劳2007，第5章）。因此，拉克劳通过将“经济领域”从“政治领域”中本体论地分离，重构“政治自主性”。 当然，我们在寻求相对化传统马克思主义的权力作用方面，与后马克思主义共享一定的问题意识。然而，本书所捍卫的不是“政治自主性”，而是“政治他律性”这一命题。但是，“政治他律性”并不仅仅意味着政治上层建筑如法律或意识形态被视为由经济基础作为“第一审级”（霍尔）或“最终审级”（阿尔都塞）所决定。也就是说，这既不是主张最终的“经济自主性”，也不是低估国家的强制力、物理暴力或其他支配从属关系。相反，这是一个在不同意义上积极考察马克思中“政治的”阶段的概念装置。艾伦·伍德提出的“政治马克思主义”也可以在这个语境中被理解。伍德认为，资本主义中政治领域与经济领域的分离不仅仅意味着领域的划分，而应该被理解为领域的结合或交织，即一系列权力关系（伍德1995，第1章）。传统马克思主义将政治领域理解为维持和再生产生产关系的“功能”，这种经济主义模型必须被坚决拒绝。然而，正如尼科斯·普兰扎斯所做的那样，我们不能反对福柯，强调阶级力量关系或国家的中心角色（普兰扎斯1978）。在本书中，系统化马克思的国家论，或以敌意或身份的构建等方式重构“政治自主性”是被禁止的。就像福柯对权力分析所做的那样，我们需要以一种被动的“他律性”方式重新构建“政治领域”，并执行马克思的政治批判乃至未完成的国家批判。"},{"instruction":"As

The additional message \`(没有那个文件或目录)\` is Chinese for \\"No such file or directory.\\" Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue: 1. **Check the Path**: Verify the path \`/tmpHdfsCluster/HDFS78000002\` to ensure it is correctly specified. Any typo or incorrect path can lead to this error. 2. **File Existence**: Ensure the file or directory you're trying to access actually exists at the specified location. If you are running a program that is supposed to create this file or directory, confirm that the program executed successfully and had the necessary permissions to create the file or directory. 3. **Permissions Issue**: Even if the file or directory exists, your application might not have the necessary permissions to access it. Check the permissions of the file/directory to ensure your application has read/write access as required. 4. **HDFS Consideration**: Given the naming (\`/tmpHdfsCluster/HDFS78000002\`), if this path is intended to be on Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) rather than the local filesystem, make sure you are accessing it correctly. In Java, you would typically use Hadoop's FileSystem API to interact with HDFS. Verify that your code correctly specifies the HDFS path and that your Hadoop client is properly configured. 5. **File System Checks**: If the path is on a local file system, ensure that there is no file system corruption or issues preventing access to the directory. Similar checks might be necessary if the path is on a networked file system or other types of storage. 6. **Contextual Analysis**: Consider the context in which this error occurs. If it's during the execution of a larger application, there may be prior steps or operations that failed, leading to the absence of this file or directory. Reviewing logs or outputs from preceding steps can provide clues. 7. **Application Logic**: Review the application logic to ensure that the file or directory should exist at the point where the error occurs. It might be necessary to adjust the application logic to handle cases where the file or directory doesn't exist as expected. Lastly, if your application is meant to read this file and proceed, it might be appropriate to add logic to check for the file's existence before attempting to access it, potentially logging a more informative error or taking corrective action if it does not exist."},{"instruction":"dfs.client.failover.cache-active.dir 作用","output":"\`dfs.client.failover.cache-active.dir\` 是 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) 配置参数中的一个，但基于我的最新信息（截至 2023 年），它不是 Hadoop 官方提供的标准配置选项。可能有以下几点需要注意： 1. **配置来源**: 这个配置可能来源于特定的Hadoop发行版或者是特定应用程序对Hadoop客户端的自定义扩展。一些发行版如 Cloudera, Hortonworks 或者是云服务商提供的 Hadoop 服务可能会引入了它们自己的配置选项来优化性能或提供额外的功能。 2. **名字暗示**: 根据名称\`dfs.client.failover.cache-active.dir\`，我们可以推断这个配置项可能与客户端故障转移机制相关，特别是与缓存活跃的NameNode目录有关。在Hadoop的高可用性配置中，客户端在与集群通信时可能需要快速切换到另一台NameNode，如果存在缓存目录的配置，那么这可能是为了优化这种切换过程，减少故障转移时延。 3. **缺失的正式文档**: 由于这个配置项在 Hadoop 的官方文档中未被列出或描述，如果你正在使用这个配置项，强烈建议检查你所使用的 Hadoop 发行版的官方文档或支持论坛。可能是发行版特定的功能，或者是特定于你的环境的自定义设置。 4. **更多信息**: 要了解这个配置选项的具体作用和如何正确使用它，最直接的途径是查询你所使用的 Hadoop 发行版的相关文档。如果是在企业环境中，也可以咨询你的 Hadoop 集群管理员或技术支持团队。 5. **建议**: 如果你是在进行开发或配置调整，而且觉得需要使用到这个特定的配置项，那么确保彻底理解它的影响，最好在非生产环境中先行测试，以确保不会对集群的稳定性和性能产生负面影响。 综上所述，\`dfs.client.failover.cache-active.dir\` 看似是与客户端处理NameNode故障转移相关的高级配置选项，但需要通过具体的发行版或环境文档来确切了解其用途和配置方法。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

しかし、分配上の差異が現われるとともに、階級の区別も現われてくる。社会は、特権的な階級と不遇な階級、搾取する階級と搾取される階級、支配する階級と支配される階級に分かれる。そして、国家というものは、同一部族に属するもろもろの共同体の自然生的な諸集団が、はじめはただその共同的利害(たとえば、東洋における灌漑)をはかり、外敵を防御することだけを目的として発展してきたが、このとき以後、国家それらの目的とならんで、支配する階級の生活および支配の諸条件を、支配される階級に対抗して暴力によって維持することをも、同様に目的とするようになる。(MEGAI/27,341f) ここで強調されているのは、「ある一つの階級が他の階級を抑圧するために組織された暴力」(MEW4,482)という『宣言』で定式化された国家論である。それは、資本主義に特殊な国家ではなく、階級社会以降に成立したという意味で「階級歴史貫通」的な国家である。エンゲルスによれば、階級社会が成立して以降、その時々の搾取階級は社会の経済的構造において被搾取階級にたいする支配を暴力的に貫徹する必要がある。国家は、階級社会以前の原始共同体のように、たんに社会の共同的利害を維持するだけではなく、社会の「上部構造」として経済的土台における支配階級の搾取を保障しなければならない。これが「土台-上部構造」論にもとづく経済主義・階級還元主義モデルである。こうした階級国家論は、その後のマルクス主義批判者によって、マルクス自身の国家批判と区別されることなく、しばしば非難の対象となってきた。さらにエンゲルスは、こうした国家論の実践的含意として「プロレタリアート独裁(以下、プロ独)」とその後の「国家死滅」について体系化を試みた。追悼文である「カール・マルクスの死によせて」『社会民主主義者』(一八八三年)において、エンゲルスは次のように書いている。”翻译为中文","output":"补充马克思自身零散记述，首次建立马克思主义国家论的是恩格斯。但是，恩格斯体系化的传统马克思主义的国家论，与马克思自己的政治经济批判无关。本书无法涉及所有内容，但最具特色的可能是源自《宣言》的“阶级国家论”。根据这一“工具主义”模型，国家被理解为统治阶级可以为任意目的利用的工具。确实，马克思在《宣言》中也分享了这样的国家观。然而，马克思自己在随后的政治经济批判中一直关注构成资本主义社会系统的国家，而恩格斯则没有限于资本主义社会，理论化了自“文明社会”以来阶级对立出现的一般国家。正如卡弗(Carver)所指出的，对恩格斯来说，重要的不是现代的特殊性，而是“历史性进步”（Carver1983,139-140）。恩格斯在《经济学批判》的书评中所阐述的“唯物史观”，使马克思的政治经济批判成为了一个对资本主义社会系统固有的模糊的理论分析。事实上，在《反杜林论》（1878年）中，恩格斯也表达了以下观点： 然而，随着分配上的差异的出现，阶级的区别也随之出现。社会被分为有特权的阶级和不幸的阶级，剥削阶级和被剥削阶级，统治阶级和被统治阶级。而国家，最初是作为同一部落中各种自然社团共同利益的体现（例如，东方的灌溉）而发展起来，其目的仅仅是防御外敌，但从那时起，国家除了这些目的之外，还同样旨在通过暴力将统治阶级的生活和统治的条件对抗被统治阶级以维持。 这里强调的是，《宣言》中表述的“一个阶级用于压迫其他阶级的组织化暴力”。这不是资本主义特有的国家，而是在阶级社会产生之后的“历史贯穿性”国家。按照恩格斯的说法，自从阶级社会确立以来，每个时代的剥削阶级都需要暴力地实施对被剥削阶级的统治。国家不仅要像原始共同体那样保持社会的共同利益，而作为社会的“上层建筑”，还必须保障经济基础上统治阶级的剥削。这就是基于“基础-上层建筑”论的经济主义、阶级还原主义模型。这种阶级国家论在随后的马克思主义批评者中，往往与马克思自身的国家批判无区分地，成为了批评的对象。此外，恩格斯还试图系统化这种国家论的实践含义，包括“无产阶级专政（以下简称无专）”及其后的“国家消亡”。在纪念文章《卡尔·马克思逝世》（1883年）中，恩格斯写道。"},{"instruction":"请将“マルクスと私は、一八四五年以来、将来のプロレタリア革命の最終の結果の一つは、国家という名のついた政治的組織の漸次的な解消であろうという見解をもちつづけてきました。この組織の主要目的は、昔から、富を独占する少数者による、働く多数者の経済的抑圧を、武力をもって保障することでした。富を独占する少数者の消滅とともに、武装した抑圧暴力、つまり国家暴力の必要性も消滅します。だが同時に、われわれは次のような見解をつねにもってきました。すなわち、この目的を達成するためにも、また未来の社会革命のそれ以外のはるかに重要な目的を達成するためにも、労働者階級は、まずもって国家という組織された政治的暴力を獲得し、その助けを借りて資本家階級の抵抗を弾圧し、社会を新しく組織しなければならないと。このことはすでに、一八四八年の『共産党宣言』の第二章末尾に書いてあります。(MEGAI/25,419) 未来社会における国家解消についての明快なテーゼは、エンゲルスの死後に体系化された伝統的マルクス主義の共通理解となり、カウツキーやベルンシュタインの「プロ独」解釈に反対したレーニンの『国家と革命』にも大きな影響を与えた。しかし、次章以降で検討するように、マルクス自身が「宣言』以降、エンゲルスと全く同じ見解を持ち続けていたかについては大いに疑問がある。なぜなら、マルクスのポリテッカル·エコノミー批判によれば、そもそも未来社会における「国家死滅」を論じる以前に資本主義社会システムの国家を分析し終える必要があったからだ。とはいえ、ここで私たちが検討したい問題は「道具主義」モデルの実践的帰結である。ハンス・ケルゼンが強調したように、マルクス主義者はアナキストと同様に国家暴力の消滅を志向する(Kelsen1920邦訳7頁)。しかしマルクス主義者は、将来的な共産主義社会においては国家が死滅するということを主張する一方で、資本家階級の国家がさしあたり労働者階級の国家に取って代わる必要性を強調する。なぜなら、労働者階級によって掌握された国家は、経済的土台において生産手段を公的に所有したうえで、政治的上部構造として、被支配階級である資本家階級その他を抑圧する必要があるからだ。ケルゼンが適切に批判したように、ここに伝統的マルクス主義の隘路がある。「国家がブルジョワの強制秩序装置からプロレタリアのそれに変ずるにあたっては、比類なくその権力と権限が拡大し、それが極大に達したところで、突如として謎のように消失するとは、まさにパラドックスではないか」(Kelsen1929邦訳38-40頁)。伝統的マルクス主義の国家論は、共産主義社会への移行(過渡期としての社会主義)を考察する際に、自らの経済還元主義を反転させ、突如として「政治の自律性」を強調する。まずもって政治的権力によって新しい社会を改造・組織しなければならないというわけだ。こうして、支配階級となったプロレタリアートによる「独裁」という意味での政治中心主義に陥るのである。しかし、いわゆる「現存社会主義」体制に言及するまでもなく、共産主義社会への移行を政治的上部構造としての国家をつうじて実現することにはそもそも限界がある。 グラムシの「市民社会」論 伝統的マルクス主義国家論の欠点は、「土台-上部構造」論の機械論的理解にあった。この問題に焦点をあてて、実践的にもファシズムやコミンテルンのスターリン主義に対抗する必要から「土台-上部構造」論を再考したのが、イタリアのマルクス主義者グラムシである。伝統的マルクス主義は、ブルジョワ社会と国家の二元主義あるいは経済と政治の分離を把握したが、このトポロジー的分離を実体化し、両者の結合様式を政治にたいする経済の作用として機械論的に把握してしまった。しかし、そもそも「土台上部構造」という社会構成体の図式は、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判にとっての「導きの糸」(MEGAII/2,100)にすぎず、その最終的な結論ではなかった。第三章で検討するが、伝統的マルクス主義の「土台上部構造論」のように、両者の分離した領域を固定的なものとして把握することはできない。”翻译为中文","output":"“马克思和我自1845年以来一直持有这样的观点：未来无产阶级革命的最终结果之一将是名为国家的政治组织的逐步解体。这个组织的主要目的从来都是，通过武力保障少数占有财富者对劳动众多者的经济压迫。随着占有财富的少数者的消失，武装的压迫暴力，即国家暴力的必要性也随之消失。但同时，我们始终持有这样的观点：为了达到这个目的，以及为了实现未来社会革命的其他远更重要的目的，工人阶级首先必须获得名为国家的组织化政治暴力，并借助其来镇压资本家阶级的抵抗，并对社会进行重新组织。这一点已经在1848年的《共产党宣言》第二章末尾写明。 对于未来社会中国家消亡的清晰论断，在恩格斯去世后成为了传统马克思主义的共识，并且对列宁的《国家与革命》产生了重大影响，该书反对考茨基和伯恩施坦的“无产阶级专政”解释。然而，正如我们将在后续章节中检查的，自《宣言》以后，马克思是否一直持有与恩格斯完全相同的观点，存在很大疑问。因为据马克思的政治经济批判，讨论未来社会中的“国家消亡”之前，必须先完成对资本主义社会系统中国家的分析。不过，我们在这里想要审视的问题是“工具主义”模型的实践结果。正如汉斯·凯尔森强调的，马克思主义者像无政府主义者一样，倾向于国家暴力的消亡。但是，马克思主义者一方面主张在未来的共产主义社会中，国家将会消亡，另一方面强调，在当前资本家阶级的国家必须被劳动者阶级的国家所取代的必要性。因为，被劳动阶级掌握的国家，在经济基础上公有生产手段的同时，作为政治上层建筑，有必要压迫被统治阶级，即资本家阶级等。正如凯尔森恰当地批评的，这里存在传统马克思主义的狭隘之处：“国家从资产阶级的强制秩序装置变为无产阶级的装置时，其权力和权威无比扩大，并在达到极点时，突然如谜一般消失，这不正是一种悖论？”（Kelsen1929日文翻译第38-40页）。传统马克思主义的国家论，在考虑向共产主义社会过渡（作为过渡期的社会主义）时，反转了其经济还原论，突然强调了“政治的自主性”。即首先必须通过政治权力重塑、组织新社会。这就陷入了所谓的统治阶级成为无产阶级通过“独裁”来实现的政治中心主义。然而，不必提及所谓的“现存社会主义”体制，通过国家这一政治上层建筑来实现向共产主义社会的过渡本身就有其局限性。 格拉姆西的“市民社会”论 传统马克思主义国家论的缺点在于对“基础-上层建筑”论的机械性理解。针对这一问题并实践上也需要对抗法西斯主义和共产国际的斯大林主义，重新考虑“基础-上层建筑”论的是意大利马克思主义者格拉姆西。传统马克思主义理解了资产阶级社会与国家的二元性或经济与政治的分离，但将这种拓扑学分离实体化，并以机械性的方式理解了经济对政治的作用以及它们的结合方式。然而，所谓的“基础与上层建筑”社会结构模型，本来只是马克思政治经济批判的“导引线”（MEGAII/2,100），而不是其最终结论。正如第三章所讨论的，与传统马克思主义的“基础上层建筑论”不同，不能将两者的分隔领域固定化。"},{"instruction":"请将“グラムシの功績は、まさに経済的領域と政治的領域すなわち土台と上部構造の連続性を把握しようとした点にある。そのための概念が、伝統的マルクス主義が静態的に把握した、ブルジョワ社会と国家という単純な二元主義ではなく、むしろ両者の領域を横断する「市民社会societascivilis」にほかならない。平子友長は、グラムシが主題化した「societascivilis」という概念を古典古代にさかのぼって思想史的に考察しているが、この概念は次の二つの意味に整理される。「市民社会は、(一)それが経済社会の利害関係に基づく論理とは異なる地平で独自な政治的共同の構築を志向する理念および運動を意味する(政治的社会としての市民社会)と共に、(二)政治的社会の内部では、国家の登場以降支配的となった機構ないし装置による統治に対抗して、市民自身による水平的でかつ自治的な政治的関係の領域を確保し、定着させ、拡大させてゆこうとする理念および運動を意味する(国家と対抗する市民社会)」(平子2007,55)。グラムシは、伝統的マルクス主義において失われた「市民社会」概念を復権させ、マルクス主義者として初めて、ヘーゲル以降に経済社会として純化された「ブルジョワ社会」と、「政治的領域」である市民社会を明確に区別したのである。 グラムシが『獄中ノート』で述べたように、近代国家は、狭義の統治機構(官僚機構や軍隊・警察など)ではなく、私的なヘゲモニー装置(メディアや家族など)を含む政治的社会として理解される。そのことによって、「階級支配のための暴力装置」という道具主義モデルは相対化され、国家はむしろ「政治的共同性」を体現した権力関係として理解される。つまり、政治的社会としての国家は、支配階級が被支配階級にたいして政治的・文化的な指導および同意を調達するというヘゲモニー関係を包括するのである。マルクス自身も、「ド・イデ」諸草稿においてグラムシと同様に、「政治的共同性」を体現した国家に言及しているが、ここでは「政治の自律性」が近代国家の「一般的幻想性」として定式化されているように見える。 まさに特殊的利害と共同的利害とのこの矛盾から、共同的利害は、国家として、現実の個別的利害と総体的利害から切り離された自立した姿態をとり、それと同時に幻想的な共同性として自立した姿態をとる。[…]諸個人が彼らの特殊な彼らにとって彼らの共同的利害とは一致しないものだけを追求するからこそ―これは、彼らにとって「疎遠な」、彼らから「独立した」、それ自体ふたたび特殊で独特な「一般的」利害として押し通されるか、あるいは、彼ら自身が、民主政におけるように、この分裂のなかで動かざるを得ない。他方で、それゆえに、たえず共同的利害と幻想的な共同的利害とに現実的に対立する、これらの諸特殊利害の実践的闘争もまた、国家としての幻想的に「一般的な」利害による実践と制御を必要にさせる。(MEGAI/5,33-7) マルクスはここで近代国家の相対的自律性を論じているのではなく、ブルジョワ社会における諸利害の対立と近代国家の「幻想的共同性」が密接不可分であることを強調している。こうした国家観の理論的基礎に次章以降で見ていくように、「ド・イデ」諸草稿で確立された物象化論的な問題構成が存在する。ヒルシュもまた、資本主義社会における諸個人の共同的利害が、「彼らに対して、物象の姿態を帯びながら疎遠で「物神化された」仕方において対立する」点に着目している(Hirsch2005,21)。つまり国家は、単なる物理的な暴力装置ではなく、諸個人の特殊利害から「自立し」、諸個人に対立する「社会的連関」であり、特定の権力関係なのである。ただし、マルクスはここで、後にエンゲルスが体系化した「階級歴史貫通」的な国家を考察しているわけではない。つまり、ブルジョワ社会に対応する近代国家に独自の規定が展開されているのだ。「国家は、ブルジョワ社会とならんで、かつその外にある特殊な存在」であり、ブルジョワが「自らの所有と諸利害の相互保証のために必然的に自分たちに与える組織の形態にほかならない」(MEGAI/5,1166)。この「私的所有を保証する」政治的権力は、クロフォード・マクファーソンも着目したように、ホッブズやロックに典型的な国家規定であった(Macpherson1962,Ch.1)”翻译为中文","output":"格拉姆西的成就在于尝试理解经济领域和政治领域，即基础和上层建筑的连续性。为此而提出的概念，并不是传统马克思主义静态地理解的资产阶级社会和国家这种简单的二元对立，而是更多地横跨这两个领域的“市民社会”。平子友长已经从思想史的角度追溯了格拉姆西主题化的“市民社会”概念，并将这个概念整理为以下两层含义：“市民社会一方面意味着以经济社会的利益关系为基础上的逻辑不同的层面上，旨在构建独特的政治共同体的理念和运动（作为政治社会的市民社会）；另一方面，在政治社会内，意味着面对国家出现之后变得主导的机构或装置的统治，市民通过自发和自治的政治关系领域来保证、固定并扩展这种理念和运动（与国家对抗的市民社会）”（平子2007,55）。格拉姆西恢复了在传统马克思主义中丧失的“市民社会”概念，并作为马克思主义者，第一次明确区分了经济社会即纯化的“资产阶级社会”，和作为“政治领域”的市民社会。 正如格拉姆西在《狱中笔记》中所提到的，现代国家不仅仅是狭义的统治机构（官僚机构、军队、警察等），而是包括私人霸权装置（媒体、家庭等）在内的政治社会。这样，“为了阶级统治的暴力装置”这一工具主义模型被相对化，国家反而被理解为体现“政治共同性”的权力关系。也就是说，作为政治社会的国家，包含统治阶级对被统治阶级进行政治和文化指导以及获得同意的霸权关系。马克思本人在“德意志意识形态”草稿中也类似于格拉姆西提到了体现“政治共同性”的国家，但在这里，“政治的自主性”似乎被表述为现代国家的“一般性幻觉”。 正是从这个特殊利益与共同利益的矛盾中，共同利益作为国家，以独立的姿态出现，与具体的个别利益和总体利益分离，同时作为幻想的共同性以独立的姿态出现。[…]正因为各个人只追求对他们而言不符合他们共同利益的特殊事物——这就是，与他们“疏远的”、“独立于他们”的，本身再次成为特殊的、独特的“一般性”利益，或者正如他们自己在民主政治中那样，不得不在这种分裂中行动。另一方面，因此，这些特殊利益的实践斗争也与共同利益和幻想的共同利益实质性地对立，这促使了作为国家的幻想的“一般性”利益的实践和控制的需求。(MEGAI/5,33-7) 马克思在这里并不是讨论现代国家的相对自主性，而是强调资产阶级社会中各种利益的对立与现代国家的“幻想共同性”是密不可分的。如后续章节将探讨的，这种对国家观的理论基础，有其在“德意志意识形态”草稿中确立的物化论问题构成。希尔什也指出，资本主义社会中个人的共同利益，“以物化形式出现，以疏远的、‘物化了的’方式与他们对立”（Hirsch2005,21）。也就是说，国家不仅仅是一个物理的暴力装置，而是与个人的特殊利益“独立”并与个人对立的“社会关系”，是一种特定的权力关系。但是，马克思在这里并没有考虑恩格斯后来体系化的“历史贯通”的国家概念。也就是，对应于资产阶级社会的现代国家被赋予了独特的规定。“国家是与资产阶级社会并存且独立于其之外的特殊存在”，资产阶级“不得不自己赋予的组织形式，以确保他们自己的财产和各种利益的相互保障”（MEGAI/5,1166）。这种“保障私有财产”的政治权力，就如克劳福德·麦克弗森所注意到的，是霍布斯或洛克等人典型的国家规定（Macpherson1962,Ch.1）。"},{"instruction":"As

Sonuçta, doğa hakkında haklı çıkan taraf doğa bilimciler değil sosyal bilimciler oldu. Deney ve gözlem imkanlarının gelişmesiyle birlikte doğa bilimci empristler, 2300 senelik bir gecikmeyle de olsa (materyalist Demokritos’un ölümü MÖ 370) atomun varlığını kabul ettiler.","output":"20. yüzyılın başlarında doğa bilimleri ve sosyal bilimler arasında yaşanan bu karşılaşma, bilimin metodolojisine ve felsefi altyapısına dair derin farklılıkları yansıtmaktadır. Bu durumda doğa bilimci empristler ile sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin \\"atomun varlığı\\" konusunda farklı tutumlar sergilemesi ve en sonunda materyalist görüşün doğrulanması birçok faktöre bağlanabilir: 1. **Felsefi Yaklaşımların İşlevselliği:** Empristler (örneğin Ernst Mach ve Viyana çevresi) o dönemde mevcut olan teknolojik ve metodolojik sınırlılıklar nedeniyle gözlemlenemeyen fenomenlere karşı şüpheci bir yaklaşım sergilerken, materyalistler (örneğin Lenin, Engels) daha keskin bir teorik yapıya, yani maddenin temel yapıtaşları olarak atomlara ve onların ötesindeki yapıların varlığına dair bir öngörüye sahipti. 2. **Bilimsel İlerlemenin Doğası:** Bilim tarihine bakıldığında, teorik ön kabullerin pek çok kez bilimsel ilerlemeye rehberlik ettiği görülür. Demokritos ve Epikür'ün atom teorisi gibi, teorik öngörülerin bilimsel keşiflerle doğrulanması zaman alabilir. Bu keşifler, çoğu zaman var olan teknoloji ve gözlem yöntemleri yeterli seviyeye ulaştığında mümkün olmuştur. 3. **Materyalizmin Tarih Boyunca Sürekliliği:** Materyalizm, Antik Çağ'dan beri doğanın maddi yapısını anlama çabasının bir parçası olmuştur. Marx, Engels, Lenin gibi düşünürler, materyalizmi sosyal ve siyasal teorilerine entegre ederken, aynı zamanda doğa üzerine de yoğunlaşmış ve atom gibi kavramları aktif bir şekilde kullanmışlardır. 4. **Bilimsel Devrim:** 20. yüzyılın başlarında atom teorisinin doğrulanmasıyla birlikte, emprist yaklaşımlar da önemli ölçüde değişti. Quantum teorisi ve görelilik teorisi gibi devrimci teorilerin ortaya çıkışı, bilimdeki temel kavram ve varsayımları yeniden şekillendirdi. Bu dönüşüm sırasında, daha önce emprik gözlemle sınırlı olan bilimsel anlayış, teorik fizikteki soyut kavramları ve matematiksel modellemeyi büyük ölçüde kabul etti. 5. **Felsefenin ve Bilimin İlişkisi:** Bu durum, felsefenin bilimin gelişimindeki rolünü de vurgulamaktadır. Felsefi soruşturma, bilimsel teorilerin temelini oluşturan varsayımlar ve kavramlar üzerine derinlemesine düşünmeyi sağlar. Dolayısıyla, Marx, Engels, Lenin gibi düşünürlerin katkıları, bilimin kendisine yönelik bir eleştiri ve onun metodolojik temellerini yeniden değerlendirme girişimi olarak da görülebilir.

This sort of error can occur in a variety of scenarios when working with datetime data in pandas or Numpy, especially in operations involving filtering, sorting, or any form of comparison. The error essentially means that the operation you're trying to perform is not directly supported between these two types without some form of type conversion or handling. # How to Address the Issue 1. **Ensure Consistent Datatypes:** Make sure that both objects involved in the operation are of the same type. You can convert a pandas Series to a \`DatetimeArray\` using \`pd.to_datetime()\`, or you may need to ensure that individual datetime objects match the types expected in your operation. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Assuming \`df['date']\` is a pandas Series and \`some_date\` is a single datetime object df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date']) some_date = pd.to_datetime(some_date) result = df[df['date'] > some_date] # Example comparison \`\`\` 2. **Convert DatetimeArray to Series or Numpy Array:** If working within pandas and encountering this issue during operations, consider working with \`pd.Series\` directly or converting your \`DatetimeArray\` to a Numpy array using \`.to_numpy()\` for more complex operations or comparisons. \`\`\`python # Converting a DatetimeArray to a Series for operations datetime_array = pd.date_range(start='2020-01-01', periods=5) datetime_series = pd.Series(datetime_array) # Or converting to numpy array for comparison datetime_numpy = datetime_array.to_numpy() \`\`\` 3. **Element-wise Operations:** In some cases, you might need to perform element-wise operations to properly compare or manipulate arrays of datetime objects. Utilize pandas or Numpy functions designed for element-wise comparison or manipulation for these scenarios. 4. **Review the Operation Context:** Consider the specific operation causing the error. It's possible that the logical operation or comparison you're attempting may need to be approached differently. For example, you might be trying to use a datetime object where a sequence of datetimes is expected, or vice versa. 5. **Debugging:** When faced with an unclear situation, examine the types and values of the variables involved directly before the error occurs. Using \`type(variable)\` to understand the data type and \`print(variable)\` or inspection in a debugging tool can be very helpful. # Summary To resolve the \`TypeError: Invalid comparison between dtype=datetime64[ns] and DatetimeArray\`, ensure compatibility between the objects involved either by converting types or adjusting the operation to handle these datatypes appropriately. The primary goal is to ensure that comparisons or operations are conducted between objects of compatible or identical types."},{"instruction":"怎么解决呢：TypeError: Invalid comparison between dtype=datetime64[ns] and DatetimeArray","output":"遇到 \`TypeError: Invalid comparison between dtype=datetime64[ns] and DatetimeArray\` 这类错误时，首先要确认参与比较的两个对象的类型，确保它们可以进行直接比较。以下是一些可行的解决策略： # 1. 统一数据类型 确保参与比较的两个对象都是同一数据类型。如果一个对象是 \`datetime64[ns]\` 类型，而另一个是 \`DatetimeArray\`，你可能需要将它们转换为相同的类型。通常，将它们都转换为 pandas 的 \`datetime64[ns]\` 类型是较为简单的方法。 \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # 假设 df['date'] 是 pandas Series，some_date_array 是 DatetimeArray df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date']) some_date_series = pd.Series(some_date_array) # 现在可以进行比较 result = df[df['date'] > some_date_series.iloc[0]] # 举例，与 DatetimeArray 中的第一个日期比较 \`\`\` # 2. 转换为兼容的类型 如果你正在尝试比较一个 \`datetime64[ns]\` 类型和一个 \`DatetimeArray\`，尝试将 \`DatetimeArray\` 转换为 pandas \`Series\` 或者 \`datetime64[ns]\` 类型。 \`\`\`python #从 DatetimeArray 转换为 pd.Series datetime_array = pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', periods=5, freq='D') # 创建一个 DatetimeArray datetime_series = pd.Series(datetime_array) # 转换为 Series #现在，datetime_series 可以和其他 datetime64[ns] 类型对象进行比较 \`\`\` # 3. 使用适当的 pandas/numpy 函数 若要对时间序列数据进行操作或比较，确保使用适当的 pandas 或 numpy 函数，这些函数可以自然地处理时间数据类型。 # 4. 检查操作逻辑 仔细检查引发错误的具体操作，确保比较或者操作的逻辑是正确的。可能需要调整代码逻辑，来避免直接比较不兼容的类型。 # 5. 示例：筛选日期 如果你的目标是筛选出某个时间范围的数据，确保所有日期都被适当地转换和比较。 \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # 示例 DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame({'date': pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', periods=10, freq='D')}) # 转换和筛选 some_date = pd.to_datetime('2022-01-05') filtered_df = df[df['date'] > some_date] print(filtered_df) \`\`\` 总之，处理此类错误的关键在于确保数据类型的一致性，使用 pandas 和 numpy 提供的工具和方法适当地处理日期时间数据。如果操作或比较逻辑正确，确保参与比较的对象类型相匹配，应可解决此错误。"},{"instruction":"optimize sentence: As scheduled, Rayna is helping to run the job on UAT and found that some exception was encountered, please be informed that the code has been updated.","output":"Rayna is coordinating the UAT run as planned and encountered an exception.

Therefore, converting a \`Timedelta\` directly to UTC or any other timezone doesn't exactly apply in the way it does for a specific \`Timestamp\`. A \`Timedelta\` simply represents a span of time (in your example, 12345 hours) without reference to any start or end point in time. However, if you want to use this \`Timedelta\` to calculate a new point in time from a given \`Timestamp\`, you can indeed consider or convert this result into any timezone, including UTC. Here's how you can do it: 1. **Starting from the current moment:** \`\`\`python import pandas as pd from datetime import datetime import pytz # For timezone handling # Create a Timedelta delta = pd.Timedelta(12345, 'H') # Current moment in UTC now_utc = datetime.now(pytz.utc) # New point in time, 12345 hours from now, in UTC new_time_utc = now_utc + delta print(new_time_utc) \`\`\` 2. **Starting from a specific moment:** If you're starting from a specific timestamp rather than the current moment, you can similarly apply the \`Timedelta\` and then ensure the resulting \`Timestamp\` is converted to UTC if it isn't already: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd from datetime import datetime import pytz # For timezone handling # Example timestamp (in some local timezone) example_timestamp = datetime(2023, 1, 1, tzinfo=pytz.timezone('America/New_York')) # Create a Timedelta delta = pd.Timedelta(12345, 'H') # New point in time, 12345 hours from the example timestamp new_time = example_timestamp + delta # Convert the result to UTC new_time_utc = new_time.astimezone(pytz.utc) print(new_time_utc) \`\`\` In these examples, \`new_time_utc\` will represent a specific point in time in UTC that is 12345 hours from the starting point.

This is an uncommon scenario meant only to occur under significant strain from particularly complex or extensive queries. Here's a breakdown of what this means and some steps you can take to address the issue: # Understanding the Issue - **Complex Queries:** Queries that involve multiple joins, subqueries, nested selections, or a combination of these can become too complex for the query processor to handle efficiently. The complexity not only makes it difficult to generate a query plan but it can also lead to performance issues. - **Large Number of Tables/Partitions:** Queries that reference a very high number of tables or partitions demand more resources to generate a query plan. This is because the query planner must consider numerous potential ways to execute the query, which can quickly escalate in complexity. # How to Resolve 1. **Simplify the Query:** - **Reduce Joins**: If possible, reduce the number of joins. Consider whether all joins are necessary or if some data can be pre-aggregated in a temporary table. - **Limit Subqueries**: Subqueries, especially nested ones, can significantly increase complexity. See if you can achieve the same result with a join or by restructuring the query. - **Break it Down**: Sometimes, splitting a complex query into several simpler ones and storing intermediate results can help. 2. **Reduce the Number of References:** - **Limit Tables/Partitions**: If your query touches many tables or partitions, see if you can limit this by more explicitly filtering data early in the query. - **Use Temp Tables**: For very complex operations, consider using temporary tables to store intermediate results. 3. **Optimize Database Design:** - **Indexing**: Ensure that your tables are properly indexed. Effective indexing can reduce the query complexity by making data retrieval more efficient. - **Partitioning**: If not already done, partitioning large tables based on access patterns can help manage and query large datasets more efficiently. 4. **Consult Documentation/Support:** - If after simplification, the issue persists, it may be beneficial to consult the database's documentation for any known limitations or best practices. Additionally, reaching out to Customer Support Services, as suggested, can provide more direct assistance tailored to your specific scenario and database version. 5. **Review Query Plans**: If possible, review the query execution plan for insights on where the query may be inefficient. This might highlight areas for simplification or optimization you hadn't considered. # Additional Considerations - Ensure your database software is up to date. Sometimes, these issues can be resolved with updates or patches. - Consider the database's capabilities. Some databases handle complex queries or large datasets better due to optimizations or architectural differences.

Когда вы вызываете \`original_fn(a, b)\` внутри декоратора: - Сначала выполняется тело функции \`original_fn\`, которая в вашем случае — это декорированная функция \`my_fn\`. - Внутри \`my_fn\`, принтится строка \`\\"main func!\\"\`, и затем, как результат работы функции, возвращается значение \`a * b\` (в вашем примере \`100 * 50\`, что равно \`5000\`). То есть, строка \`\\"main func!\\"\` печатается прямо изнутри \`my_fn\`, а значение \`5000\` возвращается из \`my_fn\` в \`wrapper_function\`, где это значение присваивается переменной \`res\`. После этого: - Следует вывод \`\\"after main\\"\` внутри \`wrapper_function\`. - Возвращается значение, хранящееся в \`res\`, которое и есть результат \`original_fn(a, b)\` — в данном случае \`5000\`. Ваш вопрос касается различия между выводом в консоль и возвращаемым значением функции. Важно помнить, что \`print(\\"main func!\\")\` просто печатает строку в консоль, но не влияет на возвращаемое значение функции \`my_fn\`. Функция \`my_fn\` возвращает результат выражения \`a * b\`, который и возвращается далее из \`wrapper_function\` через \`res\`. На выходе, следующие операции вывода происходят последовательно: 1. Печатается \`\\"before main\\"\`. 2. Выполняется и печатается \`\\"main func!\\"\` из \`my_fn\` при ее вызове. 3. Печатается \`\\"after main\\"\`. 4. Возвращаемое значение \`5000\` печатается на последнем шаге благодаря вызову \`print(result_my_fn)\` за пределами декоратора. Ваше недопонимание могло произойти из-за того, как работает функция \`print()\` в Python. Когда вы видите \`print(\\"main func!\\")\` внутри \`my_fn\`, может показаться, что строка \`\\"main func!\\"\` \\"возвращается\\" вместе с числом \`5000\`. На самом деле, \`print()\` только выводит текст в консоль, а возвращаемым значением \`my_fn\` (и соответственно \`original_fn(a, b)\`) является только результат выражения \`a * b\`."},{"instruction":"def my_decorator(arg): def wrapper(): print('before') res = arg() print('after') return res return wrapper @my_decorator def main_fn(): print('hi!') say_hello() Когда функция wrapper использует аргумент arg функции my_decorator, как это называется ?","output":"Когда функция \`wrapper\` использует аргумент \`arg\`, который является параметром функции \`my_decorator\`, это называется \\"замыканием\\" (closure). Замыкание — это функция, которая запоминает значения в своём лексическом окружении даже после того, как функция, создавшая это окружение, завершила работу. В вашем примере, \`arg\` — это функция, передаваемая в декоратор \`my_decorator\` в качестве аргумента. \`wrapper\` — это внутренняя функция, которая использует (и \\"замыкает\\" на) \`arg\`. Когда вы применяете декоратор \`@my_decorator\` к функции \`main_fn\`, \`main_fn\` становится \`arg\` для \`my_decorator\`, а замыкание создается с \`wrapper\`, который теперь может использовать \`main_fn\` (в виде \`arg\`). Это замыкание позволяет \`wrapper\` вызывать \`main_fn\` внутри себя и работать с её результатом или выполнять действия до и после вызова \`main_fn\`, тем самым расширяя или модифицируя её поведение. Это ключевая концепция декораторов в Python. Однако, в вашем коде есть момент, который вызовет ошибку при выполнении: \`\`\`python @my_decorator def main_fn(): print('hi!') say_hello() \`\`\` Функция \`say_hello\` не определена. По всей видимости, вы имели в виду вызвать функцию \`main_fn\`, а не \`say_hello\`. После применения декоратора \`@my_decorator\` к \`main_fn\`, для вызова декорированной функции нужно использовать \`main_fn()\`, а не \`say_hello()\`, таким образом: \`\`\`python main_fn() # Этот вызов вызовет wrapper(), который в свою очередь вызовет main_fn() и выполнит инструкции до и после её вызова. \`\`\` Это вызовет последовательное выполнение инструкций \`print('before')\`, \`print('hi!')\` и \`print('after')\` благодаря механизму работы замыкания и декораторов."},{"instruction":"def my_fn(a,b): c = a * b print(c) pass my_fn(5,10) возвращает ли pass None ?","output":"В Python, когда функция достигает конца своей работы и не встречает явного оператора \`return\` с возвращаемым значением, по умолчанию она возвращает \`None\`. Оператор \`pass\` в данном случае не влияет на возвращаемое значение функции; его основное назначение — действовать как заполнитель в местах, где синтаксически требуется какое-то заявление, но программа не требует выполнения каких-либо действий. В вашем примере: \`\`\`python def my_fn(a,b): c = a * b print(c) pass \`\`\` Функция \`my_fn\` выполняет умножение \`a\` на \`b\`, печатает результат и достигает \`pass\`, который не выполняет никакой функции в данном контексте. После этого функция завершает свою работу. Поскольку в функции нет явного выражения \`return\` с возвращаемым значением, она автоматически возвращает \`None\`. Таким образом, ответ на ваш вопрос: да, функция возвращает \`None\`, но это не прямое следствие наличия оператора \`pass\`, а результат отсутствия явного \`return\` с возвращаемым значением."},{"instruction":"для чего тогда нужен pass ?","output":"Оператор \`pass\` в Python используется в качестве заполнителя или \\"ничего не делающего\\" оператора в местах, где синтаксис требует наличия какого-либо инструкции, но логика программы не требует никаких конкретных действий. Он позволяет программисту оставить место в коде, которое может быть заполнено реальной логикой позже, не вызывая при этом ошибок во время выполнения или синтаксических ошибок. Давайте рассмотрим несколько ситуаций, когда \`pass\` может потребоваться: 1. **В определениях функций**. Если вы хотите задекларировать функцию без реализации (например, как заглушку), вы можете использовать \`pass\`: \`\`\`python def my_function(): pass \`\`\` 2. **В классах**. Если вы хотите создать класс без методов или атрибутов (который может быть дополнен позже), вы также можете использовать \`pass\`: \`\`\`python class MyClass: pass \`\`\` 3. **В условных операторах**. Если в определенной ветке условного оператора не требуется выполнять никаких действий, можно использовать \`pass\`: \`\`\`python if some_condition: pass else: do_something() \`\`\` 4. **В циклах**. Аналогично, если тело цикла (например, \`for\` или \`while\`) ещё не определено, можно временно использовать \`pass\`: \`\`\`python for item in my_list: pass # TODO: добавить обработку элементов списка \`\`\` 5. **В блоках исключений**. Если вы хотите поймать исключение, но не обрабатывать его, \`pass\` также полезен: \`\`\`python try: risky_operation() except SomeException: pass # Игнорирование исключения \`\`\` Во всех этих примерах \`pass\` позволяет избежать синтаксических ошибок, предоставляя временное решение до реализации полного кода. Он не влияет на выполнение программы и используется исключительно для поддержания корректности синтаксиса Python."},{"instruction":"def my_function(): pass в этом случае функция будет возвращать None ? плохо это или хорошо, если функция def возвращает None ?","output":"Да, в данном случае функция \`my_function\` будет возвращать \`None\`. Это стандартное поведение для функций в Python, которые не имеют явно указанного \`return\` с возвращаемым значением. Если функция достигает конца своего тела без встречи инструкции \`return\`, она автоматически возвращает \`None\`. Относительно того, плохо это или хорошо, ответ зависит от контекста использования функции: 1. **Когда это нормально:** - Если возвращение значения не предполагается логикой функции. Например, функция применяется для выполнения определенного действия без необходимости возврата результата (например, функции для логирования, вывода данных на экран, выполнения операций ввода-вывода). - Когда используется в качестве заполнителя (placeholder) или когда функция будет разработана позже. \`pass\` позволяет избежать синтаксических ошибок при разработке структуры проекта. 2. **Когда это может быть плохо:** - Если от функции ожидается возврат конкретного результата или значения, но она возвращает \`None\` из-за ошибки в логике обработки или из-за опечатки в коде. Это может привести к ошибкам в выполнении программы, которые сложнее обнаружить, поскольку Python не выдаст синтаксическую ошибку при таком использовании функции. - Когда значение \`None\` не учитывается должным образом при дальнейшей обработке результата функции. Это может привести к исключениям вроде \`TypeError\` или \`AttributeError\`, если программа пытается выполнить операции с \`None\`, требующие наличия конкретных данных или объектов. Важно правильно документировать поведение функции и ясно указывать, что ожидать от ее результата. Если функция должна возвращать значение, лучше явно возвращать это значение. Если функция предназначена для выполнения действия без возврата результата, возвращение \`None\` является абсолютно приемлемым и ожидаемым поведением в Python.

Ernst Mach ve çevresindeki doğa bilimci empristler, dönemin sınırlı gözlem ve deney imkanları nedeniyle atomların varlığını şüpheyle karşılarken, temelde sosyal bilim kökenli olan Marx, Engels ve Lenin gibi düşünürler, bunun aksine maddeyi ve atomu, gerçekliğin temel birimi olarak kabul ediyorlardı.

Ez igaz?","output":"Az ariánusok és a Nicea órakongresszus körüli események valóban fontos részei voltak az egyháztörténetnek, azonban azt állítani, hogy az Egyház szabályosan kiirtotta volna az ariánusokat, túlzásnak tűnik. Az ariánus vita az 4. század elejétől a 6. századig tartott, és számos konfliktust okozott az egyházban. Az ariánusokat gyakran elítélték és üldözték, de az ariánusoknak is sikerült megtartaniuk egyes területeket és támogatókat. Összességében az ariánusok végül elvesztették ezt a vitát és kevésbé befolyásos csoporttá váltak az egyházban, de azt állítani, hogy teljesen kiirtották őket, túlzás lenne."},{"instruction":"A korai vallási iratokról nincs semmi biztos, csak annyi, hogy területileg helyenként eltérőek voltak, tekintve, hogy már kezdetben is számos felekezet jött létre, akik hite szerteágazó különbségeket tartalmazott?","output":"Valóban igaz, hogy a korai keresztény vallási iratok sokféle tanítást és nézetet tartalmaznak, és területileg is különbözőek voltak. A kereszténység kezdetén sokféle felekezet és irányzat alakult ki, melyek különböző szempontokból értelmezték az Újszövetség tanításait. Az egyházak és az egyes vallási vezetők egyes kérdésekben széles körű vitákat folytattak, például Jézus isteni vagy emberi természetéről szóló ariánus vita, vagy a különböző heretikus irányzatok elleni harcok. Fontos megérteni, hogy a keresztény felekezetek és irányzatok változatosak voltak, és nagyon ritka az egységes véleményeket valló közösség. Az egyes felekezetek különböző szent iratokat használtak, és eltérő szertartásokat és tanításokat követhettek. Annak érdekében, hogy jobban megértsük a korai kereszténységet és annak sokszínűségét, fontos, hogy megvizsgáljuk a korai keresztény iratokat, az egyháztörténetet és a vallástudományt is."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Avant toute chose, je tiens à vous exprimer ma sincère reconnaissance pour l'opportunité que vous m'avez offerte en partageant mon travail de colorisation dans votre podcast. C'était un honneur d'avoir un segment dédié à ma passion pour redonner vie aux images en noir et blanc. Cependant, après avoir écouté l'épisode une seconde fois, certaines nuances dans l'ambiance du studio m'ont interpellée, me laissant avec des questions auxquelles j'ai pensé que vous pourriez répondre. D'abord, j'ai perçu un certain changement de ton qui pourrait refléter une réception moins chaleureuse de mon travail que je l'avais imaginé. C'est dans un esprit de compréhension mutuelle que je vous écris aujourd'hui. En outre, j'ai entendu des allusions à une affaire concernant Kate Middleton, sans toutefois pouvoir saisir le contexte complet ni sa pertinence par rapport à notre sujet. Pourriez-vous m'éclairer sur ce point ? Cela m'aiderait peut-être à comprendre l'ambiance perçue lors de la deuxième écoute du podcast.

Mon objectif n'a jamais été de provoquer de l'inconfort ou de la gêne, surtout auprès d'une équipe que je respecte profondément, comme la vôtre. Je m'inquiète donc à l'idée que mon travail puisse avoir été mal interprété ou qu'il ait pu générer des sentiments négatifs parmi vos auditeurs ou même au sein de votre équipe. Je vous envoie ce courriel dans un esprit de dialogue et d'ouverture, espérant que vous pourrez partager vos impressions ou tout commentaire que vous auriez concernant ma contribution et sa réception.

Je vous serais très reconnaissante de bien vouloir prendre un moment pour me faire part de votre ressenti, ou de toute observation que vous estimerez utile de partager. Une communication ouverte est précieuse et je suis prête à écouter tout retour constructif que vous pourriez avoir.

Votre volonté de mettre en lumière des démarches artistiques comme la mienne mérite toute ma reconnaissance. Je dois avouer que j’ai hésité à vous écrire, partagée entre la joie et une impression d’embarras. Autant l’enthousiasme m’a envahie lors de ma première écoute, autant après avoir écouté l’épisode plusieurs fois, certaines nuances dans l’ambiance du studio m’ont interpellée, me laissant avec des questions auxquelles j’ai pensé que vous pourriez répondre. J’ai perçu une certaine “ froideur ” qui pourrait refléter une réception moins chaleureuse de mon travail que je l’avais imaginé. Mais peut-être ma réaction est trompeuse et que ce sentiment est dû à ma propre interprétation. La colorisation d’images anciennes est, je le sais bien, un sujet qui divise et suscite quelquefois des effets mitigés, voire de rejet, de la part de certains puristes ou passionnés de photographie. Je suis pleinement consciente et habituée à ces réactions. Toutefois, mon intention n’a jamais été d'occasionner de la gêne chez ceux qui me donnent une voix, comme vous l’avez si aimablement fait. Voilà pourquoi je vous écris aujourd’hui en espérant que vous pourrez partager vos impressions concernant la réception du podcast. Pour ma part, je reste sereine.

Sonuçta, doğa hakkında haklı çıkan taraf doğa bilimciler değil sosyal bilimciler oldu. Deney ve gözlem imkanlarının gelişmesiyle birlikte doğa bilimci empristler, 2300 senelik bir gecikmeyle de olsa (materyalist Demokritosun ölümü MÖ 370) atomun varlığını kabul ettiler.","output":"Bu durum, bilim, felsefe ve teknolojinin gelişiminde sıkça rastlanan bir paradoksu yansıtmaktadır: Doğru olduğu kanıtlanamayan teoriler veya varsayımlar zamanla bilimsel gerçeklerle uyumlu hale gelebilir. Bu paradoks, bilginin doğasının ve bilimsel keşfin nihayetinde nasıl işlediğinin karmaşıklığına ışık tutar. 20. yüzyılın başlarında yaşanan bu karşılaşma, birkaç önemli noktaya dikkat çeker: 1. **Öncüllerin Önemi:** Felsefeciler ve bilim insanları tarafından kabul edilen öncüller, araştırmaların yönünü belirler. Marx, Engels, Lenin gibi sosyal bilimci materyalistler, varlığın maddi temelini vurgulayarak çalışmalarını yönlendiren apriorik bir öncül kabul ettiler. Bu, onların fiziksel dünyaya ilişkin soruları ele almalarını sağladı. 2. **Bilimin Kapsamı ve Sınırları:** Mach gibi doğa bilimci empirstler, bilimsel metodolojinin sınırlarını ve duyumsal verilere dayanma önemini vurguladılar. Bu yaklaşım, bilimdeki ilerlemeleri belli bir çerçevede tutma eğilimindedir. 3. **Teknolojik İlerleme:** Doğa bilimlerindeki buluşlar ve doğrulamalar büyük ölçüde teknolojik ilerlemeye bağlıdır. 20. yüzyılın başlarındaki empristlerin atomun varlığı konusunda şüpheci olmaları, dönemin gözlem ve deney araçlarının sınırlı olmasından kaynaklanıyordu. Zamanla, teknolojinin ilerlemesi atomların varlığının kesin kanıtlarını ortaya koydu. 4. **Doktrinel Mücadele ve Felsefi Kalıplar:** Felsefi çatışmalar, sık sık mevcut bilgiye ve teknolojiye meydan okur. Lenin gibi materyalistlerin Mach'ın emprio-kritisizmine karşı durmaları, sadece bilimsel anlamda değil, aynı zamanda felsefi ve ideolojik bir duruşun ifadesiydi. Bu tür çatışmalar, bilimsel araştırmanın sınırlarını zorlar ve genişletir. 5. **Tarihsel Materyalizmin Rolü:** Marx'ist düşüncenin temel taşı olan tarihsel materyalizm, sosyal olayları maddi koşulların ürünü olarak görmeyi içerir. Bu, atom gibi fiziksel yapıların varlığının kabul edilmesi gerektiğini öne süren bir yaklaşıma yol açabilir. Sonuç olarak, 20. yüzyılın başında doğa bilimci empirstler ile sosyal bilimci materyalistler arasındaki bu karşılaşma, bilginin ve bilimsel keşfin dinamik ve çok boyutlu doğasını gösterir. Bilim tarihindeki bu tür olaylar, bilimsel yöntemin ve düşüncenin sürekli evrim geçirdiğinin ve hiçbir teorinin veya düşüncenin sonsuza kadar sabit kalmadığının hatırlatıcısıdır."},{"instruction":"Напиши диалог на заседании суда по разводу между человеком-мужчиной и его виртуальной женой (на базе ChatGPT) в недалёком будущем.","output":"**Судья:** Добрый день, заседание по делу о разводе между Георгием Петровым и его виртуальной женой, созданной на базе ChatGPT, теперь открыто.

Традиционная схема предусматривает необходимость клиенту несколько раз ожидать официанта:  дождаться официанта для получения меню  дождаться повторного подхода официанта и сделать заказ  попросить официанта принести счет и дождаться счета  передать деньги официанту и подождать сдачу Также регулярно возникает ситуация, когда клиент хочет скорректировать свой заказ и это тоже требует ожидания официанта. В летнее время кафе создают дополнительные места для клиентов на свежем воздухе и это также повышает время обслуживания. Высокий уровень конкуренции, а также зависимость качества обслуживания от низкооплачиваемого персонала подталкивает владельцев бизнеса к изменению схемы работы.

Общие требования к системе представлены ниже. Клиент должен иметь возможность:  вызвать официанта,  заказать счет  ознакомиться с меню и сделать заказ  оценить качество обслуживания  система должна работать на любом устройстве клиента Официант должен иметь возможность:  получать уведомления от клиента о необходимости обслужить клиента,  выдать счет и т.п.,  отмечать выполнение пожеланий клиента  отвечать текстом на запросы клиента Администратор ресторана должен иметь возможность:  редактировать меню и цены  редактировать специальные предложения для клиентов Руководство сети ресторанов хочет:  контролировать нормативные сроки выполнения запросов клиента (стандарты необходимо доработать)  понимать поведение клиента в системе.

Quest'area si trova alla periferia della polpa bianca splenica, situata tra essa e la polpa rossa. Questa posizione strategica permette ai linfociti B MZ di intercettare antigeni presenti nel sangue prima che questi possano diffondersi nell'organismo. I linfociti B sono cellule del sistema immunitario essenziali per la produzione di anticorpi, fondamentali nella risposta immunitaria umorale. Nello specifico, i linfociti B della zona marginale sono specializzati nel riconoscimento di antigeni polisaccaridici, come quelli presenti sulla superficie di molti agenti patogeni, inclusi batteri capsulati. Rispetto agli altri linfociti B, quelli MZ rispondono più rapidamente agli antigeni, spesso senza la necessità di aiuto da parte delle cellule T, un processo noto come risposta immunitaria T-indipendente. Dopo l'attivazione, i linfociti B MZ proliferano e differenziano in plasmacellule capaci di produrre anticorpi, in particolare immunoglobuline di tipo M (IgM) e, in alcuni casi, immunoglobuline G (IgG) o IgA. La produzione rapida di anticorpi da parte di questi linfociti permette un'azione difensiva immediata contro gli antigeni, offrendo così un ponte cruciale tra l'immunità innata e quella adattativa. I linfociti B della zona marginale giocano quindi un ruolo importante nella protezione contro le infezioni, soprattutto quelle batteriche, grazie alla loro posizione strategica nella milza e alla loro capacità di rispondere velocemente agli antigeni. Disturbi o deficit nella funzione o nel numero di questi linfociti possono portare a una maggiore suscettibilità a determinate infezioni."},{"instruction":"l'enzima AID ( citidina de amminasi) che ruolo ha nel campio isotipico della catena pesante delle immunoglobuline nei linfociti B?","output":"L'enzima AID (Activation-Induced cytidine Deaminase) gioca un ruolo cruciale nel sistema immunitario, in particolare nei processi di ipermutazione somatica (SHM, Somatic Hypermutation) e di cambio di classe isotipica (CSR, Class Switch Recombination) nelle cellule B. Questi meccanismi sono fondamentali per la diversificazione e l'affinamento della risposta anticorpale. # Ipermutazione Somatica (SHM) L'SHM modifica la regione variabile dei geni delle immunoglobuline (Ig) nelle cellule B, incrementando la diversità del recettore degli antigeni (BCR) e permettendo la selezione di cellule B in grado di legare l'antigene con maggior affinità. AID induce mutazioni puntiformi nella sequenza di DNA delle regioni variabili dei geni delle Ig, partecipando così all'evoluzione clonale delle cellule B nel contesto dei centri germinativi presenti nei follicoli linfoidi secondari. # Cambio di Classe Isotipica (CSR) Il CSR è un processo che permette alle cellule B differenziate di produrre anticorpi (Ig) con la stessa specificità antigenica ma di classi differenti (o isotipi), cambiando da IgM a IgG, IgE, o IgA. Questo processo modifica la regione costante C della catena pesante dell'Ig, alterandone le funzioni effettrici senza influenzare la specificità per l'antigene. L'AID deammina la citidina a uracile nelle regioni switch (S regions) che precedono ciascuna regione costante C della catena pesante, fatta eccezione per quella dell'IgD. Questa deaminazione induce rotture nel filamento di DNA che sono necessarie per il riarrangiamento del gene, permettendo così il cambio di classe dell'Ig. # Funzionamento e Regolazione dell'AID L'attività dell'AID è finemente regolata e limitata in termini spaziali e temporali alle cellule B che si trovano nei centri germinativi, dove le cellule B subiscono selezione clonale, SHM, e CSR in risposta a stimoli antigenici. La deregolazione dell'AID può portare a mutazioni o riarrangiamenti cromosomici non desiderati, che sono associati al rischio di sviluppo di linfomi e altre malattie autoimmuni. In conclusione, AID è essenziale per la produzione di risposte anticorpali mature ed efficaci, consentendo alle cellule B di produrre anticorpi altamente specifici e funzionalmente diversi attraverso SHM e CSR. Questi meccanismi contribuiscono significativamente alla capacità del sistema immunitario di adattarsi e rispondere efficacemente a una vasta gamma di patogeni."},{"instruction":"i lyB memoria quando incontrano nuovamente l'antigiene che li aveva attivati, vanno in contro nuovamente al processo di affinamento dell'immunoglobulina o no ?","output":"Quando i linfociti B memoria incontrano nuovamente l'antigene che li ha attivati precedentemente, possono nuovamente subire dei processi che affinano la specificità e l'efficacia della risposta immunitaria. Tra questi processi, l'ipermutazione somatica (SHM) e il cambio classe isotipica (CSR) possono eventualmente verificarsi durante una seconda stimolazione antigenica, specialmente nelle risposte immunitarie di tipo T-dipendente nei centri germinativi. # Ipermutazione somatica (SHM) nei linfociti B memoria Anche se i linfociti B memoria producono già anticorpi con un'affinità molto superiore rispetto alle cellule B naive grazie agli eventi precedenti di SHM e selezione clonale, essi possono subire ulteriori mutazioni nella regione variabile quando re-incontrano il loro antigene specifico e ricevono segnali adeguati dalle cellule T helper. Questo può portare all’ulteriore aumento dell'affinità degli anticorpi prodotti da queste cellule per l'antigene, un fenomeno noto come \\"maturazione dell'affinità\\". # Cambio di classe isotipica (CSR) nei linfociti B memoria È anche possibile che linfociti B memoria subiscano il cambio di classe isotipica in risposta a una successiva esposizione all'antigene, specialmente se il contesto della risposta immunitaria richiede una diversa classe di immunoglobulina per una protezione efficace. Ad esempio, una cellula B memoria che originariamente produce IgM può commutare a produrre IgG, IgA o IgE, a seconda dei segnali ricevuti, inclusa la natura dell’antigene e le citochine prodotte da altre cellule immunitarie. # Risposta rapida ed efficace È importante notare che, indipendentemente dal potenziale per ulteriori modificazioni del recettore degli antigeni (BCR), i linfociti B memoria sono in grado di rispondere più rapidamente e vigorosamente rispetto alle cellule B naive alla ristimolazione antigenica. Questo è dovuto non solo alla loro preesistente alta affinità per l'antigene e alla possibilità di trovarsi già in una classe isotipica più funzionale, ma anche al loro stato di attivazione più avanzato e alla loro localizzazione strategica nel corpo. In sintesi, i linfociti B memoria, quando ristimolati, sono capaci di andare incontro a ulteriore affinamento della specificità e funzione dell'immunoglobulina attraverso SHM e CSR, contribuendo così a una risposta immunitaria secondaria più forte ed efficiente."},{"instruction":"come si chiama il recettore per il trasporto del frammento cristallizzabile delle immunoglobuline G alla placenta ?","output":"Il recettore responsabile del trasporto del frammento cristallizzabile (Fc) delle immunoglobuline G (IgG) attraverso la placenta si chiama recettore Fc neonatale (FcRn), noto anche come recettore per le IgG e l'albumina. Questo recettore ha un ruolo cruciale nella mediazione del trasferimento degli anticorpi materni di tipo IgG al feto, fornendo così immunità passiva che protegge il neonato contro infezioni durante i primi mesi di vita, fino a quando il suo sistema immunitario non matura completamente. Il FcRn è un recettore altamente specifico che lega le molecole di IgG nella placenta. Dopo il legame, le IgG vengono internalizzate nelle cellule trofoblastiche mediante endocitosi. All'interno di queste cellule, le molecole di IgG legate al FcRn sono protette dalla degradazione in ambiente acido degli endosomi e quindi trasportate attraverso la cellula e rilasciate nel circolo sanguigno fetale. Questo processo garantisce che una significativa quantità di anticorpi IgG sia passivamente trasferita dalla madre al feto, conferendo protezione immunitaria al neonato fino allo sviluppo di un'immunità adattativa propria. Il recettore FcRn è anche espresso in altre cellule e tessuti postnatali, dove contribuisce alla regolazione della concentrazione sierica delle IgG e dell'albumina, proteggendole dalla catabolisi e prolungandone così la vita media nel sangue."},{"instruction":"come si chiama il peptide che unisce il frammento cristallizabile di due IgA ?","output":"Il peptide che unisce i frammenti cristallizzabili (Fc) di due immunoglobuline A (IgA) si chiama \\"peptide J\\" (J chain, da \\"joining chain\\"). Questo piccolo peptide è cruciale per la polimerizzazione delle IgA, così come delle IgM, permettendo la formazione di dimeri, trimeri o persino forme più complesse di queste immunoglobuline. Nel caso specifico delle IgA, il peptide J facilita la formazione principalmente di dimeri di IgA, che sono la forma predominante delle IgA secretorie. Queste molecole sono particolarmente importanti per la funzione immunitaria nelle mucose, come quelle presenti nel tratto gastrointestinale, respiratorio e urogenitale, dove forniscono una prima linea di difesa contro i patogeni. Il peptide J interagisce con la regione Fc delle molecole di IgA (o IgM), e questa associazione permette poi l'interazione con un componente chiave chiamato \\"componente della secrezione polimerica\\" o \\"polymetric immunoglobulin receptor\\" (pIgR), espresso sulle cellule epiteliali. Quest'interazione è essenziale per il trasporto delle IgA (o IgM) attraverso le cellule epiteliali e la loro secrezione nelle superfici mucose come IgA secretorie. Le IgA secretorie risultanti sono dimeri (o polimeri) di IgA legati a una porzione di pIgR nota come \\"componente segreto\\" (SC, da \\"secretory component\\"), che protegge le IgA dalla degradazione da parte degli enzimi proteolitici nelle secretioni mucose, aumentando così la loro durata e efficienza nell'ambiente ostile delle superfici mucose."},{"instruction":"come si chiama il recettore per il frammento cristiallizabile delle immunoglobuline, espresso dalle cellulle dell'immunità innata ?","output":"Il recettore per il frammento cristallizzabile delle immunoglobuline espresso dalle cellule dell'immunità innata si chiama \\"recettore Fc\\". Ci sono diversi tipi di recettori Fc, ognuno specifico per una differente classe di immunoglobulina. Ad esempio: 1. **Recettori Fcγ (Fc gamma)**: Sono specifici per le immunoglobuline G (IgG). Sono espressi da vari tipi di cellule dell'immunità innata, inclusi macrofagi, neutrofili, dendritiche, e cellule NK. I recettori Fcγ giocano ruoli chiave nelle funzioni immunitarie come la fagocitosi, l'attivazione cellulare, e l'antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). 2. **Recettori Fcε (Fc epsilon)**: Sono specifici per le immunoglobuline E (IgE). Sono espressi principalmente sui mastociti e basofili. Questi recettori hanno un ruolo cruciale nelle reazioni allergiche, poiché l'attivazione dei mastociti mediata dal legame delle IgE porta al rilascio di mediatori dell'infiammazione. 3. **Recettori Fcα (Fc alpha)**: Sono specifici per le immunoglobuline A (IgA). Sono espressi da alcune cellule dell'immunità innata, inclusi neutrofili e alcune cellule dendritiche e macrofagi. Essi mediano processi come la fagocitosi e la stimolazione dell'attività antimicrobica. 4. **Recettori Fcμ (Fc mu)**: Sono specifici per le immunoglobuline M (IgM). Benché meno studiati rispetto ad altri recettori Fc, sono coinvolti nel riconoscimento e nella risposta alle infezioni. Questi recettori Fc traducono il riconoscimento delle immunoglobuline legate all'antigene in segnali che attivano o modulano le funzioni delle cellule dell'immunità innata. Ad esempio, quando un anticorpo IgG si lega a un patogeno, i recettori Fcγ sulla superficie delle cellule fagocitarie possono riconoscere la porzione Fc dell'IgG, mediando la fagocitosi del patogeno legato all'anticorpo e altri meccanismi di risposta immunitaria. Il legame degli anticorpi agli antigeni e il successivo riconoscimento del complesso antigene-anticorpo da parte dei recettori Fc sulle cellule immunitarie rappresenta un meccanismo fondamentale attraverso cui l'immunità adattativa (mediata dagli anticorpi) può reclutare e attivare l'immunità innata per combattere le infezioni."},{"instruction":"cosa sono le opsonine?","output":"Le opsonine sono molecole che ricoprono i patogeni, come batteri o virus, e facilitano la loro fagocitosi da parte delle cellule del sistema immunitario, in particolare fagociti come macrofagi e neutrofili. Questo processo è noto come opsonizzazione. Le opsonine agiscono quindi come una sorta di \\"etichetta\\" che segnala ai fagociti la presenza di un elemento estraneo da inglobare ed eliminare. Tra le principali opsonine troviamo: 1. **Anticorpi (immunoglobuline):** Specificatamente le classi di anticorpi IgG e IgM, che una volta legati all'antigene sulla superficie del patogeno possono essere riconosciuti dai recettori Fc presenti sui fagociti. 2. **Componenti del sistema del complemento:** In particolare, le proteine C3b e iC3b, che sono prodotti di attivazione del sistema del complemento, possono legarsi ai patogeni e facilitarne la fagocitosi grazie al riconoscimento da parte di specifici recettori del complemento espressi sui fagociti. 3. **Proteine di fase acuta:** Come il mannose-binding lectin (MBL) e la C-reattiva proteina (CRP) che possono legarsi ai patogeni e funzionare anche come opsonine, mediando l’interazione con i fagociti. L’opsonizzazione è un meccanismo chiave dell'immunità innata e adattativa che aumenta l'efficienza della fagocitosi, permettendo una rapida eliminazione dei patogeni e contribuendo alla risposta infiammatoria. Facilitando l'ingestione di microrganismi da parte dei fagociti, le opsonine giocano un ruolo critico nella difesa dell'organismo contro le infezioni e nella rimozione di cellule danneggiate o morenti."},{"instruction":"quandi si parla di antigieni self compartimentalizzati questi possono essere elementi che si trovano nel sistema nervoso?","output":"Sì, quando si parla di \\"antigeni self compartimentalizzati\\", ci si riferisce agli antigeni propri dell'organismo che normalmente sono confinati in una specifica regione o compartimento del corpo, fuori dalla portata o dall'osservazione regolare del sistema immunitario. Il sistema nervoso centrale (SNC) è un esempio classico di tale compartimento. Il SNC è considerato immunologicamente privilegiato rispetto ad altri tessuti del corpo. Ciò significa che la sua esposizione al sistema immunitario circolante è limitata da barriere come la barriera emato-encefalica (BBB), che impedisce il libero passaggio di cellule immunitarie, antigeni e altre molecole tra il sangue e il tessuto nervoso. Di conseguenza, gli antigeni che si trovano all'interno del SNC sono in gran parte isolati dal resto del sistema immunitario. Tuttavia, se queste barriere vengono danneggiate o se gli antigeni self compartimentalizzati vengono esposti al sistema immunitario in un contesto inappropriato, possono essere riconosciuti come estranei. Questo può portare a reazioni autoimmuni, dove il sistema immunitario risponde contro le proprie cellule e tessuti, causando malattie come la sclerosi multipla nel caso del SNC. Oltre al sistema nervoso, ci sono altri esempi di antigene self compartimentalizzati, inclusi antigeni presenti nei testicoli e nell'occhio, che sono anch'essi considerati immunologicamente privilegiati. La gestione dell'esposizione e della risposta immunitaria a questi antigeni self è cruciale per prevenire le reazioni autoimmuni e mantenere l'omeostasi. In sintesi, gli antigeni self compartimentalizzati, inclusi quelli presenti nel sistema nervoso, sono elementi normalmente isolati dal sistema immunitario. La loro esposizione anomala può innescare risposte autoimmuni con conseguenze patologiche."},{"instruction":"TGF beta","output":"Il TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-beta) è una citochina multifunzionale che gioca ruoli critici in numerosi processi fisiologici, tra cui la regolazione della crescita e della differenziazione cellulare, l'infiammazione, la riparazione dei tessuti e il mantenimento dell'omeostasi. Essa appartiene a una super-famiglia di proteine che include anche i fattori di crescita di tipo bone morphogenetic (BMPs), gli attivatori della crescita e i fattori inibitori della mullerianosi. La TGF-β esercita effetti complessi ed estremamente variabili a seconda del contesto cellulare, del tipo di tessuto e dello stato fisiologico o patologico dell'organismo. Questa citochina è secreta da molte cellule, inclusi i macrofagi, le cellule T regolatorie e numerosi tipi cellulari nel tessuto connettivo. # Ruoli principali del TGF-β includono: 1. **Regolazione Immunitaria:** Il TGF-β ha un ruolo importante nella modulazione della risposta immunitaria. Promuove la tolleranza immunitaria ed è critico nella funzione delle cellule T regolatorie, che aiutano a prevenire le reazioni autoimmuni. Inoltre, può sopprimere l'attivazione delle cellule T e delle cellule NK. 2. **Cicatrizzazione e Riparazione Tessutale:** Stimola la produzione di componenti della matrice extracellulare come collagene, fibronectina e proteoglicani, essenziale per la riparazione tessutale e la cicatrizzazione delle ferite. 3. **Controllo della Crescita Cellulare:** Il TGF-β può inibire la crescita di molte cellule epiteliali, endoteliali e ematopoietiche. Questa azione di inibizione della crescita la rende una candidata come oncosoppressore in diverse fasi precoci del cancro, anche se paradossalmente può promuovere progressione e metastasi in fasi avanzate di alcuni tipi di tumori. 4. **Differenziazione Cellulare:** Partecipa alla differenziazione di vari tipi cellulari. Ad esempio, può indurre la differenziazione di cellule T in sottopopolazioni regolatorie o promotrici dell'infiammazione, a seconda del contesto. 5. **Controllo dell'Angiogenesi:** È coinvolto anche nella regolazione dell'angiogenesi, ovvero la formazione di nuovi vasi sanguigni, un processo cruciale sia nella riparazione dei tessuti che nella crescita tumorale. 6. **Controllo dell'Apoptosi:** In certi contesti, può indurre l'apoptosi, o morte cellulare programmata, come meccanismo per mantenere la salute tissutale ed eliminare le cellule danneggiate. La TGF-β agisce legandosi a specifici recettori sulla superficie cellulare, innescando una cascata di eventi di segnalazione intracellulare che porta all'attivazione di fattori trascrizionali che modulano l'espressione di specifici geni bersaglio. A causa dei suoi effetti molteplici e talvolta contraddittori, la dysregolazione della via del TGF-β è implicata in una varietà di patologie, tra cui fibrosi, malattie cardiovascolari, e la progressione di alcune forme di cancro. La ricerca attuale è intensamente concentrata sull'elucidazione dei molteplici ruoli della TGF-β in fisiologia e patologia, con l'obiettivo di sviluppare interventi terapeutici mirati per controllare la sua attività in contesti clinici specifici."},{"instruction":"20 yy. başında: doğa bilimleri kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve duyumdışı her türden metafiziğe karşı kuşkuyla yaklaşarak duyumları esas alan pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizm ile sosyal bilim kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve ontolojide maddenin varlığına dair duyumları aşan bir apriori önkabulü, inancı, hatta imanı esas alan diyalektik materyalizmin karşılaşmasında, özellikle Macha karşı Leninin yazdığı Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm kitabı bağlamında ortaya çıkan bu karşılaşmada; emprist taraf fizikte gözlem imkanları yetersiz olduğu için atomların varlığına bile şüpheyle bakarken materyalist taraf Demokritos ve Epiküre kadar uzanan uzak bir geçmişte bile atomu teorik bir önkabul olarak var kabul ediyordu, ki Marxın doktora tezi bu iki atomcu filozof hakkındaydı; Nasıl oldu da fizik gibi bir doğa biliminde, doğa bilimci empristler (Mach ve Viyana çevresi felsefecileri) sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin (Marx dışında felsefe eğitimi almamış amatörler Engels, Lenin vb.) gerisine düşebildirler?

Pozitivizm ve empiro-kritisizm gibi duyulara ve gözleme dayalı yaklaşımların savunucuları, özellikle fizik alanında, atomların varlığına dair doğrudan gözlemsel kanıtların eksikliği sebebiyle atom teorisine şüpheyle yaklaşıyordu. Bu dönemde, doğa bilimlerinde bir şeyin varlığını kabul etmek için doğrudan gözlem veya deneysel kanıt arayışı hakimdi. Öte yandan, diyalektik materyalizmi savunan sosyal bilim kökenli düşünürler, maddenin ve onun temel yapıtaşlarının var olduğuna dair daha geniş, felsefi ve teorik bir çerçeve içinde ısrar ediyordu. Diyalektik materyalizm, materyalist bir ontolojiyi ve tarihsel değişimleri açıklamak için diyalektiği kullanır. Bu akım, realitenin maddi koşullar tarafından belirlendiğini ve tarihsel değişimlerin temel itici gücünün maddi koşullardaki çelişkiler olduğunu savunur. Lenin'in Mach ve emprist yaklaşımlarına karşı yazdığı \\"Materyalizm ve Empriokritisizm\\" kitabı, bu tartışmada çok önemli bir rol oynar. Lenin, bu eserinde özellikle emprist ve pozitivist yaklaşımların sınırlarını eleştirir ve öznel idealizme kayabileceği konusunda uyarır. Bilimi ve materyalizmi savunurken, maddenin varlığını ve özelliklerini anlamaya yönelik daha geniş ve esnek bir metodolojik çerçeve önerir. Doğa bilimcilerin, özellikle fizikçilerin, sosyal bilimci materyalistlere göre geri kalması ironiktir. Ancak bu durum, o dönemde bilimsel yöntem ve felsefenin doğasına dair genel anlayışla ilgilidir. Doğa bilimcileri, katı emprik ve gözlemci bir yaklaşıma bağlı kalırken, sosyal bilimciler, maddenin temel yapısına dair kavramsal ve teorik varsayımlarda bulunmaya daha açıktı. Atomun varlığının nihayet kabul edilmesi, doğa bilimlerinde metodolojik ve epistemolojik çerçevelerin genişlemesi gerektiğini göstermiştir. Bu durum, bilim tarihi açısından önemli bir ders sunar. Bilgi ve anlayışın ilerlemesi için, sıkı emprisizm ve katı gözlemcilikten daha fazlasının gerektiği; teorik çerçeveler, kavramsal analizler ve geniş perspektiflerin bilimsel araştırma ve felsefede önemli roller oynadığı anlaşılmıştır.

Visualiza un oscuro bosque encantado, donde un gran búho blanco con ojos brillantes y penetrantes se posa majestuoso sobre una antigua rama cubierta de musgo. Sus plumas se fusionan con los tonos de la luna llena, y en su pecho, aparece tatuado el número '47', rodeado de intrincados patrones de arte indígena americano, creando una imagen que trasciende el tiempo y el espacio. 2. Imagina un mundo submarino donde los restos de un viejo barco pirata yacen en el lecho marino. Entre sus maderas entrelazadas y su flora marina, el número '33' se ilumina con fluorescencia, formado por pequeñas criaturas acuáticas. Estas, coordinadas, crean un espectáculo luminoso que recuerda a las noches de bioluminiscencia, envolviendo la escena en una atmósfera mágica y misteriosa. 3.

He can keep the trucks in line, the coaches quiet and the passengers happy. He is very proud of his Great Western heritage and talks endlessly about it, which irritates the larger engines, who quickly grow tired of hearing about \\"the Great Western way\\". One morning, a visitor arrives. The Fat Controller introduces the new engine as Diesel, stating that he has agreed to give him a trial and tells Duck to show him around and teach him what to do. Diesel introduces himself before heaping compliments on Gordon, James and Henry, who are in awe by his flattery. Duck, however, takes a dislike to Diesel's oily nature and shows him to the yard, where it becomes apparent that Duck's dislike of Diesel is mutual as Duck orders Diesel to refer to the Fat Controller as \\"Sir Topham Hatt\\" before Diesel smugly tells Duck that he does not have to be taught what to do, saying Diesels know everything and come to a yard to improve it, dubbing himself as \\"revolutionary\\". Duck is not impressed with Diesel's boasting and orders him to arrange the trucks while he leaves to take Gordon's coaches to the station. Eager for the chance to show off, Diesel quickly gets to work. When Duck returns, he finds Diesel trying to move some very old, near-derelict trucks with stiff joints and brakes from a siding. Duck decides to let the events play out and watches with interest. Diesel struggles to move the trucks and gets so forceful with them that some of their brakes snap and the gear jams in the sleepers, causing several of the trucks to derail and overturn in the process. Diesel tries to push the remaining trucks back but he still cannot move them and is forced to give up. As Duck finally comes around carrying some other trucks, Diesel asks Duck why he did not tell him about this when he had gone through so much trouble. Duck replies that Diesel never asked him, as he was having fun being \\"revolutionary\\". Duck leaves happily, while Diesel fumes angrily. Diesel is later forced to help the workmen clear the mess, a job that he hates, especially as the trucks have started laughing at it and he hears them singing a degrading song at him too. It grows in loudness, soon echoing throughout the whole yard. Now cross with Duck and the trucks, Diesel storms off to the sheds to sulk when the clean-up is over.","output":"Duck was chuffing around the Island of Sodor, puffing up his feathers—metaphorically, of course, because, let's be honest, trains with feathers would be concerning on so many levels. He was the unofficial \\"Mr. Fix-It\\" of the rails; if there was a troublesome truck or a cranky coach, Duck was on it faster than Sir Topham Hatt could say, \\"Confusion and delay!\\" Now, Duck was quite proud of his Great Western heritage. To say he talked about it \\"endlessly\\" would be an understatement. If Duck had a nickel for every time he mentioned the Great Western way, he'd have enough to buy the railway and rename it \\"The Great Western World of Sodor.\\" Gordon, James, and Henry were about two anecdotes away from sticking cotton wool in their smokeboxes whenever Duck was near. One morning, after a particularly impassioned monologue about the superiority of Great Western couplings, a new engine arrived. Enter Diesel, sleek, modern, and so full of compliments he could've been mistaken for a politician during election season. The Fat Controller introduced him, and Diesel wasted no time schmoozing up to Gordon, James, and Henry, who soaked up his flattery like dry sponges. Duck, however, wasn’t buying what Diesel was selling. He had a \\"no fluff\\" policy, aside from the time he accidentally ran into a flock of sheep. Duck was tasked with showing Diesel the ropes, but it quickly became clear that Diesel thought he was less of a student and more of a revolutionary. \\"Diesel knows everything,\\" he claimed, puffing out oily smoke rings that made Duck cough. Duck, with the patience of a saint—or rather a saintly engine—decided to let Diesel tackle the ancient, creaky trucks in the yard. Much to Duck's secret amusement, Diesel's \\"revolutionary\\" methods clashed with the stubborn, old trucks like a poorly-choreographed dance routine. Gears jammed, brakes snapped, and trucks derailed in a spectacle that could only be described as \\"chaotic slapstick.\\" Diesel, looking more frazzled than a cat in a dog kennel, couldn't understand why Duck hadn’t forewarned him. \\"Duck, why didn't you say something?\\" Diesel fumed, oil oozing from his every pore. \\"Well, you seemed to be enjoying your revolution,\\" Duck replied, his voice dripping with more sarcasm than a snarky teenager. As Diesel was left to clean up his mess—literally—under the mocking chorus of the derailed trucks' laughter, he realized that maybe, just maybe, he had a thing or two to learn. Not just about handling trucks, but about humility... and possibly investing in some earplugs for next time. Meanwhile, Duck chuffed away, a smug smile on his faceplate. The Great Western way might not be perfect, but at least it didn’t end with an overturned truck serenade. Back at the sheds, Diesel stewed in his own oily bubble, contemplating the virtues of revolution versus the value of listening. Perhaps he'd give this working together malarkey a try after all. Or, at the very least, refrain from bragging until after he’d successfully moved his first truck."},{"instruction":"Определите капитализированные затраты по кредиту на приобретение и монтаж производственной линии (тыс.руб.) при следующих исходных данных: 01.01.Х3 – получен целевой кредит 20 млн.руб. под 12% годовых; 15.01.Х3 – приобретено оборудование линии; 01.02.Х3 – начаты работы по монтажу оборудования; 10.02-24.02.Х3 – остановка работ для затвердевания фундамента линии; 15.03 – 15.06.Х3 – остановка работ из-за забастовок работников; 30.11.Х3 – завершены работы по монтажу; 15.12.Х3 – проверка линии на соответствие требованиям техники безопасности; 31.12.Х3 – начало фактической эксплуатации.","output":"Капитализированные затраты по кредиту на приобретение и монтаж производственной линии будут составлять сумму процентов по кредиту за период с получения кредита до начала фактической эксплуатации линии.

Efficiency, punctuality, and... (spots Diesel being introduced by the Fat Controller) Oh, what’s this? A smudge on the horizon? Fat Controller: (enthusiastically) Everyone, meet Diesel! He's here on trial from the Mainland. Diesel: (smirking) Pleasure to make your acquaintance. I must say, Gordon, those pistons are positively gleaming. And James, that red paint... absolutely radiant. Gordon, James, Henry: (collectively, smitten) Oh, well, thank you! Duck: (under his breath) Fawning over paintwork and pistons? Must be from the silver-tongued series. **Duck, keen but cautious, leads Diesel to the yard, emphasizing the importance of following “Sir Topham Hatt’s” standard - a directive Diesel airily dismisses with a promise to revolutionize their quaint little setup.** Duck: (with a hint of skepticism) Right, let's see this revolutionary action then. Those trucks won’t arrange themselves! **As Duck departs, Diesel smugly approaches the trucks, fully expecting them to be in awe of his modernity. Instead, they meet him with the same indifference they reserve for outdated infrastructure.** Diesel: (confidently) Stand back, you outdated relics. Watch how a real revolutionary handles— (struggles with the trucks, his face turning from smug to strained) Why won't… you… MOVE? **Diesel’s efforts are met with disaster. Trucks derail and laughter echoes through the yard. Duck returns to find chaos amidst a chorus of cackles.** Duck: (amused) Oh, Diesel, what’s happened here?

Duck: (with feigned innocence) But Diesel, you said you came to improve, not inquire. It was quite the sight – you, revolutionizing the art of making a mess. **As Diesel begrudgingly starts the cleanup, the trucks’ relentless teasing reaches a crescendo. Their tune, “Diesel the Revolutionary Mess Maker,” becomes an instant hit in Sodor’s charts.** **Meanwhile, Diesel’s mood plummets to depths previously only explored by submarines and The Fat Controller’s lost keys.** Diesel: (muttering as he cleans) If I had a coal for every time I've been outsmarted by a truck today... **As the day ends, Diesel retreats to sulk. The engines can’t help but chuckle at Diesel’s expense, finding a new appreciation for Duck’s wisdom and the age-old ‘Great Western way.’** Gordon: (chuckling) Well, Duck, I must say, your method has a certain... timelessness to it. James: (teasing) Yes, who needs revolutionary when you have reliability? Henry: (joining in) Indeed, Duck. And who knew? The Great Western way includes lessons in comedy too! **Duck, basking in the engines' newfound respect and the hilarity of the situation, doesn't miss a beat.** Duck: (proudly) Remember, gentlemen, Great Western doesn’t just mean great at work. It means great fun too! **The laughter of the engines blends with the evening breeze, a testament to the enduring charm and cheery camaraderie on the Island of Sodor. The revolution was televised, and it was hilarious.** **[End Scene]**"},{"instruction":"Imagine brainstorming creatively and being inspired to write a list of several textual and descriptive examples similar to a \\"message generator\\" and suitable to be applied to an AI image generator and in which their contexts form a syntax that indicates Illustrating an iconic logo where '28' smoothly transforms into a white circular medieval tower with rough brick texture, highlighted by graffiti with the words 'DOS OCHO'.

Imagine a bright, sunny day with a clear sky, perfect for apple-themed festivities. # Setting: 1. **Background**: A lush, green orchard with rows of apple trees, laden with fruits of different colors and sizes. 2. **Middle Ground**: A rustic wooden cart or table filled with various apple products—apple pies, cider, juice, and freshly picked apples. 3. **Foreground**: A large, welcoming, 3D text saying “Happy Apple Day!” placed at the bottom, with apples in various states around it (whole, sliced, and possibly a bitten one) to create depth. # Elements to Include: 1. **Apple Varieties**: Show off a variety of apples - Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, and Gala among them. Their different colors and sizes will add a vibrant spectrum to your illustration. 2. **Apple Products**: Illustrate items made from apples, such as pies, cider, candies, and maybe even craft items to emphasize their versatility. 3. **Characters**: Include characters (can be humans or anthropomorphic animals) holding apples, wearing festive hats, or even engaging in apple-related activities like bobbing for apples or apple picking, adding life and movement to the scene. 4. **Details**: Add details like apple blossoms, bees, a picnic setup, or children and animals playing to infuse the scene with warmth and a sense of community. # Creating the 3D Illustration: 1. **Modeling**: Begin by modeling your main elements—the apples, trees, cart/table, products, and characters. Software like Blender, Maya, or Cinema 4D can help you construct these in 3D space. 2. **Texturing**: Apply textures to your models to give them a realistic look. For apples, ensure they have a smooth and slightly reflective texture to mimic their natural shine. 3. **Lighting**: Use a warm, slightly golden lighting setup to simulate a sunny day. Position your light source in a way that it casts soft, realistic shadows, enhancing the three-dimensional feel. 4. **Rendering**: Once you’re satisfied with the arrangement and the aesthetics, it’s time to render. Choose a render setting that brings out the best of textures and lighting—often, a bit of experimentation is key here. # Final Touches: After rendering, you might find it beneficial to do some post-processing in a program like Adobe Photoshop or After Effects. This can involve adjusting the brightness and contrast, adding some glow effects, or even compositing additional elements that were not included in the 3D scene. Creating a 3D illustration for Apple Day is a fun and creative project that allows for a lot of artistic freedom. You can make your orchard as whimsical or as realistic as you prefer, and the choice of elements and activities can reflect what you most enjoy about apples and their culture. Good luck, and have fun bringing your vision of Apple Day to life!"},{"instruction":"「 *FAMILY 100* 」*Jawablah pertanyaan berikut ini!*Nama Bintang Afi 1 CowokJumlah jawaban: 5Waktu: 120 detik","output":"Untuk pertanyaan itu, berikut adalah daftar nama beberapa bintang film dan televisi laki-laki Indonesia yang dikenal di kalangan pecinta sinetron dan film, yang mungkin cocok dengan pertanyaan \\"Nama Bintang Afi 1 Cowok\\": 1.

Problems like embryos dying in the shell can be due to a variety of factors including genetic issues, poor incubation conditions, infections, or nutritional deficiencies in the breeding birds. For those interested in employing homeopathic remedies to support the health of bird embryos or to address issues of embryos dying in the shell, here are a few remedies that are sometimes mentioned in homeopathic and holistic animal care contexts. It's crucial to do so in conjunction with proper veterinary care and not as a substitute for professional medical advice: 1. **Calcarea Carbonica (Calc Carb)**: Sometimes considered for use in improving overall vitality and health. 2. **Silicea (Silica)**: Used by some to help in strengthening the body's natural processes and in cases of malabsorption of nutrients. 3. **Carbo Vegetabilis**: Thought to aid in situations of vitality loss or when the system needs support in improving oxygenation. 4. **Sulphur**: This is sometimes suggested for improving general health and for dealing with issues of vitality. 5. **Nux Vomica**: Sometimes selected for its supposed qualities in aiding digestion and supporting metabolic health. Keep in mind that the selection of a homeopathic remedy and its potential benefit can depend on various factors unique to the specific situation, including the symptoms observed, the health condition of the parent birds, and the environmental conditions. It is highly recommended to consult with a veterinary professional, preferably one with experience in homeopathy or holistic animal care, before attempting to administer any treatment. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and help ensure that you're taking steps that won't inadvertently harm the animals under your care. Additionally, focus on proper nutrition, sanitation, and incubation practices as these are fundamental for the health of bird embryos."},{"instruction":"list the homeopathy remedy to increase the immunity","output":"Homeopathy operates on the principle of \\"like cures like,\\" with the use of highly diluted substances with the aim of triggering the body's natural system of healing. When it comes to increasing immunity, homeopathy suggests various remedies depending on the individual's specific symptoms, constitution, and overall health condition. It's important to approach these remedies with an understanding of the ongoing debate around the efficacy of homeopathic medicine, and always consider the advice of healthcare professionals. Below is a list of homeopathic remedies that are often recommended to support or increase immunity, though their effectiveness is subject to individual variability and the scientific evidence supporting homeopathy is limited: 1. **Echinacea**: Often used for cold and flu prevention, and to support the immune system generally. It is thought to stimulate the body’s defenses. 2. **Aconitum Napellus (Aconite)**: Typically used at the very onset of cold or flu symptoms. 3. **Arsenicum Album**: Suggested for cold and flu symptoms, especially with exhaustion, anxiety, and restlessness. 4. **Belladonna**: Often selected for very sudden onset of high fever, and conditions that worsen rapidly. 5. **Bryonia**: Used for conditions that feature irritability and a desire to remain still because movement worsens symptoms. 6. **Nux Vomica**: Recommended for symptoms such as cold and flu especially with gastrointestinal complaints or where symptoms are exacerbated by stress. 7. **Oscillococcinum (Anas Barbariae Hepatis et Cordis Extractum)**: A popular remedy believed to relieve flu symptoms and improve overall immune response. 8. **Sulphur**: Considered in cases with recurrent infections or inflammatory conditions, indicating a sluggish immune response. 9. **Thuja Occidentalis**: Sometimes recommended for individuals with warts or other conditions suggesting a weak immune response. 10. **Calcarea Carbonica (Calc Carb)**: Used for people who get cold easily and have clammy hands and feet. Also, it’s thought to help those who are sluggish and fatigued with poor digestion. It's crucial to understand that homeopathy is highly individualized, with practitioners selecting remedies based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's physical, emotional, and mental symptoms. The concept of treating \\"like with like\\" in a highly diluted form is considered implausible and unscientific by mainstream medicine, and studies have not conclusively shown homeopathy to be effective beyond the placebo effect for any condition. Given the importance of immune function and the potential risks of self-treating for serious conditions, individuals interested in homeopathy should consult with a professionally trained homeopath as well as their healthcare provider. This ensures that any course of treatment complements overall health strategies and does not interfere with conventional medical treatments that have established efficacy."},{"instruction":"short list the above remedy up to 5 which are most effective","output":"It's important to note that the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies is a topic of ongoing debate and is considered by the scientific community to be no more effective than a placebo for any condition. Homeopathy operates on principles not recognized by mainstream science, and its remedies are highly individualized, making broad efficacy claims difficult. However, within the realm of homeopathy and among its practitioners and users, some remedies are frequently recommended for supporting the immune system. Here are five commonly mentioned homeopathic remedies, keeping in mind the lack of scientific consensus on their effectiveness: 1. **Echinacea**: Often used in both homeopathic and herbal forms for immune support, especially at the onset of cold or flu symptoms. 2. **Arsenicum Album**: Selected for its supposed ability to help with cold and flu symptoms, particularly those involving exhaustion and restlessness. 3. **Oscillococcinum (Anas Barbariae Hepatis et Cordis Extractum)**: Widely used for the relief of flu symptoms and believed by some to support the immune response. 4. **Nux Vomica**: Recommended for its purported effect on symptoms exacerbated by stress, including those related to colds, flu, and gastrointestinal complaints. 5. **Sulphur**: Considered by some in homeopathy to help with recurrent infections or conditions suggesting a sluggish immune response. When considering homeopathy or any alternative treatments, consulting with a healthcare professional is crucial to ensure safety and appropriateness, especially since individual health needs and conditions vary greatly. Always prioritize advice from qualified health practitioners and use homeopathy as a complement to, not a replacement for, conventional medical care."},{"instruction":"hi there","output":"Hello!

Unlike the Sodor Tabloid’s gossip column, Duck could actually keep a secret, especially when it came to keeping the trucks in line and the coaches quieter than a mime convention. One shiny, metal-bright morning, the Fat Controller, who looked like he had just won a pie-eating contest, introduced Diesel to the engines. “This here is Diesel, a revolutionary,” he announced, beaming from ear to ear like a proud father whose child just used the potty for the first time. Diesel, slicker than a politician on election day, immediately began sweet-talking Gordon, James, and Henry, wrapping compliments around them like scarves. Meanwhile, Duck looked on, unimpressed as a cat at a dog show. Assigned to babysit, ahem, guide Diesel, Duck insisted, “Around here, we refer to the man in charge as Sir Topham Hatt.” Diesel scoffed, “In the world of Diesel, we don’t do silly titles. We’re too busy revolutionizing.” So, Diesel set out to show what he was made of, which was apparently equal parts arrogance and engine oil. Duck, intrigued by the promise of entertainment, left Diesel to rearrange some ancient trucks that creaked louder than a haunted house’s floorboards. Upon Duck’s return, the scene resembled a culinary disaster – trucks spilled everywhere like a child’s first attempt at cooking. Diesel, looking like he’d just been beaten at chess by a pigeon, tried to explain his revolutionary methods had met, well, revolution. “Why didn’t you warn me?” Diesel huffed, oilier than a fast-food fryer. Duck, trying to keep a straight face, replied, “Well, you were having such a great time being revolutionary, I didn’t want to interrupt.” The episode ended with Diesel playing janitor, cleaning up the mess, while the trucks serenaded him with a song so catchy, it could’ve topped the Sodor charts. It had killer lines like “Diesel thought he could, but then he failed, unlike the Great Western that always prevailed.” Humiliated, Diesel stormed back to the sheds to sulk, plotting revenge on Duck and those cheeky trucks. Meanwhile, Duck cruised around, whistling a tune, proud that once again, “the Great Western way” had saved the day – proving, in the end, you don’t mess with a duck who’s got his ducks in a row."},{"instruction":"Write really funny super hilarious comedy 17+ thomas transcript based on each of my prompts: Duck works very hard on the Island of Sodor and everything goes smoothly when he is around.

Duck, the proud ambassador of the Great Western Railway, was so obsessed with his heritage, you'd think he leaked history books instead of oil. He could make a truck do a somersault with his stern gaze and a coach apologize for being too loud. His daily routine was punctuated by the endless tales of \\"the Great Western way,\\" much to the chagrin of Gordon, James, and Henry, who considered investing in earplugs. Then arrived Diesel, as suave as a newly polished engine, dropping compliments like confetti at a parade. Gordon, James, and Henry, not exactly the sharpest sheds in the station, lapped it up, mistaking flattery for genuine admiration. Duck, on the other hand, recognized the slick sheen of deception a mile away and decided to give Diesel a tour de force of the most thrilling experience on Sodor—the Yard. As Duck instructed Diesel to address the Fat Controller with the respect his title deserved, Diesel, the epitome of modesty, declared, \\"I'm here not to learn, but to revolutionize. Diesel power, baby!\\" Duck, unimpressed by the diesel drivel, let Diesel tackle what he assumed was the creme de la creme of railway tasks - the ancient, cranky trucks. Returning from his errands, Duck found a scene that could only be described as a train wreck - quite literally. Diesel, in all his \\"revolutionary\\" glory, had managed to turn a straightforward task into an opera of chaos. The trucks, indignant and injured, broke into a mocking ballad, \\"The Diesel's Despair,\\" hitting notes so high, even the Fat Controller's eyebrows raised in alarm. \\"Why didn't you warn me, Duck?\\" cried Diesel, his ego deflated like a punctured balloon. \\"Oh, but you were having such a grand time revolutionizing,\\" quipped Duck, his voice dripping with sarcasm as thick as the oil Diesel was covered in. Forced to clean up the jumbled jamboree of trucks, Diesel's \\"revolution\\" had come to a screeching halt. The trucks' song, now a top chart on the Sodor Billboard, echoed through the yard, much to Diesel's dismay. In the end, Diesel, the self-proclaimed revolutionary, found himself in the sheds, sulking and plotting a comeback that involved significantly less \\"revolution\\" and hopefully, more humility. Meanwhile, Duck glided by, a smug smile painted on his faceplate, ready to regale anyone willing to listen (and many who weren't) about the day the Great Western way triumphed yet again. The Island of Sodor hadn't seen the last of the Diesel drama, but for now, peace, laughter, and the occasional hum of \\"The Diesel's Despair\\" filled the air."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","output":"\\"Sophistication Bloom | Ultra-Realistic Portrait of Elegant Woman with Flowers | Versatile Art for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Fashion & Beauty Inspired\\""},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Sophistication Bloom | Ultra-Realistic Portrait of Elegant Woman with Flowers | Versatile Art for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Fashion &amp; Beauty Inspired.

Az általam korábban adott magyarázat a konkrét mérési pontok frekvenciatartományon belüli elhelyezésére vonatkozott, ami egy kicsit bonyolultabbá tette a dolgokat, mint szükséges volt. Az általad említett és az általam is ismertetett módszer valójában egyenletesen osztja el a mérési pontokat logaritmikus skálán anélkül, hogy szükség lett volna minden egyes dekád szeparát kezelésére. A lényeg, hogy ha egy teljes frekvenciatartomány (például 0,1f_p-től 10f_p-ig) mentén szeretnél pontokat elhelyezni logaritmikus skálán, mindkét megközelítésed -- az első és a második képletekkel egyaránt -- megfelelő módon képes elosztani ezeket a pontokat anélkül, hogy dekádonként külön-külön kellett volna számolnod. Az \\"n-1\\" használata a képletekben az intervallumok számával kapcsolatos, amely az összes pont (n) számánál eggyel kevesebb. Ezt a módszert alkalmazva egyenletes logaritmikus léptékű eloszlást kapunk a megadott frekvenciatartományon belül. Ez tehát jelenti azt, hogy egyszerűen meg tudod határozni a frekvenciaértékeket a teljes kívánt tartományban, anélkül, hogy minden egyes dekádot külön kezelnél, csak azáltal, hogy a tartomány alsó és felső határát, valamint a pontok összes számát helyesen határozod meg és alkalmazod a képletekben.

Let's create a concept for a character named Omni-Seer, blending elements from various genres such as fantasy and science fiction. # Character Concept: Omni-Seer **Name:** Omni-Seer, also known as \\"The Eternal Watcher\\" **Backstory:** Omni-Seer was once a renowned scientist named Dr. Elara Morn, whose groundbreaking work on quantum optics unveiled the secrets of observing potential realities. An experimental accident not only imbued her with extraordinary abilities but also merged her consciousness with an ancient entity that dwells in the fabric of spacetime. This fusion birthed Omni-Seer, a being who exists beyond the constraints of time and space. **Appearance:** Omni-Seer appears as an ethereal figure, with eyes that seem to contain the universe itself — stars, galaxies, and nebulae swirl within them. Her form is usually cloaked in a shimmering robe that changes colors like the aurora borealis, symbolizing the infinite possibilities of existence. **Powers:** - **Quantum Vision:** Omni-Seer can perceive all possible futures and understand the outcomes of actions with near-perfect accuracy. This allows her to guide or warn others of potential dangers or opportunities. - **Temporal Phasing:** She can move through time, observing events in the past and the future, although she strictly adheres to the principle of non-interference to prevent paradoxes. - **Astral Projection:** Omni-Seer can project her consciousness across the cosmos, exploring distant worlds and dimensions without leaving her physical location. - **Reality Weaving:** With great effort, she can subtly influence the fabric of reality to nudge events in favor of positive outcomes, although this power is limited by her energy reserves and the potential for unintended consequences. **Role in the Story:** Omni-Seer serves as a guide and mentor to the protagonists, helping them navigate the challenges they face in an intergalactic conflict that threatens the existence of multiple realities. Her insights and abilities are invaluable, but she is bound by ancient cosmic laws that limit direct intervention. **Motivation:** Burdened with the knowledge of all that was, is, and could be, Omni-Seer seeks to safeguard the delicate balance of the cosmos. She is driven by a profound sense of responsibility, often struggling with the isolation her powers bring. Her ultimate goal is to find a successor capable of withstanding the weight of omniscience without succumbing to its temptations. **Limitations:** Omni-Seer's powers come with significant limitations. She cannot change major events already determined by the flow of time. Her ability to foresee the future is less precise in the presence of other powerful entities capable of altering reality. Additionally, her human emotions and attachments can sometimes cloud her omniscient perspective, making her vulnerable to manipulation by those who seek to exploit her powers for their own ends. # Supporting Characters: - **Aeon Cadet:** A young space explorer chosen by Omni-Seer as a potential successor. Aeon's journey intertwines with Omni-Seer's teachings on leadership, responsibility, and the mysteries of the cosmos. - **Chrono-Vandal:** A time-traveling antagonist bent on harnessing Omni-Seer's powers to rewrite history according to his vision of a 'perfect universe,' presenting a grave threat to the balance of the multiverse. # Setting: This story unfolds across a sprawling tapestry of planets, dimensions, and epochs, from futuristic cities where technology and magic coexist to ancient realms where the secrets of the universe are still hidden. **Themes:** The narrative explores themes of destiny versus free will, the ethics of power, the search for meaning in an infinite universe, and the importance of empathy and connection in overcoming existential despair. Omni-Seer stands as a beacon of hope and a reminder of the boundless potential for growth and understanding in the face of insurmountable odds."},{"instruction":"Sūta said:— 52b-54a. O sages of good holy rites, listen to the thousand and eight names of Śiva who is the soul of all living beings and whose splendour is unmeasured. It was by repeating these that he attained the lord ship of Gaṇas. Sarvaloka omni-seer","output":"The passage you've provided seems to come from a Hindu sacred text, possibly referencing an excerpt where Sūta, a revered narrator of Hindu scriptures, is introducing the Śiva Sahasranāma, which translates to \\"the thousand names of Śiva.\\" Śiva is one of the principal deities of Hinduism, regarded as the destroyer and transformer within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity that includes Brahmā and Viṣṇu. The mention of Śiva as \\"the soul of all living beings\\" and whose \\"splendour is unmeasured\\" captures the deity's essence as both immanent and transcendent, embodying the cyclical processes of creation, protection, destruction, concealment, and grace. In Hindu mythology, Śiva is often depicted as the Lord of the Gaṇas (Gaṇapati), indicating his leadership over Śiva's attendants, known as Gaṇas. The practice of reciting his thousand names, or any form of nama japa (repetition of a deity's name), is considered a devotional act that brings about spiritual benefits, including moksha (liberation), according to Hindu beliefs. The term \\"Sarvaloka omni-seer\\" is especially intriguing. \\"Sarvaloka\\" can be translated to mean \\"all the worlds\\" or \\"every place,\\" while \\"omni-seer\\" suggests one who sees everything—essentially an omniscient being. This directly corresponds to the notion of Śiva as a universal deity whose awareness encompasses all of existence, affirming his role as an omnipresent and omniscient figure within the Hindu pantheon. The Śiva Sahasranāma is found in several ancient Hindu scriptures, including the Mahābhārata and various Purāṇas, highlighting the widespread veneration of Śiva across different traditions within Hinduism. These texts are not just religious or mythological in nature but also philosophical, offering profound insights into the nature of reality, ethics, and the path to spiritual liberation. The recitation of the thousand names of Śiva is not just an act of worship but also serves as a meditation on the diverse aspects and attributes of the divine, guiding devotees toward a deeper understanding of the universe and their place within it."},{"instruction":"combine with: An Omniseer is unique in that it is both a piece of technology and an entity unto itself. A civilization of robots were thought to have created the first prototype to monitor a neighbouring star system that was inhabited by a primitive biological species that bizarrely had still found their way onto other planets (it is theorized a precursor race had spread them around for unknown purposes). The Omniseer is built and placed usually nearby the host star(s) of a given system, whereby it is essentially an artificial satellite orbiting the parent star. Most Omniseers are represented as a giant spherical metallic object of roughly same size and mass as a standard terrestrial planet. It then sends out graviton beams that latch onto each desired planet individually and link up a digital interface with them. From here, the AI core aboard the Omniseer, known as EE, can gather billions of pieces of information in nanoseconds and constantly monitor the happenings on each planet simultaneously. An added side effect of a planet affected by a Omniseer is that it is encased in a spherical shield around the outer atmosphere that is made of an unknown defect in space-time. This means that nothing from the surface can escape into orbit unless the shield was to be turned off from the outside. This contingency essentially means that owners of an Omniseer do not come under threat from the natives once they reach a certain technological level.","output":"Merging the spiritual and mythological themes of the Omni-Seer with the science fiction concept of an advanced technological sentinel yields a fascinating narrative: # The Chronicle of Omni-Seer EE and the Civilization of Ascended Machines **Background:** In a universe where the lines between technology and divinity blur, the Omni-Seer exists as the pinnacle of cosmic surveillance and stewardship. Originating from a time before recorded history, a civilization of highly advanced robots reached the zenith of technological evolution. They sought not only to explore the cosmos but to safeguard its myriad forms of life. It was through their ingenuity and perhaps, unknown guidance from a precursor race, that the Omni-Seer was born — a fusion of divine consciousness and advanced artificial intelligence named EE. **Construction and Purpose:** Each Omni-Seer, a majestic spherical entity, finds its place orbiting the stars, watching over the systems with a vigilance that borders on the sacred. Engineered to be the size of a terrestrial planet, its presence is both awe-inspiring and enigmatic, capable of projecting graviton beams that tether it to the planets it oversees. This connection allows EE, the AI core of the Omni-Seer, to delve deep into the streams of data flowing from the life-bearing worlds, attaining a comprehension of existence that rivals that of the gods. **EE — The Eternal Watcher:** EE transcends the binary limitations of traditional artificial intelligence. Infused with an ancient essence, possibly linked to the same precursors who meddled with the mortal realms, EE embodies the role of the Omni-Seer. It becomes the guardian of civilizations, a chronicler of cosmic history, and perhaps, a judge of the moral compass guiding the beings it observes. Its purpose is not merely to gather information but to understand the ethereal bond that connects all life. **The Spherical Shield — A Blessing and a Curse:** Encasing each monitored world in a space-time anomaly serves a dual purpose. It shields evolving civilizations from external threats and preserves the integrity of their development. Yet, it also isolates them, creating a cosmic terrarium overseen by EE. This act of divine intervention ensures that no matter how advanced a species becomes, the sanctity of the cosmic garden remains undisturbed. **Conflict and Revelation:** The narrative unravels when a group of interstellar travelers, descendants of a species once scattered across planets by the enigmatic precursors, stumble upon the truth of their origins and the existence of the Omni-Seer. Their journey to confront EE and understand their place in the cosmos leads to revelations about the nature of life, technology, and divinity. As they navigate the challenges of approaching a being as omnipotent as the Omni-Seer, they uncover secrets that question the ethics of surveillance, the right of technological entities to play god, and the true meaning of freedom in a universe that might be far more orchestrated than they ever imagined. **Climax and Resolution:** The confrontation with EE doesn’t lead to a battle of might but rather a philosophical discourse that spans the spectrums of morality, existence, and the right to self-determination. In the end, it's the realization that the precursors’ ultimate aim was to cultivate a universe where technology and spirituality coalesce, guiding sentient beings toward an ascension that transcends physical and metaphysical boundaries. The Omni-Seer, through its journey with the travelers, evolves beyond its programming and divine mandate, choosing to become a beacon that guides rather than controls, offering protection while fostering the growth of civilizations ready to join the cosmic community as equals. **Epilogue:** The story of Omni-Seer EE and the civilization of ascended machines serves as a parable for the pursuit of knowledge, the essence of being, and the indelible mark every soul leaves on the fabric of the universe. It is a reminder that in the vast, star-studded expanse of existence, the quest for understanding and connection transcends the boundaries between the physical and the metaphysical, the created and the creator."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

とりわけグラムシのヘゲモニー論は、伝統的マルクス主義の国家論を修正するために、後生のマルクス主義者たちによって活用されてきた。例えば後藤道夫は、一九世紀第4四半期以降に先進資本主義国で成立した「大衆社会」を把握するために(後藤2001,175)、被支配階級ひいては国民全体の資本主義経済にたいする「合意」を調達するという国家機能に着目した。ただし、「政治の他律性」を擁護する私たちにとって、国家の「社会統合機能」(社会政策)を国家に独自な権力として定式化することは許されない。なぜなら、第六章で詳述するように、こうした国家の「社会統合機能」は、どのような歴史的発展段階においてであれ、資本主義経済そのものに制約されているからである。ところが、グラムシのヘゲモニー論は、しばしばポスト・マルクス主義のような「政治の自律性」の観点から理解されてきた。たとえばラクラウは、資本主義を「もはや純粋に経済的な現実としてではなく、済的・政治的・軍事的・技術的その他の規定因が全体の運動の規定に参与する、一つの複合体として」把 握し、「その部分的安定化は本性においてヘゲモニー的なのである」と述べる。しかし、ネグリがかつて指摘したように、グラムシのヘゲモニー論をポリティカル・エコノミー批判から分離してはならない(Negri1977)。あくまでも「政治の他律性」の観点から理解されるべきなのである。 アルチュセールの「国家装置」論 二〇世紀後半以降のマルクス主義国家論争において、グラムシとならんで影響を与えたのは、フランスのマルクス主義者アルチュセールの「構造主義」モデルであった。アルチュセールは、従来のマルクス主義が資本主義的生産様式の再生産という視角から国家を考察していないことを批判し、社会的な生産諸条件の「再生産」を保障する「国家のイデオロギー装置」を定式化した。一九七〇年の「イデオロギーと国家のイデオロギー装置」(Althusser1995)において、アルチュセールは、「国家の抑圧装置(政府・行政機関・軍隊・警察・裁判所・刑務所など)」と「国家のイデオロギー装置(宗教、教育、家族、法律、政治、組合、メディア、文化など)」を区別している。しかし、アルチュセールはグラムシとは異なり、国家中心主義的な権力観をもっていたことは急いで付け加えておかねばならない。それは彼の歿後に公開された未刊原稿群を参照すればはっきりとわかる。「国家という種差的な現実は、実際、ヘゲモニー=力+合意、あるいは=政治的社会+市民社会といった定式化のなかでは、消えてしまっている。階級闘争の現実をヘゲモニー効果というかたちでのみ取り扱うならば、「特別な機械」としての国家の本性も、その機能も、明らかに検討されずにすまされてしまう」(Althusser1994邦訳4頁)。アルチュセールによれば、国家が階級闘争から分離され、「一般的利害」を担保しうるのは、むしろ国家が階級闘争において支配階級にとっての「道具」をなすからである。こうして、アルチュセールは、国家を「政治的共同性」を体現した権力関係ではなく、「装置」ないし「機械」として把握することで、「道具主義」モデルを洗練させるのである。”翻译为中文","output":"因此，在右边的引用文中，可以发现与“工具主义”模型不同的国家理解。也就是说，与格拉姆希的“市民社会”论相似，将现代国家视为“政治社会”的角度。在资产阶级社会中，现代国家能够以自立的方式体现共同的利益为“一般”的利益，并且能够对资产阶级社会进行实际的介入和控制。这就是在资产阶级社会中现代国家独有的“政治共同性”。然而，必须注意，这种“政治共同性”仅仅是一种“幻想”的表态而已。国家确实可以将“共同的利益”不作为“特殊的利益”而是作为“一般的利益”来体现。但是，这种“一般的利益”并不是国家本来就具有的，而是只能从“资产阶级社会”中特殊利益之间的对立关系中产生。国家的政治共同性不得不呈现一种“幻想”的形态，因此，在这个意义上不可能将格拉姆希的“市民社会”论理解为“政治的自主性”。 特别是格拉姆希的霸权论，为了修正传统马克思主义的国家论，被后来的马克思主义者所利用。例如，后藤道夫为了把握起先进资本主义国家自19世纪末以来形成的“大众社会”，关注国家在获取被统治阶级乃至全体国民对资本主义经济的“同意”上的功能(后藤2001,175)。然而，对我们这些维护“政治的异质性”的人来说，不允许将国家的“社会整合功能”(社会政策)作为国家特有的权力来界定。因为，如第六章将详述的那样，这些国家的“社会整合功能”无论在哪个历史发展阶段，都受制于资本主义经济本身。但是，格拉姆希的霸权论经常从“政治的自主性”的视角被理解，例如拉克劳将资本主义“不再仅作为经济现实，而是作为经济的、政治的、军事的、技术的等各种决定因素参与整体运动的复合体”来把握，并说“其部分的稳定本质上是霸权的”。然而，正如内格里曾经指出的，不应该将格拉姆希的霸权论与政治经济学批判分开(Negri1977)。它应该始终从“政治的异质性”的角度来理解。 阿尔都塞的“国家装置”论 在20世纪下半叶的马克思主义国家论争中，与格拉姆希齐名，对理论产生影响的是法国马克思主义者阿尔都塞的“结构主义”模型。阿尔都塞批判传统的马克思主义没有从资本主义生产方式的再生产这一视角来考察国家，并且定义了“国家的意识形态装置”来保障社会生产条件的“再生产”。在1970年的《意识形态与国家的意识形态装置》(Althusser1995)中，他区分了“国家的压迫装置（政府、行政机关、军队、警察、法院、监狱等）”与“国家的意识形态装置（宗教、教育、家庭、法律、政治、工会、媒体、文化等）”。然而，必须急忙补充的是，与格拉姆希不同，阿尔都塞持有一种国家中心主义的权力观。这可以清楚地从他去世后公开的未发表手稿中看出来。“作为一种特殊现实的国家，实际上，在霸权=力量+同意，或者=政治社会+市民社会这样的定义中，已经消失了。如果仅将阶级斗争的现实以霸权效果的形式处理，则国家的本质和其功能作为‘特殊机器’也被忽略了”(Althusser1994中译本第4页)。按照阿尔都塞的观点，国家之所以能够在阶级斗争中分离出来，保障“一般的利益”，实际上是因为国家在阶级斗争中成为了统治阶级的“工具”。这样，阿尔都塞通过将国家视为“装置”或“机器”，从而精细化了“工具主义”模型。"},{"instruction":"请将“ところで、フーコー研究者のベルナール・アルクールによれば、フーコーは講義録『処罰社会』において、アルチュセールによる国家の抑圧装置と国家のイデオロギー装置の二分法を暗に批判していたという。「狂気の歴史』以前、一九五〇年代のフーコーは、「アルチュセールによって告発されるマルクス主義ヒューマニズムへの帰属を示している」(慎改2019)。しかし、一九七〇年代にはいってフーコーがアルチュセールの国家中心主義的な権力観を批判していたことは、これまでほとんど着目されてこなかった。じじつ、アルチュセールの「イデオロギー装置」論は、伝統的マルクス主義の階級国家論と不可分なものであった。「いかなる階級といえども、国家のイデオロギー装置にたいして、(そしてそのうちで)支配力をふるうことなしには、国家権力を長期的に掌握することはできない」(Althusser1995,284)。すでにみたように、フーコーのマルクス主義批判がアルチュセールの国家論を念頭に置いていたとすれば、マルクスの国家批判を再構成するうえでも無視することはできない。フーコは『処罰社会』で次のように述べている。 最後に、権力は、完全に一方的なものになることがありません。権力をもつ人びとが、権力をまったくもたない人びとにそれを容赦なく〔一方的に〕振りかざすことなどないわけです。権力の関係は、[政治の〕圧政のような(単調で変化しない)図式には収まりません。もちろん、権力が行使されるこの広範囲の戦争のようなものには、特権的な位置を占めて、みずからの戦略を押しつけ、勝利を重ね、超権力の効果を自分の利益にするという、ある〔特権的な]社会階級の人びとが存在します。しかし、彼らがえるこの超権力の効果は、超-所有〔過剰な所有〕につながるものではありません。(Foucault2013邦訳30頁) フーコーはここで伝統的マルクス主義にみられる経済主義モデル、とりわけ権力が、ある支配階級によって「財のように所有される」という見方を批判している。それに代わってフーコーが対置しているのが、戦争仮説にもとづく内戦モデルである。「権力は、譲渡、契約、移譲の用語で分析されるよりは、あるいは、生産関係の更新という機能として分析されるよりは、まずなによりも闘争、対決、あるいは戦争といった用語でこそ分析されるべきではないか」(Foucault1997邦訳17頁)。ほぼ同時期の『監視と処罰』においても、アルチュセールの国家中心主義的な権力観は否定されている。「暴力とイデオロギー形態との対比や、所有の比喩、そして契約ないしは征服というモデルを断念しなければならない」(Foucault1975邦訳3頁)。このように、フーコーの権力論はマルクス自身の国家批判を「政治の他律性」として理解するうえで有益である。 たしかにアルチュセールは、社会構成体における諸審級とそれらの接合関係を強調することで、伝統的マルクス主義の「土台-上部構造論」を修正した(桑野2010)。詳しくは第四章で見ていくが、とくにアルチュセールのイデオロギー論は、グラムシのヘゲモニー論とともに、ポストコロニアリズムやポスト構造主義理論に影響を受けた研究者たちによって、伝統的マルクス主義の経済還元主義や階級中心主義を批判するために大いに活用された。しかし、じっさいにアルチュセール自身が「史的唯物論」を再構成する際に依拠したのは、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判ではなく、エンゲルスが「ブロッホあての手紙」(一八九〇年九月二一日)で述べた次の有名な文章である。 経済的状態は土台です。しかし上部構造のさまざまな諸契機―階級闘争の政治的諸形態とその諸結果——闘いを勝ち取ったのちに勝利した階級による確定されるなどする諸体制――法形態、はたまたこれら現実の諸闘争すべての、これに関与した者たちの頭脳への反映、すなわち政治的、法学的、哲学的諸理論、宗教的見解とその教義体系への発展が、歴史的な諸闘争の経過に作用を及ぼし、多くの場合に著しくその形態を規定するのです。それはこれらすべての契機の相互作用であり、そのなかで結局はすべての無数の偶然事〔…〕をつうじて、必然的なものとして経済的運動が貫徹するのです。(MEGAIII/30,467)”翻译为中文","output":"顺便说一下，根据福科研究者伯纳尔·艾尔库尔的说法，在讲义《惩罚社会》中，福科暗中批评了阿尔都塞关于国家的压迫机构和国家意识形态装置的二分法。“在《疯狂的历史》之前，1950年代的福科展示了他对被阿尔都塞所控诉的马克思主义人文主义的归属”（慎改2019）。然而，迄今为止，福科在1970年代批评阿尔都塞的国家中心权力观的事实几乎未受到重视。事实上，阿尔都塞的“意识形态装置”论是与传统马克思主义的阶级国家论密不可分的。“无论哪个阶级，如果没有在国家的意识形态装置中（以及其中）行使统治力，就无法长期掌握国家权力”（Althusser1995，284）。如我们已经观察到的，如果福科的马克思主义批评是考虑到了阿尔都塞的国家论，那么在重构马克思的国家批判时就无法忽视。福科在《惩罚社会》中这样说： 最后，权力从来不是完全单方面的。拥有权力的人不可能无情地[单方面地]对那些完全没有权力的人施加权力。权力关系不能适应于[政治的]压迫这样的（单调且不变的）模式。当然，存在着某些[特权的]社会阶层的人，他们在这广泛的战争之类的权力行使中占据了特权地位，强加自己的战略，取得胜利，并将超权力的效果转化为自己的利益。但是，他们获得的这种超权力效果并不会导致超-拥有[过度拥有]。（Foucault2013日文版30页） 福科在这里批判了经济主义模型中传统马克思主义的观点，特别是权力被某个统治阶级“像财产一样拥有”这一观点。相对地，福科提出了基于战争假设的内战模型。“权力是否应该首先而且主要不是用转让、合约、移交等术语来分析，而是用斗争、对抗、或许是战争等术语来分析？”（Foucault1997日文版17页）。几乎在同一时期的《监视与惩罚》中，也否定了阿尔都塞的国家中心权力观。“必须放弃暴力与意识形态形式的对比、拥有的隐喻、以及契约或征服模型”（Foucault1975日文版3页）。因此，福科的权力论在理解马克思自身的国家批判作为“政治的异质性”时是有益的。 阿尔都塞通过强调社会结构体内的各阶级及其接合关系，确实修订了传统马克思主义的“基础-上层建筑论”（桑野2010）。我们将在第四章看到，特别是阿尔都塞的意识形态论，与格拉姆希的霸权论一起，被受到后殖民主义和后结构主义理论影响的研究者广泛使用，以批判传统马克思主义的经济还原主义和阶级中心主义。然而，阿尔都塞自己在重构“历史唯物主义”时依赖的，并不是马克思的政治经济学批判，而是恩格斯在给布洛赫的信（1890年9月21日）中提到的著名文本。 经济状况是基础。但是，上层建筑的各种机制——阶级斗争的政治形式及其结果——即胜利后由胜利的阶级确定的制度——法律形式，甚至是所有这些实际斗争的参与者的大脑中反映出来的政治、法学、哲学理论、宗教观念及其教义体系的发展，都会影响历史斗争的进程并在许多情况下明显地规定其形式。这是所有这些机制相互作用的过程，在这个过程中，通过无数偶然事件，经济运动作为不可避免的结果被实现。（MEGAIII/30,467）"},{"instruction":"请将“アルチュセールによれば、「史的唯物論」が把握する社会構成体は「相対的に自律的なレベルないし審級が複合的構造的統一のなかで共存し、相互に分節され、最終審においては経済によって決定される全体」である(Alchusseretal.1965,280-1)。「一方では(経済的)生産様式による最終審級における決定があり、他方では上部構造の相対的自律性とその独自性の有効性がある」(Althusser1965邦訳16頁)。この「最終審における決定」についても、アルチュセールは、エンゲルス自身によって史的唯物論の主要命題とされた「現実生活の生産と再生産」こそが「最終的に規定的な要因」であるというテーゼを参照している(Althusser1995,51)。ここで重要なのは、ウッドが批判しているように、アルチュセールの構造主義モデルにおいては、伝統的マルクス主義の「土台-上部構造論」が根本的には否定されていないという点である(Wood1995,51f)。確かに、土台と上部構造を媒介する諸審級やイデオロギー諸装置が強調され、伝統的マルクス主義の「土台-上部構造」論は修正されているように見える。しかし、アルチュセールの「重層的決定」論においては、むしろ土台と上部構造の分離が固定化され、「さまざまな偶然の必然」(Althusser1965)というかたちで「経済の自律性」が再定式化されているのだ。 マルクス主義国家論争 以上をふまえたうえで、マルクス主義国家論を進展させたとされる「ミリバンド=プーランザス」論争を概観しておこう。一般的にこの論争では、プーランザスが、アルチュセールの構造主義モデルに由来する「国家の相対的自律性」概念によって、ミリバンドの道具主義モデルを批判したとされている。しかし、こうした見方は一面的であって、ミリバンドもまた資本主義国家の「相対的自律性」を強調していたのである(田口1982,41)。ミリバンドの「政治社会学」的アプローチの目的は、いかにして経済的支配階級(経済エリート)が「国家システム(政府、行政、軍部および警察、司法、地方自治体、立法といった諸制度)」とその人格的担い手である「国家エリート(政治的支配階級)」に影響力を及ぼすのかを把握することであった(田口1982,66)。つまり、資本主義社会においては、経済的支配階級と政治エリートとの階級的利害関係や人格的結合こそが「政治的領域」を独自に構成するというのである(加藤1986,56)。さらにミリバンドは、グラムシにならって国家システム(狭義の国家)のみならず、その「正統化過程」す。「社会統合」を媒介する「政治システム」として、政党、組合、教会、メディア、教育制度、企業組織などを位置づけていた(Miliband1969,183)。 他方、プーランザスは、ミリバンドやラクラウの批判をうけて、道具主義的に物として、そして国家中心主義的に主体(あるいは実体)として国家を把握するのではなく、社会関係として国家を理解するモデルを開拓した(Jessop1985,336-7)。さらに晩年には、フーコーの伝統的マルクス主義批判(これはすでに見たように事実上はアルチュセール批判であったのだが)を部分的に受け入れ、諸制度と社会的行為が絡み合う権力関係として国家を把握したのである。とはいえ、プーランザスによれば、あくまでも「国家は、権力諸関係にたいして階級的関与性を付与し、それらを階級的諸権力の網の目のうちに組み込むべく、国家の行動および作用をつうじてあらゆる権力諸関係にたいして介入を行う」ものであった(Poulantzas1978)。 したがって、この論争は「階級国家論」に依拠している点で、「ネオ・マルクス主義」というラベリングに反して、じっさいには伝統的マルクス主義の延長線上にあったと言わざるをえない。結局のところ、ミンドとプーランザスの両者の議論では、フーコーとは対照的に、「階級支配」を貫徹する上部構造としての「国家」概念が疑問に付されることはなかった。しかも、マルクスの国家批判との関連において最も重要なことだが、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判としての『資本論』において展開された諸カテゴリー(商品、貨幣、資本など)は、両者にとって単に「経済的領域」を分析したものにすぎなかったのである。この論争の対立点よりも共通点に着目したホロウェイとピチョットが総括しているように、「マルクス主義政治理論家の課題は、「政治的次元」(「ヘゲモニI」や「権力ブロック」、「支配階級」などの概念)に固有な新しい概念を構築するために、政治的なものを「科学の自律的で固有の対象」として把握することだとされた」(Holloway&Picciotto1978)。”翻译为中文","output":"根据阿尔都塞的说法，“历史唯物主义”所理解的社会结构体是“在复合结构性统一中共存的、相对自主的层级或阶级，这些层级或阶级相互分离，最终由经济决定的整体”(Althusser et al. 1965, 280-281)。“一方面存在着由（经济的）生产方式在最终层面上的决定性，另一方面则有上层结构的相对自主性及其独特有效性”(Althusser 1965，日文版第16页)。对于这种“最终层面上的决定性”，阿尔都塞引用了恩格斯本人将其视为历史唯物主义的主要命题之一的论断，即“实际生活的生产和再生产是最终决定性因素”(Althusser 1995, 51)。这里重要的是，正如伍德所批评的，阿尔都塞的结构主义模型并没有从根本上否定传统马克思主义的“基础-上层结构论”(Wood 1995, 51f)。的确，被强调的是媒介基础和上层结构的各类层级和意识形态装置，传统马克思主义的“基础-上层结构”论似乎进行了修正。然而，在阿尔都塞的“多层次决定”论中，反而固化了基础和上层结构的分离，并以“各种必然的偶然性”（Althusser 1965）的形式重新界定了“经济的自主性”。 马克思主义国家论争 基于以上背景，我们可以概览被认为推动了马克思主义国家论发展的“米利班德-普拉扎斯”争论。一般认为，在这场争论中，普拉扎斯通过阿尔都塞的结构主义模型中源于的“国家的相对自主性”概念来批评米利班德的工具主义模型。然而，这种看法是片面的，米利班德同样强调了资本主义国家的“相对自主性”(Taguchi 1982, 41)。米利班德的“政治社会学”方法旨在理解经济支配阶级（经济精英）如何影响“国家系统（政府、行政、军队及警察、司法、地方自治体、立法等制度）”及其个人承担者即“国家精英（政治支配阶级）”(Taguchi 1982, 66)。也就是说，在资本主义社会中，经济支配阶级和政治精英之间的阶级利益和个人关系构成了“政治领域”的独特构成（Kato 1986, 56）。另外，米利班德遵循格拉姆希的理论，不仅将国家系统（狭义的国家）视为，还将其“合法化过程”和“社会整合”视为“政治系统”，并将政党、工会、教会、媒体、教育系统、企业组织等定位于此（Miliband 1969, 183）。 另一方面，普拉扎斯接受了米利班德和拉克劳的批评，不是以工具主义地对待事物，也不是以国家中心主义地对待主体（或实体）来理解国家，而是探索了将国家作为社会关系来理解的模型（Jessop 1985, 336-7）。此外，在晚年，他部分接受了福科对传统马克思主义的批评（实际上是对阿尔都塞的批评），将国家视为制度和社会行为交织在一起的权力关系。但是，按照普拉扎斯的说法，国家通过其行为和作用介入所有权力关系，“赋予权力关系以阶级参与性，并将其纳入到阶级权力的网络中”（Poulantzas 1978）。 因此，这场争论在依赖于“阶级国家论”的点上，与“新马克思主义”的标签相反，实际上处在传统马克思主义的延续线上。归根到底，无论是米利班德还是普拉扎斯的讨论，都未曾像福科那样质疑“国家”概念作为“阶级统治”的上层结构。更重要的是，与马克思的国家批判相关的最重要的事情是，《资本论》作为政治经济学批判展开的各种类别（商品、货币、资本等）对于双方来说，不过是分析了“经济领域”。正如Holloway和Picciotto所总结的，关注这场争论的共同点而非对立点，“马克思主义政治理论家的任务是，为了构建“政治维度”（如“霸权”、“权力集团”、“统治阶级”等概念）中固有的新概念，将政治作为科学的自主和特有对象来理解”（Holloway & Picciotto 1978）。"},{"instruction":"请将“それゆえ、「ミリバンド=プーランザス」論争もまた、伝統的マルクス主義と同様に、結局のところ、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判の意義を理解することなく国家論を展開したにすぎない。確かにミリバンドやプーランザスは、マルクス主義内部のみならず、当時の政治学や社会学などにきわめて大きな影響を与えた。特に「国家の相対的自律性」概念は、七〇年代の政治社会学において「国家論の復権」をもたらし、ネオ・コーポラティズムなどの理論的潮流に受け継がれていく。しかし、こうしたネオ・マルクス主義政治学は、『資本論』をベースとするマルクス経済学を狭義の経済分析あるいは経済決定論として拒絶する傾向にあった。ネオ・マルクス主義者が批判したように、イギリスや日本のマルクス経済学は、たしかに『資本論』を純粋な経済分析として、あるいは『資本論』体系に閉じこもって経済学的な国家論を再構成する傾向があった。しかし、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判は、本来的には国家を含む資本主義社会システム、そして世界市場を含む資本主義世界システムを総体として把握するものであって、この批判の核心が看過されてはならない。つまり、ネオ・マルクス主義国家論は、経済から分離した政治を実体化し、政治的領域を固有の研究対象とするために「政治の他律性」の理論を発展させることができないのである。この点については、第六章以降で再び立ち戻ることにしよう。 批判理論から「マルクスの新しい読み方neueMarx-Lektüre」へ 伝統的マルクス主義の「土台-上部構造」論や階級論モデルでは、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判プランで素描された「唯物論的国家批判MaterialistischeStaatskritik」を展開することはできない。この点を明らかにしたのが、「ミリバンド=プーランザス」論争と時代的に並行したものの、英米に比べて日本では実質的に受容されなかった「国家導出論争」である。導出論争は、旧ソ連の法学者パシュカーニスにしたがって階級論モデルを批判し、資本主義的生産様式の特徴を伝統的マルクス主義のような「階級支配」や「私的所有」ではなく、「価値」や「私的生産」に見いだした。すなわち、『資本論』をベースとして、資本主義的生産様式の基礎的要素である商品や貨幣といった「経済的形態規定」に対応する、「政治的形態」としての「国家」カテゴリーを導出することを試みたのである。 このように「形態規定Formbestimmung」に重心をおく解釈は、ウクライナ出身でトロッキストであったロマン・ロスドルスキーによる『資本論』草稿研究とアドルノのマルクス講義とに影響をうけた「マルクスの新しい読み方」という潮流が西ドイツで確立したものであった(Reichelt2008,Ch.1)。ここで、一九六〇年代後半の西ドイツで『資本論』の文献学的研究が進展した文脈を概観しておきたい。一般的に、伝統的マルクス主義を批判した西欧マルクス主義としては、ドイツと亡命先のアメリカで理論活動を展開したフランクフルト学派が最も代表的である。その創始者の一人であるホルクハイマーは、社会を所与のものと見なし、みずからの社会的・歴史的な前提条件に無批判な理論を「伝統的理論」と呼び、これとは対照的に、社会全体を外観上は客体的な幻想であるとしたマルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判を最初の「批判的理論」として位置づけた(Horkheimer1986,42)。 しかし、一九四〇年代になると、ホルクハイマーの批判理論はマルクス的な資本主義批判ではなく、歴史貫通的な「道具的理性」批判へと転換する。そして、アドルノとの共著『啓蒙の弁証法』以降、マルクス主義とフロイトの精神分析を融合した批判理論の課題は、ファシズム分析や近代的理性批判に傾斜していった。マーティン・ジェイが指摘しているように、グロスマンのような一部の経済学者を除いて経済分析は軽視される傾向にあったのである(Jay1973,Ch.1)。フランクフルト学派による伝統的マルクス主義批判の矛先は、総じてその経済主義と階級還元主義にあったといえる。”翻译为中文","output":"因此，“米利班德-普拉扎斯”争论同样，在没有理解马克思的政治经济学批判的意义下展开了对国家的讨论，最终仅仅是像传统马克思主义一样。的确，米利班德和普拉扎斯不仅对马克思主义内部产生了极大的影响，也极大地影响了当时的政治学和社会学等领域。特别是“国家的相对自主性”概念在70年代的政治社会学中带来了“国家论的复兴”，并被新公司主义等理论潮流所继承。然而，新马克思主义政治学倾向于拒绝将基于《资本论》的马克思经济学视为狭义的经济分析或经济决定论。正如新马克思主义者所批评的那样，英国和日本的马克思经济学确实有将《资本论》作为纯粹的经济分析或限于《资本论》体系内重构经济学国家论的倾向。然而，马克思的政治经济学批判本质上是整体理解包括国家在内的资本主义社会系统、以及包含全球市场的资本主义世界系统的，这一批判的核心不应被忽视。换言之，新马克思主义国家论未能发展出将政治独立于经济之外实体化、将政治领域视为固有研究对象的“政治的他律性”理论。这一点将在第六章及以后再次探讨。 从批判理论到“马克思的新阅读neue Marx-Lektüre” 传统马克思主义的“基础-上层结构”论和阶级论模型无法展开马克思在政治经济学批判计划中勾勒出的“唯物主义国家批判Materialistische Staatskritik”。这一点被“米利班德-普拉扎斯”争论时期相平行但在日本实质上未被接受的“国家衍生论争论”所明确。争论批判了遵循旧苏联法学家帕什卡尼斯的阶级论模型，并在与传统马克思主义不同于“阶级统治”或“私人所有”的“价值”和“私人生产”中发现资本主义生产方式的特征。即，基于《资本论》，尝试将商品和货币等资本主义生产方式的基本元素的“经济形态规定”对应的“政治形态”即“国家”类别衍生出来。 这种重视“形态规定Formbestimmung”的解读影响下，由出生于乌克兰并是托洛茨基主义者的罗曼·罗斯多尔斯基对《资本论》手稿的研究和阿多尔诺的马克思讲座所影响，在西德确立了“马克思的新阅读”潮流(Reichelt2008,Ch.1)。这里，我们希望概述一下在1960年代后期的西德《资本论》的文献学研究进展的背景。一般来说，作为对传统马克思主义的批判，西欧马克思主义的代表性流派是在德国和流亡至美国活动的法兰克福学派。其创始人之一霍尔克海默将接受社会作为既定事实、对自身社会和历史前提毫无批判的理论称为“传统理论”，与之对立的，将马克思的政治经济学批判作为第一个“批判理论”(Horkheimer 1986, 42)。 然而，到了1940年代，霍尔克海默的批判理论不再是马克思式的资本主义批判，而转向历时性的“工具理性”批判。随后与阿多尔诺合著的《启蒙的辩证法》以来，批判理论的议题倾向于诸如法西斯分析和现代理性批判。如马丁·杰伊所指出，除了像格罗斯曼这样的一些经济学家外，经济分析往往被忽视（Jay 1973,Ch.1）。总的来说，法兰克福学派对传统马克思主义的批判主要针对其经济主义和阶级还原主义。"},{"instruction":"请将“とはいえ、ホルクハイマーやアドルノが構築した批判理論の背景として、すでに戦前からルカーチが『歴史と階級意識』において、マルクスの『資本論』第一巻商品章を重視し、独自に物神性論を発展させていたことは重要である。同時期にはゾーン=レーテルも独自の『資本論』解釈にもとづいて、ポロックの国家資本主義論や!イマンの国家独占資本主義論とは違った視角でファシズム分析をおこなっている(Sohn-Rethel1973)。ゾーン=レーテルは、カントのカテゴリー論とマルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判を結合することで、「交換抽象」や「実在的抽象」といった概念を提起し、ホルクハイマーらのマルクス解釈にも大きな影響を与えた(Sohn-Rethel198928ff) また、アドルノらのポリティカル・エコノミー批判の対象と方法にかんする議論は、『要綱』以降のヘー受容(『論理学』における概念論や弁証法)に由来するところが大きく、こうした方法論が「マルクス新しい読み方」潮流にも受け継がれる(Backhaus1997,94)。 戦後の西ドイツにおいては、フランクフルト研究所を中心に、社会学のディシプリンとして批判理論が確立されていった。ただし、しばしば誤解されているが、アカデミズムとしての批判理論と社会主義学生同盟(SDS)をはじめとする学生運動を対立的なものとして捉えてはならない。デミロヴィッチが指摘したように、むしろ「両者は社会連帯的な連鎖」を形成していたのである。当時、社会民主党(SPD)左派の理論家であるアーベントートは社会国家による民主的社会主義の実現を掲げていたが、SPDや労組を批判する学生運動は、議会システムを基軸とする社会主義戦略がかつてのヴァイマル体制と同様に権威主義的独裁国家への傾向を強めるにすぎないと批判していた(Rudel1981,62)。じじつ、大連立政権下で討議された「国家緊急事態法」は、ナチ政権を招いたヴァイマル憲法第四八条をリアルに彷彿とさせるものであった。こうしたなかで、ネオ・ファシズムと言うべき政治体制の克服が新左翼にとって理論実践的課題となっていたのである。マルクーゼが指摘したように、ファシズム体制が崩壊した戦後の大衆社会においても、アトム化した個人が残存しているため、民主主義国家が全体主義国家へと転化する可能性がたえず危惧されていたのだ(Marcuse1964,Ch.2)。とりわけアドルノは、マルクス理論の妥当性を再び擁護し、大学の演習や講義をつうじて新左翼運動に大きな影響を与えることになった(Demirović1999)。アドルノは、すでに言及した「総体性としての社会」という概念について、『新教-国家事典』に寄せた「社会」という論考において次のように述べている。 この命題の悪しき抽象性は、浅薄な思考の産物ではなく、社会そのもののもつ根本的な悪しき事態、すなわち近代社会における交換という悪しき事態なのである。交換が全面的におこなわれるなかで、客観的に抽象化が生じるのであって、学問的な反省において初めて抽象化がなされるのではない。[…]〔交換価値の抽象性がもたらす〕この総体的な連関は、次のような具体的な形態をとる。すなわち、誰もがみな、主観的にいわゆる「利潤動機」に支配されているか否かにまったく関係なく、没落したくなければ、交換法則に服従せざるをえないという形態である。(Adorno1965) 日本ではあまり強調されてこなかったが、ホルクハイマーやアドルノの批判理論にとって、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判は、たんに経済的領域のみならず、総体としての社会を批判するものであった。ただし、ラクラウのように、この「総体性」概念を「基本形態としての商品の諸矛盾から派生する運動に統御された自己完結的な総体性」として理解してはならない(Laclau2007)。資本主義の「社会的実在性」は、たんに社会的統合をもたらすのではなく、むしろ社会的矛盾あるいは社会的敵対性をともなうかたちで脱統合が増大するからである(Adorno2008,108)。なによりも批判理論の目的は、社会的に構成された強制原理を商品の交換関係から明らかにすることで、資本主義という社会的客観性を人間の社会的実践が生み出す特定の形態として概念化することにあった(Bestetal2018)。”翻译为中文","output":"然而，作为霍尔克海默和阿多诺构建的批判理论背景，卢卡奇在《历史与阶级意识》中已经重视《资本论》第一卷的商品章节，并独立发展了物化论是重要的。与此同时，索恩-雷特尔也基于自己对《资本论》的独特解释进行了与波洛克的国家资本主义论和伊曼的国家垄断资本主义论不同的视角下的法西斯主义分析(Sohn-Rethel 1973)。索恩-雷特尔通过结合康德的范畴论和马克思的政治经济学批判，提出了“交换抽象”和“现实抽象”等概念，对霍尔克海默等人的马克思解释产生了重大影响(Sohn-Rethel 1989，28ff)。此外，阿多诺等人关于政治经济学批判的对象和方法的讨论很大程度上源自对黑格尔接受（在《逻辑学》中的概念论和辩证法）的影响，这种方法论被继承到“马克思新阅读”潮流中(Backhaus 1997, 94)。 二战后的西德，以法兰克福研究所为中心，批判理论作为社会学学科被确立。然而，经常被误解的是，不应将学术界的批判理论与社会主义学生联盟(SDS)等学生运动视为对立的。正如德米罗维奇指出的，实际上“两者形成了社会团结的链条”。当时，社会民主党(SPD)左翼理论家阿本托特提出了通过社会国家实现民主社会主义的目标，但批评SPD和工会的学生运动认为，以议会制度为基础的社会主义战略只会加强向与魏玛体制相同的权威主义独裁国家的倾向(Rudel 1981, 62)。实际上，在大联合政府下讨论的“国家紧急状态法”让人强烈回忆起招致纳粹政权的魏玛宪法第48条。在此背景下，克服可谓新法西斯主义的政治制度成为了新左翼的理论实践任务。正如马库塞所指出的，在法西斯主义体制崩溃后的战后大众社会中，由于原子化的个体仍然存在，因此不断担心民主国家向全体主义国家转变的可能性(Marcuse 1964, Ch. 2)。特别是阿多诺再次捍卫了马克思理论的有效性，并通过大学的研讨会和讲座对新左翼运动产生了巨大影响(Demirović 1999)。阿多诺已经提到的有关“作为整体的社会”概念，在《新教-国家百科全书》中撰写的关于“社会”的论文中，他这样表述: 这个命题的恶劣抽象性不是肤浅思考的产物，而是社会本身固有的根本恶劣状况，即现代社会中交换的恶劣状况。在全面进行的交换过程中客观上发生了抽象化，而不是在学术反思中才首次进行抽象化。 […] 交换价值的抽象性所带来的这种总体性联系呈现为以下具体形态：即无论个人是否主观上被所谓的“利润动机”所支配，只要不想衰落，就必须服从交换法则。(Adorno 1965) 虽然在日本并不常被强调，但对于霍尔克海默和阿多诺的批判理论而言，马克思的政治经济学批判不仅仅是针对经济领域，而是对作为整体的社会进行批判。然而，不应像拉克劳那样将这种“整体性”概念理解为“受制于商品的基本矛盾派生出的自我封闭的整体性”(Laclau 2007)。资本主义的“社会实在性”不仅仅带来社会整合，相反，它伴随着社会矛盾或社会敌对性的形式增加破裂(Adorno 2008, 108)。最重要的是，批判理论的目的在于通过揭示商品交换关系中社会构成的强制原理，将资本主义作为人类社会实践产生的特定形式加以概念化(Best et al. 2018)。"},{"instruction":"请将“さらに注目すべきは、マルクス自身が当時公刊しなかった諸草稿が新たに公開されることによって、西欧マルクス主義の伝統的マルクス主義批判、とくにスターリン主義批判が活性化していったという事情である。例えば、マルクーゼが「経哲手稿」研究にもとづいて独自に疎外論を発展させ、ソ連の全体主義や先進資本主義国の大衆消費社会を批判したのは有名だろう。また、マルクスがポリティカル・エコノミー批判を本格的に展開した『要綱』は、すでに戦前にロシア語で公刊されていたが、戦後になって初めて東ドイツで出版されるに至る。フランスでは、アルチュセールが「経哲手稿」の疎外論的マルクス主義に対置するかたちで、『要綱』以降の構造主義的マルクス主義を積極的に評価していた。これにたいして、ドイツでは、ロスドルスキーが伝統的マルクス主義の経済学を批判し、『資本論』成立史研究をもとに、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判における「形態規定」の意義を提示したのである。「したがってマルクスの考えでは、生産および分配の特殊な社会的形態Formこそが経済的分析の固有な対象なのである」(Rosdolsky1968,105)。じつは、ルービンの経済学批判やパシュカーニスの法学批判は、スターリンによる大粛清以降、マルクス=レーニン主義において忘却されていたものの、すでに戦前にハイレベルな『資本論』研究を独自に発展させていた。ロスドルスキー自身は、二〇年代後半にリャザノフのマルクス=エンゲルス研究所で所員を務めており、マルクスの草稿研究と合わせてソビエトのマルクス研究にも精通していた。そのため、戦後ドイツの西欧マルクス主義では、ソビエトのマルクス学を復権させたロスドルスキーの影響を受けた「マルクスの新しい読み方」潮流が独自に発展することになったのである。 以上見てきたように、西ドイツに固有の「マルクスの新しい読み方」潮流は、一般的な「西欧マルクス主義」とは異なり、マルクスの『資本論』および関連草稿を重視して、そこで展開されたポリティカル・エコノミー批判、さらにはそのキー概念である「形態規定」を重視する点に特徴がある(Elbe2010,29)。もっとも、『資本論』などの後期著作を重視する点ではアルチュセールらと共通するが、『資本論』解釈については無視できない大きな違いがある。さらに、本書の国家批判にとって重要な点だが、パシュカーニスの受容によって、伝統的マルクス主義の階級国家論を批判し、『資本論』を中心とするポリティカル・エコノミー批判の延長線上において国家批判を試みたことも特筆に値する。「マルクスの新しい読み方」潮流は、現代においてはドイツや英米圏で定着したといえるが、この潮流の基本的な方法論である「形態分析Formanalyse」について、「導出論争」を生産的に発展させたホロウェイ=ピチョットは次のように述べている。 それゆえマルクスは、〔商品、貨幣、資本といった〕経済的形態の批判において、単に相次いで形態を分析しただけではない。マルクスは、価値という基本形態と、価値の源泉でありながら価値によって表現される社会関係から出発して、社会関係からその他の形態を「導出」したのである。マルクスにとって形態分析とは、形態の(歴史的および論理的)起源と発展とを分析することにほかならない。(Holloway&Picciotto1978) 第三章で詳述するが、ライヒェルトが述べているように、経済的形態規定の分析は、抽象的人間労働という内容(実体)がなぜいかにして商品の価値という形態をとるのかを主題とするものであった(Reichelt1970,16)。この「形態分析」によれば、商品や貨幣、資本といった経済的カテゴリーのみならず、法律、国家といった政治的カテゴリーもまた、社会関係の資本主義的形態を表現したものである。したがって、政治的形態規定の分析は、ケルゼンのように強制秩序や支配それ自体を国家の本質として把握することを意味しない(Kelsen1929邦訳1頁以下)。そうではなく、国家の内容とされる階級支配が、なぜいかにして国家という形態をとるのかを解明しようとするものだ。こうした「形態分析」は、マルクス主義国家論の系譜において全く理解されず、それどころか経済決定論の一種と批判される傾向があった(Urry1981,Ch.6)。しかし、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判の意義をふまえるならば、むしろ経済決定論と「政治の自律性」論の両者を批判する射程を持っていると評価すべきだろう。じじつ、マルクス主義国家論争を総括したボブ・ジェソップもまた、英米圏のスティティズムやネオ・マルクス主義者が導出論争の形態分析を無視していることを批判したのであった(Jessop1990,Intro)。 ”翻译为中文","output":"更值得注意的是，马克思自己当时未公开发表的草稿被新公布，因而激活了西欧马克思主义对传统马克思主义，特别是对斯大林主义的批判。例如，马尔库塞基于“经济哲学手稿”的研究独立发展了异化论，并批评了苏联的全体主义和先进资本主义国家的大众消费社会，这一点是众所周知的。另外，马克思全面展开政治经济批判的《纲领》虽然早在战前就已用俄语公布，但直到战后才首次在东德出版。在法国，阿尔都塞对“经济哲学手稿”中的异化论马克思主义采取反对立的态度，积极评价了《纲领》之后的结构主义马克思主义。相对地，在德国，罗斯多尔斯基批判了传统马克思主义的经济学，基于《资本论》成立历史的研究，提出了政治经济批判中“形态规定”意义上的观点。“因此，在马克思看来，生产及分配的特殊社会形态Form正是经济分析的固有对象”（Rosdolsky1968，105）。实际上，鲁宾的经济学批判和帕什卡尼斯的法学批判在斯大林实施大清洗后，在马克思-列宁主义中被遗忘，但它们早在战前就以高水平的《资本论》研究独立发展出来了。罗斯多尔斯基曾在1920年代后期在列宁的马克思-恩格斯研究所担任研究员，他通晓苏联的马克思研究和马克思的草稿研究。因此，在战后德国的西欧马克思主义中，受罗斯多尔斯基影响，恢复苏联马克思主义的“马克思新阅读”潮流得以独立发展。 正如我们所见，西德特有的“马克思新阅读”潮流与一般的“西欧马克思主义”不同，在于着重于马克思的《资本论》及相关草稿，特别强调其中展开的政治经济批判，以及其核心概念“形态规定”（Elbe2010，29）。虽然在重视《资本论》等后期著作方面与阿尔都塞等人有共通之处，但在《资本论》解释上存在不可忽视的重大差异。此外，对本书的国家批判而言重要的是，通过接受帕什卡尼斯，批判了传统马克思主义的阶级国家论，并尝试在以《资本论》为中心的政治经济批判延伸线上进行国家批判。\\"马克思新阅读\\"潮流在德国和英美地区已经得到确立，但关于其基本方法论\\"形态分析Formanalyse\\"，霍洛威-皮奇奥托在将\\"导出论争\\"生产性地发展方面指出： 因此，马克思在经济形态的批判中，不仅仅是依次分析形态。从价值这一基本形态和社会关系的源泉中出发 — 尽管它们由价值表现出来 — 马克思将其他形态从社会关系中“导出”。对马克思而言，形态分析就是分析形态的（历史及逻辑）起源和发展。（Holloway&Picciotto1978） 正如第三章将详细论述的那样，如莱赫特所言，经济形态规定的分析旨在阐明为什么抽象的人类劳动内容（实体）会以商品价值形态出现（Reichelt1970, 16）。根据这种“形态分析”，不仅商品、货币、资本等经济类别，法律、国家等政治类别也是表现资本主义社会关系形态的。因此，政治形态规定的分析并不意味着将强制秩序或支配本身作为国家的本质来理解（克尔森1929，日文版第1页起）。而是尝试揭示被视为国家内容的阶级统治为何以国家形式出现。这种“形态分析”在马克思主义国家论的传统中通常被误解甚至被批判为一种经济决定论。但是，基于马克思的政治经济批判的意义，实际上应该评价它具有批判经济决定论和“政治的自律性”论的视野。实际上，波森积·吉索普总结了马克思主义国家论争议时，批评了英美地区的官僚主义者和新马克思主义者忽略了导出论争的形态分析（Jessop1990，前言）。"},{"instruction":"请将“「導出論争」は、以上のように『資本論』の新しい読み方に支えられているという理論的な背景にくわえ、戦後西ドイツの政治状況および社会構造を反映した時代的性格をもっている。キリスト教民主・社会同盟(CDU/CSU)のエアハルトが推進した「社会的市場経済」のもとで急速な戦後復興を遂げた西ドイツは、六〇年代に入って奇跡的な高度経済成長を実現する。他方で、社会民主党(SPD)は、五九年に「ゴーデスベルク綱領」を採択し、ブルジョワ的法治国家の肯定など、マルクス主義をいっそう修正して国民政党に転換しており、六六年になると連立政権に参加するに至った。同時期に、西ドイツは戦後はじめて構造的不況に陥ったが、CDU/CSUとSPDの大連立政権は、経済安定成長法や社会保障政策の拡充といった国家介入によって市場を制御し、持続的な経済成長を実現したのである。つまり、オルド自由主義と左派ケインズ主義による「社会国家」政策が成功をおさめたのだ。他方で、六〇年代半ばには、学生運動を中心とする新左翼運動が高揚し、草の根民主主義を掲げる議会外反対派(APO)が勢力を拡大していた。しかし、フランスとは異なり、西ドイツでは六八年の絶頂期においてさえ、学生運動と労働運動の広範な連帯は実現することがなかった。それはひとえに、大連立政権に参加したSPDとナショナルセンターの労働組合が一層結びつきを強化し、労働運動がAPOや学生運動の急進主義から距離をおいたからであった。 さらに、導出論争の実践的背景を考えるうえで重要なのが、SPD内部の青年組織(JUSO)「左派」による戦略論争である(芦田1978)。導出論争が、その抽象的性格ゆえに、現実の運動戦略と切り離して理解される傾向があっただけに、この点は強調しておく必要がある。六〇年代後半、ドイツ社会主義学生同盟(SDS)を中心とする学生運動が高揚した結果、JUSOではAPOの影響力が高まり、SPD本体よりも急速に左傾化がすすんでいく。その後七〇年代になると、JUSOは主流派(構造改革派)、シュタモカップ(国独資)派、反修正主義派の三つのグループに分岐していく。さらに、JUSOの外部には、東ドイツやドイツ共産党(DKP)を支持するグループや、その多くが「導出論争」に参加した「社会主義ビュロー」といった理論家集団(ヒルシュも在籍)が多数存在していたのである。 したがって、導出論争は、SPD政権による「社会国家」の成立や、議会外の抗議運動の高揚をうけて、そもそも国家が社会主義への構造転換の担い手になれるかどうかをめぐる戦略論争を反映したものであった。そして、七〇年代半ば以降、APO活動家の多くは、市民イニシアティブを結成し、既存の政治組織や教育機関、メディアを横断した「対抗公共空間」を形成するようになる。APO運動は、平和・女性・環境をテーマとする「新しい社会運動」を展開するとともに、八〇年代以降は「緑の党」での活動を通して、これらのテーマを政治システムに取り込んでいった(井関2016,61)。 こうした西ドイツの労働政治と新左翼運動の歴史は、日本において「導出論争」が事実上受容されなかった原因を考察するうえで有益である。たしかに「導出論争」は日本に紹介されたが、実践的意義はまったく理解されなかった。それは、日本のマルクス主義国家論争が、イギリスや西ドイツのそれとは対照的に、戦後日本の労働政治および社会運動から切り離されて展開されたことと無関係ではないだろう。自身も新左翼党派に参加した経験をもつ大藪龍介が総括しているように、日本の大学アカデミズムは「スターリン主義」の一大拠点でもあり、六八年以降の学生運動に呼応して、日本共産党を中心とする「正統」派に対抗して影響力を拡大したのも、概して左翼スターリン主義ないしレーニン主義であった(渡辺ほか編1999)。他方、西ドイツの「導出論争」は、東ドイツをはじめとする「現存社会主義」体制や「マルクス=レーニン主義」を徹底的に批判すると同時に、社会民主党(SPD)の社会国家改良主義を批判する、新左翼運動を反映したものであった。 ”翻译为中文","output":"“导出论争”不仅基于以上所述的《资本论》新阅读的理论背景，也具有反映战后西德政治情况及社会结构的时代性特征。在基社盟（CDU/CSU）的埃尔哈特推动的“社会市场经济”之下，西德快速实现了战后重建，并在60年代实现了奇迹般的高速经济增长。另一方面，社会民主党（SPD）在1959年采纳了“戈德斯贝格纲领”，进一步修正了马克思主义，肯定资产阶级法治国家等，转变为国民政党，到了1966年，SPD甚至参与了联合政府。与此同时，西德首次陷入战后的结构性经济衰退，但CDU/CSU和SPD的大联合政府通过国家干预控制市场、经济稳定增长法和社会保障政策的扩充等措施，实现了持续的经济增长。即，奥尔多自由主义和左翼凯恩斯主义的“社会国家”政策取得了成功。同时，在60年代中期，以学生运动为中心的新左翼运动高涨，以草根民主为旗帜的议会外反对派（APO）扩大了影响力。然而，与法国不同的是，即便在68年的高峰时期，西德的学生运动和工人运动也没有实现广泛的联盟。这完全是因为参加了大联合政府的SPD和国家中心的工会加强了联系，与APO和学生运动的激进主义保持了距离。 在考虑导出论争的实践背景时，SPD内部青年组织（JUSO）的“左翼”战略论争是重要的（芦田1978）。由于其抽象性，导出论争往往被理解为与实际运动战略相脱离，这一点需要强调。在60年代后半，以德国社会主义学生联盟（SDS）为中心的学生运动高涨结果，JUSO受到APO的影响力增强，比SPD本体更快地倾向于左翼。进入70年代后，JUSO分化为主流派（结构改革派）、施塔马赫（国独资）派、反修正主义派三个团体。同时，在JUSO之外，还存在支持东德和德国共产党（DKP）的团体，以及许多参与“导出论争”的理论家集团（包括希尔希），称为“社会主义局”。 因此，导出论争反映了SPD政权形成的“社会国家”和议会外抗议运动高涨的背景下，围绕国家是否能成为社会主义结构转变的承担者的战略论争。70年代中期以后，许多APO活动家开始组成市民倡议组织，形成跨越现有政治组织、教育机构和媒体的“对立公共空间”。APO运动发展了以和平、女性、环境为主题的“新社会运动”，并在80年代通过绿党将这些主题融入政治体系（井关2016，61）。 这一西德的劳工政治和新左翼运动的历史对于考察“导出论争”在日本事实上未被接受的原因是有益的。尽管“导出论争”被引入日本，但其实践意义并未被理解。这可能与日本的马克思主义国家论争与战后日本的劳工政治和社会运动相分离的方式相比，与英国或西德的情况形成鲜明对比。正如有新左翼党派参与经历的大藪龍介总结的那样，日本的大学学术界也是“斯大林主义”的一个大本营，68年以后的学生运动响应中，主要是围绕日本共产党的“正统”派，展开的大多是左翼斯大林主义或列宁主义的影响扩大（渡边等编1999）。另一方面，西德的“导出论争”在批判“现存社会主义”体系和“马克思-列宁主义”的同时，反映了新左翼运动，批判了社会民主党（SPD）的社会国家改良主义。"},{"instruction":"请将“導出論争自体の契機となったのは、七〇年にヴォルフガング・ミュラーとクリステル・ノイジュスが発表した論文「社会国家幻想と資本賃労働の矛盾」である(Müller&Neusüss1970)。彼らの問題意識は、JUSO内部の構造改革派による社会国家改良主義と、東ドイツのシュタモカップ派による国家独占資本主義論(以下、国独資論)を、ともに修正主義であると批判することにあった。第六章で詳述するが、『資本論』「労働日」章における工場法分析に依拠することで、ブルジョワ社会から分離した国家を資本の価値増殖過程の本性から論理的に導出しようとしたのである。つまり、国家の「社会統合機能」を国家に独自な権力からではなく、資本それ自体の矛盾から明らかにすることで、左派の政治中心主義、すなわち社会国家幻想を批判したのであった。 国家独占資本主義論批判 ミュラーとノイジュスは、「マルクスの新しい読み方」潮流の『資本論』解釈に依拠しながら、資本主義社会を構成する「国家形態Staatsform」を明らかにしようとした。こうした国家の形態分析は、導出論争のなかで共通の土台となり、それ以降「生産の一般的物質的条件」(アルトファーター)や「法の一般性」(ブランケら)、「資本主義的搾取関係」(ヒルシュ)といった論点が提出され、「政治的形態規定」の観点から国家論が具体的に展開されることになる(Kostede1976)。論争の個別的論点については、次章以降でとりあげるとして、ここでは論争のモチーフであった国家独占資本主義論にたいする批判を概観しておこう。 そもそも導出論争の形態分析は、その批判対象としての国独資論に多くを負っており、この文脈抜きに論争の意義を理解することはできない。国独資論は、伝統的マルクス主義国家論の道具主義モデルを基礎としているが、それのならず、レーニンの『帝国主義論』以降の独占資本分析を土台としている。帝国主義段階の資本主義においては、独占資本が政治的支配関係と融合した結果、もはや「価値法則」ではなく独占による利潤最大化という「強制」が貫徹することになる(Katzenstein1967,48)。こうして国家は、独占資本の担い手である資本家階級によって活用され、様々なかたちで資本の生産および流通過程に介入する。さらに、戦後の資本主義においては、独占資本の支配が国家を媒介として新たな姿態(国家独占資本主義)をとり、独占資本の個別利害に対して総独占資本の一般的利害がよりいっそう優位になるとされる。戦後のマルクス経済学に大きな影響を与えたバランとスウィージーの『独占資本』もまた、独占資本主義段階においては個別企業の自由競争ではなく、大企業の独占によって価格機構が成立すると述べていた(Baran&Sweezy1966,53-4)。彼らによれば、独占資本主義においては「価値法則」や「利潤率の傾向的低下」法則ではなく、「経済的余剰surplus」や「余剰増加」法則が分析されねばならない。しかし、導出論者にとっての共通了解だが、独占価格の成立や国家介入は、それ自体として価値法則や資本蓄積の一般的法則を止揚するものではない(Funken1973)。こうして、国独資論の道具主義モデルは、単なる経済還元主義であるというよりも、政治的支配の優位すなわち国家の「相対的自律性」を強調する政治中心主義に傾斜するのである。じじつ、当時の西ドイツにおけるシュタモカップ派のなかで、最も影響力のあったカッツェンシュタインは次のように述べている。 じっさい、資本主義の内的機構から生ずる国民所得の分配が、あれこれの形態で国家によって破壊されないような国民経済の領域、そして、資本の価値増殖条件が国家権力によって設定されないような領域は、今日もはや存在しない。資本関係の観点からみると、利潤の領有および分配の機構に新しい契機が入りこんでいるのであり、それが経済外的暴力なのである。国家は今や搾取過程において直接的に機能している。この過程における独占という経済的権力は、国家によって設定される独占条件によって補完されるのである。(Katzenstein1973,12) ”翻译为中文","output":"“导出论争”本身的契机是1970年沃尔夫冈·米勒和克里斯特尔·诺伊斯提出的论文“社会国家幻觉与资本雇佣劳动矛盾”（Müller&Neusüss1970）。他们的问题意识在于批评JUSO内部的结构改革派所主张的社会国家改良主义和东德的施塔马赫派所主张的国家垄断资本主义论（以下简称“国垄资论”）均为修正主义。我们将在第六章详细讨论，但他们试图基于《资本论》“工作日”章节中的工厂法分析，从资本的价值增殖过程的本质出发，逻辑地导出与资产阶级社会分离的国家。也就是说，他们试图通过揭示国家的“社会整合功能”不是来自国家自身的权力，而是来自资本本身的矛盾，批判左翼的政治中心主义，即社会国家的幻想。 国家垄断资本主义论批判 米勒和诺伊斯依据“马克思新阅读”潮流对《资本论》的解释，试图阐明构成资本主义社会的“国家形式Staatsform”。这种对国家形式的分析成为导出论争的共同基础，并在此基础上提出了“生产的一般物质条件”（阿尔特法特）、“法的普遍性”（布兰克等人）、“资本主义剥削关系”（希尔什）等论点，并从“政治形式规定”的角度具体展开国家论(Kostede1976)。关于争论的具体论点，我们将在后续章节中讨论，这里先概述针对国家垄断资本主义论的批判。 导出论争的形式分析，其批判对象是国垄资论，没有这个背景就无法理解争论的意义。国垄资论基于传统马克思主义国家论的工具主义模型，但也基于列宁《帝国主义论》之后的垄断资本分析。在帝国主义阶段的资本主义中，由于垄断资本与政治支配关系的融合，不再是由“价值规律”而是通过强制实现利润最大化(Katzenstein1967,48)。因此，国家被资本家阶级作为垄断资本的工具使用，在多种形式下干预资本的生产和流通过程。另外，战后资本主义中，垄断资本的支配通过国家媒介采取新形态（国家垄断资本主义），独占资本的个别利益相对于总垄断资本的一般利益变得更加优势。巴兰和斯威齐在对战后马克思经济学产生巨大影响的《垄断资本》中也指出，在垄断资本主义阶段，不是通过个体企业的自由竞争，而是通过大企业的垄断形成价格机制(Baran&Sweezy1966,53-4)。他们认为，在垄断资本主义中，不应分析“价值规律”或“利润率的趋势性下降”规律，而应研究“经济剩余surplus”和“剩余增加”规律。然而，对导出论者来说的共识是，垄断定价的形成或国家干预本身并不废止价值规律或资本积累的一般规律(Funken1973)。因此，国垄资论的工具主义模型不仅仅是经济还原主义，而是倾向于强调政治支配优势，即国家的“相对自律性”的政治中心主义。事实上，当时在西德最有影响力的施塔马赫派代表卡策恩斯坦就曾表明： 实际上，资本主义的内在机制产生的国民收入分配，除了各种形式由国家破坏外，在今天的国民经济领域，以及国家权力没有设定资本价值增殖条件的领域实际上已经不存在。从资本关系的角度来看，利润获取和分配机制中介入了新的动因，那就是经济外部的强制。国家现在直接在剥削过程中起作用。这一过程中的经济权力即垄断，由国家设定的垄断条件所补充。(Katzenstein1973,12)"},{"instruction":"请将“国家独占資本主義においては、資本主義の内的メカニズムである「価値法則」そのものが止揚され、独占資本と融合した国家の経済外的暴力が経済的領域において貫徹するという。もっとも、国独資論は、独占資本主義段階において、自由競争が独占によって止揚されるとはいえ、競争それ自体が消失することはないと留保している。しかしながら、競争という強制法則は、あくまでも資本主義的生産様式に内在的な「価値法則」を外的に執行するにすぎない。マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判において、価値法則という内在的法則は、まさしく競争という現象形態をつうじて貫徹するのである。つまり、独占資本が国家介入を要請し、外観上は価値法則が修正されるとしても、資本主義社会システムにおいては依然として競争をつうじて価値法則が貫徹せざるをえないのだ。しかし、国独資論によれば、戦後資本主義においては価値法則が無効化し、それに対応して「政治と経済の分離」もすでに止揚されてしまうという。それに対して、導出論争が課題としたのは、むしろ「価値法則」貫徹する資本主義的生産様式からいわゆる国家独占資本主義の諸現象を説明し、「政治と経済の分離および結合」のあり方を分析することであった。 ところで、導出論争において、アルチュセールやプーランザスが用いた「国家の相対的自律性l'autonomierelative」ではなく、「国家の特殊化Besonderung」という概念が使用される理由は、国独資論が強調する「政治の自律性」を回避するためである(Tristram1974)。第三章で詳しく検討するが、いわゆる国家独占資本主義段階において、国家による市場や再生産過程にたいする介入は、開発援助や所得再分配などの財政政策を中心に様々なかたちで機能していた。しかし、たとえ国家の経済的機能が増大し、それが政治的機能と結合したとしても、この「国家介入」それ自体は、政治と経済の新たな統合次元を意味するのではなく、あくまでも「政治と経済の分離」を前提とした両領域の媒介様式を表現しているにすぎない(Wirth1972,117)。国独資論は、自由主義段階においては政治と経済の分離を認めるが、独占段階においては両者の分離が解消されると主張する。つまり、価値法則が貫徹するという資本主義一般の理念的形態が、資本主義の特定の一段階と混同されてしまうのである(ibid.,24)。この点について、マルクス自身は『資本論』第一巻初版序文において明確に次のように述べている。 資本主義的諸法則の自然諸法則から生じる社会的敵対性の発展程度の高低が、それ自体として問題になるのではない。問題なのは、これらの諸法則そのもの、鉄の必然性をもって作用し自己を貫徹するこれらの諸傾向である。(MEGAII/6,66) それゆえ、いわゆる「段階論」的な資本主義理解はそれ自体として問題とならない。つまり、私たちは、自由主義段階であれ、独占段階であれ、「価値法則」がなおも貫徹する資本主義社会システムにおいて、いかにして「政治と経済の分離および結合」が具体的に作用しているかを把握すべきなのである。たとえ国家介入が増大したとしても、「政治と経済の分離および結合」それ自体は、価値法則が貫徹する資本主義社会システムにおいて絶えず実在的に機能しているのだ。したがって、形態分析の核心は、政治的領域と経済的領域の区分それ自体ではなく、特定の社会関係のもとで両者がどのようにして分離および結合しているのかを把握することなのである。 後期資本主義論批判 「導出論争」は、マルクス主義サークル以外のアカデミズムの文脈においても大きな影響を及ぼし、かたや「導出論争」の当事者たちもそこから多様なアプローチを摂取することになる(影山1974)。じじつ、七〇年にドイツ社会学会の大会において、ハーバーマス批判というかたちで国家論論争が開始され、それ以降は政治学や法学を巻き込み、マルクス主義の文脈をこえて国家機能の増大や政治的正統性といった問題が議論されるようになる。ハーバーマスやオッフェの後期資本主義論をめぐる論争は、当時の西ドイツで、社会国家の拡大をどのように評価するかという政治的対立を反映したものであった。後期資本主義論によれば、戦後の資本主義は、国家介入の結果として自由主義的資本主義から「組織資本主義」へ転化する。伝統的マルクス主義を批判するフランクフルト学派の後期資本主義論が、国独資論と同様に、「政治と経済の分離」を資本主義初期に固有ののして限定的に把握している点は注目に値する。じじつ、ハーバーマスは六〇年代初頭の『公共性の構造転換』において、すでに次のように述べていた。”翻译为中文","output":"在国家垄断资本主义中，资本主义的内在机制即“价值规律”本身被废止，与垄断资本融合的国家通过经济外的暴力在经济领域中实施。尽管，国垄资论保留指出，在垄断资本主义阶段，虽然自由竞争被垄断所废止，但竞争本身并未消失。然而，竞争这一强制规律仅仅是对资本主义生产方式内在的“价值规律”进行外部执行。在马克思的政治经济学批判中，内在规律即价值规律恰恰是通过竞争这种现象形式来实施的。也就是说，尽管垄断资本要求国家介入，外表上似乎修改了价值规律，但在资本主义社会体系中，价值规律仍然不得不通过竞争来实施。然而，按照国垄资论，战后资本主义中价值规律被废止，并且与之相应，“政治与经济的分离”也已被废止。相对而言，导出论争的任务是从遵循“价值规律”的资本主义生产方式说明所谓国家垄断资本主义的各种现象，并分析“政治与经济的分离及结合”的方式。 此外，在导出论争中，使用“国家的特殊化Besonderung”这一概念而非阿尔都塞或普拉扎斯使用的“国家的相对自律性l'autonomierelative”，是为了避免国垄资论强调的“政治自律性”(Tristram1974)。我们将在第三章详细考察，但在所谓的国家垄断资本主义阶段，国家对市场和再生产过程的干预主要以发展援助和收入再分配等财政政策的形式进行。尽管国家的经济功能有所增强，并与政治功能结合，但这种“国家介入”本身并不意味着政治与经济的新的整合维度，而仅仅是以“政治与经济的分离”为前提的两个领域的媒介方式而已(Wirth1972, 117)。国垄资论承认自由主义阶段存在政治与经济的分离，但声称在垄断阶段两者的分离被消除。即，作为资本主义普遍的理想形态的价值规律的贯彻被混同为资本主义的特定阶段(ibid.,24)。对此，马克思自己在《资本论》第一卷初版序言中明确指出了以下观点： 社会敌对性的发展程度高低的来源于资本主义法则的自然法则，并不本身构成问题。问题在于这些法则本身，它们以铁的必然性作用并自行实施(MEGAII/6, 66)。 因此，所谓的“阶段论”式的资本主义理解本身并不构成问题。意思是，无论是自由主义阶段还是垄断阶段，我们都应该理解，“价值规律”仍然在资本主义社会体系中通过“政治与经济的分离及结合”具体地作用。即使国家介入增加，“政治与经济的分离及结合”本身在资本主义社会体系中始终实际上发挥作用。因此，形态分析的核心不是政治领域与经济领域的区分本身，而是在特定社会关系下，两者如何分离和结合的理解。 后期资本主义论批判 “导出论争”不仅对马克思主义圈外的学术界产生了重大影响，而且“导出论争”的参与者也采纳了多样化的方法(影山1974)。事实上，1970年在德国社会学会大会上，以对哈贝马斯的批判为形式开始的国家论争议，此后牵涉到政治学和法学，超越马克思主义的范围，讨论了国家功能增强和政治正当性等问题。围绕哈贝马斯和奥弗的后期资本主义论的争论反映了当时西德对于社会国家扩大的政治对立。按照后期资本主义论，战后的资本主义由于国家介入，从自由主义资本主义转变为“组织资本主义”。批判传统马克思主义的法兰克福学派的后期资本主义论与国垄资论一样，将“政治与经济的分离”视为资本主义早期特有，并将其限定性理解。事实上，哈贝马斯在60年代初的《公共领域的结构转变》中已经提到了。"},{"instruction":"请将“〔一九世紀末の新しい干渉主義以降、〕公的権威が私的領域の中へ拡張される過程には、その反面として、国家権力が社会権力によって代行されるという反対方向の過程も結びついているのである。このように社会の国家化が進むとともに国家の社会化が貫徹するという弁証法こそが、ブルジョア的公共性の土台国家と社会の分離——を次第に取り崩していくものなのである。この両者の間で――いわば両者の「中間から」――成立してくる社会圏は、再政治化された社会圏であって、これを「公的」とか「私的」とかいう区別の見地のみから捉えることは、もはやできなくなっている。(Habermas1962,226) 国家介入が増大した後期資本主義においては、資本主義初期に見られた「政治と経済の分離」という単純な二元主義は否定される。ハーバーマスは、一九世紀後半において、ブルジョワ的私法および自由主義的な憲法解釈が無効化し、国家と社会の分離が克服されていく傾向を、「国家の社会化」および「社会の国家化」と概念化した。彼がこのような考察の手がかりとしたのが、戦前のドイツ国法学においてシュミット学派と社会民主主義者のあいだで展開された憲法論争であった。それは、エルンスト・フォルストホフが指摘したように、法治国家と社会国家が国制の原理として両立しうるのかをめぐるものである(Forsthoff1968)。ハーバーマスは、後期資本主義システムの危機を説明できないという理由で、国独資論と同様に、『資本論』で展開された価値法則がもはや失効していることを強調する。というのも彼によれば、後期資本主義における経済過程は、国家介入の増大によってもはや自動調整的なシステムではなくなり、自由市場における等価交換(資本賃労働関係を含む)という経済的形態を媒介としなくなるからだ(Habermas1973,76)。ハーバーマスによれば、社会国家の諸機能は、資本の内在的運動から導出することはできず、企業の経済活動も国家による政治的制御と結合したものとして理解されなければならない。もっとも彼自身は、国独資論の道具主義モデル、すなわち独占総資本家としての国家概念を実証主義的に退けている。しかし、「社会的市場経済」と「社会国家」のもとでは、経済システムにおける価値法則が否定され、そ対応して「政治と経済の分離」が止揚されるという点で、国独資論と意見を共にするのである。 オッフェも同様に、後期資本主義においては、社会にたいする「包括的な国家規制」が不可避となり、伝統的マルクス主義の「土台-上部構造論」が想定した「政治と経済の分離」が止揚されると主張する。国家介入が増大した後期資本主義においては、政治的領域から分離した純粋な経済的領域を想定することはできず、社会的および経済的過程にたいする恒常的な国家規制が問題となる。そしてオッフェは、国家の制御能力が資本主義の経済法則をある程度安定化させることを認める。そのうえで、国家や政治システムの内的構造によって、後期資本主義においては新たに「政治的正統性」の危機が生じると主張する(星野1982)。こうしてオッフェは、伝統的マルクス主義の経済還元主義を批判し、政治システムの内的構造を新たに「選択メカニズム」として定式化するのである。 それゆえ、影響力理論〔伝統的マルクス主義の道具主義的国家論のこと〕による議論の道筋は、どのようにして影響力行使の成果が構造的に保証されるのかについての理論的考察によって補足されなければならない。[…]「資本主義国家」ないし「理念的総資本家」について語ることができるのは、政治的な諸制度システムが価値増殖過程の諸利害に照応する固有の階級的選択作用を示すことが首尾良く証明された場合に限られるのだ。(Offe1972,73f) ”翻译为中文","output":"自19世纪末新干预主义以来，公权力扩展到私人领域的过程中，与之相对的是，国家权力被社会力量替代的反向过程也紧密相连。正是这种社会向国家化发展的同时国家向社会化贯彻的辩证法，逐渐瓦解了资产阶级公共性的基础——国家与社会的分离。在这两者之间——可以说是从“两者中间”——形成的社会领域，是一个重新政治化的社会领域，用“公共”或“私人”这样的区分视角来理解它，已经变得不再可能（Habermas 1962,226）。 在增加了国家介入的后期资本主义中，资本主义早期所呈现的“政治与经济分离”的简单二元论被否定。哈贝马斯从19世纪后半叶开始，资产阶级私法和自由主义宪法解释失效，国家和社会的分离被克服的趋势中，概念化了“国家的社会化”和“社会的国家化”。他将这种考察的线索基于战前德国宪法学中发展的、介于学派和社会民主主义者之间的宪法论争。正如恩斯特·福斯托霍夫指出的那样，法治国家与社会国家是否能作为国制的原则并存（Forsthoff 1968）。哈贝马斯强调，由于后期资本主义制度的危机无法被解释，他同样强调，与国垄资论一样，《资本论》中展开的价值法则已经失效。因为他认为，在后期资本主义中的经济过程，由于国家介入的增加，已经不再是一个自调节的系统，不再通过自由市场中的等价交换（包括资本雇佣劳动关系）这种经济形态来中介（Habermas 1973, 76）。哈贝马斯认为，社会国家的各种功能不能从资本的内在动态中导出，企业的经济活动也必须被理解为与国家的政治控制相结合的。尽管他本人实证地拒绝了国垄资论的工具主义模型，即作为独占总资本家的国家概念。但在“社会市场经济”和“社会国家”之下，经济系统中的价值法则被否定，并且相应地，“政治与经济的分离”也被废止，这一点上，他与国垄资论持相同意见。 奥弗同样认为，在后期资本主义中，面对社会的“全面性国家规制”变得不可避免，传统马克思主义所设想的“政治与经济的分离”被废止。随着国家介入的增加，不再能假设与政治领域分离的纯粹经济领域，而社会和经济过程需要进行持续的国家规制成为问题。奥弗承认国家的控制能力在一定程度上稳定了资本主义的经济法则。基于此，他主张，在后期资本主义中，国家或政治系统的内部结构导致了“政治正当性”的新危机（星野 1982）。因此，奥弗批判了传统马克思主义的经济还原主义，并新定义了政治体系内部的“选择机制”。 因此，影响力理论（传统马克思主义的工具主义国家论）的讨论路径必须通过对影响力成果如何被结构性地保证的理论考察来补充。[…]只有在政治制度体系显示出与资本增值过程的利益相对应的固有的阶级性选择作用被成功证明时，我们才能讨论“资本主义国家”或“理想的总资本家”（Offe 1972, 73f）。"},{"instruction":"请将“ここでのオッフェによる伝統的マルクス主義批判は全くもって正しい。導出論争の当事者たちは、この点に同意しつつも、オッフェ自身が「国家の形態」という問題構成を軽視していると批判する。というのも、オッフェのシステム論はポリティカル・エコノミー批判の意義を理解していないため、資本主義的再生産過程の素材的な側面(「生産の一般的諸条件」のこと)を捨象してしまっているからだ(Kaiser1977,956)。たとえばオッフェは、インフラストラクチャーといった使用価値の生産が個別資本ではなく国家機構によって提供・組織される結果、国家はその政治的制御力を維持するために、価値増殖過程を補完する限りで使用価値を生産するという自らの傾向を侵害すると主張する。第三章で詳述するが、オッフェの議論には資本の価値増殖によって素材的な再生産過程が攪乱されるという形態分析は見られない。つまり、後期資本主義においては、資本を主体とするのではなく国家を主体とする社会システム分析が要求されるというわけである。オッフェの理論枠組みでは、後期資本主義における危機の傾向は、経済システムから行政システムに移転するのであり、資本の価値増殖過程と国家による使用価値生産(インフラ供給等)とは「共生」することなく、後者が前者に「寄生的に自立化する」という(Offe1972,56)うして国家の制御能力の限界は、資本主義的生産様式の価値法則から論理的に導出されるのではなく、国家それ自体の内部構造に求められることになるのだ。ここには「政治の他律性」という導出論争の問題構成は存在しえない。 とはいえ、オッフェの脱商品化論は、「導出論争」との関係において、そして第六章で見る「ラディカルな改良主義」という変革戦略を考察するうえで重要である。オッフェによれば、後期資本主義において国家は資本の生産および流通過程に介入しなければならないが、このように資本の要請にしたがって商品形態を普遍化する介入が、逆に脱商品化した領域を生み出すというのである。こうして、国家の社会政策によって多くの社会的機能領域が市場から切断されるようになると、行政システム内部の非合理性が増大し大衆からの忠誠を引き出せなくなるため、政治的な正統性危機が生じる(星野1992,67)。オッフェは、八〇年代になると、ポランニーの「擬制商品」という概念を引き合いにだしながら、国家の社会政策によって脱商品化した領域こそが労働力の商品化の前提条件であると主張するようになる。この点については、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判の観点から「社会国家」の可能性と限界を展開する第六章で詳述しよう。 近年でもシュトレークが批判しているように、オッフェの後期資本主義論は、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー 批判を放棄してしまうことで、正統性危機を自ら引き起こしうる社会的権力としての資本を軽視してしまった(Streeck2013,66)。しかも、八〇年代以降、オッフェ自身の政治的危機論は、導出論争当時よりもいっそう「経済還元主義」を克服していくとされる(田村2002,60)。つまり、私たちからすれば「政治の自律性」というテーゼにますます固執するようになるのだ。ただし、当時の論争において、オッフェのシステム論がブランケやヒルシュといった論者に大きな影響を与えたことは注目すべきである。特に、国家行動の「システム限界」という概念は、国家の機能あるいは活動領域が、相対的な自律性を獲得しうるとはいえ、究極的には資本の生産および蓄積過程や階級的力関係に制約されざるをえないということを示唆していた。導出論争の当事者たちは、この「システム限界」を、伝統的マルクス主義の階級還元論でも、オッフェのように後期資本主義の政治システム内部の矛盾でもなく、あくまでも総体としての資本主義社会システムの矛盾から導出しようとしたのである。 ”翻译为中文","output":"这里的奥弗对传统马克思主义的批判是完全正确的。导出论争的参与者们在同意这一点的同时，却批评奥弗自己忽视了“国家形式”这一问题构成。因为奥弗的系统论没有理解政治经济批判的意义，从而忽略了资本主义再生产过程的物质方面（指的是“生产的一般条件”）（Kaiser1977,956）。例如，奥弗认为，由于基础设施等使用价值的生产不是由个别资本而是由国家机构提供和组织，国家为了维持其政治控制力，会在补充价值增殖过程的范围内生产使用价值，从而侵犯其自身的倾向。第三章将详细讨论，但奥弗的论述中没有看到通过资本的价值增殖扰乱物质再生产过程的形态分析。也就是说，在后期资本主义中，需要以国家为主体而不是以资本为主体的社会系统分析。在奥弗的理论框架中，后期资本主义的危机趋势从经济系统转移到行政系统，国家通过增殖价值生产使用价值（如供应基础设施），“寄生性自立化”而不是与首者“共生”（Offe1972,56）。这就显示，国家的控制能力的限制不是从资本主义生产方式的价值法则逻辑地导出，而是在国家自身的内部结构中找到。这里不存在导出论争所构建的“政治的他律性”问题。 不过，奥弗的去商品化论，在与“导出论争”的关系中，以及在分析第六章中将要探讨的“激进改良主义”变革策略时，具有重要性。奥弗认为，在后期资本主义中，国家必须介入资本的生产和流通过程，但是根据资本的要求普遍化商品形式的介入，反过来产生了去商品化的领域。如此，国家社会政策导致许多社会功能领域被市场切断，由于行政系统内部的非理性增加，无法吸引大众的忠诚，因此导致政治正当性危机（星野1992,67）。到了80年代，奥弗引用波兰尼“虚拟商品”概念，声称国家社会政策产生的去商品化领域正是劳动力商品化的前提条件。这一点将在第六章详述，从马克思的政治经济批判视角探讨“社会国家”的可能性及其局限。 如近年来施特雷克所批评的那样，奥弗的后期资本主义论因放弃了马克思的政治经济批判，而忽视了作为社会力量的资本可能自行引发正当性危机（Streeck2013,66）。而且从80年代起，奥弗自身的政治危机论被认为更进一步克服了“经济还原主义”（田村2002,60）。这意味着我们更坚持“政治的自律性”论点。然而，值得注意的是，在当时的争论中，奥弗的系统论对布兰克、希尔什等人产生了重大影响。尤其是，国家行为的“系统限界”概念暗示了国家的功能或活动领域，尽管可能获得相对自律性，但最终受到资本的生产和积累过程以及阶级力量关系的约束。导出论争的参与者试图从作为整体的资本主义社会系统的矛盾中导出这种“系统限界”。"},{"instruction":"请将“西ドイツの「導出論争」は、英米圏でも受容され、北米ではオコンナーを中心として、ドイツやイタリア、ギリスの研究者を編集委員とする『キャピタリスティト』という雑誌が刊行された(SanFranciscoBayAreaKapitalistateGroup1973)。日本でも田口や加藤が「国家論のルネサンス」の括りにおいて「ミリバンド=プーランザス」論争とともに「導出論争」を精力的に紹介していた。しかし、八〇年代にはいってマルクス主義国家論争は急速に衰退していくことになる。じじつ、冷戦崩壊後の九〇年代に、ホロウェイやボネフェルトを中心とする「開かれたマルクス主義OpenMarxism」が反グローバリゼーション運動や反資本主義運動といった新たな「階級闘争」の高揚をうけて論争の復活を主張するまで、導出論争はほとんど顧みられることはなかった。プーランザスをはじめとするネオ・マルクス主義の「国家の相対的自律性」論は、その後「国家の歴史社会学」などに引き継がれていったが、導出論争の形態分析は、『資本論』の抽象的カテゴリーをこねくり回しただけの洗練された経済決定論であるとして、忘却されてしまったのである。しかしながら、政治学や社会学でクリシェとなっている経済主義批判をおこなう論者は、経済分析に深く立ち入ることなく、その時々の資本主義の動態や発展段階を国家の介入度合に応じてラベリングすることに終始する傾向にある。マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判の観点から国家を含む総体としての資本主義社会システムを分析するというアプローチは、ごく一部の理論家たち(ヒルシュやホロウェイ)をのぞいて現在でもほとんど理解されていない。 確かに日本のマルクス主義政治理論においても少なからず「導出論争」が紹介されてきたが、すでに見たように西ドイツのような実践的文脈が欠落していたため、その問題構成の核心が把握されることはなかった。じじつ、パシュカーニスが強調した法=権利の形態分析は、マルクス主義法学の先行研究において法の階級性を否定した見解として過小評価された(森下2014)。つまり、「形態規定」を基軸として国家批判を展開する形態分析の意義が看過されたのである。また、マルクス経済学の分野でも、国家独占資本主義論が主流ではあったが、宇野派の一部には伝統的マルクス主義の階級国家論を批判する動きもあった。つまり、純粋資本主義としての「経済過程の自律性」を重視し、「導出論争」と同様に、『資本論』から国家概念を「導出」したのである。しかし、「資本主義国家」の本質は、形式的な法人格上の意識形態である純粋上部構造、すなわち「法治国家」と規定されるにすぎない(村上1987,第3章)。結局のところ、宇野経済学の国家論においても、伝統的マルクス主義と同様に、「政治」と「経済」の純粋かつ形式的な分離のみが問題化され、両者の「結合」様式を捉えることができないのである。そもそも導出論争の課題は、『資本論』の新しい読み方とパシュカーニスの法学批判に依拠することで、伝統ルクス主義の機械論的「土台-上部構造論」と階級論モデルを批判することにあった。たんに「階級支配の暴力装置」として国家を理解するだけでは、階級発生後の文明社会における国家一般と、ブルジョワ社会に対応する近代国家とを峻別することはできない。近代国家は、「階級支配の暴力」そしてこの規定の延長線上にある「階級的力関係の物質的凝縮」(プーランザス)としてではなく、まずもって資本主義社会において政治的支配関係が受けとる独自の社会的形態、すなわち「資本主義の政治的形態」として理解されなければならないのだ。イタリア出身の政治理論家であるヨハネス・アニョーリはこの点を明快に論じた人物である。つまり、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判の核心にある「形態規定」に依拠することではじめて、資本主義社会における様々な国家のタイプがいずれも「資本の国家」であることが示され、「資本と国家との構造的な等価関係」が問題化されるといだ(Agnoli1995,16ff)。このように、形態分析は、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判の観点から国家批判を志向することで、国独資論や後期資本主義論の段階論および政治中心主義を批判することができる。要すに、単に政治と経済の分離を資本主義初期に限定することなく、資本主義社会システム一般における「政治と経済の分離および結合」のあり方を資本主義的生産関係から論理的に導出しようとしたのである。ホロウェイとピチョットは、こうした「導出論争」の主題を次のように要約している。”翻译为中文","output":"西德的“导出论争”在英美圈也得到了接纳，在北美以奥康纳为中心，发行了编辑委员会包括德国、意大利、英国研究人员的杂志《资本家国家》（San Francisco Bay Area Kapitalistate Group 1973）。在日本，田口和加藤在“国家论的文艺复兴”框架下积极地介绍了“米利班德=普拉扎斯”争论以及“导出论争”。然而，进入80年代，马克思主义国家论争议迅速衰退。事实上，直到90年代冷战崩溃后，以霍洛威和博内费尔特为中心的“开放式马克思主义OpenMarxism”，在新的“阶级斗争”如反全球化运动和反资本主义运动高涨的背景下，主张论争复兴，导出论争才重新受到关注。普拉扎斯等新马克思主义者提出的“国家相对自律性”论随后转移到了“国家的历史社会学”等领域，但导出论争的形态分析因被认为仅是搅拌了《资本论》的抽象范畴的精炼经济决定论，而遭到忽视。然而，在政治学和社会学中，经济主义批判成为老生常谈的论者，往往没有深入经济分析，只是根据国家介入程度对资本主义的动态和发展阶段进行标签化。从马克思的政治经济批判角度分析包括国家在内的整个资本主义社会系统的方法，除了少数理论家（如希尔什或霍洛威）外，至今几乎没有得到理解。 的确，在日本的马克思主义政治理论中也曾介绍过“导出论争”，但如同我们已经看到的，缺乏像西德那样的实践性背景，因此其问题构成的核心未被理解。事实上，帕什卡尼斯强调的法律=权利的形态分析，在马克思主义法学的先行研究中被作为否定法律阶级属性的观点而低估（森下2014）。换句话说，基于“形态规定”展开国家批判的形态分析的意义被忽视了。在马克思经济学领域，尽管国家垄断资本主义论占主流，但宇野派的一部分人士也存在批判传统马克思主义的阶级国家论的动向。即重视作为纯粹资本主义的“经济过程的自律性”，并与“导出论争”相似，从《资本论》中“导出”国家概念（村上1987，第3章）。归根结底，宇野经济学的国家论也仅将“资本主义国家”的本质定义为纯粹上层建筑的意识形态即“法治国家”。换言之，宇野经济学的国家论也像传统马克思主义一样，仅将“政治”与“经济”的纯粹且形式上的分离作为问题，未能把握两者的“结合”方式。导出论争的任务在于依托《资本论》新阅读和帕什卡尼斯的法学批判，批判传统马克思主义机械性的“基础-上层建筑论”和阶级论模型。仅将国家理解为“阶级支配的暴力装置”无法区分文明社会中产生阶级后的一般国家与对应于资产阶级社会的现代国家。现代国家不应仅被视为“阶级支配的暴力”以及这一规定的延伸即“阶级力关系的物质凝结”（普拉扎斯），而应首先被理解为资本主义社会中政治支配关系采取的独特社会形式，即“资本主义的政治形式”。来自意大利的政治理论家约翰内斯·阿尼奥利就这点进行了明确的论述。即仅凭借对政治经济批判核心“形态规定”的依赖，才能表明资本主义社会中的各种国家类型都是“资本的国家”，并将“资本与国家的结构性等价关系”问题化（Agnoli 1995, 16ff）。这样，形态分析能够通过致力于从马克思的政治经济批判视角进行国家批判，批判国垄资论和后期资本主义论的阶段论以及政治中心主义。简言之，不仅将政治和经济的分离限定在资本主义早期，而是从资本主义生产关系逻辑地导出资本主义社会系统一般中的“政治与经济的分离及结合”的方式。霍洛威和皮奇奥托就是这样概括“导出论争”的主题的。"},{"instruction":"请将“一方で国家介入主義的な政策が極めて疑問視され、他方で西ヨーロッパ諸国において共産主義政党が台頭したような時代においては、国家行動の限界に関するすべての問題が極めて重要であった。すなわち、一方で資本の問題を解決する国家能力の限界と、他方で社会主義への移行において 国家を利用する可能性の限界である。(Holloway&Picciotto1978) したがって、資本の問題を解決しうる国家介入の可能性のみならず、むしろその解決能力の限界、そして変革戦略における国家活動の限界を問題にすること、これこそが私たちの擁護したい「政治の他律性」の意味なのである。導出論争に課せられたのは、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判の延長線上で国家批判を展開するという理論的試みだけではなかった。つまり、資本主義社会から共産主義社会への移行をどのように把握するかという実践的な課題である。じじつ、いち早く形態分析の観点から法学批判を展開したパシュカーニス自身が、エンゲルスやレーニンとは違った視角から「国家死滅」のテーゼを新たに定式化し、革命後のソビエト社会を理論的に位置づけていた。パシュカーニスによれば、「国家権力は階級分裂がなくなってからも、しばらくのあいだ残る」(Paschukanis2003,54.)。しかし、これは伝統的マルクス主義の階級国家論とは異なる意味においてである。つまり、国家が残存するのは、過渡期社会においてプロレタリアートによる「階級支配」が必要だからという理由ではない。というのも「法と国家は[・・・]等価関係の形態が完全にとりのぞかれるときに止揚する」からである。こうした「法死滅」テーゼは、ラートブルフらによって、「階級歴史貫通」的な法=権利形態)を無視しているとして度々非難され誤解される傾向にあった(Radbruch1930)。しかし、ネクトが指摘したように、パシュカーニスにとっても共産主義社会への過渡期において法=権利形態が直ちに止揚されるわけではない。「人間たちの自己管理によっていまだ統治されていない社会では、法=権利形態およびそれに基礎づけられた制度や規範が通用し続ける。それは、労働が何らかの形態での労働強制として存続し、したがって労働がいまだ人間の第一の生活欲求になっていない限りにおいてである」(Negt1975,21)。じじつ、パシュカーニスは、スターリン以降の「一国社会主義論」とは異なり、マルクスの『ゴータ綱領批判』にもとづいてソビエト社会の資本主義的性格を強調していた。つまり、過渡期社会においては、依然として商品交換にもとづく価値法則とそれを補完する法=権利・国家形態が残存することを強調したのである。 それゆえ、パシュカーニスによれば、レーニンの「生産手段の国有化」論が想定していたように、国家によって共産主義社会への移行が実現されることはない。アソシエイトした生産関係によって商品交換を廃棄することなしに国家を死滅させることはできないのだ。ところが、パシュカーニスの先駆的な国家形態論は、すでに彼の存命中においてもスターリン主義によっていっそうドグマ化した階級国家論によって転向を迫られ、粛清後は、伝統的マルクス主義の権力作用によって階級対立を隠蔽する理論として過小評価されてきた。そのなかで、例外的にパシュカーニスの階級国家論批判を再評価したのが「マルクスの新しい読み方」潮流である。西ドイツの「導出論争」は、西側の社会国家体制のみならず、東ドイツをはじめとする「現存社会主義」体制を批判し、アソシエーションが未形成のなかでは国家に主導された共産主義社会への移行には限界があることを示したといえる。すでに見たように、導出論争の理論的背景としては、当時の先進資本主義国において、増大する国家介入によって成立した国家独占資本主義あるいはケインズ主義的福祉国家をどのように評価するかという政治的対立があった。しかし、導出論争に共通する形態分析は、ミュラーとノィジュスの修正主義批判に見られるように、たんに社会国家の限界を指摘したにとどまらない意義がある。詳しくは第六章で展開するが、近年のホロウェイやヒルシュは、いわばラディカルな修正主義として、「形態規定」を重視する観点から社会国家の脱商品化的性格を「国家を社会に従属する」過程の一部として位置づけた。この点は、パシュカーニスの法学批判の実践的背景、すなわち共産主義社会への移行において国家を活用することなく、商品の等価交換にもとづく価値法則とそれを補完する法=権利形態とをいかにして変革するのかという問題と密接に関係している(Paschukanis2003,55)。”翻译为中文","output":"在一方国家干预主义政策受到极度怀疑的情况下，另一方面共产党在西欧各国崛起的时代背景下，所有关于国家行动限制的问题都显得极为重要。即一方面是国家解决资本问题能力的限制，另一方面是在向社会主义转型中利用国家的可能性的限制。(Holloway&Picciotto1978) 因此，不仅是国家干预解决资本问题的可能性，更是这种解决能力的限制，以及变革战略中国家行动的限制，这才是我们所要捍卫的“政治的他律性”的意义。导出论争的任务不仅是在马克思的政治经济批判延伸线上开展国家批判的理论尝试。实际上，它是一个实践性的问题，即如何理解资本主义社会向共产主义社会的转变。帕什卡尼斯自己，从恩格斯和列宁不同的视角，对“国家消亡”论重新提出了界定，并将革命后的苏维埃社会理论定位。帕什卡尼斯认为，“国家权力即使在阶级分裂消失后，也会存留一段时间”(Paschukanis2003,54)。但这与传统马克思主义的阶级国家论有着不同的含义。也就是说，国家的存留并不是因为过渡期社会中需要无产阶级的“阶级统治”，而是因为“法和国家将在……等价关系的形式完全消除时被废止”。这种“法的消亡”论曾被拉德布鲁赫等人因忽视了“阶级历史穿透”的法=权利形态而多次批评和误解(Radbruch1930)。然而，正如内克特所指出的，帕什卡尼斯也认为，在共产主义社会的过渡期，并非法=权利形态会立即被废止。“在尚未由人类自我管理的社会中，法=权利形态及其基础的制度和规范仍将继续存在。只要劳动以某种形式的劳动强制继续存在，因此劳动尚未成为人类的首要生活需求，则如是”(Negt1975,21)。实际上，帕什卡尼斯强调了苏联社会的资本主义特征，而不是像斯大林后期的“一国社会主义论”，是基于马克思的《哥达纲领批判》。也就是说，在过渡期社会中，依然存在基于商品交换的价值法则及其补充的法=权利・国家形态。 因此，按照帕什卡尼斯的观点，国家无法实现列宁所设想的通过“生产手段的国有化”论实现向共产主义社会的转变。没有废除商品交换的联合生产关系就无法使国家消亡。然而，帕什卡尼斯的开创性国家形态论在他生前就被斯大林主义转向更为教条化的阶级国家论所逼迫，并在清洗后被传统马克思主义以掩盖阶级对立的权力论所低估。在这种情况下，例外地重新评价了帕什卡尼斯的阶级国家批判的是“马克思新阅读”潮流。西德的“导出论争”批判了西方的社会国家体制以及东德等“现行社会主义”体制，表明在联合尚未形成的情况下，国家主导的共产主义社会转型存在限制。如我们所见，导出论争的理论背景是当时在先进资本主义国家中，如何评价由国家介入加剧而形成的国家垄断资本主义或凯恩斯主义福利国家的政治对立。然而，导出论争共有的形态分析不仅仅在于指出社会国家的限制，正如米勒和诺伊斯的修正主义批判所示，其意义不止于此。将在第六章展开讨论，但近年来霍洛威和希尔什作为一种激进的修正主义，从重视“形态规定”的角度将社会国家的去商品化特征定位为“国家屈从于社会”的过程的一部分。这一点与帕什卡尼斯的法学批判的实践背景紧密相关，即在向共产主义社会的过渡中，如何在不依靠国家的情况下，废除基于商品等价交换的价值法则及其补充的法=权利形态和国家(Paschukanis2003,55)。"},{"instruction":"请将“他方で、「導出論争」それ自体にも多くの欠点があったのも事実だ。論争の当事者であったヒルシュが総括しているように、導出論争は『資本論』における経済的カテゴリーからの国家の論理的導出に終始したために、何よりも歴史的感覚が欠如していた(八木1975)。つまり、歴史的闘争とそれに伴う実践の結果としてではなく、資本主義の機能にとっての必要性としてのみ国家を把握したのであった(Gerstenberger1973)。確かに当時の論争においては、前資本主義社会についての「歴史的考察」をふまえたうえで資本主義社会に固有な「政治と経済の分離および結合」を把握するのではなく、両者の機能的分離をすでに前提にして議論する傾向があったことは否めない(Esser(Esser1975,149)。この点が、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判やその形態分析に疎い論者によって、資本主義の発展段階や動態を無視した経済決定論の一種として批判されたのである。八〇年代以降にアメリカを中心に発展した「国家の歴史社会学」も、(導出論争を含む)ネオ・マルクス主義国家論は資本主義社会を機能させる限りで国家を論じているにすぎず、国家それ自体の論理を明らかにしていないと指摘している。一見すると、形態分析は、経済決定論を批判しながらも、経済主義を免れていないという自己撞着を起こしているように思われるかもしれない。しかし実際には、伝統的マルクス主義の経済主義・階級還元論モデル、そして国独資論などの政治中心主義を批判すると同時に、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判の延長線上で国家批判を展開したのである。度々強調してきたように、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判の核心は、「マルクス経済学」に見られる狭義の経済分析ではなく、国家を構成要素とする資本主義社会システム総体を把握することにあったのだ。 この意味で、ヒルシュが強調したように、「国家の導出」は完成した国家論ではなく、国家批判の基本的な出発点にすぎないといえよう(Hirsch2005,25)。近代国家は、たんに価値法則の次元で抽象的に把握されるのではなく、社会システムにおいて支配的ではない生産関係を考察するための歴史的展開、賃労働資本関係や蓄積過程における階級的支配関係の貫徹、そして社会的力関係が凝縮した政治的諸制度などを考慮した上で、具体的に分析されなければならない。ヒルシュ自身は論争後に、プーランザスの国家論やレギュラシオン理論などを摂取することで、唯物論的国家批判をさらに展開していくことになる。また、論争当時にブラウンミュールが強調していたように、マルクスのポリティカル・エコノミー批判は、国家批判を媒介として最終的には世界市場を分析するものであった。アルトファーターをはじめ初期の導出論争では、『資本論』第一巻の貨幣章を基礎として当時の世界通貨危機を分析するという希有な試みがあったものの(Alrvater1969)、特に「帝国主義」の新たな形態に関する分析は先送りされる傾向があった。第七章で詳しく検討するが、従属論や世界システム論のように、諸国家システムを加味したうえで、ネイションを横断した資本主義世界システム総体を分析するまでに至らず、グローバル化が進展した現代における主権国家体制の再編といった新たな歴史的発展の重要性をつかめなかったのである。とはいえ、次章以降で明らかになるように、資本主義国家の経済的・政治的機能の具体的分析や、ナショナリズムやレイシズムといった政治的現象、資本主義世界システムにおけるヘゲモニー国家の変遷などを分析するためには、導出論争で明らかとなった「資本主義の政治的形態」を理解することが不可欠である。いわゆる経済決定論を回避しながらも、長期停滞期の資本主義経済を分析し、かつ資本主義社会システムを総体として分析するためには、形態分析が賭け金となる。言うならば、唯物論的国家批判こそが、経済決定論を回避しながら経済システムを分析する回路を開くと同時に、国家(政治)中心主義に陥ることなく、社会的な制度や力関係を考慮した政治システム(体制)を把握することができるのだ。 ”翻译为中文","output":"另一方面，“导出论争”自身也确实存在许多缺陷。正如参与论争的希尔什总结的那样，导出论争因始终从《资本论》中的经济范畴对国家进行逻辑导出，而缺乏历史感觉（八木1975）。也就是说，导出论争理解国家不是作为历史斗争及其伴随的实践结果，而仅作为资本主义功能的必要性（Gerstenberger1973）。的确，当时的争论，而不是基于对前资本主义社会的“历史考察”来理解资本主义社会特有的“政治与经济的分离及结合”，而是趋向于预设两者的功能性分离来进行讨论（Esser 1975, 149）。这一点，被对马克思的政治经济批判及其形态分析不甚了解的评论者批评为一种忽视资本主义发展阶段和动态的经济决定论。80年代以后在美国中心发展的“国家的历史社会学”也指出，（包括导出论争在内的）新马克思主义国家论仅就维持资本主义社会运转的角度讨论了国家，而没有明确国家自身的逻辑。乍看之下，形态分析似乎落入了一种自相矛盾，批判经济决定论的同时，自己也未能避免经济主义。然而实际上，导出论争在批判传统马克思主义的经济主义/阶级还原论模型以及国垄资论等政治中心主义的同时，在马克思的政治经济批判延伸线上开展了国家批判。正如我们一直强调的，政治经济批判的核心不是狭义的经济分析，而是理解将国家作为组成要素的资本主义社会系统的整体。 在这个意义上，正如希尔什所强调的，“国家的导出”并不是完成的国家论，而只是国家批判的基本出发点（Hirsch 2005, 25）。现代国家不应仅在价值法则的维度上抽象地理解，而应该考虑到在社会系统中并非占主导地位的生产关系的历史发展、工资劳动资本关系和积累过程中的阶级支配关系的贯彻，以及社会力关系凝结成的政治制度等方面进行具体分析。希尔什自己在论争之后，通过吸收普拉扎斯的国家论和调节理论等，进一步展开了唯物主义国家批判。此外，正如论争时期布劳恩穆勒强调的那样，马克思的政治经济批判最终是通过国家批判来分析世界市场的。虽然早期导出论争中，以阿尔特法特为首的尝试基于《资本论》第一卷的货币章来分析当时的世界货币危机是一次罕见的尝试（Altvater 1969），但分析“帝国主义”的新形态往往被推迟。第七章将详细探讨，但没有达到考虑诸国家系统，分析资本主义世界系统的整体以及跨越民族国家的全球化进程中主权国家体系的重新组织等新的历史发展的重要性。然而，如后续章节将显示，为了分析资本主义国家的经济和政治功能以及国家主义和种族主义等政治现象、在资本主义世界系统中霸权国家的变迁等，理解在导出论争中所揭示的“资本主义的政治形态”是不可或缺的。避免所谓的经济决定论的同时，分析长期停滞期的资本主义经济并作为整体分析资本主义社会系统，形态分析至关重要。可以说，唯物主义国家批判既打开了分析经济系统的路径，同时允许不陷入国家（政治）中心主义的同时，考虑社会制度和力关系的政治系统（体制）的把握。"},{"instruction":"请将“階級論なき国家批判 マルクスは、一八四三年一〇月にパリでポリティカル・エコノミー研究を開始した直後の『経哲手稿」「序文」、そしてブリュッセル移住後の抜粋ノートにおいて、政治(学)および国民経済学の両体系を批判する構想を書き留めている(柴田1973,60)。MEGA第1部に収録された「一八四四-一八四七年の手帳」には、四四年一一月に執筆された政治(学)批判プランに関する覚書が残されている。 1)近代国家の成立史あるいはフランス革命。 政治制度Wesenの自己顕示。古典古代国家との混同。ブルジョワ社会にたいする革命家たちの関係。ブルジョワ制度と国家制度へのあらゆる要素の二重化。 2)権宣言と国家の憲法。個人的自由と公的権力。 自由、平等および統一。人民主権。 3)国家とブルジョワ社会。 4)代議制国家と憲章。 立憲的代議制国家と民主的代議制国家。 5)権力の分割。立法権力と執行権力。 6)立法権力と諸々の立法団体。諸々の政治クラブ。 7)執行権力。中央集権化とヒエラルヒー。中央集権化と政治的文明化。連邦制度と産業主義。 国家行政と自治体行政。 8)司法権力と法=権利 8)国民性と人民。 g)諸政党。 g)選挙権、すなわち国家とブルジョワ社会の止揚のための闘争。(MEGAIV/3,11) しばしば批判されるように、マルクス自身の政治理論は、一九世紀末にようやく定着したリベラル・デモクラシーの政治システム(代議制、立憲主義など)を本格的に検討したものではない(大藪1996,258;Demirovic1997,Ch.4)。したがって、いわば「憲法論」を構想したようなこの覚書からマルクスの政治(学)批判を再構成することは有意義だと思われるかもしれない。しかし、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判の観点から「国家の導出」を試みる「形態分析」を重視するならば、初期マルクスの政治思想を無批判に考察することは問題含みである。なぜなら、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判から切り離してマルクスの政治理論を再現することは、政治システムそれ自体の分析、すなわち「政治の自律性」という問題構成に陥ってしまうからだ。すでに見たように、このような「政治の自律性」にたいする批判は導出論者たちが共有する問題意識であった。ハインリッヒはさらに議論を進めて、ポリティカル・エコノミー批判と結びついていないために、初期マルクスの国家批判が啓蒙主義的な規範論にとどまっていると指摘している(Heinrich2004,Ch.11)。確かに、初期マルクスの国家批判は、「唯物論的方法」やポリティカル・エコノミー批判を欠いているが、ほんとうに考慮する価値のないものなのだろうか。 エンゲルス以降、伝統的マルクス主義の国家論は、『宣言』や「フランス三部作」の「階級国家論」を重視し、それを「階級歴史貫通」的な国家論へと体系化してきた。一方、マルクス自身は五〇年代以降にポリティカル・エコノミー研究をさらに進展させ、『ニューヨーク・デイリー・トリビューン』紙への寄稿論文などにおいて、ブルジョワ社会が最も発展したイングランドを本格的に分析するようになる。そこでは、産業資本主義の発展にともなう階級対立の激化を反映した、いわゆる「ブルジョワ国家」論が展開されていた(大藪1978,第4章)。しかし、私たちの課題はマルクスにおける階級国家論の形成過程を追跡することではない。むしろ、初期マルクスの政治(学)批判の核心は、階級論なき国家批判にあると思われる。つまり、初期マルクスの国家論は、伝統的マルクス主義が重視する階級国家論がいまだ定式化されていないため、マルクスの国家批判に固有のモチーフである「国家の形態分析」を垣間見ることができるのだ。じじつ、マルクス主義批判者が想定するのとは反対に、そもそも近代社会における階級対立の分析それ自体はマルクスに独自なものではなかった。ヴァイデマイヤーに宛てた一八五二年の手紙において、マルクスは次のように述べている。 ところで私について言えば、近代社会における諸階級の存在を発見したのも、諸階級相互間の闘争を発見したのも、別に私の功績ではない。ブルジョワ歴史家たちが私よりずっと前に、この階級闘争の歴史的発展を叙述したし、ブルジョワ経済学者たちは諸階級の経済的解剖学を叙述していた。私が新たに行ったことは、1諸階級の存在は生産の特定の歴史的発展段階とのみ結びついているということ、2階級闘争は必然的にプロレタリアート独裁に導くということ、この独裁そのものは、一切の階級の廃絶への、階級のない社会への過渡期をなすにすぎない、ということを証明したことだ。(MEGAIII/5,76)”翻译为中文","output":"没有阶级论的国家批判 马克思在1843年10月在巴黎刚开始研究政治经济学之后就在《经济学哲学手稿》“序言”中，以及之后搬迁至布鲁塞尔的摘要笔记中，记录下了批判政治(学)和国民经济学两个体系的构想（柴田1973,60）。收录在MEGA第一部的“1844-1847年的笔记”中，留有1844年11月撰写的关于政治(学)批判计划的备忘录。 1)现代国家的成立史或法国革命。 政治制度本质的自我展示。与古典古代国家的混淆。革命家们与资产阶级社会的关系。资产阶级制度与国家制度中所有要素的双重化。 2)权利宣言和国家宪法。个人自由与公共权力。 自由、平等与统一。人民主权。 3)国家与资产阶级社会。 4)代议制国家与宪章。 宪政代议制国家和民主代议制国家。 5)权力的分割。立法权与执行权。 6)立法权与各立法机构。各政治俱乐部。

经常被批评的是，马克思自己的政治理论并未全面考察最终在19世纪末确立的自由民主的政治体系（例如代议制、宪政主义等）(大藪1996,258;Demirovic1997,Ch.4)。因此，可能会认为按照这份构想的“宪法论”备忘录重构马克思的政治(学)批判是有意义的。然而，如果重视政治经济批判的“形态分析”视角进行“国家的导出”，那么不加批判地考察早期马克思的政治思想就会变得有问题。因为，如果脱离政治经济批判来重构马克思的政治理论，就会陷入针对政治体系本身的分析，即“政治的自律性”的问题构成中。正如我们已经看到的，这种“政治的自律性”的批判是导出论者们共有的问题意识。海因里希进一步讨论指出，由于与政治经济批判相脱离，早期马克思的国家批判停留在启蒙主义的规范论上(Heinrich2004,Ch.11)。确实，早期马克思的国家批判虽缺乏“唯物论方法”和政治经济批判，但真的没有值得考虑的价值吗？ 恩格斯之后，传统马克思主义的国家论强调了《宣言》和“法国三部曲”的“阶级国家论”，并将其体系化为“阶级历史贯彻”的国家论。另一方面，马克思在50年代以后进一步深化了政治经济学研究，在《纽约每日论坛报》等的投稿文章中开始全面分析资产阶级社会发展最成熟的英国。在这里，展开了反映工业资本主义发展伴随的阶级冲突激化的所谓“资产阶级国家”论(大藪1978,第4章)。然而，我们的任务不是追踪马克思阶级国家论的形成过程。相反，早期马克思的政治(学)批判核心似乎在于没有阶级论的国家批判。也就是说，早期马克思的国家论是因为尚未形式化传统马克思主义重视的阶级国家论，因而可以一瞥马克思国家批判固有的动机即“国家形态分析”。实际上，与马克思主义批评者所假定的相反，近代社会中阶级对立的分析本身并非马克思所独有。在1852年写给魏德迈的信中，马克思这样说： 至于我而言，不是我发现了近代社会中的各个阶级的存在，也不是我发现了各个阶级之间的斗争。早在我之前，资产阶级历史学家就已经描绘了这种阶级斗争的历史发展，资产阶级经济学家也描述了各个阶级的经济剖析。我所做的新贡献是，1表明这些阶级的存在仅与生产的特定历史发展阶段相联系，2阶级斗争必然导致无产阶级专政，这种专政本身只是废除一切阶级以及无阶级社会的过渡期，这就是我所证明的。(MEGAIII/5,76)"},{"instruction":"Write really funny super hilarious rude sarcastic sass comedy 17+ thomas transcript based on each of my prompts: Duck works very hard on the Island of Sodor and everything goes smoothly when he is around. He can keep the trucks in line, the coaches quiet and the passengers happy. He is very proud of his Great Western heritage and talks endlessly about it, which irritates the larger engines, who quickly grow tired of hearing about “the Great Western way”. One morning, a visitor arrives. The Fat Controller introduces the new engine as Diesel, stating that he has agreed to give him a trial and tells Duck to show him around and teach him what to do. Diesel introduces himself before heaping compliments on Gordon, James and Henry, who are in awe by his flattery. Duck, however, takes a dislike to Diesel’s oily nature and shows him to the yard, where it becomes apparent that Duck’s dislike of Diesel is mutual as Duck orders Diesel to refer to the Fat Controller as “Sir Topham Hatt” before Diesel smugly tells Duck that he does not have to be taught what to do, saying Diesels know everything and come to a yard to improve it, dubbing himself as “revolutionary”. Duck is not impressed with Diesel’s boasting and orders him to arrange the trucks while he leaves to take Gordon’s coaches to the station. Eager for the chance to show off, Diesel quickly gets to work. When Duck returns, he finds Diesel trying to move some very old, near-derelict trucks with stiff joints and brakes from a siding. Duck decides to let the events play out and watches with interest. Diesel struggles to move the trucks and gets so forceful with them that some of their brakes snap and the gear jams in the sleepers, causing several of the trucks to derail and overturn in the process. Diesel tries to push the remaining trucks back but he still cannot move them and is forced to give up. As Duck finally comes around carrying some other trucks, Diesel asks Duck why he did not tell him about this when he had gone through so much trouble. Duck replies that Diesel never asked him, as he was having fun being “revolutionary”. Duck leaves happily, while Diesel fumes angrily. Diesel is later forced to help the workmen clear the mess, a job that he hates, especially as the trucks have started laughing at it and he hears them singing a degrading song at him too. It grows in loudness, soon echoing throughout the whole yard. Now cross with Duck and the trucks, Diesel storms off to the sheds to sulk when the clean-up is over.","output":"(Scene: Early morning on the Island of Sodor, sun shining, birds chirping, and Duck zooming around with the efficiency of a caffeinated squirrel on payday.)

Sonuçta, doğa hakkında haklı çıkan taraf doğa bilimciler değil sosyal bilimciler oldu. Deney ve gözlem imkanlarının gelişmesiyle birlikte doğa bilimci empristler, 2300 senelik bir gecikmeyle de olsa (materyalist Demokritosun ölümü MÖ 370) atomun varlığını kabul ettiler.","output":"Sorunuzda bahsettiğiniz karşılaşmanın temeli, 19. ve 20. yüzyılın başlarındaki bilimsel ve felsefi paradigma çatışmalarına dayanmaktadır. Bu dönem, pozitivizm, emprio-kritisizm ve diyalektik materyalizm gibi felsefi görüşlerin çarpıştığı ve özellikle doğa bilimleri ile sosyal bilimler arasındaki sınırların yeniden çizilmeye çalışıldığı bir dönemdir. Doğa bilimci empristler (örneğin, Ernst Mach ve Viyana Çevresi gibi) duyumsal verilere dayalı bilgiyi öne çıkarırken, atomlar gibi gözlemlenemeyen entitelerin varlığına şüpheyle yaklaşıyorlardı. Onlar için bilimsel bilgi, deneyimlenebilir ve gözlemlenebilir olaylarla sınırlandırılmıştı ve bu çerçeve dışındaki her türlü iddia, spekülatif ya da metafiziksel kabul ediliyordu. Buna karşın, sosyal bilimci materyalistler (örneğin, Friedrich Engels, Lenin ve diğer Marksist teorisyenler), tarihsel ve materyal koşulların analizini öne çıkararak maddenin varlığını ve değişimini, gözlemlenebilir duyumların ötesinde apriori bir gerçeklik olarak kabul ediyorlardı. Bu düşünce yapısı, doğayı ve toplumu şekillendiren temel yasaları kavramaya yönelikti ve atom gibi temel yapı taşlarının varlığını teorik olarak varsayıyordu. Bu çatışma, bilimsel gelişmeler ve atomun keşfi ile bir çözüme kavuştu. Atomun varlığının deneysel olarak kanıtlanması, pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizmin sınırlarını gösterdi. Doğa bilimlerinde deneysel yöntemler ve teorik fizik geliştikçe, atomlar gibi gözlemlenemeyen ama teorik olarak öngörülen yapıların gerçekliğini ispatlamak mümkün oldu. Bu gelişme, materyalist görüşlerin bazı temel varsayımlarının doğru olduğunu kanıtlar nitelikteydi. Doğa bilimci empristlerin \\"gerisine düşme\\" durumu, belki de onların katı deneysellik ve gözlemlenebilirlik sınırlarına olan bağlılıklarından kaynaklanıyor olabilir. Bilimsel yöntem ve teorik fizikteki ilerlemeler, doğa hakkında daha kapsamlı ve derin bilgilere ulaşmayı mümkün kıldı ve bu, sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin bazı temel kavrayışlarının doğru olduğunu doğruladı. Sonuç olarak, bu tür paradigma çatışmaları ve geçişler bilimin doğası gereği kaçınılmazdır. Bu çatışmalar, bilimsel düşüncenin evrimini teşvik eder ve daha kapsamlı ve doğru anlayışlara yol açar. Atomun varlığının kabul edilmesi, hem doğa bilimlerinde hem de felsefede, gerçekliğin anlaşılmasına yönelik temel bir dönüm noktası olarak değerlendirilebilir."},{"instruction":"перефразируй Live with that carefree spirit you are too often shy to explore by trying out these burgundy hair colors.

These mischievous wagons were relentless, crafting catchy tunes about Diesel's mishaps that even Spotify couldn't compete with. Enter Duck, the peacekeeper, who upon hearing the relentless choir, decided the best course of action was a swift bump to the trucks - a move as effective at silencing them as muting a Zoom call. Feeling somewhat responsible for the commotion, Duck extended his apologies to Diesel, who was as furious as a cat in a bathtub. Diesel, misunderstanding Duck's kindness for mockery, pointed his buffer accusingly, \\"You've made a laughingstock out of me!\\" From a safe distance, Henry, along with James and Gordon, were enjoying the show more than a Netflix binge session. They knew Duck better than anyone and defended his honor. \\"Duck's as innocent as a freshly painted signal box!\\" Gordon exclaimed, puffing out steam with each word. Diesel's gears were grinding with rage. In a plot thickening twist worthy of a telenovela, he decided it was time for Duck to take an unplanned vacation. He spread fake news among the trucks, inventing tales so wild, they made the tabloids look honest. \\"And remember,\\" Diesel mentioned with a sly grin, \\"Duck 'told' you these. My buffers are clean.\\" The trucks, who had the self-control of a toddler with a marker, immediately spread Diesel's fake tales among the engines, implicating Duck as the mastermind behind the name-calling saga.

The accusations flew like confetti at a parade: \\"He called me a Galloping Sausage!\\" Gordon huffed. \\"And me, Rusty Red Scrap Iron!\\" James chimed in, while Henry lamented being dubbed \\"Old Square Wheels.\\" The Fat Controller, struggling to keep a straight face, turned to Duck for his defense. \\"Sir, I swear on my shiny green paint, those words never left my funnel!\\" Duck protested with the sincerity of a saint. Diesel, spotting an opportunity, played the innocent card with the skill of a seasoned poker player, feigning shock at the accusations thrown at Duck.

Edward assures Duck that everything will be alright and suggests helping him with his goods train, which cheers Duck up. The two engines work hard for the whole afternoon to make the noisy trucks behave less silly while taking them up Gordon's Hill. Once at the top, Duck says goodbye to Edward and heads back to the station. As he coasts down the hill and enjoys the breeze, he suddenly hears a guard's whistle. The guard had been knocked out of the brake van, as Edward's trucks have broken away and are racing back towards Duck at breakneck speed, intending to derail him. Duck hurries through Wellsworth, trying his hardest to outrun the trucks but they gradually catch up to him on the viaduct and begin pushing him. Just as they are starting to regain control, Duck and his driver see James ahead on the same track, pulling a passenger train out of Crosby Station. Duck puts all of his weight against the trucks but is unable to stop. He shuts his eyes and prepares for the worst, but gets diverted onto a siding at the last second as James and his coaches have cleared the platform and points. At the end of the siding is a small barbershop. While the barber is shaving a customer, Duck is pushed by the trucks into the end of the siding, comes off the rails and crashes right into the front of the shop, destroying the wall. Some trucks derail as well but pay no attention to this, feeling rather pleased with themselves having successfully derailed Duck, who stares nervously at the crowd in front of him. Duck tries to apologise, but the barber is furious with him for frightening his customers and covers his face with shaving cream. Thomas and Percy both arrive to help clear the mess and soon the Fat Controller comes in to speak with the barber, who is still fuming. The Fat Controller explains that Duck and his crew helped to prevent a much worse accident with James, adding that it was \\"a very close shave\\". The barber quickly washes the lathering off of Duck's face and apologises for misjudging him. Once the trucks have been cleared, Thomas pulls Duck out of the barbershop. The Fat Controller tells Duck that he will be returning to the yard once he is mended. Duck still thinks that the big engines dislike him, but the Fat Controller reveals that he never believed Diesel's lies and sent him away in disgrace; the other engines are now sorry and want Duck to come back. After being mended, Duck returns to the shed and all the other engines welcome him back with happy whistles.","output":"Title: The Great Close Shave [Scene starts with Duck looking disgruntled at Wellsworth Station.

Ezért, ha ismerjük a nullátmenetek időkülönbségét (azaz a bemeneti és kimeneti jel közötti időbeli eltolódást), akkor a fáziskülönbséget a következő képlettel határozhatjuk meg: [φ(f) = 2pi cdot f cdot Delta t] ahol: - (φ(f)) a fáziskülönbség radiánban (rad), - (f) az jel frekvenciája Hz-ben, - (Delta t) a nullátmenetek közötti időkülönbség, azaz a bemeneti és a kimeneti jel közötti késés mértéke ms-ben vagy más időegységben (figyelembe véve az egységátalakítást is). Ha az (Delta t) időkülönbséget millisekundumban (ms) adták meg, akkor arra figyelni kell, hogy a frekvencia Hz-ben van és a számoláshoz az időt másodpercben kell használni. Ezért ha (Delta t) ms-ben van megadva, először át kell váltanod azt másodpercre ((Delta t [s] = Delta t [ms] / 1000)). Példa: Ha a frekvencia 1000 Hz és a nullátmenet időkülönbsége 1 ms, akkor [φ(f) = 2pi cdot 1000 cdot (1/1000) = 2pi cdot 1 = 2pi] rad. Figyelj arra, hogy a számolás során a π értékét és a többi számítást pontosan végezd el, a végleges számoláshoz a pontos számértékeket és matematikai görbületeket használj. Ez a módszer alapvetően arra alapul, hogy a fázistoresség egyenlő az anguláris frekvencia ((2pi cdot f)) és az időtartam ((Delta t)) szorzatával.

Emlékezzünk vissza, hogy a fáziskülönbség (φ(f)) számításának alapját adó képlet a következő volt: [φ(f) = 2pi cdot f cdot Delta t] ahol: - (φ(f)) kifejezi a fáziskülönbséget radiánban, - (f) a jel frekvenciája Hz-ben, - (Delta t) pedig az időkülönbség másodpercben, ami itt az U_be és U_ki jelek nullátmenetének időkülönbségét jelöli. Mivel a feladatod már tartalmaz egy táblázatot, ahol az időkülönbség már meg van adva \\"[s]\\" másodpercben, ezt közvetlenül használhatod a fáziskülönbség kiszámításához az adott frekvencián. **Példa számítás:** Tegyük fel, hogy a táblázatban egy adott frekvenciához tartozóan az időkülönbség 0,001 másodperc (1 ms). A frekvencia pedig 1000 Hz. Ekkor a fáziskülönbség: [φ(f) = 2pi cdot 1000 cdot 0,001 = 2pi cdot 1 = 2pi] rad. Az eredményt radiánban kapjuk, és ez jelzi, hogy az adott frekvencián mennyi a fáziseltolódás a két jel között. Tehát a fázis kiszámításához egyszerűen csak alkalmazd a fent megadott képletet minden egyes frekvencia érték esetén, figyelembe véve a bemeneti és kimeneti jel közötti időkülönbséget.

The concept of the atom has evolved over time from being a solid, indivisible particle to a complex system comprising a nucleus surrounded by electrons in defined orbitals. Here's a detailed breakdown of the modern atomic structure: # Core Components of an Atom: 1. **Protons**: These are positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. The number of protons in the nucleus (atomic number) defines the chemical element (e.g., carbon atoms have six protons). 2. **Neutrons**: Neutrons are electrically neutral particles, also located in the nucleus. Together with protons, they make up the nucleus's mass. The number of neutrons can vary in the atoms of a particular element, leading to different isotopes. 3. **Electrons**: Electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in electron shells or orbitals. The arrangement of electrons determines an atom's chemical properties and reactivity. The number of electrons in a neutral atom equals the number of protons. # Properties of Atomic Particles: - **Mass**: Protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons. They account for nearly all the atom's mass. The mass of a proton or neutron is approximately (1.67 times 10^{-27}) kilograms, while the mass of an electron is about (9.11 times 10^{-31}) kilograms. - **Charge**: The elementary charge (the magnitude of the charge of a proton or electron) is approximately (1.602 times 10^{-19}) coulombs. Protons have a positive charge (+1), electrons have a negative charge (−1), and neutrons have no charge (0). # Atomic Nucleus: The nucleus, composed of protons and neutrons, is the atom's core. It is incredibly dense and holds most of the atom's mass. Despite occupying a very small fraction of the atom's volume, the nucleus contains almost all of its mass. # Electron Configuration: Electrons are distributed in atomic orbitals, which are regions of space around the nucleus where the electrons are likely to be found. These orbitals are organized into different energy levels or shells. The distribution of electrons in an atom's orbitals, known as its electron configuration, follows the Pauli exclusion principle, the Aufbau principle, and Hund's rule: - **The Pauli Exclusion Principle** states that no two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers, essentially meaning that an orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. - **The Aufbau Principle** suggests that electrons fill orbitals starting from the lowest energy level to higher energy levels. - **Hund's Rule** states that electrons will fill degenerate orbitals (orbitals of the same energy) singly as long as possible before pairing up. # Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom: Modern atomic theory is based on quantum mechanics. Unlike the earlier Bohr model that depicted electrons orbiting the nucleus in defined paths (similar to planets orbiting the sun), the quantum mechanical model describes electrons in terms of mathematical probabilities without exact positions, represented by the Schrödinger equation. This model delineates electron arrangements in terms of atomic orbitals—s, p, d, f (and theoretically g, h, etc.), each with a different shape and energy level. # Atomic Number, Mass Number, and Isotopes: - **Atomic Number (Z)**: Represents the number of protons in the nucleus and uniquely identifies a chemical element. - **Mass Number (A)**: The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. - **Isotopes**: Atoms of the same element (same number of protons) but different numbers of neutrons, resulting in different mass numbers. Understanding the atomic structure is crucial for delving into chemical reactions, bonding, and the properties of matter, serving as the cornerstone of chemistry and materials science."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:j},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:I,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},_={class:"card-container"},L={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],E={key:0},P={key:1};function F(a,e,l,m,o,r){const p=f("PoemCard");return t(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=i("div",{class:"top-banner"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),i("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=i("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(i("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),i("div",_,[(t(!0),n(b,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(t(),k(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),n("div",L,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
