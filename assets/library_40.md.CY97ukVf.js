The neural tube is a narrow channel that normally folds and closes between the 3rd and 4th weeks of pregnancy, forming the brain and spinal cord of the embryo. Anencephaly occurs when the 'cephalic' or head end of the neural tube fails to close, causing the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp. Infants with this disorder are born without a forebrain (the front part of the brain) and a cerebrum (the thinking and coordinating part of the brain). The remaining brain tissue is often exposed (not covered by bone or skin). Affected babies are usually blind, deaf, unconscious, and unable to feel pain. Almost all babies with anencephaly die before birth, although some may survive a few hours or a few days after birth. Anencephaly is likely caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors, many of which remain unknown."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Anencephaly ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Anencephaly?

The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."},{"instruction":"What causes Anencephaly ?","output":"What causes anencephaly? The underlying cause of anencephaly is not fully understood. Like other forms of neural tube defects (NTDs), anencephaly is likely caused by the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors, many of which remain unknown. Variations in many genes may influence the risk of developing anencephaly. The best-studied gene thus far is the MTHFR gene, which gives the body instructions to make a protein used to process the vitamin folate (also called vitamin B9). A deficiency of folate is a known risk factor for NTDs. Other genes involved in folate processing, and the development of the neural tube, may also affect the risk. Researchers have also looked at environmental factors that could contribute to the risk of anencephaly. Folate appears to play a significant role, and studies have shown that taking folic acid (a form of folate), before getting pregnant and very early in pregnancy, significantly reduces the risk to have a baby with a NTD. Other possible maternal risk factors for anencephaly include diabetes mellitus; obesity; exposure to high heat (such as a fever or use of a hot tub or sauna) in early pregnancy; and the use of certain anti-seizure medications during pregnancy."},{"instruction":"Anencephaly inherited ?","output":"Is anencephaly inherited? Most cases of anencephaly are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no family history of anencephaly or other neural tube defects (NTDs). In some cases, it may be associated with a chromosome abnormality, a severe malformation syndrome, or disruption of the amniotic membrane. A small portion of cases have appeared to be familial, but it often does not have a clear inheritance pattern. In isolated populations, anencephaly has been suspected to be due to a single gene. In Iranian Jews, who have high rates of consanguinity (mating with family members), it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Parents who have had a child with anencephaly are at an increased risk to have another affected child (compared with the risk in the general population). Because most cases are believed to be multifactorial (due to interaction of genetic and environmental factors), the recurrence risk is estimated to be between 2% and 5% after a single case. If anencephaly is known to be associated with an underlying disorder, the recurrence risk may depend on that of the underlying disorder. For women who have previously had a fetus or infant with anencephaly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends increasing the intake of folic acid to 4mg per day beginning at least one month prior to conception. People who have had a pregnancy or child with anencephaly or another NTD, and have questions about future risk, are encouraged to speak with a genetic counselor or other genetics professional."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility ?","output":"Autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility (AGID) is a rare form of autoimmune autonomic neuropathy that can occur either due to an idiopathic cause or a paraneoplastic cause.

These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure. It is often caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Genetic factors involve genes that code for proteins that help control the complement system (part of your bodys immune system). Environmental factors include viral or bacterial infections, certain medications (such as anticancer drugs), chronic diseases, cancers, and organ transplantation. Most cases are sporadic. Less than 20 percent of all cases have been reported to run in families. When the disorder is familial, it can have an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome differs from a more common condition called typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The two disorders have different causes and symptoms."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Spastic paraplegia 19 ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Spastic paraplegia 19?

Symptoms typically appear at an average age of 28 years and may include polyuria (excessive production or passage of urine) and low urinary osmolality (decreased concentration) in the first morning urine. Later, symptoms of renal insufficiency typically progress to include anemia, metabolic acidosis and uremia. End stage renal disease (ESRD) eventually follows. There are 2 types of MCKD, which are both inherited in an autosomal dominant manner but are caused by mutations in different genes. MCKD 1 is caused by mutations in the MCKD1 gene (which has not yet been identified) and MCKD 2 is caused by mutations in the UMOD gene. The 2 types also differ by MCKD 1 being associated with ESRD at an average age of 62 years, while MCKD 2 is associated with ESRD around 32 years and is more likely to be associated with hyperuricemia and gout. Treatment for MCKD may include correction of water and electrolyte imbalances, and dialysis followed by renal transplantation for end-stage renal failure."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Medullary cystic kidney disease ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Medullary cystic kidney disease?

Signs and symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include pale skin, fatigue, anemia, jaundice, gallstones, and enlargement of the spleen. Some people with a severe form may have short stature, delayed sexual development, and skeletal abnormalities. The condition is caused by mutations in any of several genes, such as the ANK1, EPB42, SLC4A1, SPTA1, and SPTB genes. It is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

Hereditary spherocytosis may be caused by mutations in any one of several genes. The mutations that cause the condition result in the formation of spherical, overly rigid, misshapen red blood cells. The misshapen red blood cells, called spherocytes, are removed from circulation and taken to the spleen for destruction. Within the spleen, the red blood cells break down (undergo hemolysis). The shortage of red blood cells in the blood circulation and the abundance of cells in the spleen are responsible for the signs and symptoms of this condition. Mutations in the ANK1 gene are responsible for about half of all cases of hereditary spherocytosis. The other genes associated with hereditary spherocytosis account for a smaller percentage of cases and include the EPB42, SLC4A1, SPTA1, and SPTB genes."},{"instruction":"Hereditary spherocytosis inherited ?","output":"How is hereditary spherocytosis inherited? About 75 percent of cases of hereditary spherocytosis are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that one copy of the altered (mutated) gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. The mutated gene may be inherited from an affected parent or may occur for the first time in the affected individual. Each child of an individual with an autosomal dominant form of hereditary spherocytosis has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated gene. Less commonly, hereditary spherocytosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell have mutations. Parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have signs and symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of the same autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have to condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% risk to not have the condition and not be a carrier. In some of the cases that result from new mutations in people with no history of the condition in their family, the inheritance pattern may be unclear."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Actinomycosis ?","output":"Actinomycosis is a chronic bacterial infection that commonly affects the face and neck.

It is a progressively debilitating disorder; however, the rate of progression varies among affected individuals. MPS I is caused by mutations in the IDUA gene. These mutations lead to reduced levels or the complete lack of the IDUA enzyme. Without the proper amount of this enzyme, large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) accumulate within cells called lysosomes. This causes the lysosomes to increase in size, causing many different organs and tissues of the body to become enlarged. This leads to the medical problems seen in the condition. MPS I was once divided into three separate syndromes: Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, and Scheie syndrome, listed from most to least severe. Because no biochemical differences have been identified and the clinical findings overlap, the condition is now divided into two subtypes, severe MPS I and attenuated MPS I. People with severe MPS I typically have an earlier onset of symptoms, a decline in intellectual function, and a shorter lifespan.

Mutations in the IDUA gene cause MPS I. The IDUA gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme that is involved in the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Mutations in the IDUA gene reduce or completely eliminate the function of the IDUA enzyme. The lack of IDUA enzyme activity leads to the accumulation of GAGs within cells, specifically inside the lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle different types of molecules. Conditions that cause molecules to build up inside the lysosomes, including MPS I, are called lysosomal storage disorders. The accumulation of GAGs increases the size of the lysosomes, which is why many tissues and organs are enlarged in this disorder."},{"instruction":"Mucopolysaccharidosis type I inherited ?","output":"How is mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) inherited? MPS I is inherited from both parents in an autosomal recessive pattern."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Mucopolysaccharidosis type I ?","output":"What treatment is available for mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I)? The two main treatments for MPS I are enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and bone marrow transplant. Both of these treatments work by replacing the missing IDUA enzyme. A drug called laronidase or Aldurazyme is the enzyme replacement therapy for MPS I. Treatment with laronidase can improve problems with breathing, growth, the bones, joints and heart. However, this treatment is not expected to treat problems with mental development because laronidase cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. A bone marrow transplant is another treatment option that provides the person with MPS I with cells that can produce the IDUA enyzme. A bone marrow transplant can stop the progression of neurological problems."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Multifocal choroiditis ?","output":"Multifocal choroiditis (MFC) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by swelling of the eye (called uveitis) and multiple lesions in the choroid, a layer of blood vessels between the white of the eye and the retina. Symptoms include blurry vision, floaters, sensitivity to light, blind spots and mild eye discomfort. Though the cause is unknown, multifocal choroiditis is seen most frequently in women ages 20 to 60, and usually affects both eyes. MFC is generally treated with steroid medication that can be taken orally or injected into the eye. Multifocal choroiditis is a chronic condition, thus symptoms may return or worsen even after successful treatment."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Multifocal choroiditis ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of multifocal choroiditis? Multifocal choroiditis (MFC) generally causes blurry vision with or without sensitivity to light. Other common symptoms include blind spots, floaters, eye discomfort and perceived flashes of light. Clinical examination by an ophthalmologist reveals inflammation in the front, middle and/or back layers of the eye with multiple scattered yellow/gray-white spots in the choroid and retina. A subset of people with this condition also develop choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVMs), new blood vessels that can cause more severe vision loss."},{"instruction":"What causes Multifocal choroiditis ?","output":"What causes multifocal choroiditis?

Multifocal choroiditis (MFC) is diagnosed by an ophthalmologist, using a series of imaging techniques. A test called flourescein angiography uses a special dye and camera to study blood flow in the back layers of the eye. When a person has MFC, lesions in the eye will appear as fluorescent spots. Vision tests may also show an enlarged blind spot or a decrease in visual clarity. Often, doctors may order blood tests to check if the symptoms are caused by a viral disease rather than MFC."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Multifocal choroiditis ?","output":"How might multifocal choroiditis be treated? Multifocal choroiditis (MFC) is generally treated with steroid medication that can be taken orally or injected into the affected eye. These treatments may be successful in managing symptoms, though there is no permanent cure for the disease and symptoms may return. If a person no longer responds to steroid treatment, drugs that suppress the immune system, such as cyclosporine, may be recommended. People with more severe vision loss may also benefit from laser therapy.

It is an essential scaffolding (supporting) component of the nuclear envelope, which is the membrane that surrounds the nucleus. Mutations that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome result in the production of an abnormal version of the lamin A protein.

Leukonychia totalis can be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. It may also occur as part of various underlying conditions or abnormalities, some of which have their own specific genetic cause(s) and inheritance patterns. In some cases, the condition is idiopathic (of unknown cause). Autosomal dominant inheritance means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the disease-causing gene is enough to cause signs or symptoms. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene. Autsomal recessive inheritance means that a person must have mutations in both copies of the disease-causing gene to have the condition.

Eating can also be impaired as tongue and throat twitches can interfere with chewing and swallowing food. People with chorea-acanthocytosis may uncontrollably bite their tongue, lips, and inside of the mouth. Nearly half of all people with chorea-acanthocytosis have seizures. Individuals with chorea-acanthocytosis may develop difficulty processing, learning, and remembering information (cognitive impairment). They may also have reduced sensation and weakness in their arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy) and muscle weakness (myopathy). Impaired muscle and nerve functioning commonly cause speech difficulties, and can lead to an inability to speak. Behavioral changes are also a common feature of chorea-acanthocytosis and may be the first sign of this condition. These behavioral changes may include changes in personality, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), lack of self-restraint, and the inability to take care of oneself. The signs and symptoms of chorea-acanthocytosis usually begin in early to mid-adulthood. The movement problems of this condition worsen with age. Loss of cells (atrophy) in certain brain regions is the major cause of the neurological problems seen in people with chorea-acanthocytosis. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Chorea-acanthocytosis.

Platelet storage pool deficiency refers to a group of conditions that can be acquired (non-inherited) or inherited. Hereditary forms of the condition may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner. In autosomal dominant conditions, one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause signs or symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene from the affected parent. When a condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, a person must have a change in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the condition is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes (the Y chromosome is the other sex chromosome). Women have two X chromosomes and men have an X and a Y chromosome. X-linked conditions can be X-linked dominant or X-linked recessive. The inheritance is X-linked dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Women with an X-linked dominant condition have a 50% chance of passing the condition on to a son or a daughter with each pregnancy. Men with an X-linked dominant condition will pass the condition on to all of their daughters and none of their sons. The inheritance is X-linked recessive if a gene on the X chromosome causes the condition in men with one gene mutation (they have only one X chromosome) and in females with two gene mutations (they have two X chromosomes). A woman with an X-linked condition will pass the mutation on to all of her sons and daughters. This means that all of her sons will have the condition and all of her daughters will be carriers. A man with an X-linked recessive condition will pass the mutation to all of his daughters (carriers) and none of his sons."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Platelet storage pool deficiency ?","output":"How is platelet storage pool deficiency diagnosed? A diagnosis of platelet storage pool deficiency is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms.

Treatment for platelet storage pool deficiency is symptomatic. For example, people who have severe episodes of bleeding may require platelet transfusions or antifibrinolytic medications, particularly during periods of high risk such as during surgical procedures or after an injury. Transfusions are generally used with caution as the potential risks often outweigh the benefits when bleeding is not life-threatening. People with a platelet storage pool deficiency should avoid antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Hypoplastic right heart syndrome ?","output":"Hypoplastic right heart syndrome is a rare heart defect, present at birth (congenital), that results in low blood oxygen levels.

Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is a genetic condition caused by mutations in any of 5 genes - EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, and EIF2B5. These genes give the body instructions to make the five parts (subunits) of a protein called eIF2B. This protein helps regulate overall production of protein in cells (protein synthesis). Proper regulation of protein synthesis ensures that the correct levels of protein are available for cells to cope with changing conditions and stress. Mutations in any of these 5 genes results in partial loss of eIF2B function, making it more difficult for cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress. Researchers believe that cells in the white matter may be particularly affected by an abnormal response to stress, thus causing the signs and symptoms of this condition. Approximately 90% of affected people have been found to have mutations in one of these 5 genes. Approximately 10% of families who have been diagnosed by MRI and clinical features do not have an identifiable mutation, suggesting that additional genes may also be responsible for the condition."},{"instruction":"Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter inherited ?","output":"How is leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter inherited? Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene to be affected. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter ?","output":"How might leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter be treated? Treatment for leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is supportive, aiming to alleviate symptoms. Management may include physical therapy and rehabilitation for motor dysfunction (mainly spasticity and ataxia); and anti-seizure medications for seizures. Infections and fevers should be prevented when possible through the use of vaccinations; low-dose maintenance antibiotics during winter months; antibiotics for minor infections; and antipyretics (fever-reducing medications) for fever. For children, wearing a helmet outside can help minimize the effects of head trauma. Contact sports, head trauma, and stressful situations (including high body temperature) should be avoided.

Parathyroid hormone helps control calcium, phosphorous, and vitamin D levels in the bones and blood. Hypoparathyroidism is a similar condition in which the body does not make enough parathyroid hormone instead of not being able to respond to it (as in pseudohypoparathyroidism). The symptoms of these two conditions are similar and are caused by low calcium levels and high phosphate levels in the blood. This may cause cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), dental problems, numbness, seizures, or tetany (muscle twitches and hand and foot spasms). These symptoms are usually first seen in childhood. There are two different types of pseudohypoparathyroidism, both of which are caused by spelling mistakes (mutations) in certain genes.

Managing X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) mainly consists of preventing infections and treating infections aggressively when they do occur. Sudden infections in individuals with XLA are usually treated with antibiotics that are taken for at least twice as long as taken in healthy individuals. Preventing bacterial infections is very important for people with XLA. Gammaglobulin (a type of protein in the blood that contains antibodies to prevent or fight infections) is the main treatment for people with XLA. In the past, most people received this by intravenous (IV) infusion every two to four weeks. However, in the last few years, an increasing number of people have been receiving it by weekly subcutaneous injections. The choice of whether to receive it intravenously or by injection may just depend on what is most convenient for the doctor and/or patient. Sometimes, people with XLA have a reaction to gammaglobulin, which may include headaches, chills, backache, or nausea. These reactions are more likely to occur when they have a viral infection or when the brand of gammaglobulin has been changed. Some centers use chronic prophylactic antibiotics (continuous use of antibiotics) to prevent bacterial infections. Aggressive use of antibiotics lower the chance of chronic sinusitis and lung disease, which are common complications in individuals with XLA. Early diagnosis and treatment of bowel infections may decrease the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Furthermore, children with XLA should not be given live viral vaccines. For example, they should be given inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) rather than the oral polio vaccine. The siblings of children with XLA should also be given inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) rather than oral polio vaccine in order to avoid infecting their affected sibling with live virus."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Curry Jones syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Curry Jones syndrome?

Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is caused by changes (mutations) in the BEST1 gene. This gene gives the body instructions for making a protein called bestrophin. Bestrophin acts as a channel that controls the movement of chloride ions within the retina. It is thought that mutations in the BEST1 gene affect the shape of the channel and its ability to properly regulate the flow of chloride. However, it is unclear how exactly this relates to the specific features of BVMD."},{"instruction":"Best vitelliform macular dystrophy inherited ?","output":"How is Best vitelliform macular dystrophy inherited? Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although a few cases with autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. In autosomal dominant inheritance, having one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. Most people with BVMD have an affected parent, but some people have the condition as the result of a new mutation that occurred for the first time. Autosomal recessive inheritance means that a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell to be affected. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Best vitelliform macular dystrophy ?","output":"How is Best vitelliform macular dystrophy diagnosed? Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) may be diagnosed based on the findings on an exam of the fundus (the interior surface of the eye opposite the lens); an electrooculogram (EOG); and the family history. An eye exam may include other tests as well. A fundus exam may show a typical yellow yolk-like macular lesion. An EOG is usually abnormal in affected people, but occasionally, people with signs of BVMD and a mutation in the BEST1 gene have a normal EOG. The family history in affected people is often consistent with either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance. Genetic testing may also be used to make a diagnosis of BVMD. A BEST1 mutation is detected in about 96% of affected people who have an affected family member. In people with no family history of BVMD, the mutation detection rate ranges between 50-70%. The exact type of genetic test ordered to confirm a diagnosis may depend on a person's ancestry, family history, and/or whether other eye disorders are also being considered."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy ?","output":"How might Best vitelliform macular dystrophy be treated? There is no specific treatment for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) at this time. Low vision aids help affected people with significant loss of visual acuity. Laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, and anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents such as bevacizumab have shown limited success in treating some of the secondary features of BVMD such as choroidal neovascularization (when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and retina)."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Onychotrichodysplasia and neutropenia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Onychotrichodysplasia and neutropenia?

Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) usually occurs occurs by itself without other symptoms and is called isolated HSCR. Isolated HSCR has multifactorial inheritance, which means that multiple genes interact with environmental factors to cause the condition. When someone has a child with isolated HSCR, the overall risk to have another child with the condition is 4%. There are some factors that can change the risk. For example, the risk is higher if the sibling has long-segment disease rather than short-segment disease. Also males are more likely than females to develop HSCR. Another factor is if the siblings have the same or different parents. If HSCR occurs as part of a genetic syndrome, then it is inherited in a specific pattern. For example, the inheritance may be autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive, depending on the exact cause of the syndrome.

Cobalamin deficiency is typically detected first, followed by showing that cobalamin is poorly absorbed (the main cause of cobalamin deficiency). Other known causes of vitamin B12 malabsorption must then be ruled out. Lastly, it must be shown that after correcting the deficiency, the only nutrient to be poorly absorbed is vitamin B12. The diagnosis can also be confirmed by having genetic testing of the genes that are known to cause the condition. While the presence of proteinuria is strongly suggestive of IGS, not all affected individuals have proteinuria."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Familial tumoral calcinosis ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Familial tumoral calcinosis?

There are two types of Wolfram syndrome (type 1 and type 2) which are primarily differentiated by their genetic cause. Changes (mutations) in the WFS1 gene are responsible for approximately 90% of Wolfram syndrome type 1 cases. This gene encodes wolframin, a protein that is important for the proper functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (the part of a cell that is involved in protein production, processing, and transport). Wolframin helps regulate the amount of calcium in cells, which is important for many different cellular functions. Mutations in WFS1 result in a defective form of wolframin that is unable to perform its normal role. This causes cells to trigger their own death (apoptosis). The death of cells in various organs and other parts of the body results in the signs and symptoms of Wolfram syndrome type 1. A specific mutation in the CISD2 gene causes Wolfram syndrome type 2. Although the exact function of this gene is not known, scientists suspect that it plays an important role in the mitochondria (the part of the cell where energy is produced). Mutations in CISD2 lead to the loss of mitochondria which decreases the amount of energy available to cells. Cells that do not have enough energy die. As in Wolfram syndrome type 1, the death of cells in different parts of the body results in the many health problems associated with Wolfram syndrome type 2.

It is called primary because it occurs in the absence of lung disease such as emphysema and spontaneous because the pneumothhorax was not caused by an injury such as a rib fracture. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is likely caused by the formation of small sacs of air (blebs) in lung tissue that rupture, causing air to leak into the pleural space. This air creates pressure on the lung and can lead to its collapse. Symptoms may include chest pain on the side of the collapsed lung and shortness of breath. The blebs that lead to primary spontaneous pneumothorax may be present in an individual's lung (or lungs) for a long time before they rupture. A change in air pressure or a very sudden deep breath may cause a rupture to occur. In most cases, there are no prior signs of illness. Once a bleb ruptures and causes a pneumothorax, rates for recurrence may be as high as 13 to 60 percent. Many researchers believe that genetic factors may play a role in the development of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. In rare cases, the condition can be caused by mutations in the FLCN gene. In these cases, the condition follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. In addition, several genetic disorders have been linked to primary spontaneous pneumothorax, including Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Primary spontaneous pneumothorax ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Primary spontaneous pneumothorax?

If a person with Sotos syndrome has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutation. However, the specific features and severity can vary from one generation to the next, so it is not possible to predict how a child will be affected."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Joubert syndrome with oculorenal anomalies ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Joubert syndrome with oculorenal anomalies?

Attacks frequently last for several days and require emergency care. Most cases of capillary leak occur randomly in previously healthy adults. Treatment involves preventing attacks using medications which may decrease capillary leakage and interfere with hormones that may cause future leakage. Once an attack is underway, treatment is aimed at controlling blood pressure to maintain blood flow to vital organs and prevention of swelling due to fluid accumulation. Capillary leak syndrome may lead to multiple organ failure, shock and even death."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Systemic capillary leak syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Systemic capillary leak syndrome?

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unlikely to add additional information. Current practice dictates that a core biopsy (utilizing a needle to remove a small cylinder of tissue) be performed for a definitive diagnosis.

Fibrofolliculomas are a type of benign skin tumor specific to BHDS. They typically occur on the face, neck, and upper torso. Most people with BHDS also have multiple cysts in both lungs that can be seen on high-resolution chest CT scan. While these cysts usually do not cause any symptoms, they put people at increased risk for spontaneous pneumothorax. BHDS is caused by mutations in the FLCN gene. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of BirtHoggDube syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome?

At the time of diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome, a computed tomography (CT) scan, or high resolution CT scan if available, should be done to determine the number, location, and size of any cysts in the lungs. There is no recommended management of the lung cysts. Lung cysts related to BHD have not been associated with long-term disability or fatality. The main concern is that the cysts may increase the chance of developing a collapsed lung (pneumothorax). If an individual with BHD experiences any symptoms of a collapsed lung - such as chest pain, discomfort, or shortness of breath - they should immediately go to a physician for a chest x-ray or CT scan. Therapy of a collapsed lung depends on the symptoms, how long it has been present, and the extent of any underlying lung conditions. It is thought that collapsed lung can be prevented by avoiding scuba diving, piloting airplanes, and cigarette smoking. Individuals with BHD who have a history of multiple instances of collapsed lung or signs of lung disease are encouraged to see a lung specialist (pulmonologist)."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Metachromatic leukodystrophy due to saposin B deficiency ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Metachromatic leukodystrophy due to saposin B deficiency?

The skin abnormalities are present from birth and can include streaks of very thin skin (dermal hypoplasia), cutis aplasia, and telangiectases. They also may abnormalities in the nails, hands, and feet. Some of the eye findings present may include small eyes (microphthalmia), absent or severely underdeveloped eyes (anophthalmia), and problems with the tear ducts. People with focal dermal hypoplasia may also have distinctive facial features such as a pointed chin, small ears, notched nostrils, and a slight difference in the size and shape of the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry). Most individuals with this condition are female. Males usually have milder signs and symptoms than females. Although intelligence is typically unaffected, some individuals have intellectual disability. This condition is caused by mutations in the PORCN gene and is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Most cases of focal dermal hypoplasia in females result from new mutations in the PORCN gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. When focal dermal hypoplasia occurs in males, it always results from a new mutation in this gene that is not inherited. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in the person; however, care usually involves a team of specialists, including dermatologists, otolaryngologist, physical/occupational therapists, and hand surgeons."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Focal dermal hypoplasia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Focal dermal hypoplasia? Focal dermal hypoplasia is usually evident from birth and primarily affects the skin, skeleton, eyes, and face. The signs and symptoms of vary widely, although almost all affected individuals have skin abnormalities. Some of the skin findings include streaks of very thin skin (dermal hypoplasia), yellowish-pink nodules of fat under the skin, areas where the top layers of skin are absent (cutis aplasia), telangiectases, and streaks of slightly darker or lighter skin. These skin features can cause pain, itching, irritation, or lead to skin infections. With age, most develop wart-like growths, called papillomas, around the nostrils, lips, anus, and female genitalia. They may also be present in the throat, specifically in the esophagus or larynx, and can cause problems with swallowing, breathing, or sleeping. Other features include small, ridged fingernails and toenails as well as sparse, brittle or absent scalp hair. The skeleton is usually affected as well. Many individuals have hand and foot abnormalities, including missing fingers or toes (oligodactyly), webbed or fused fingers or toes (syndactyly), and a deep split in the hands or feet with missing fingers or toes and fusion of the remaining digits (ectrodactyly). X-rays can show streaks of altered bone density, called osteopathia striata, which usually do not cause symptoms. Eye abnormalities are common and can include microphthalmia and anopthalmia as well as problems with the tear ducts. The retina or the optic nerve can also be incompletely developed, which can result in a gap or split in these structures (coloboma). Some of these eye abnormalities do not impair vision, while others can lead to low vision or blindness. People with focal dermal hypoplasia often have distinctive, but subtle facial features such as a pointed chin, small ears, notched nostrils, and a slight difference in the size and shape of the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry). Some individuals may have a cleft lip and/or palate. About half of those with focal dermal hypoplasia have teeth abnormalities of their teeth, especially of the enamel (the hard, white material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth). Less commonly, kidney and gastrointestinal abnormalities are present. The kidneys may be fused together, which can lead to kidney infections.

In addition, there are cases in which a woman may have the focal dermal hypoplasia mutation in some but not all of her egg cells, a condition known as germline mosaicism. In this case the risk of passing along the mutation may be as high as 50% depending on the level of mosaicism. Males with focal dermal hypoplasia typically have the mutation in some but not all of their cells. The risk that a male with FDH will pass the condition on to his daughters may be as high as 100%; men do not pass this condition on to their sons.

The age of diagnosis varies from childhood to adulthood. In FIHP, tumors involving the parathyroid glands cause the production and release of excess parathyroid hormone, which in turn causes increased calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). The tumors are usually benign, but a cancerous tumor can develop in rare cases. Abnormal levels of calcium cause many of the symptoms of FIHP, including kidney stones, nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure (hypertension), weakness, and fatigue. Osteoporosis often also develops. FIHP may be caused by mutations in the MEN1, CDC73 (also known as the HRPT2 gene), or CASR genes and is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In some cases, the cause is unknown. Mutations in the MEN1 and CDC73 genes cause other conditions in which hyperparathyroidism is one of many features, but some people with mutations in these genes have only isolated hyperparathyroidism. FIHP can also represent an early stage of other syndromes. Treatment for FIHP often includes surgical removal of the affected gland(s)."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism?

The diagnosis of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP) is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that it is diagnosed when no symptoms or genetic features of other forms of familial hyperparathyroidism are present. FIHP may be the only feature of another condition that is not manifesting completely, or it may be a distinct condition due to mutations in genes that have not yet been identified. Clinical exams, laboratory tests, and histological (microscopic) findings are needed before making a diagnosis of FIHP. A diagnosis of FIHP may include the findings of: hypercalcemia (defined as a serum calcium level greater than 10.5 mg/dL) inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations parathyroid adenomas exclusion of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT) In the majority of people with FIHP, genetic mutations are not found.

Some people do experience life-long problems associated with LCH."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis? Symptoms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) can vary greatly from person to person depending on how much of the body is involved and what part(s) are affected. The disease can affect virtually every organ, including skin, bones, lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, spleen, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, thymus, central nervous system, and hormone glands. The symptoms may range from localized bone lesions or skin disease to multiple organ involvement and severe dysfunction. Below are the organs that may be affected as well as the symptoms that might be observed: Skin - Red, scaly papules in areas where opposing skin surfaces touch or rub (e.g. skin folds) are commonly seen in LCH. Infants with the skin presentation on the scalp are often misdiagnosed with cradle cap. The skin symptoms usually improve without treatment. Bone - Lesions that cause bone destruction are common, with the skull, lower limbs, ribs, pelvis, and vertebrae usually being affected. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, limited motion, and inability to bear weight. Lymph node - Lymph node involvement may be limited or associated with a skin or bone lesion or disseminated disease. Although any of the lymph nodes may be affected, the cervical lymph nodes are where the disease commonly occurs. Individuals usually only present with pain of the lymph node affected. If only one lymph node is affected, prognosis is normally good and treatment is unnecessary. Liver - Liver involvement at the time of diagnosis is generally associated with more severe disease. Symptoms may include ascites, jaundice, low levels of protein, and prolonged clotting time. Central nervous system (CNS) and hormone - CNS involvement is rare and may be devastating. The most common result of CNS involvement is the altering of hormonal function, with some individuals developing diabetes insipidus.

Angelman syndrome is caused by a loss of function of a gene called UBE3A on chromosome 15. The exact mechanism that causes this loss of function is complex. People normally inherit one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues. In certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother is active. This parent-specific gene activation is known as genomic imprinting. If the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene mutation, a person will have no active copies of the gene in some parts of the brain. Several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. Most cases of Angelman syndrome occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. In other cases, Angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. In a small percentage of cases, a person with Angelman syndrome inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father, instead of one copy from each parent. This is called paternal uniparental disomy. Rarely, Angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of DNA that controls activation of the UBE3A gene. These genetic changes can abnormally turn off (inactivate) UBE3A or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15. The cause of Angelman syndrome is unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. Changes involving other genes or chromosomes may be responsible for the condition in these individuals."},{"instruction":"Angelman syndrome inherited ?","output":"How might Angelman syndrome be inherited? Most cases of Angelman syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 or by paternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. In these instances, people typically have no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a mutation in the UBE3A gene or in the nearby region of DNA that controls gene activation to be passed from one generation to the next."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of SLC4A1associated distal renal tubular acidosis ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis?

Livedoid vasculopathy may occur alone or in combination with another condition, such as lupus or thrombophilia."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Livedoid vasculopathy ?","output":"How might livedoid vasculopathy be treated? Treatment of livedoid vasculopathy aims to reduce pain, ulceration and scarring. General treatment measures may involve protecting the skin from injury and irritants, removing dead tissue from the ulcers, treating infection with antibiotics, elevating legs, compression therapy, and avoiding smoking and hormonal contraceptives. Treatments will also be given to address any co-occurring conditions such as lupus or thrombophilia. Drugs that aim to improve blood flow or prevent blood clotting may also be considered. Examples of these treatments, include: Antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin, dipyridamole) Fibrinolytic agents (e.g. danazol, tissue plasminogen activator) Anticoagulant agents (e.g. subcutaneous heparin injections, oral warfarin) Pentoxifylline Low-dose danazol (200 mg/day orally) Hyperbaric oxygen Pulsed intravenous immunoglobulin Iloprost Ketanserin Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy Niacin (nicotinic acid) Sulfapyridine Guanethidine Currently there are no established guidelines for treatment.

Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis is caused by abnormal development of the forearm bones in the fetal period, although the underlying cause of the developmental abnormality is not always known. The condition may be isolated (occur without other abnormalities) or it may be associated with various other skeletal, cardiac (heart), neurologic, or gastrointestinal abnormalities. When other abnormalities are present, the condition may be due to an underlying genetic cause, including a variety of syndromes or chromosome abnormalities. In some cases, congenital radio-ulnar synostosis appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In an article published in 2000, the authors found that autosomal dominant radio-ulnar synostosis with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia was caused by mutations in the HOXA11 gene in 2 families."},{"instruction":"Congenital radioulnar synostosis inherited ?","output":"How is congenital radio-ulnar synostosis inherited? Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in some cases.

The mutated gene may occur for the first time in an affected individual, or it may be inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with an autosomal dominant condition has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene. Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis may also occur with a variety of other abnormalities and may be associated with a chromosome abnormality or genetic syndrome. In these cases, the inheritance pattern may depend upon that of the underlying genetic abnormality. Some genetic abnormalities that have been reported in association with this condition include Apert syndrome, Carpenter syndrome, arthrogryposis, Treacher Collins syndrome, Williams syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Holt-Oram syndrome.

It typically starts during the first decade of life. Affected people usually develop moderate visual loss and color vision defects. The severity varies and visual acuity can range from normal to legal blindness. About 20% of people with DOA have non-ocular features, such as sensorineural hearing loss; myopathy; peripheral neuropathy; multiple sclerosis-like illness; and spastic paraplegia (impaired function of the legs). These cases may be referred to as 'DOA plus.' DOA is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and may be caused by a mutation in any of several genes, some of which have not been identified. There is currently no way to prevent or cure DOA, but affected people may benefit from low vision aids."},{"instruction":"Dominant optic atrophy inherited ?","output":"How is dominant optic atrophy inherited? Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene from a parent. In other cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in an affected person and is not inherited from a parent (a de novo mutation). When a person with a mutation that causes DOA has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutation. While a mutation responsible for DOA can cause the condition, not all people with a mutation will develop DOA. This means that DOA has reduced penetrance. There are likely to be other genetic and environmental factors that influence whether a person with a mutation will develop features of DOA. Additionally, not all people who do develop features will be affected the same way, and severity can vary - even within families. This phenomenon is known as variable expressivity. People with questions about genetic risks or genetic testing for themselves or family members are encouraged to speak with a genetics professional."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Dominant optic atrophy ?","output":"How might dominant optic atrophy be treated? There is currently no cure for dominant optic atrophy (DOA). Management generally consists of regular eye exams, including measurement of visual acuity, color vision, visual fields and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Currently there is no specific treatment, but low-vision aids in individuals with severely decreased visual acuity can be helpful. A preliminary study published in February 2013 found that several individuals with specific OPA1 mutations who underwent idebenone therapy (which has been used to treat some cases of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy) experienced some improvement of visual function. However, more thorough research is necessary to confirm these findings. Acupuncture is also being studied as a potential treatment. Avoiding tobacco and alcohol intake and certain medications (antibiotics, antivirals), which can interfere with mitochondrial metabolism, may help to slow the progression. Cochlear implants have been shown to markedly improve hearing in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Buschke Ollendorff syndrome ?","output":"Buschke Ollendorff syndrome (BOS) is a genetic condition of the connective tissue. Common signs and symptoms include non-cancerous skin lumps and spots of increased bone density (which can be seen on X-ray). Some people with BOS have both skin and bone symptoms, while others have one or the other. Individual cases of BOS have occurred in association with joint pain, hearing disorders (e.g., otosclerosis), congenital spinal stenosis, craniosynostosis, and nail patella syndrome. Symptoms of BOS may begin at any age, but most often present before age 20. BOS is caused by mutations in the LEMD3 gene. The mutation results in a loss of protein (also named LEMD3) that results in the excessive formation of bone tissue. It is not clear how the LEMD3 mutations cause the skin lumps or other features of BOS. BOS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Affected members of the same family can have very different symptoms."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Buschke Ollendorff syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Buschke Ollendorff syndrome? Buschke Ollendorff syndrome (BOS) is an association of connective tissue nevi and osteopoikilosis (small, round areas of increased bone density). The nevi are typically present on the trunk, in the sacrolumbar region (lower back and sacrum), and on the extremities (arms and legs). Occasionally, they may be on the head. The nevi are usually nontender and firm, and are typically first noticeable as slightly elevated and flattened yellowish bumps, grouped together and forming plaques that may be several centimeters in diameter. The plaques are typically of irregular shape. They are usually numerous, painless, and develop over several years. The osteopoikilosis typically occurs in the long bones, wrist, foot, ankle, pelvis, and scapula. They are harmless and usually found by chance when radiographs are taken for other purposes, although pain and limited joint mobility have been reported in some individuals. In some individuals, only skin or bone manifestations may be present. Other signs and symptoms of BOS may include nasolacrimal duct obstruction, amblyopia (\\"lazy eye\\"), strabismus, benign lymphoid hyperplasia, hypopigmentation (abnormally light skin), and short stature.

Buschke Ollendorff syndrome (BOS) is caused by mutations in the LEMD3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that only one changed (mutated) copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient for a person to be affected by the condition. An affected individual may have inherited a mutated copy of the LEMD3 gene from an affected parent, or they may have been born with a new (de novo) mutation. There is a 50% (1 in 2) chance for each child of an affected individual to inherit the mutated gene, and a 50% chance for each child to not inherit the mutated gene. It has been proposed that the inheritance of BOS shows incomplete penetrance. Penetrance refers to the proportion of people with a particular genetic change (such as a mutation in a specific gene) who exhibit signs and symptoms of a genetic disorder. If some people with the mutation do not develop features of the disorder, the condition is said to have reduced (or incomplete) penetrance. Reduced penetrance probably results from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, many of which are unknown. This phenomenon can make it challenging for genetics professionals to interpret a persons family medical history and predict the risk of passing a genetic condition to future generations.

However, some scientists suspect that an increased production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by the immune system may contribute to the development of CD. IL-6 is a substance normally produced by cells within the lymph nodes that helps coordinate the immune response to infection. Increased production of IL-6 may result in an overgrowth of lymphatic cells, leading to many of the signs and symptoms of CD. It has also been found that a virus called human herpes virus type 8 (also known as HHV-8, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, or KSHV) is present in many people with multicentric CD, specifically. HHV-8 is found in nearly all people who are HIV-positive and develop multicentric CD, and in up to 60% of affected people without HIV. The HHV-8 virus may possibly cause multicentric CD by making its own IL-6."},{"instruction":"Castleman disease inherited ?","output":"Is Castleman disease inherited?

This condition gets its name from the areas of the body that are affected most often: muscles in the face (facio-), around the shoulder blades (scapulo-), and in the upper arms (humeral). The signs and symptoms of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy usually appear in adolescence. However, the onset and severity of the condition varies widely. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy results from a deletion of genetic material from a region of DNA known as D4Z4. This region is located near one end of chromosome 4. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy?

People with this condition can develop abnormal blood vessels called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in several areas of the body. If they are on the skin, they are called telangiectasias. The AVMs can also develop in other parts of the body, such as the brain, lungs, liver, or intestines. HHT is caused by mutations in the ACVRL1, ENG, and SMAD4 genes. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. There is no cure for HHT. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, with a focus on controlling bleeding, either through surgery or medication."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia?

Yes. Although there is not yet a way to prevent the telangiectases or AVMs associated with HHT, most can be treated once they occur. Management includes surveillance for undiagnosed AVMs and treatment for identified complications such as nosebleeds, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, pulmonary AVMs, cerebral AVMs, and hepatic AVMs. Treatment of nosebleeds with humidification and nasal lubricants, laser ablation, septal dermoplasty, or estrogen-progesterone therapy can prevent anemia and allow individuals with HHT to pursue normal activities. Individuals with GI bleeding are treated with iron therapy to maintain hemoglobin concentration; endoscopic application of a heater probe, bicap, or laser; surgical removal of bleeding sites; and estrogen-progesterone therapy. Iron replacement and red blood cell transfusions are used to treat anemia. Pulmonary AVMs with feeding vessels that exceed 3.0 mm in diameter require occlusion. Cerebral AVMs greater than 1.0 cm in diameter are treated by surgery, embolotherapy, and/or stereotactic radiosurgery. The treatment of choice for hepatic AVMs is liver transplantation. Blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) and anti-inflammatory agents should be avoided. Some patients may need to take antibiotics during simple dental or surgical procedures. Individual patients and their doctors should make decisions regarding these measures, as necessary. Surveillance includes annual evaluations for anemia and neurologic conditions and re-evaluation for pulmonary AVMs every one to two years during childhood and every five years thereafter. Women with HHT considering pregnancy are screened and treated for pulmonary AVMs; if pulmonary AVMs are discovered during pregnancy, they are treated during the second trimester."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency?

It causes a person to hypoventilate (especially during sleep), resulting in a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood. Symptoms usually begin shortly after birth. Affected infants hypoventilate upon falling asleep and exhibit a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis). Other features may include difficulty regulating heart rate and blood pressure; decreased perception of pain; low body temperature; sporadic profuse sweating; Hirschsprung disease; constipation; learning difficulties; eye abnormalities; and a characteristic facial appearance (having a short, wide, somewhat flattened face). CCHS is caused by a mutation in the PHOX2B gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, over 90% of cases are due to a new mutation in the affected person and are not inherited from a parent. Treatment typically includes mechanical ventilation or use of a diaphragm pacemaker."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome?

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. The genetics of CCHS can be complex. Most people with CCHS have a new (de novo) mutation in the responsible gene (the PHOX2B gene). De novo mutations occur for the first time in the affected person and are not inherited from a parent. Some people with CCHS have a parent with the condition, and inherit the mutation from that parent. In some cases, an asymptomatic parent of a person with symptoms has a PHOX2B mutation in some of their germ cells (egg or sperm cells, not body cells). This is called germline mosaicism. Some of these parents also have a PHOX2B mutation in some of their body cells. This is called somatic mosaicism. Germline mosaicism with or without somatic mosaicism is present in about 25% of asymptomatic parents of people with CCHS. Parents with mosaicism should have a comprehensive assessment to determine if any features of CCHS are present. It is also recommended that parents of a person with a presumed de novo mutation have genetic testing for the presence of the mutation, including testing that detects mosaicism at low levels."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Familial progressive cardiac conduction defect ?","output":"Familial progressive cardiac conduction defect (PCCD) is a is a cardiac (heart) conduction disorder that may progress to complete heart block.

The antibiotic dapsone is extremely effective in treating this condition. Symptomatic improvement may occur in as little as several hours after the first dose. However, dapsone may cause serious side effects and requires regular monitoring by a physician. When this medication is used to relieve the symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, it should be taken in the smallest effective dose and for the shortest period possible. In some cases, immunosuppressive medications may be used. These medications do not appear to be as effective. A strict gluten-free diet is also recommended to help control the disease. Following this diet may eliminate the need for medications and prevent later complications."},{"instruction":"What is (are) BallerGerold syndrome ?","output":"Baller-Gerold syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis) and abnormalities of bones in the arms and hands, sometimes referred to as radial ray anomalies. Many cases of Baller-Gerold syndrome are caused by mutations in the RECQL4 gene. These cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In a few reported cases, the characteristic features of Baller-Gerold syndrome have been associated with prenatal exposure to a drug called sodium valproate which is used to treat epilepsy and certain psychiatric disorders. Treatment may include surgery for treatment of craniosynostosis or reconstruction of the index finger to functional thumb. The symptoms of Baller-Gerold syndrome overlap with features of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome and RAPADILINO syndrome which are also caused by the RECQL4 gene. Researchers are trying to determine if these conditions are separate disorders or part of a single syndrome with overlapping signs and symptoms."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of BallerGerold syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Baller-Gerold syndrome? Many people with Baller-Gerold syndrome have prematurely fused skull bones along the coronal suture, the growth line that goes over the head from ear to ear. Other parts of the skull may be malformed as well. These changes result in an abnormally shaped head, a prominent forehead, and bulging eyes with shallow eye sockets (ocular proptosis). Other distinctive facial features can include widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a small mouth, and a saddle-shaped or underdeveloped nose. Bone abnormalities in the hands include missing fingers (oligodactyly) and malformed or absent thumbs. Partial or complete absence of bones in the forearm is also common. Together, these hand and arm abnormalities are called radial ray malformations. People with Baller-Gerold syndrome may have a variety of additional signs and symptoms including slow growth beginning in infancy, small stature, and malformed or missing kneecaps (patellae). A skin rash often appears on the arms and legs a few months after birth. This rash spreads over time, causing patchy changes in skin coloring, areas of skin tissue degeneration, and small clusters of enlarged blood vessels just under the skin. These chronic skin problems are collectively known as poikiloderma. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Baller-Gerold syndrome.

Mowat-Wilson syndrome is caused by mutations in the ZEB2 (also known as ZFHX1B or SIP-1) gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many organs and tissues before birth. It is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Researchers believe that ZEB2 protein is involved in the development of tissues that give rise to the nervous system, digestive tract, facial features, heart, and other organs. Mowat-Wilson syndrome almost always results from the loss of one working copy of the ZEB2 gene in each cell. In some cases, the entire gene is deleted. In other cases, mutations within the gene lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the ZEB2 protein. A shortage of this protein disrupts the normal development of many organs and tissues, which causes the varied signs and symptoms of Mowat-Wilson syndrome."},{"instruction":"MowatWilson syndrome inherited ?","output":"How is Mowat-Wilson inherited?

Usher syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that a person must have a change (mutation) in both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell to have Usher syndrome. One mutated copy is typically inherited from each parent, who are each referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition usually do not have any signs or symptoms. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to not be a carrier and not be affected."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Microcystic adnexal carcinoma ?","output":"Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare tumor of the skin that most often develops in the head and neck region, particularly in the middle of the face, though it may occur in the skin of other parts of the body as well. The average age of diagnosis is 56. This tumor is often first noticed as a bump or yellowish spot in the skin. Though microcystic adnexal carcinomas frequently grow into and disturb nearby tissues and is therefore considered an invasive cancer, this type of tumor rarely spreads to more distant parts of the body (metastasizes). The main treatment for microcystic adnexal carcinoma is Mohs micrographic surgery, which is thought to improve the chances that all of the tumor cells are removed during surgery."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Microcystic adnexal carcinoma ?","output":"What are the symptoms of microcystic adnexal carcinoma?

Unfortunately, because microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare cancer, there is currently not enough information to determine if radiation therapy is an effective treatment for this disease. There are no guidelines for the use of radiation therapy as treatment for microcystic adnexal carcinoma, and little is known about the dose of radiation that might be needed to be effective. Two articles studying a total of 17 patients receiving radiation therapy for microcystic adnexal carcinoma have suggested that there may be a benefit of radiation therapy for decreasing the chances of the tumor regrowing (recurrence), and the authors suggest that this treatment could be considered if there is evidence that cancer cells remain after surgery, or in situations where additional surgery cannot be done. However, another article raises concerns about the use of radiation therapy considering the small number of patients studied, the report of one patient's disease potentially worsening after radiation therapy, and the belief that exposure to radiation may be a risk factor for the initial development of this tumor."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Cataract congenital Volkmann type ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Cataract congenital Volkmann type?

Severity can range considerably from being almost invisible when covered with clothes, to the shoulder being elevated over 5 centimeters, with neck webbing. Signs and symptoms may include a lump in the back of the base of the neck and limited movement in the shoulder or arm. The condition may also be associated with other skeletal (bone or cartilage) or muscular abnormalities. Sprengel deformity typically occurs sporadically for no apparent reason but autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported. It is caused by an interruption of normal development and movement of the scapula during early fetal growth (probably between the 9th and 12th weeks of gestation). Treatment often includes physical therapy, but severe cases may require surgery to improve cosmetic appearance and scapular function."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Sprengel deformity ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Sprengel deformity? Signs and symptoms of Sprengel deformity can vary depending on the severity and whether additional skeletal or muscular abnormalities are present. Some people may not have noticeable signs or symptoms. It more commonly occurs on the left side, but can occur on both sides (bilaterally). In addition to shoulder asymmetry, the elevated shoulder blade may cause a lump in the back of the base of the neck; underdeveloped or incomplete muscles in the surrounding area; and limited movement of the shoulder and arm on the affected side. Some people have bone, cartilage or fiber- like tissue between the shoulder blade and the spinal bones (vertebrae) next to it.

Treatment of Sprengel deformity depends on the degree of functional impairment and/or cosmetic disfigurement. Many people with Sprengel deformity do not need surgery and may have physical therapy to maintain range of motion and strengthen weak muscles. For those who do require surgery, the goals are to release the binding of the scapula and relocate the scapula. Surgery can improve the cosmetic appearance and contour of the neck, and improve the scapular function when it is severely impaired. However, the ability to increase shoulder abduction is limited. For surgical indication, many experts refer to the Cavendish classification - one method used for grading the severity of Sprengel deformity. This method classifies the condition into grades I through IV, with grade I being the most mild (almost invisible when covered with clothes) and grade IV being the most severe (with over 5 centimeters of elevation of the shoulder, and neck webbing). Although no improvement or worsening has been reported in untreated grade I and II cases, surgery is recommended in grade III and IV deformities. However, the Cavendish classification may be subjective and inaccurate since it is based on the structure of the deformity (rather than function) and aesthetic criteria. The optimal age for surgery is controversial, but most experts recommend that it be done before age 8 to obtain the best surgical result. There are several surgical options that may be considered depending on each person's situation. Many of the surgical procedures for Sprengel deformity leave unsightly scars, so the cosmetic improvement must be carefully considered."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Congenital intrauterine infectionlike syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Congenital intrauterine infection-like syndrome?

For example, OPCA associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 3 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most types of inherited OPCA are associated with spinocerebellar ataxias that follow autosomal dominant inheritance. Sporadic OPCA refers to when the condition occurs for unknown reasons, or when there is no evidence of a genetic basis. Some people with sporadic OPCA will eventually develop multiple system atrophy (MSA).

The muscle pain is often confused with fibromyalgia and the joint pain is sometimes confused with gout. The pain symptoms are usually the result of inflammation in the lining of the abdomen, lungs, joints, heart, pelvis, and/or in the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Headaches and amyloidosis may also occur. The majority of people with FMF experience their first episode by age 20. The frequency of such attacks is highly variable and the interval between attacks ranges from days to years. The frequency and symptoms experienced during an attack may also change over time.

FMF is almost always inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. As many as 1 in 5 people of Sephardic (non-Ashkenazi) Jewish, Armenian, Arab and Turkish heritage are carriers for FMF. In rare cases, this condition appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with FMF inherited in an autosomal dominant manner has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child. In some cases, FMF may appear to be autosomal dominant when it is actually autosomal recessive. This phenomenon is called pseudodominance. This may happen in families if one parent is an unaffected, unknown carrier (with 1 mutation) and the other parent is affected (with 2 mutations). It may appear that an affected child inherited FMF from only the affected parent, when in fact he/she inherited one mutation from each parent."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Familial Mediterranean fever ?","output":"How is familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) diagnosed? In making a diagnosis of FMF, doctors take all of these factors into account: Whether the person has the clinical symptoms common for the disease and whether the symptoms are recurrent. How he or she responds to colchicine treatment. Usually a positive family history in people of Middle Eastern ancestry. The results of genetic testing. Also helpful in establishing a correct diagnosis of FMF is the person's ancestry. Testing for the following can also be helpful: Elevated white blood cell count, which is an indication of an immune response. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which is an indication of an inflammatory response. Elevated plasma fibrinogen, which helps stop bleeding. An elevated amount would indicate that something might be wrong with this mechanism. Elevated serum haptoglobin, which would indicate that red blood cells are being destroyed, a common occurrence in rheumatic diseases, such as FMF. Elevated C-reactive protein, which is a special type of protein, produced by the liver, that is only present during episodes of acute inflammation. Elevated albumin in the urine, which is demonstrated by urinalysis. The presence of the protein albumin in the urine can be a symptom of kidney disease, along with microscopic hematuria (very small - microscopic - amounts of blood or blood cells in the urine), during attacks. Is genetic testing for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) available? Yes. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic testing for this condition. We strongly recommend that you work with a genetics professional if you wish to pursue genetic testing."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Familial Mediterranean fever ?","output":"How might familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) be treated? Currently, there is no known cure for FMF. Physicians can only treat the symptoms of the disease. A common therapy for FMF is daily use of the drug colchicine, a medicine that reduces inflammation. Many people require colchicine for life. This therapy has been successful in preventing attacks of fever in 75 percent of those who take the drug regularly. Over 90 percent of people with FMF demonstrate a marked improvement. Even if colchicine does not prevent the fever attacks, it does prevent the amyloidosis. However, compliance in taking colchicine every day is very important. If a person stops taking the drug, an attack can occur within a few days. Complications of colchicine use can also occur and include muscle weakness (myopathy) and a toxic epidermal necrolysis-like reaction. Since the gene that causes FMF codes for the protein pyrin, researchers hope that by studying how this protein works they will ultimately develop improved treatments for FMF, and possibly for other conditions involving excess inflammation."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia ?","output":"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) occurs when your immune system makes antibodies that attack your red blood cells.

The treatment of PAP varies from case to case depending upon the age of an affected individual and severity of the disease. Approximately one-third of individuals with idiopathic PAP (of unknown cause) will improve without treatment (spontaneous remission). The other two-thirds may be treated by a whole lung lavage, a procedure in which one lung is cleansed with a salt solution while the other is pumped with pure oxygen. In some cases, the procedure may need to be performed once; in others it may need to be repeated many times over several years. In secondary PAP (due to environmental exposure or an underlying disorder), removal and avoidance of the causative agent (e.g., silica exposure) or treatment of the underlying disorder may improve symptoms. Inhaled GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), a blood-stimulating medication, has been shown to improve the condition in some individuals with PAP. Lung transplantation has been used to treat adults with PAP as a last resort.

Most experts feel that fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy are separate disorders but they have many similarities and some experts group these disorders together. Fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy can be distinguished from each other by electron microscopy; the 'fibrils' that characterize fibrillary glomerulonephritis are smaller and randomly oriented as opposed to the larger and organized fibrils of immunotactoid glomerulopathy which also have microtubule formations. Both disorders probably result from deposits derived from immunoglobulins but in most cases the cause is idiopathic (unknown). The signs and symptoms are similar in both diseases and may include blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the urine, kidney insufficiency and high blood pressure. Fibrillary glomeurlonephritis is much more common than immunotactoid glomerulopathy. Both fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy have been associated with hepatitis C virus infection and with malignancy and autoimmune disease, but immunotactoid glomerulopathy patients have a greater predisposition to chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B cell lymphomas. All patients should be screened for these conditions. It is also important to rule out another disease known as amyloidosis. When the fibrils are stained with an acid dye known as \\"Congo red\\" the results are negative. In amyloidosis the results are positive because the dye is absorbed by the amyloids.

It is characterized by a noncancerous mass or tumor. There are two types of PVNS: the local or nodular form (where the tumor involves the tendons that support the joint, or in one area of the joint) and the diffuse form (where the entire lining of the joint is involved). Symptoms might include: pain, limitation of movement, and locking of the joint. In some cases, the normal joint structure can be destroyed. The knee is most commonly affected by this condition, though it can occur in other joints such as the hip, shoulder, elbow, ankle, wrist, and rarely the jaw. The average age of diagnosis for this condition is 35 years. The cause of PVNS is grossly unknown. Treatment involves surgery to remove the tumor and damaged portions of the synovium."},{"instruction":"What causes Pigmented villonodular synovitis ?","output":"What causes pigmented villonodular synovitis? The exact cause of pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is unknown. Some doctors believe that it is similar to arthritis, arising from swelling (inflammation) of the joint tissue. Others believe it develops like a tumor, caused by cells growing and multiplying more quickly than usual. The association between a history of trauma and the development of PVNS is unclear. One study found that 56% of individuals with PVNS had a history of previous trauma, while other studies have found a much lower incidence. There have been studies suggesting that PVNS could be caused by specific genetic changes in the cells lining the joint.

Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is diagnosed via physician examination, imaging studies, and sometimes surgical procedures. Imaging studies commonly used include: X-ray, MRI, and CT scan. MRI findings are diagnostic in more than 95% of patients. CT scan findings are additionally often diagnostic, though they might not show the extent of the disease. Other methods that might be utilized in the diagnostic process include joint aspiration, in which a needle is used to remove fluid from the joint and a biopsy, in which a small operation is completed to obtain a tissue sample."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Pigmented villonodular synovitis ?","output":"How might pigmented villonodular synovitis be treated? Pigmented villonodular synovitis is first treated with surgery to remove as much of the abnormal tissue growth as possible.

In most cases, chromosome 3p- syndrome occurs for the first time in the affected person (de novo mutation). However, the deletion is rarely inherited from a parent. In these cases, the deletion is passed down in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that a person with chromosome 3p- syndrome has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing the condition on to his or her child. In theory, it is possible for a parent to not have the deletion in their chromosomes on a blood test, but have the deletion in some of their egg or sperm cells only. This phenomenon is called germline mosaicism. In these rare cases, it would be possible to have another child with the deletion.

There are several different specialized tests that can be used to diagnose a chromosome 3p- syndrome. These include: Karyotype - a karyotype is a laboratory test that produces an image of a person's chromosomes. This test can be used to diagnose large deletions. FISH - a laboratory technique that is used to detect and locate a specific DNA sequence on a chromosome. During FISH, a chromosome is exposed to a small DNA sequence called a probe that has a fluorescent molecule attached to it. The probe sequence binds to its corresponding sequence on the chromosome. This test can be used in combination with karyotyping for deletions that are too small to be seen on karyotype, alone. However, FISH is only useful if the person ordering the test suspects there is a duplication of a specific region of 3p.

Many cases of epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI) are sporadic. This means they result from a new mutation in one of the responsible genes (KRT1 or KRT10), in people with no family history of EI. However, while people with sporadic EI did not inherit the condition from a parent, they may still pass the condition on to their children. Inherited cases of EI usually have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This means that having a mutation in only one copy of KRT1 or KRT10 in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation. Typically, EI due to a new mutation will follow autosomal dominant inheritance in subsequent generations. Very rarely, EI caused by mutations in the KRT10 gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Spastic paraplegia 39 ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Spastic paraplegia 39?

It may involve one bone (monostotic) or multiple bones (polyostotic). Fibrous dysplasia can affect any bone in the body. The most common sites are the bones in the skull and face, the long bones in the arms and legs, the pelvis, and the ribs. Though many individuals with this condition do not have any symptoms, others may have bone pain, abnormally shaped bones, or an increased risk of fractures (broken bones). This condition can occur alone or as part of a genetic disorder, such as McCune-Albright syndrome. While there is no cure for fibrous dysplasia, the symptoms can be treated. Medications known as bisphosphonates can reduce pain and surgery may be indicated for fractures or to correct misshapen bones."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Fibrous dysplasia ?","output":"What are the symptoms of fibrous dysplasia? Fibrous dysplasia may cause no symptoms, mild symptoms, or severe symptoms. The most common symptoms are bone pain, bone deformities, fractures, and skin pigmentation differences (light brown spots on the skin). The problems that a person experiences depend on the specific bone(s) affected. For example, if the legs are of different lengths, they might limp when they walk; if the bones in the sinuses are affected, chronic sinus congestion may be a present. In rare cases, fibrous dysplasia is associated with abnormalities in the hormone-producing glands of the endocrine system. This may lead to precocious puberty, hyperthyroidism (excess thyroid hormone production), excess growth hormone (gigantism or acromegaly), and/or excess cortisol production (Cushing syndrome). If the face or skull bones are affected, hearing or vision loss may occur."},{"instruction":"What causes Fibrous dysplasia ?","output":"What causes fibrous dysplasia? The cause of fibrous dysplasia has been linked to a gene mutation that occurs after conception, in the early stages of fetal development. The mutation involves a gene that affects the cells that produce bone. People with fibrous dysplasia carry this mutation in some, but not all cells of their body. It is not well understood why the mutation occurs, but it is not inherited from a parent, nor can it be passed on to future offspring."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Fibrous dysplasia ?","output":"How might fibrous dysplasia be treated?

Individuals affected by this condition often have severe movement disorders, abnormal eye movements, autonomic symptoms, and neurological impairment. The condition is caused by mutations in the DDC gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment includes a variety of medications which may result in varying levels of success in individual patients. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy may also be of benefit."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Aromatic Lamino acid decarboxylase deficiency ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency? Symptoms, which typically present during the first year of life, include severe developmental delay, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle stiffness, difficulty moving, and involuntary writhing movements of the limbs (athetosis). This condition may also cause infants to lack energy, feed poorly, startle easily, and have sleep disturbances. Many people with AADC deficiency exprience episodes called oculogyric crises (also called \\"spells\\" or \\"attacks\\"), which are characterized by abnormal rotation of the eyeballs, extreme irritability and agitation, pain, muscle spasms, and uncontrolled movements of the head and neck.. These episodes can last for many hours and can be times of extreme concern for caregivers and family members. AADC deficiency may also affect the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body processes like regulation of blood pressure and body temperature. Autonomic symptoms may include droopy eye lids (ptosis), constriction of the pupils of the eyes (miosis), inappropriate or impaired sweating, nasal congestion, drooling, reduced ability to control body temperature, low blood pressure (hypotension), gastroesophageal reflux, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), fainting (syncope), and cardiac arrest.

Trisomy 17 mosaicism is one of the rarest trisomies in humans. It is often incorrectly called trisomy 17 (also referred to as full trisomy 17), which is when three copies of chromosome 17 are present in all cells of the body. Full trisomy 17 has never been reported in a living individual in the medical literature. Few cases of trisomy 17 mosaicism have been described, most having been detected during pregnancy through a test called amniocentesis. Only a few individuals have had a confirmed diagnosis of trisomy 17 mosaicism after birth. Because the proportion and location of cells with trisomy 17 differs from case to case, the presence and severity of signs and symptoms may vary significantly from person to person."},{"instruction":"What causes Trisomy 17 mosaicism ?","output":"What causes trisomy 17 mosaicism? Trisomy 17 mosaicism can arise due to errors in cell division that occur after conception. For example, at the time of conception, the fetus may actually have trisomy 17 in all of its cells; however, during cell division, some of the cells lose the extra chromosome 17. Alternatively, the fetus may initially have had only two copies of chromosome 17, but due to errors in cell division some of the cells end up with an extra copy of chromosome 17. Either of these two scenarios result in trisomy 17 mosaicism.

It is related to a similar disease known as fibrillary glomerulopathy, which is more common. Both disorders probably result from deposits derived from immunoglobulins, but in most cases the cause is idiopathic (unknown). On electron microscopy, immunotactoid glomerulopathy is characterized by the formation of microtubules which are much larger than the fibrils observed in fibrillary glomerulonephritis (30 to 50 versus 16 to 24 nm in diameter). The signs and symptoms include blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the urine, kidney insufficiency and high blood pressure. Both fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy have been associated with hepatitis C virus infection and with malignancy and autoimmune disease. Also, patients with immunotactoid glomerulopathy have a greater risk to have chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B cell lymphomas and should be screened for all of these conditions.

The mainstay of treatment for IVL is surgery to remove the tumor and its spread throughout the body. The use of anti-estrogen therapy, such as tamoxifen, has also been suggested. Surgery requires the complete removal of the tumor, since incomplete removal may result in a recurrence and hence further surgery or even death. Many affected individuals undergo a hysterectomy; bilateral oophorectomy is also suggested because these tumors are estrogen dependent. Part of a tumor left inside the pelvic veins at the time of hysterectomy can extend towards the right side of the heart, leading to obstruction and other adverse events later in life. The median time between hysterectomy to the diagnosis of IVL with cardiac involvement is 4 years. Once there is cardiac involvement, a patient may require open-heart surgery to remove the IVL from the affected areas."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Menkes disease ?","output":"Menkes disease is a disorder that affects copper levels in the body.

Researchers have considered that changes in the ATM gene may interact with other genes or environmental factors to predispose a person to developing IJT. Some researchers have speculated that diabetes, or pre-diabetes, may be associated with some cases of IJT. However, to our knowledge, this association has not been proven. Others have suggested there may be a developmental cause, such as abnormal formation of vessels in the eye, which could cause abnormalities of the vessels in adulthood.

Small \\"bursts\\" of the laser can be used to seal leaky blood vessels, destroy abnormal blood vessels, seal retinal tears, and destroy abnormal tissue in the back of the eye. Photocoagulation usually is not considered for people with people in Group 1B because of the closeness of the leakage to the fovea, and the good prognosis without treatment.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) may be caused by changes (mutations) in any of several genes. OI is most commonly due to a mutation in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, causing OI types I through IV. These genes play a role in how the body makes collagen, a material that helps to strengthen the bones. The type and severity of OI depends on the effect that the specific mutation has on normal collagen production. OI caused by mutations in these genes is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to mutations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. Other genes in which mutations may be responsible for less common types of OI, some of which have been reported in only one individual or family, include: IFITM5 (type V) SERPINF1 (type VI) CRTAP (type VII) LEPRE1, also called P3H1 (type VIII) PPIB (type IX) SERPINH1 (type X) FKBP10 (type XI) SP7 (type XII) BMP1 (type XIII) TMEM38B (type XIV) WNT1 (type XV) SPARC (type XVII)"},{"instruction":"Osteogenesis imperfecta inherited ?","output":"How is osteogenesis imperfecta inherited? Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of OI. The mutated copy of the gene may be inherited from an affected parent, or it may occur for the first time in an affected person (a de novo mutation). When a person with an autosomal dominant form of OI has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the mutated gene. If the child inherits the mutated gene, the child's symptoms may be milder, or more severe, than those of the parent. Less commonly, OI is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that both copies of the responsible gene in each cell must have a mutation for a person to be affected. The parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition typically are unaffected, but each carry one mutated copy of the gene. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive form of OI have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Osteogenesis imperfecta ?","output":"Is genetic testing available for osteogenesis imperfecta? Genetic testing is available for individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. The rate for detecting mutations in the genes that are responsible for OI varies depending on the type. Carrier testing may be available to relatives of affected individuals if the type of OI, disease-causing gene, and specific mutation in the affected individual are known. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies can be performed by analysis of collagen made by fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at about ten to 12 weeks' gestation if an abnormality of collagen has been identified in cells from the affected individual. Analysis of collagen after an amniocentesis (usually performed at 15-20 weeks gestation) is not useful, because the cells obtained do not produce type I collagen. However, prenatal testing can be performed by analyzing the genes (molecular genetic testing) if the specific mutation has been identified in the affected relative.

The dystonias are a group of movement problems characterized by involuntary, sustained muscle contractions, tremors, and other uncontrolled movements. Focal task-specific dystonia, or FTSD, interferes with the performance of particular tasks, such as writing, playing a musical instrument, or participating in a sport. Additionally, FTSD has been reported in tailors, shoemakers, hair stylists, and people who frequently type or use a computer mouse. While the abnormal movements associated with focal dystonia are usually painless, they can cause high levels of anxiety. The causes of focal dystonia are unknown, although the disorder likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is possible that the different forms of FTSD have different underlying causes. Researchers have found that at least some cases are related to malfunction of the basal ganglia, which are structures deep within the brain that help start and control movement. Most cases of focal dystonia are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the condition in their family. However, at least 10 percent of affected individuals have a family history which seems to follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Focal dystonia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Focal dystonia?

In some affected babies, the space between the skull bones closes too soon (craniosynostosis). This sometimes results in developmental abnormalities. Hypophosphatemic rickets is almost always inherited and may be caused by changes (mutations) in any of several genes. Most commonly it is due to the PHEX gene and inherited in an X-linked dominant manner.

Hypophosphatemic rickets is almost always hereditary and may be caused by mutations in any of several genes. The specific gene involved determines the way it is inherited. Most commonly, it is caused by a mutation in the PHEX gene. Other genes that can be responsible for the condition include the CLCN5, DMP1, ENPP1, FGF23, and SLC34A3 genes. The genes associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets are involved in keeping a proper balance of phosphate in the body. Many of these genes directly or indirectly regulate a protein that normally inhibits the kidneys' ability to reabsorb phosphate into the blood. Mutations affecting the function of these genes increase the production (or reduce the breakdown) of the protein, causing the protein to be overactive. The overactivity of the protein reduces phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to the features of the condition. Rarer, sporadic, acquired cases are sometimes associated with benign (non-cancerous) mesenchymal tumors that decrease resorption of phosphate."},{"instruction":"Hypophosphatemic rickets inherited ?","output":"How is hypophosphatemic rickets inherited? Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition. Because males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene (as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females. If a father has the mutated X-linked gene: all of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome) none of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome) If a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.

Some NR0B1 mutations result in the production of an inactive version of the DAX1 protein, while other mutations delete the entire gene. The resulting shortage of DAX1 disrupts the normal development and function of hormone-producing tissues in the body. The signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occur when endocrine glands do not produce the right amounts of certain hormones."},{"instruction":"Xlinked adrenal hypoplasia congenita inherited ?","output":"How is X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita inherited? X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the altered gene, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. In rare cases, however, females who carry a NR0B1 mutation may experience adrenal insufficiency or signs of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism such as underdeveloped reproductive tissues, delayed puberty, and an absence of menstruation."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Microphthalmia syndromic 9 ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Microphthalmia syndromic 9?

The treatment of autoimmune atrophic gastritis is generally focused on preventing and/or alleviating signs and symptoms of the condition. For example, management is focused on preventing vitamin B12, folate and iron deficiencies in the early stages of the condition. With adequate supplementation of these vitamins and minerals, anemia and other health problems may be avoided. If pernicious anemia is already present at the time of diagnosis, replacement of vitamin B12 is generally recommended via injections. In some cases, endoscopic surveillance may also be recommended due to the increased risk of certain types of cancer. While surgery may be appropriate for the treatment of related cancers, we are not aware of surgical management options or recommendations otherwise. Symptoms of gastritis in general may be managed with prescription or over-the-counter medications (besides antibiotics for H. pylori-associated gastritis) that block or reduce acid production and promote healing. Proton pump inhibitors reduce acid by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid. Examples may include omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, esomeprazole, dexlansoprazole and pantoprazole. Histamine (H-2) blockers reduce the amount of acid released into the digestive tract, which relieves gastritis pain and promotes healing. Examples include ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine and nizatidine. Antacids that neutralize stomach acid and provide pain relief may also be used. We are not aware of dietary guidelines or recommendations for autoimmune atrophic gastritis. Much of the literature on dietary management of gastritis is specific to H. Pylori-associated gastritis. However, people with gastritis in general may find some relief by eating smaller, more-frequent meals; avoiding irritating foods; avoiding alcohol; switching pain relievers; and managing stress."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Carcinoid syndrome ?","output":"Carcinoid syndrome refers to a group of symptoms that are associated with carcinoid tumors (rare, slow-growing tumors that occur most frequently in the gastroinestinal tract or lungs).

In later stages, carcinoid syndrome may damage the heart valves, resulting in symptoms of congestive heart failure. The condition occurs when the carcinoid tumor secretes serotonin or other chemicals into the bloodstream.

Although antibiotics are often prescribed prior to having a correct diagnosis (and may be continued if there is a secondary infection or surrounding cellulitis), antibiotics are generally not helpful for treating uncomplicated cases of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). The best documented treatments for PG are systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporin A. Smaller ulcers may be treated with strong topical steroid creams, steroid injections, special dressings, oral anti-inflammatory antibiotics, and/or other therapies. More severe PG typically requires immunosuppressive therapy (used to decrease the body's immune responses). Combinations of steroids with cytotoxic drugs may be used in resistant cases. There has reportedly been rapid improvement of PG with use of anti-tumor necrosis alpha therapy (such as infliximab), which is also used to treat Crohn's disease and other conditions. Skin transplants and/or the application of bioengineered skin is useful in selected cases as a complementary therapy to immunosuppressive treatment. The use of modern wound dressings is helpful to minimize pain and the risk of secondary infections. Treatment for PG generally does not involve surgery because it can result in enlargement of the ulcer; however, necrotic tissue (dying or dead tissue) should be gently removed.

Symptoms of high blood sugar may include frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue, blurred vision, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands and feet, and weight loss. The exact cause of DM1 is unknown, but having certain \\"variants\\" of specific genes may increase a person's risk to develop the condition. A predisposition to develop DM1 runs in families, but no known inheritance pattern exists. Treatment includes blood sugar control and insulin replacement therapy. Improper control can cause recurrence of high blood sugar, or abnormally low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during exercise or when eating is delayed.

Diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) itself is not inherited, but a predisposition to developing the condition can run in families. While some people with a family history of DM1 may be at an increased risk, most will not have the condition. While the exact cause is not known, some genetic risk factors have been found. The risk of developing DM1 is increased by having certain versions (variants) of genes, which belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. HLA genes have many variations, and people have a certain combination of these variations, called a haplotype. Certain HLA haplotypes are associated with a higher risk of developing DM1, with particular combinations causing the highest risk. However, these variants are also found in the general population, and only about 5% of people with the gene variants develop DM1. Other genes, as well as a variety of other factors, are thought to influence the risk for DM1 also. Because there is no specific inheritance pattern associated with DM1, it is difficult to predict whether another family member will develop the condition. Generally, the risk is higher if a parent or sibling is affected. In some cases, genetic testing can be done to determine if someone who has a family history is at increased risk of developing the condition.

Primary carnitine deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Individuals have two copies of each gene, one of which is inherited from each parent. For an individual to have an autosomal recessive condition, he/she must have a mutation in both copies of the disease-causing gene. The parents of an affected individual, who each likely have one mutated copy, are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers for an autosomal recessive condition have children together, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% risk to not have the condition and not be a carrier."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Primary carnitine deficiency ?","output":"How might primary carnitine deficiency be treated? Most individuals with primary carnitine deficiency are followed by a metabolic doctor as well as a dietician familiar with this condition. Certain treatments may be advised for some children but not others. Treatment is often needed throughout life. The main treatment for this condition is lifelong use of L-carnitine, which is a natural substance that helps body cells make energy. It also helps the body get rid of harmful wastes. L-carnitine can reverse the heart problems and muscle weakness caused by this condition. In addition to L-carnitine, infants and young children with primary carnitine deficiency need to eat frequently to prevent a metabolic crisis. In general, it is often suggested that infants be fed every four to six hours. But some babies need to eat even more frequently than this. Many teens and adults with this condition can go without food for up to 12 hours without problems. Some children and teens benefit from a low-fat, high carbohydrate diet. Any diet changes should be made under the guidance of a metabolic specialist and/or dietician familiar with this condition. Ask your doctor whether your child needs to have any changes in his or her diet. Other treatments usually need to be continued throughout life. Infants and children with this condition need to eat extra starchy food and drink more fluids during any illness, even if they may not feel hungry, because they could have a metabolic crisis. Children who are sick often do not want to eat. If they wont or cant eat, they may need to be treated in the hospital to prevent serious health problems."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Cataract and cardiomyopathy ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Cataract and cardiomyopathy?

A breathing machine is used to deliver high doses of oxygen and continued pressure called PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) to the damaged lungs. Patients often need to be deeply sedated with medications when using this equipment. Some research suggests that giving medications to temporarily paralyze a person with ARDS will increase the chance of recovery.

The most common form of Tay-Sachs disease begins in infancy. Infants with this disorder typically appear normal until the age of 3 to 6 months, when development slows and muscles used for movement weaken. Affected infants lose motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling. As the disease progresses, infants develop seizures, vision and hearing loss, mental retardation, and paralysis. An eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination, is characteristic of this disorder. Children with this severe form of Tay-Sachs disease usually live only into early childhood. Other forms of Tay-Sachs disease are much rarer. Signs and symptoms can begin in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood and are usually milder than those seen with the infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease. As in the infantile form, mental abilities and coordination are affected. Characteristic features include muscle weakness, loss of muscle coordination (ataxia) and other problems with movement, speech problems, and mental illness.

Tay-Sachs disease is caused by mutations in the HEXA gene. The HEXA gene provides instructions for making part of an enzyme called beta-hexosaminidase A, which plays a critical role in the brain and spinal cord. This enzyme is located in lysosomes, which are structures in cells that break down toxic substances and act as recycling centers. Within lysosomes, beta-hexosaminidase A helps break down a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside. Mutations in the HEXA gene disrupt the activity of beta-hexosaminidase A, which prevents the enzyme from breaking down GM2 ganglioside. As a result, this substance accumulates to toxic levels, particularly in neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Progressive damage caused by the buildup of GM2 ganglioside leads to the destruction of these neurons, which causes the signs and symptoms seen in Tay-Sachs disease,"},{"instruction":"TaySachs disease inherited ?","output":"How is Tay-Sachs disease inherited?

Cartilage is a tough but flexible tissue that covers the ends of bones at a joint, and gives shape and support to other parts of the body. Ear involvement is the most common feature, but a variety of other areas of the body may be affected, including the costal (rib) cartilage, eyes, nose, airways, heart, vascular (veins) system, skin, joints, kidney, and nervous system. The signs and symptoms vary from person to person depending on which parts of the body are affected. The exact underlying cause of RP is unknown; however, scientists suspect that it is an autoimmune condition. The primary goals of treatment for people with RP are to relieve present symptoms and to preserve the structure of the affected cartilage."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Relapsing polychondritis ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Relapsing polychondritis? Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is characterized by recurrent inflammation of cartilage (the tough but flexible tissue that covers the ends of bones at a joint) and other tissues throughout the body. The features of the condition and the severity of symptoms vary significantly from person to person, but may include: Ear: The ears are the most commonly affected body part. Symptoms include a sudden onset of pain, swelling, and tenderness of the cartilage of one or both ears. The pinna usually loses firmness and becomes floppy; hearing impairment may also occur. Inflammation of the inner ear may also cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and/or ataxia. Joint: The second most common finding is joint pain with or without arthritis. Eye: Affected people may experience episcleritis, uveitis and/or scleritis. Scleritis may lead to a bluish or dark discoloration of the sclera (white of the eye) and may even be associated with vision loss in severe cases. Proptosis (bulging out of one or both eye balls) may also be a symptom of RP. Nose: Nasal cartilage inflammation may lead to stuffiness, crusting, rhinorrhea, epistaxis (nose bleeds), compromised sense of smell and/or saddle nose deformity (a condition where the nose is weakened and thus \\"saddled\\" in the middle). Airways: Inflammation may affect the larynx, trachea (windpipe), and bronchi (tubes that branch off the trachea and carry air to the lungs). Airway involvement may lead to a cough, wheezing, hoarseness and recurrent infections. It can become life-threatening if not properly diagnosed and managed. Less commonly, RP may affect the heart, kidneys, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and/or vascular (veins) system. Nonspecific symptoms such as fever, weight loss, malaise, and fatigue may also be present. In approximately one third of affected people, RP is associated with other medical problems. Conditions reportedly associated with RP include hematological disease (including Hodgkin's lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndromes); gastrointestinal disorders (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis); endocrine diseases (including diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroid disorders) and others. Episodes of RP may last a few days or weeks and typically resolve with or without treatment. However, it is generally progressive, and many people have persistent symptoms in between flares.

The exact underlying cause of relapsing polychondritis (RP) is unknown. However, scientists suspect that it is an autoimmune condition. It it thought that RP occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own cartilage and other tissues. In general, autoimmune conditions are complex traits that are associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. There is also evidence to suggest that some people may be born with a genetic susceptibility to RP. Studies have found that people with RP are roughly twice as likely as those without this condition to carry a certain genetic allele called HLA-DR4. \\"HLA\\" stands for human leukocyte antigen, which is an important part of our immune system and plays a role in resistance and predisposition (risk) to disease. However, HLA genes are not solely responsible for specific diseases but instead may simply contribute along with other genetic or environmental factors to disease risk. Thus, many people with HLA-DR4 will never develop RP."},{"instruction":"Relapsing polychondritis inherited ?","output":"Is relapsing polychondritis inherited? Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is not passed through families in a clear-cut fashion. Most people with relapsing polychondritis do not have affected relatives. Like many other autoimmune conditions, RP is likely a multifactorial condition which is associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. In general, having a first degree relative (for example a parent, child, or sibling) with an autoimmune condition may increase your personal risk for developing an autoimmune condition. Unfortunately, no specific risk estimates are available for relapsing polychondritis."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Relapsing polychondritis ?","output":"How is relapsing polychondritis diagnosed? There are no tests available that are specific for relapsing polychondritis (RP). A diagnosis is, therefore, generally based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. For example, people may be diagnosed as having RP if they have three or more of the following features: Inflammation of the cartilage of both ears Seronegative (negative for rheumatoid factor) polyarthritis (arthritis that involves 5 or more joints simultaneously) Inflammation of the cartilage of the nose Eye inflammation (conjunctivitis, episcleritis, scleritis, and/or uveitis) Inflammation of the cartilage of the airway Vestibular dysfunction (i.e. vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus) In some cases, a biopsy of affected tissue may be necessary to support the diagnosis."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Relapsing polychondritis ?","output":"How might relapsing polychondritis be treated? The primary goals of treatment for people with relapsing polychondritis (RP) are to relieve present symptoms and to preserve the structure of the affected cartilage. The main treatment for RP is corticosteroid therapy with prednisone to decrease the severity, frequency and duration of relapses. Higher doses are generally given during flares, while lower doses can typically be prescribed during periods of remission. Other medications reported to control symptoms include dapsone, colchicine, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, hydroxychloroquine, cyclosporine and infliximab. People who develop severe heart or respiratory complications may require surgery.

The major feature of these conditions is the loss of large myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. Myelin is an insulating layer, or sheath that forms around nerves, made up of protein and fatty substances, that allows electrical impulses to transmit along the nerve cells. If myelin is damaged, these impulses slow down. Symptoms of HSAN include diminished sensation of pain and its associated consequences of delayed healing, Charcot arthopathies, infections, osteomyelitis, and amputations. They have been categorized into types one through five, although some children do not fit well into this classification and do not all have altered pain sensation and/or autonomic function.[9873] HSAN type I is the most common form of HSAN. It is caused by a mutation in the SPTLC1 gene and inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. HSAN type 2 is caused by mutations in the WNK1 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive . HSAN type 3 (Riley-Day syndrome or familial dysautonomia) is caused by mutations in the IKBKAP gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. HSAN type 4, also called congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), is caused by mutations in the NTRK1 gene and is an autosomal recessive disorder. HSAN type 5 is caused by mutations in the NGFB gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Spondylospinal thoracic dysostosis ?","output":"Spondylospinal thoracic dysostosis is an extremely rare skeletal disorder characterized by a short, curved spine and fusion of the spinous processes, short thorax with 'crab-like' configuration of the ribs, underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), severe arthrogryposis and multiple pterygia (webbing of the skin across joints), and underdevelopment of the bones of the mouth.

In women there is still no consensus about a formal definition, but some of the experts propose that in women it should be defined as a rare, unwanted, and intrusive sexual dysfunction associated with excessive and unremitting genital arousal and engorgement in the absence of sexual interest. The persistent genital arousal usually does not resolve with orgasm and causes personal distress. Features include excessive excitement or excessive genital (lubrication, swelling, and engorgement) or other somatic responses. Causes may be neurological (central or peripheral involving the pudendal nerve), related to medication, vascular, hormonal, psychological or others. Diagnosis of the cause is essential for an adequate patient management. The treatment may include avoiding offending medications, using medications that stabilize nerve transmission and/or effect mood, local topical anesthetic agents, ice and hormonal replacement. More recently PGAD has being described as one component of a broader Restless Genital Syndrome if the PGAD was also associated with urinary frequency/urgency and restless leg syndrome."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Infantile spasms broad thumbs ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Infantile spasms broad thumbs?

The diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis is typically made based on symptoms, blood tests, and a liver biopsy."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Autoimmune hepatitis ?","output":"How might autoimmune hepatitis be treated? Some people with mild forms of autoimmune hepatitis may not need to take medication. Doctors assess each patient individually to determine whether those with mild autoimmune hepatitis should undergo treatment. Treatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early. With proper treatment, autoimmune hepatitis can usually be controlled. In fact, studies show that sustained response to treatment stops the disease from getting worse and may reverse some of the damage. The primary treatment is medicine to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system. Prednisone or other corticosteroids help reduce the inflammation. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are drugs used to treat other autoimmune disorders, which have shown to help patients with autoimmune hepatitis as well. In about seven out of 10 people, the disease goes into remission within 3 years of starting treatment. Remission occurs when symptoms disappear and lab tests show improvement in liver function. Some people can eventually stop treatment, although many will see the disease return. People who stop treatment must carefully monitor their condition and promptly report any new symptoms to their doctor. Treatment with low doses of prednisone or azathioprine may be necessary on and off for years, if not for life. People who do not respond to standard immune therapy or who have severe side effects may benefit from other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenylate mofetil, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus. People who progress to end-stage liver diseasealso called liver failureor cirrhosis may need a liver transplant.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliosis type is caused by changes (mutations) in the PLOD1 gene. This gene encodes an enzyme that helps process molecules which allow collagen to form stable interactions with one another. Collagen is a protein that provides structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. Mutations in the PLOD1 gene lead to reduced levels of functional enzyme which disrupt networks of collagen throughout the body. This weakens the connective tissues and leads to the characteristic signs and symptoms associated with EDS, kyphoscoliosis type."},{"instruction":"EhlersDanlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type inherited ?","output":"Is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, kyphoscoliotic type inherited? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose EhlersDanlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type ?","output":"How is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type diagnosed?

The treatment of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliosis type is focused on preventing serious complications and relieving associated signs and symptoms. For example, physical therapy may be recommended in children with hypotonia and delayed motor development. This treatment can also help improve joint stability. Assistive devices such as braces may be necessary depending on the severity of joint instability. Depending on the severity of the kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis), surgery may be necessary. Because EDS, kyphoscoliosis type is associated with fragile skin with abnormal wound healing, affected people, especially children, may need to wear protective bandages or pads over exposed areas, such as the knees, shins, and forehead. Regular follow-up may be recommended to check for development or progression of abnormalities of the eyes, cardiovascular system, and other parts of the body.

Autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome causes shortening of the long bones in the arms and legs; short fingers and toes; wedge-shaped spinal bones leading to kyphoscoliosis; fused or missing ribs; short stature; and distinctive facial features. Other features may include underdeveloped genitalia; dental problems; kidney or heart defects; or delayed development. This form is caused by mutations in the ROR2 gene. Autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome causes more mild, but similar, features. There are rarely spine and rib abnormalities, and short stature is less severe. A variant type of this form is additionally characterized by osteosclerosis. Autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome may be caused by a mutation in the WNT5A or DVL1 gene.

It is characterized by enlargement of the esophagus, impaired ability of the esophagus to push food down toward the stomach (peristalsis), and failure of the ring-shaped muscle at the bottom of the esophagus (the lower esophageal sphincter) to relax. Achalasia is typically diagnosed in individuals between 25 and 60 years of age. The exact etiology is unknown, however, symptoms are caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus. Familial studies have shown evidence of a potential genetic influence. When a genetic influence is suspected, achalasia is called familial esophageal achalasia. Treatment is aimed at reducing the pressure at the lower esophageal sphincter and may include Botox, medications, or surgery."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Achalasia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of achalasia? Most people with achalasia experience difficulty swallowing, also known as dysphagia and heartburn. Other symptoms might include: regurgitation or vomiting, noncardiac chest pain, odynophagia (painful swallowing), and pain in the upper central region of the abdomen. Non esophageal symptoms might include: coughing or asthma, chronic aspiration (breathing a foreign object such as food into the airway), hoarseness or sore throat, and unintentional weight loss."},{"instruction":"What causes Achalasia ?","output":"What causes achalasia? The lower esophageal sphincter, the ring-shaped muscle at the bottom of the esophagus, normally relaxes during swallowing. In people with achalasia, this muscle ring does not relax as well. The reason for this problem is damage to the nerves of the esophagus. In some people, this problem appears to be inherited. There is additionally a suspected autoimmune component involved in the development of achalasia as individuals with achalasia are more likely to have a concomitant autoimmune disease than the general population."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Achalasia ?","output":"How is achalasia diagnosed? Achalasia is suspected in individuals with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and in instances where regurgitation symptoms are not responsive to protein pump inhibitor medication. The diagnosis of achalasia is confirmed by manometry (test that measures how well the esophagus is working); however, other tests such as upper endoscopy and upper GI X-ray can additionally be useful."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Achalasia ?","output":"How might achalasia be treated? The aim of treatment is to reduce the pressure at the lower esophageal sphincter. Therapy may involve: Injection with botulinum toxin (Botox) to help relax the sphincter muscles (used as a temporary fix) Medications, such as long-acting nitrates (i.e. isosorbide dinitrate) or calcium channel blockers (i.e. nifedipine), to relax the lower esophagus sphincter Surgery (Heller myotomy) to decrease the pressure in the lower sphincter Pneumatic balloon dilation of the esophagus at the location of the narrowing (done during esophagogastroduodenoscopy) You can learn more about these treatment options by clicking on the following links: eMedicine Esophageal Motility Disorders Merck Manuals Motility Disorders A doctor should help to determine the best treatment for each individual situation."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa syndrome ?","output":"Neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) syndrome is characterized by a variety of signs and symptoms that mainly affect the nervous system.

The stiffness of the hair in uncombable hair syndrome (UHS) is likely due to the triangular shape of the hair shaft that is seen in cross section in affected people. It has been suggested that the condition may result from premature keratinization (development of keratin) of the inner root sheath, which forms the channel for the growing hair. The inner root sheath conforms in configuration to the abnormal outline of the hair shaft. It thus forms an irregular, rigid tube that then alters the shape of the emerging hair. While it is assumed that the condition is autosomal dominant and thus due to changes (mutations) in a gene, no responsible gene has been identified."},{"instruction":"Uncombable hair syndrome inherited ?","output":"Is uncombable hair syndrome inherited? Uncombable hair syndrome (UHS) is thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Autosomal dominant means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation. Reduced penetrance means that not all people with a mutation in the responsible gene will have the condition. For this reason, conditions with reduced penetrance may appear to \\"skip a generation\\" or may appear to occur for the first time (or only once) in a family. While people with UHS often report a negative family history, the characteristic hair shaft abnormality seen in affected people can still be seen in unaffected family members by looking at their hair under a specific type of microscope."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Uncombable hair syndrome ?","output":"How is uncombable hair syndrome diagnosed? A diagnosis of uncombable hair syndrome (UHS) is made by observing the characteristic symptoms of the condition, as well observing the hair shaft under a special microscope.

People with concerns about symptoms of UHS are encouraged to speak with their dermatologist about being evaluated for this condition."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Uncombable hair syndrome ?","output":"How might uncombable hair syndrome be treated? There is no definitive treatment for uncombable hair syndrome, but the condition usually improves or resolves on its own with the onset of puberty. Gentle hair care is generally recommended using conditioners and soft brushes, along with avoiding harsh hair treatments such as permanent waves (perms); chemical relaxants; or excessive brushing and blow drying. These strategies may improve the general manageability of the hair, although how well they work is subjective. Another strategy that has been suggested to improve the appearance of the hair is the use of biotin supplements. One case report suggested significant improvement in hair strength and combability, with an increase in rate of growth after 4 months of supplementation."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Small patella syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Small patella syndrome?

Cholestasis is a condition that impairs the release of bile (a digestive juice) from liver cells. The bile then builds up in the liver, impairing liver function. Symptoms typically become apparent in the third trimester of pregnancy and can include severe itching (pruritus). Occasionally, the skin and the whites of the eyes can have a yellow appearance (jaundice). ICP is additionally associated with risks to the developing baby such as premature delivery and stillbirth. The cause of ICP is largely unknown, although approximately 15% of cases are caused by mutations in either the ABCB11 or ABCB4 genes. Mutations within the ABCB11 and ABCB4 genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Symptoms of ICP are typically limited to pregnancy. Bile flow returns to normal after delivery and the signs and symptoms of the condition disappear, however, they can return during later pregnancies."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy?

Largely, the cause of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is unknown. ICP is present in approximately 1% of pregnancies in the United States. It is thought to be caused by a mixture of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Risk factors include: A personal or family history of cholestasis of pregnancy A history of liver disease A multiple gestation pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc) Approximately 15% of women with ICP have a mutation in either the ABCB11 orABCB4 gene. Mutations within these genes increase the likelihood that a woman will develop ICP. Mutations within the ABCB11 and ABCB4 gene(s) are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that in order to be affected, a person only needs a change in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations within the gene. A person with a mutation in either theABCB11 or ABCB4 gene has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy ?","output":"How is intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy diagnosed?

However, since we are only interested in the proportionality, we can simply add the ratios as they are, because the common denominator will cancel out when we divide the total amount by the sum of the ratios. Let's calculate the sum of the ratios: Sum = (5/11) + (7/15) + (11/19) + (2/9) + (17/23) + (13/29) + (19/31) To find the fifth part, we need to calculate the value of the fifth ratio (17/23) in proportion to the sum of all ratios.

Since he secures 160 marks in total and he scored 176 marks for the correct answers, the marks lost due to wrong answers must account for the difference between these two amounts. So, the total marks lost due to wrong answers is 176 - 160 = 16 marks. Now, we need to find out how many marks he loses for each wrong answer. Since he got 16 questions wrong and lost a total of 16 marks, we divide the total marks lost by the number of wrong answers to find the marks lost per wrong answer.

For the first orientation: - Along the 120 cm side of the floor, we can fit ( frac{120}{50} = 2 ) full tiles (since 120 cm is not exactly divisible by 50 cm, there will be a 20 cm gap left). - Along the 150 cm side of the floor, we can fit ( frac{150}{40} = 3 ) full tiles (since 150 cm is exactly divisible by 40 cm). This gives us a total of ( 2 times 3 = 6 ) tiles for the first orientation.

This follows from the properties of the nine-point circle and the fact that ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) lie on this circle. 4. Suppose the line ( CC_2 ) intersects the line ( AB ) at point ( C_3 ). We aim to prove that (frac{overline{AC_3}}{overline{C_3B}} = frac{tan (2beta)}{tan (2alpha)}). [  overline{C_3 M} = frac{R sin (beta - alpha)(2 sin beta sin alpha - cos gamma)}{cos gamma} = frac{R sin (beta - alpha) cos (beta - alpha)}{cos gamma} ] 5. The length ( overline{C_1E} ) in the rectangle is calculated as: 6. [ overline{C_1E} = 2 R sin alpha sin beta - R cos gamma ] 7. And the length ( overline{C_2E} ) is: 8. [ overline{C_2E} = R sin (beta - alpha) ] 9. The heights about the point ( C_1 ) within the rectangle give the relationship: 10. [ overline{C_3 M} = frac{R sin (beta - alpha)(2 sin beta sin alpha - cos gamma)}{cos gamma} = frac{R sin (beta - alpha) cos (beta - alpha)}{cos gamma} ] 11. Therefore, we can write the ratio: 12. [ frac{overline{AC_3}}{overline{C_3B}} = frac{overline{AM} + overline{MC_3}}{overline{C_3M} + overline{MB}} = frac{sin (2 gamma) + sin 2(alpha - beta)}{sin (2 gamma) - sin 2(alpha - beta)} = frac{tan (2 beta)}{tan (2 alpha)} ] 13. With similar reasoning, we can show: 14.

The center of this rotation must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment AC.     - Similarly, consider the rotation that maps point D onto point B. The center for this rotation must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment BD.  3. **Intersection of Perpendicular Bisectors**:    Since AC and BD are not parallel line segments, their perpendicular bisectors will intersect at exactly one point, say P. This point P is the potential center of rotation. 4. **Analyzing the 90^{circ} Rotation**:    - Look at the scenario where we rotate the segment CD about point P. If we perform a 90^{circ} rotation around P, the images of points C and D will map to new positions. Given that both segments AB and CD are of equal length and arranged in the described fashion, this rotation should map segment CD exactly onto segment AB.     - It's important to note that the perpendicular nature of the segments means that a 90^{circ} rotation will align them perfectly.

He buys 30 bags in total (20 for adults and 10 for children). Since he buys 20 or more bags, he gets a 10% discount on each bag. The original price per bag is 4, so the discount per bag is 10% of 4, which is 0.40. The discounted price per bag is therefore 4 - 0.40 = 3.60. The total cost for 30 bags is 30 bags * 3.60/bag = 108. Next, let's calculate the packaging cost for 30 bags. The packaging cost per bag is 0.50, so the total packaging cost is 30 bags * 0.50/bag = 15.

For xin(0,x_{1}) and xin(x_{2},+infty) we have f'(x) < 0, and for xin(x_{1},x_{2}), we have f'(x) > 0. Therefore, f(x) has a minimum at x_{1} and a maximum at x_{2}, which means f(x) has two extreme points. In summary, when a geq frac{1}{8}, f(x) has no extreme points; when 0 < a < frac{1}{8}, f(x) has two extreme points. (II) As we know from part (I), f(x) has a minimum at x_{1} and a maximum at x_{2} only when a in (0, frac{1}{8}). Also, x_{1} and x_{2} are the solutions to the equation 2ax^{2}-x+1=0. Then x_{1}+x_{2}=frac{1}{2a} and x_{1}x_{2}=frac{1}{2a}. We calculate f(x_{1})+f(x_{2}) as follows: begin{align*} f(x_{1})+f(x_{2}) & =ln frac{1}{2x_{1}} - ax_{1}^{2} + x_{1} + ln frac{1}{2x_{2}} - ax_{2}^{2} + x_{2}  & =-ln 2x_{1} -ln 2x_{2} - a(x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}) + (x_{1}+x_{2})  & =ln frac{a}{2} - frac{1}{4a} + 1 + frac{1}{2a}  & =ln a + frac{1}{4a} + 1 -ln 2. end{align*} Let g(a) = ln a + frac{1}{4a} + 1 -ln 2 for a in (0, frac{1}{8}). The derivative of g(a) is g'(a) = frac{1}{a} - frac{1}{4a^{2}}=frac{4a-1}{4a^{2}} < 0, thus g(a) is a decreasing function on (0, frac{1}{8}), and g(a) > g(frac{1}{8}). Therefore, g(a) > ln frac{1}{8} + 3 -ln 2 = 3-4ln 2. Hence, boxed{f(x_{1})+f(x_{2}) > 3-4ln 2}."},{"instruction":"Sally had 13 peaches left at her roadside fruit stand.

To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s For the first train: 74 kmph = 74 * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 74000 m / 3600 s ≈ 20.56 m/s For the second train: 92 kmph = 92 * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 92000 m / 3600 s ≈ 25.56 m/s Now, since the trains are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.

Before applying the discount and tax, the revenue from selling 100 articles would be: 100 articles * 1.30/article = 130 Now, the shopkeeper offers an additional 10% discount on the total revenue. The discount amount is: 10% of 130 = 0.10 * 130 = 13 The revenue after the discount is: 130 - 13 = 117 Next, the shopkeeper has to pay a tax of 15% on the total revenue after the discount.

Step 1: Pour one-third the coffee from Cup 1 to Cup 2 - Amount of coffee transferred from Cup 1 to Cup 2 = frac{3}{3} = 1 ounce. - **Cup 1:** 3 - 1 = 2 ounces of coffee. - **Cup 2:** 7 ounces of milk + 1 ounce of coffee = 8 ounces total.  Step 2: Stir Cup 2 and pour one-quarter back to Cup 1 - Total liquid in Cup 2 before pouring back = 8 ounces. - Amount of liquid transferred back to Cup 1 = frac{8}{4} = 2 ounces. Since the liquid in Cup 2 is a mixture of 1 ounce of coffee to 7 ounces of milk, the composition of the mixture is frac{1}{8} coffee and frac{7}{8} milk. When transferring 2 ounces back to Cup 1, the amounts of coffee and milk transferred are: - Coffee transferred back = 2 times frac{1}{8} = frac{1}{4} ounce. - Milk transferred back = 2 times frac{7}{8} = 1.75 ounces.  Final Composition in Cup 1: - Coffee in Cup 1 = 2 ounces (remaining from initial) + frac{1}{4} ounce (transferred back) = 2.25 ounces. - Milk in Cup 1 = 1.75 ounces (transferred back).

This follows from the construction conditions and the fact that (Y) and (C) are both perpendicular projections relative to similar sides of the square.    - Consequently, (BY = CD). Thus, the distance from (B) to (Y) equals the distance from (C) to (D). 5. **Completing the Square Construction:**    - We have established point (Y), which lies on the perpendicular from (B).    - Draw line (AY) as one side of the square.    - From point (C), draw a line perpendicular to (AY). This line will intersect (Y) at (D), if extending from (B) parallel to (AY). 6. **Final Lines and Square:**    - To finalize the square, extend lines from points (C) and (D) perpendicular to line (L).    - Join these intersections ensuring to maintain right angles and equal lengths to complete the geometry of the square. # Conclusion By using properties of perpendicular projections and congruent triangles, we accurately determine precise locations of the points on the square.

If ( x_1 = 0 pmod{2^s} ), then ( x_1 = 0 ) or ( 2^s pmod{2^{s+1}} ).    - So either ( f(x_0) = 0 ) or ( f(x_0 + 2^s) = 0 pmod{2^{s+1}} ), and the induction is complete. 4. Suppose the contrary of the problem's claim, so there exist finitely many ( x ) such that ( f(x) ) is ziba. Name them ( r_1, r_2, ldots, r_t ). All the numbers ( f(r_i) ) are finite, so there exists a ( u ) such that ( 2^u > max { f(r_i) } ) and ( u > 11 ). ( f(x) equiv 0 pmod{2^u} ) has a root; so ( f(x) equiv 0 pmod{2^u} ) has a root in the set ({0, 1, 2, ldots, 2^u - 1}) like ( T ) and ( f(0) neq 0 pmod{2^u} ). If ( f(T) = 2^alpha cdot v ) such that ( v ) is odd, we know ( alpha geq u ).    - If ( v leq 2^alpha ), ( f(T) ) would be ziba too by Lemma 2, which is in contrast with the way ( T ) is chosen and the assumption that the problem's claim is wrong.    - If ( v > 2^alpha ), ( 2^u cdot (2^u + 1) leq 2^alpha cdot (2^alpha + 1) leq f(x) leq (2^u - 1)^2 + 2^u + 2021 ), which is again in contrast with ( u > 11 ). So there are infinite natural values for ( x ) such that ( f(x) ) is ziba and the problem is proved.

This can be proven by induction. 4. **Induction proof of the lemma**:    - **Base case**: For (t = 1), (F_{x+1} = F_2F_x + F_1F_{x-1} = 1 cdot F_x + 1 cdot F_{x-1} = F_x + F_{x-1}), which is true by the definition of the Fibonacci sequence.    - **Inductive step**: Assume the lemma holds for some (t = k), i.e., (F_{x+k} = F_{k+1}F_x + F_kF_{x-1}). We need to show it holds for (t = k+1):      [      F_{x+k+1} = F_{x+k} + F_{x+k-1}      ]      Using the inductive hypothesis:      [      F_{x+k} = F_{k+1}F_x + F_kF_{x-1}      ]      [      F_{x+k-1} = F_kF_x + F_{k-1}F_{x-1}      ]      Therefore:      [      F_{x+k+1} = (F_{k+1}F_x + F_kF_{x-1}) + (F_kF_x + F_{k-1}F_{x-1}) = F_{k+2}F_x + F_{k+1}F_{x-1}      ]      This completes the induction proof. 5. **Solve the Diophantine equation**: We need to solve (5F_x - 3F_y = 1).

We need (5 - 3F_{m+1}) to be positive, so (F_{m+1} < frac{5}{3}). The only Fibonacci numbers less than (frac{5}{3}) are 1, so (F_{m+1} = 1).

It will be visited only if it is adjacent to a town with a lower number or if it is the starting point of the 100th trip. 4. **Inductive Step:**    - Suppose we remove the town numbered 100 and its adjacent town (which must be the town with the lowest number adjacent to 100).    - This reduces the problem to 98 towns and we need to ensure that each of these 98 towns is visited twice. 5. **Maximizing Roads:**    - To maximize the number of roads, we need to ensure that each town is connected to as many other towns as possible while maintaining the condition that each town is visited twice.    - The maximum number of roads in a complete graph with n vertices is given by frac{n(n-1)}{2}. 6. **Constructing the Graph:**    - We can construct a graph where each town i (for i leq 49) is adjacent to all towns numbered greater than i.    - This ensures that each town is visited twice and maximizes the number of roads. 7. **Calculating the Number of Roads:**    - For n = 100, the maximum number of roads in a complete graph is frac{100 times 99}{2} = 4950.    - However, we need to ensure that each town is visited exactly twice, which means we need to remove some roads to maintain this condition. 8. **Final Calculation:**    - By removing the town numbered 100 and its adjacent town, we reduce the problem to 98 towns.    - The number of roads in a complete graph with 98 towns is frac{98 times 97}{2} = 4753.    - Adding back the roads involving the town numbered 100, we get 4753 + 98 = 4851.

We need to analyze the conditions that guarantee the product of 3 numbers is a perfect cube. 6. **Conditions for forming a perfect cube:**     - If ( N(i, j) geq 3 ) for some ((i, j)), then these three numbers' product is a perfect cube.     - If there exists an ( i ) such that ( N(i, 0) cdot N(i, 1) cdot N(i, 2) neq 0 ), the product of these three is a perfect cube.     - If there exists a ( j ) such that ( N(0, j) cdot N(1, j) cdot N(2, j) neq 0 ), the product of these three is a perfect cube.     - If there exists nonzero ( N(i_1, j_1) ), ( N(i_2, j_2) ), and ( N(i_3, j_3) ) such that ({i_1, i_2, i_3} = {j_1, j_2, j_3} = {0, 1, 2}). 7. **Analysis using the pigeonhole principle:**     Since we have 9 types and 9 integers in S, at least 5 of these ( N(i, j) ) are non-zero. Given ( N(i, j) leq 2 ), there's no repetition of more than 2 numbers in any type. 8. **Deriving the condition:**     - No three from that subset can have the same ( i ) or ( j ). Thus, by placing each nonzero ( N(i, j) ) in a ( 3 times 3 ) array, we can guarantee three boxes whose rows and columns are distinct, satisfying condition 4. # Second Solution: 1. **Reiteration:**     Up to (dagger), proceed as previously. We have nine types of the form ((a mod 3, b mod 3)). 2. **Set definitions:**     - Let ( T ) be the set of types.     - Let ( N(i) ) denote integers of the form ((i, cdot)).     - Let ( M(i) ) denote the count of ( j in {0, 1, 2} ) such that ((i, j) in T). 3. **Case analysis:**     - If ( N(i) geq 5 ) for some ( i ), the result from (i) ensures 3 integers sum to 0 mod 3.     - If some permutation ((i, j, k)) of ((0, 1, 2)) yields:        [       N(i) geq 3, quad N(j) geq 3, quad N(k) geq 1       ]     - If ( M(i) ) or ( M(j) ) is 1 or 3, the result follows from (ii). 4. **Finding a pattern:**     - We must have at least one ( (k, x), (k, y) ) or ( (k, z) in T ). This compatibility ensures the selection of types such that the sum condition in mod 3 is met, producing three integers whose product is a perfect cube.

Hence it holds true.  5. **For the remaining type (emeralds)**:    - The remaining two boxes should contain emeralds.    - The total number of jewels in these two remaining boxes should be calculated. 6. **Calculate total number of emeralds**:    - Since the boxes with rubies and diamonds have been identified, the remaining jewels must be emeralds.    - The total count of emeralds = 5 + 7 = 12. # Conclusion: Thus, the total number of emeralds in the boxes is: [boxed{12}]"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = frac{1}{2}ax^2^  (2a + 1)x + 2lnx, where a ∈ R: 1.

Prove that for any x₁ ∈ (0, 2], there exists x₂ ∈ (0, 2] such that f(x₁) < g(x₂) when a > 0, where g(x) = (x^2^  2x)e^x^.","output":"1. Since f(x) = frac{1}{2}x^2^ - 3x + 2lnx, x > 0,    The derivative f'(x) = x - 3 + frac{2}{x} = frac{(x - 1)(x - 2)}{x}.    Let f'(x) = 0, we get x = 1 or x = 2.    When f'(x) > 0, we get 0 < x < 1 or x > 2.    When f'(x) < 0, we get 1 < x < 2.    Therefore, the function is increasing on intervals (0, 1) and (2, +∞), and decreasing on (1, 2). 2. For the proposition to hold true, we need f(x)~max~ < g(x)~max~ when x ∈ (0, 2]. Since g'(x) = (x^2^ - 2)e^x^,    we know that when x ∈ (0, 2], g(x) is decreasing on interval (0, sqrt{2}) and increasing on (sqrt{2}, 2].    Since g(0) = g(2) = 0, g(x)~max~ = 0.    Thus, we only need f(x)~max~ < 0.    For function f(x), f'(x) = ax - (2a + 1) + frac{2}{x} = frac{(ax - 1)(x - 2)}{x}.    ① When frac{1}{a} ≥ 2, i.e., 0 < a ≤ frac{1}{2}, function f(x) is increasing on interval x ∈ (0, 2].    So, f(x)~max~ = f(2) = -2a - 2 + 2ln2 < 0.    Thus, a > ln2 - 1, i.e., 0 < a ≤ frac{1}{2}.    ② When 0 < frac{1}{a} < 2, i.e., a > frac{1}{2}, function f(x) is increasing on interval (0, frac{1}{a}) and decreasing on (frac{1}{a}, 2].    So, f(x)~max~ = f(frac{1}{a}) = -2lna - frac{1}{2a} - 2.    When a ≥ 1, it is obviously less than 0, satisfying the proposition.    When frac{1}{2} < a < 1, let h(a) = -2lna - frac{1}{2a} - 2.    Then h'(a) = frac{1 - 4a}{2a^2}.    We know that this function is decreasing when a ∈ (frac{1}{2}, 1), and h(a) < h(frac{1}{2}) = 2ln2 - 3 < 0, satisfying the proposition.    Thus, a > frac{1}{2} satisfies the proposition. In summary, when a > 0, for any x₁ ∈ (0, 2], there exists x₂ ∈ (0, 2] such that f(x₁) < g(x₂). Alternative method for (2): f(x) = frac{1}{2}ax^2^ - (2a + 1)x + 2lnx = frac{a(x^2 - 4x)}{2} - (x - 2lnx). Since a > 0 and x ∈ (0, 2], frac{a(x^2 - 4x)}{2} < 0. Let h(x) = x - 2lnx, then h'(x) = 1 - frac{2}{x} = frac{x - 2}{x}. So h(x) is decreasing on (0, 2], and h(x) ≥ h(2) = 2 - 2ln2 > 0. Therefore, when a > 0 and x ∈ (0, 2], f(x) < 0. Hence, when a > 0, for any x₁ ∈ (0, 2], there exists x₂ ∈ (0, 2] such that f(x₁) < g(x₂).

This means A, P, B, and R satisfy the properties of a parallelogram: opposite sides are equal and parallel.

We have (PM = QM) and hence (PQ) is symmetric with respect to (M).    - By the construction of (APBR), segments (AP) and (BR) are equal and parallel, and (BP) and (AR) are also equal and parallel.    - Therefore, ( AR ) and ( QC ) must be parallel and equal, as (BP) and (AR) get reflected onto (CQ ).

Since point (O) lies in the plane of this section, the section is an isosceles triangle with base (a sqrt{2}), inscribed in a circle of radius (R). 3. Let the extension of the radius (OP) intersect the segment (AC) at point (M) and the circle at point (K).

Thus, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of the function (V(h) = frac{2}{3} h^2 (2R - h)) on the interval ((0, 2R)).  First Method:     7.

Therefore, the minimum value of f(p) in this interval is at p = frac{3}{4}, which is: [ fleft(frac{3}{4}right) = frac{243}{256} ] Hence, the maximum probability of player B winning (event A) is: [ P(A)_{max} = 1 - frac{243}{256} = frac{13}{256} approx 0.0508 ] Since 0.0508 > 0.05, event A is not necessarily a low probability event when p geq frac{3}{4}.

Since 10% of shakes and cones get an additional 0.3 ounces, we need to find 10% of the total number of shakes and cones sold: 10% of shakes = 10% of 7 = 0.7 shakes (since we can't have a fraction of a shake, we'll consider this as 0 shakes for the complimentary topping) 10% of cones = 10% of 5 = 0.5 cones (since we can't have a fraction of a cone, we'll consider this as 0 cones for the complimentary topping) Since the number of shakes and cones that receive the complimentary topping is less than 1, we won't add any complimentary topping. Now, let's check if they qualify for the 5% discount on the total chocolate syrup used. The total number of shakes, cones, and sundaes sold is: Total items sold = 7 shakes + 5 cones + 3 sundaes = 15 items Since the total number of items sold exceeds 13, they qualify for the 5% discount on the total chocolate syrup used.

We need to show that for every ( n ) satisfying ( 1 leq n leq frac{p}{2} ), the binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{p-2n} ) is divisible by ( n ).        For ( p = 2 ), the only possibility for ( n ) is ( n = 1 ). Since ( binom{1}{2-2 cdot 1} = binom{1}{0} = 1 ), and 1 is divisible by 1, the condition is met.        For odd primes ( p ), consider the binomial identity:    [    (p-2n) cdot binom{n}{p-2n} = n cdot binom{n-1}{p-2n-1}    ]        Examine the terms:    - Since ( p geq 2n ) and ( p ) is prime, both ( p-2n ) and ( n ) are non-zero.    - Let ( d = gcd(p-2n, n) ). Since ( d ) divides ( p ) and ( d leq n < p ), we must have ( d = 1 ) because ( p ) is a prime.     Therefore, ( p-2n ) and ( n ) are relatively prime, which implies ( gcd(p-2n, n) = 1 ). Consequently, ( n ) divides ( (p-2n) binom{n}{p-2n} ), and thus ( n ) divides ( binom{n}{p-2n} ). 2. **Composite Numbers:**        Next, we show that no composite number ( m ) has this property.        - **Case 1: ( m = 2k ) (for ( k > 1 )):**      Pick ( n = k ).

Choose ( n = pk ).      [      frac{m}{3} leq pk leq frac{m}{2}      ]      Compute:      [      frac{1}{n} binom{n}{m-2n} = frac{1}{pk} binom{pk}{p} = frac{(pk-1)(pk-2) cdots (pk-(p-1))}{p!}      ]      The numerator consists of ( p-1 ) terms of the form ( pk - i ) where ( i ) ranges from 1 to ( p-1 ).

According to the problem, the length of the rug is 8 feet longer than its width, so we can write: ( l = w + 8 ) The area of the rug is the product of its length and width, so: ( text{Area of the rug} = l times w ) Since the uniform width between the rug and the room is 8 feet, the dimensions of the room are ( (w + 2 times 8) ) feet by ( (l + 2 times 8) ) feet, or ( (w + 16) ) feet by ( (l + 16) ) feet. The area of the room is then: ( text{Area of the room} = (w + 16) times (l + 16) ) The area of the region uncovered by the rug (shaded region) is the area of the room minus the area of the rug, which is given as 704 square feet: ( text{Area of the shaded region} = text{Area of the room} - text{Area of the rug} = 704 ) Substituting the expressions for the area of the room and the area of the rug, we get: ( (w + 16) times (l + 16) - l times w = 704 ) Substitute ( l ) with ( w + 8 ): ( (w + 16) times (w + 8 + 16) - (w + 8) times w = 704 ) Simplify and solve for ( w ): ( (w + 16) times (w + 24) - w^2 - 8w = 704 ) Expand the left side: ( w^2 + 24w + 16w + 384 - w^2 - 8w = 704 ) Combine like terms: ( 32w + 384 = 704 ) Subtract 384 from both sides: ( 32w = 320 ) Divide by 32: ( w = 10 ) Now that we have the width of the rug, we can find the length: ( l = w + 8 = 10 + 8 = 18 ) Finally, we can calculate the area of the rug: ( text{Area of the rug} = l times w = 18 times 10 = 180 ) square feet.

Evaluating the derivative at x=1, we get     f'(1) = 4 - 2 cdot 1 = 2.    Since f(1) = 4ln(1) - 1^2 = 0 - 1 = -1,    the tangent line at the point (1, f(1)) must have a slope of 2 and pass through the point (1, -1).

A critical point occurs where f'(x) = 0, which happens when 2a - x^2 = 0; solving for x gives     x = sqrt{2a}.     To determine the nature of this critical point, we consider whether f'(x) changes sign as x passes through sqrt{2a}.

We conclude that the function f(x) has a maximum at x = sqrt{2a} since the derivative changes from positive to negative.

Prove that lines A B, C Q, and E P are concurrent at a single point.","output":"1. **Understanding Equal Circles and Midpoint**:     - Circles O_1 and O_2 are equal, implying they have the same radius.     - A and B are the points of intersection of circles O_1 and O_2.     - O is the midpoint of segment AB. 2. **Chord Properties**:     - Line AB is the radical axis of circles O_1 and O_2.     - Since O is the mid-point, O is the center of symmetry of AB.     - Thus, O equidistant from P to D and from Q to F, where P and Q are additional points of intersection defined. 3. **Angles and Congruent Arcs**:     - overline{OP} = overline{OD} and overline{OQ} = overline{OF}.     - The arcs overparen{PF} = overparen{DQ}, so the angles angle PEF = angle QCD. 4. **Drawing Symmetry Chords**:     - Construct the chord CD concerning AB such that it lies on both circles.     - Extend CD to create C'D' in circle O_2, making C' and D' corresponding points.     - Hence, overline{CO} = overline{C'O} and overline{OD} = overline{D'O}. 5. **Parallel and Perpendicular Lines**:     - Draw overline{PD'} and overline{DD'} such that angle PD'D is a right angle.     - Thus, PD' parallel AB making the triangles involved to be symmetrical and similar. 6. **Intersection Analysis**:     - Extend CQ to intersect AB at M and EP to intersect AB at N.     - Join overline{C'N} to analyze intersecting aligned points and circular quadrilaterals. 7. **Cyclic Quadrilateral Context**:     - Points C', D', P, E form a cyclic quadrilateral due to equal angles subtended on the circle.     - Thus, angle C'E O = angle C' D' P = angle C'OA.     - Therefore, the points C', O, N, E lie on a circle. 8. **Similar Triangles**:     - From discovering that the triangles triangle OC'N and triangle OCM are congruent (properties of symmetry and cyclic nature), we obtain that overline{ON} = overline{OM}.     - Hence, N and M coincide, confirming N=M. 9. **Conclusion**:     - This establishes that the lines AB, CQ, and EP intersect at one point, affirming the required proof.
