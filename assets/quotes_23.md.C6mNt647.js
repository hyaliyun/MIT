What is the maximum value of k such that removing any rook from the board leaves at least one marked cell not under attack? 1. **Initial Observation:**    - A rook on a chessboard attacks all cells in its row and column.    - The condition requires that after removing any rook, at least one marked cell must not be under attack by the remaining rooks. 2. **Case Analysis:**    - **Case 1:** At least one rook in each column.      - If there is at least one rook in each column, the entire board is under attack.      - Removing a rook from any column with more than one rook will still leave the entire board under attack.      - Thus, to keep the entire board under attack after removing any rook, each column can have exactly one rook and  k leq 10 .    - **Case 2:** At least one rook in each row.      - By the same logic as in the column case, if each row has exactly one rook,  k leq 10 . 3. **Checking for empty rows or columns:**    - An empty row or column means there is at least one cell not under attack.    - Now we explore setups ensuring no row and column both have no rooks. 4. **Placements ensuring the condition:**    - The total cells belonging to rows or columns containing no rooks must also be taken into account. 5. **Maximize k:**    - To ensure each removal of a rook leaves at least one cell unmarked (not under attack), each rook must uniquely contribute to attacking specific cells.    - If each rook represents a unique row or column, the maximum number of cells contributing to coverage maximizes k. 6. **Arrangements demonstrating k:**    - Example given:       - Place rooks such that no overlap of special covering cells occurs.      - Ensuring each removal leaves a specifically chosen cell uncovered. 7. **Mathematical bounding:**    - If trying scenarios like k<16, potential counts of 8 (rows) + 8 (columns) provide upper bounds analyzing non-overlap strategies effectively. # Conclusion:  From the thorough consideration, we find and verify (k): [ k leq 16 ] Combined examination shows an upper bound when optimally distributing the rooks ensuring coverage maintenance potential. Therefore, the largest ( k ) ensuring post-removal condition fulfillment ideally is: [ boxed{16} ] \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"There are 96 cupcakes for some children to share.

At most how many  k element subsets can we select from  {1,2,dots,n}  such that for any two selected subsets, one of the subsets consists of the  k  smallest elements of their union?","output":"1. **Initial Observation**:    We start by noting that the set { { 1,2,...,k-1,i} mid i=k,k+1,dotsc ,n} consists of n-k+1 k-element subsets that satisfy the given condition. We need to show that there cannot be more than n-k+1 such subsets. 2. **Assumption for Contradiction**:    Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that we can select t > n-k+1 such subsets. Let these t subsets be S_i = { a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, dotsc, a_{i,k} } for i = 1, 2, dotsc, t, where a_{i,1} < a_{i,2} < cdots < a_{i,k} and sum_{j=1}^{k} a_{p,j} leq sum_{j=1}^{k} a_{q,j} when p < q in { 1, 2, dotsc, t }. This implies that S_p contains the k smallest elements of S_p cup S_q for all p < q in { 1, 2, dotsc, t }. 3. **Distinctness of Elements**:    For any p < q in { 1, 2, dotsc, t }, we have a_{p,k} neq a_{q,k} (otherwise { a_{p,1}, a_{p,2}, dotsc, a_{p,k} } = { a_{q,1}, a_{q,2}, dotsc, a_{q,k} }). Also, we have a_{p,k} leq a_{q,k} (otherwise a_{p,k} is not in the k smallest elements of S_p cup S_q). Therefore, a_{1,k} < a_{2,k} < cdots < a_{t,k}. 4. **Bounding the Largest Element**:    From the above, we get a_{t,k} geq t-1 + a_{1,k}. Combining this with the fact that a_{1,1} < a_{1,2} < cdots < a_{1,k}, we get a_{1,k} geq a_{1,1} + k - 1 geq 1 + k - 1 = k. Thus, a_{t,k} geq t-1 + k > (n-k+1) - 1 + k = n. 5. **Contradiction**:    The inequality a_{t,k} geq n contradicts the fact that a_{t,k} should be an element of the set {1, 2, dotsc, n}.

Therefore, the maximum number of k-element subsets that can be selected from {1, 2, dotsc, n} such that for any two selected subsets, one of the subsets consists of the k smallest elements of their union, is n-k+1.

Why?","output":"To understand why the differences between the square roots of consecutive numbers decrease and approach zero, let's investigate the mathematical reasoning step by step. 1. Consider the difference between square roots of consecutive integers:    [    sqrt{n+1} - sqrt{n}    ] 2. To simplify this expression, multiply and divide by the conjugate:    [    sqrt{n+1} - sqrt{n} = frac{(sqrt{n+1} - sqrt{n})(sqrt{n+1} + sqrt{n})}{sqrt{n+1} + sqrt{n}}    ] 3. Simplify the numerator:    [    (sqrt{n+1} - sqrt{n})(sqrt{n+1} + sqrt{n}) = left[(n+1) - nright] = 1    ] 4. Therefore, the expression becomes:    [    sqrt{n+1} - sqrt{n} = frac{1}{sqrt{n+1} + sqrt{n}}    ] 5. Observe that as (n) approaches infinity, (sqrt{n+1} + sqrt{n}) becomes very large since both (sqrt{n+1}) and (sqrt{n}) approach infinity. Hence, (frac{1}{sqrt{n+1} + sqrt{n}}) approaches zero. This demonstrates why the difference between square roots of consecutive integers becomes smaller and smaller. Next, let’s explore the difference between cube roots of consecutive integers and show that these differences decrease more slowly than those of square roots: 1. Consider the difference between cube roots of consecutive integers:    [    sqrt[3]{n+1} - sqrt[3]{n}    ] 2. Using a similar approach, multiply and divide by the conjugate:    [    sqrt[3]{n+1} - sqrt[3]{n} = frac{(sqrt[3]{n+1} - sqrt[3]{n})(sqrt[3]{(n+1)^2} + sqrt[3]{(n+1)n} + sqrt[3]{n^2})}{sqrt[3]{(n+1)^2} + sqrt[3]{(n+1)n} + sqrt[3]{n^2}}    ] 3. Simplify the numerator:    [    (sqrt[3]{n+1} - sqrt[3]{n})(sqrt[3]{(n+1)^2} + sqrt[3]{(n+1)n} + sqrt[3]{n^2}) = (n+1 - n) = 1    ] 4. Therefore, we have:    [    sqrt[3]{n+1} - sqrt[3]{n} = frac{1}{sqrt[3]{(n+1)^2} + sqrt[3]{(n+1)n} + sqrt[3]{n^2}}    ] 5. To compare this with the difference of square roots, consider:    [    frac{sqrt[3]{n+1} - sqrt[3]{n}}{sqrt{n+1} - sqrt{n}} = frac{frac{1}{sqrt[3]{(n+1)^2} + sqrt[3]{(n+1)n} + sqrt[3]{n^2}}}{frac{1}{sqrt{n+1} + sqrt{n}}}    ]    [    = frac{sqrt{n+1} + sqrt{n}}{sqrt[3]{(n+1)^2} + sqrt[3]{(n+1)n} + sqrt[3]{n^2}}    ] 6. Simplifying this further, we get an inequality:    [    frac{sqrt{n+1} + sqrt{n}}{sqrt[3]{(n+1)^2} + sqrt[3]{(n+1)n} + sqrt[3]{n^2}} < frac{2sqrt{n+1}}{3sqrt[3]{n^2}}    ]    [    < frac{4sqrt{n}}{3(sqrt[3]{n^2})}    ] 7. This can be simplified to:    [    < frac{4}{sqrt[3]{n}}    ] Conclusion: The differences between the cube roots of consecutive natural numbers decrease more slowly than the differences between the square roots of consecutive natural numbers due to the nature of their respective denominators. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"an alley of width w, a ladder of length l = 10 text{ meters} leans against two opposite walls.

Let's consider two triangles MNP and M^{prime}N^{prime}P^{prime} (Chart 76), obtained as specified in the problem's condition.

Those two vertices lie on the same edge of the tetrahedron ABCD (e.g., N and N^{prime}). 3. We examine the quadrilateral MNBAD. Since this quadrilateral is inscribed in the circle formed by intersecting the sphere (passing through points A, B, and C) with the plane of face ABD, we have:     [     angle DNM = angle BAD     ] 4.

Now consider the three-dimensional angles at vertices N and N^{prime} (i.e., NMDP and N^{prime}M^{prime}DP^{prime}).

This implies that for any a_i, a_j in M with i neq j, a_i^2 + 1 is divisible by a_j. 2. **Consider the smallest element a_1 in M.**     Without loss of generality, let a_1 be the smallest element in M. Then, for each a_i in M where i neq 1, a_i must divide a_1^2 + 1. 3. **Analyze the divisibility condition.**    Since a_i divides a_1^2 + 1 for all i neq 1, we have:    [    a_2 cdot a_3 cdot ldots cdot a_n leq a_1^2 + 1    ]    This is because each a_i is a divisor of a_1^2 + 1 and they are all distinct positive integers. 4. **Consider the case when n geq 3.**    If n geq 3, then the product of a_2, a_3, ldots, a_n must be greater than a_1^2 + 1. Specifically, since a_1 is the smallest element, we have:    [    a_2 cdot a_3 cdot ldots cdot a_n geq (a_1 + 1)^{n-1}    ]    For n geq 3, this product will be greater than a_1^2 + 1:    [    (a_1 + 1)^{n-1} > a_1^2 + 1    ]    This inequality holds because (a_1 + 1)^{n-1} grows faster than a_1^2 + 1 as n increases. 5. **Conclude that n geq 3 is not possible.**    Since the product of a_2, a_3, ldots, a_n exceeds a_1^2 + 1 for n geq 3, it contradicts the given condition that a_i divides a_1^2 + 1.

Show that if there are vertices a distance (h) apart and vertices a distance (k) apart, then there are vertices a distance (hk) apart. Are there vertices a distance (sqrt{1981}) apart?","output":"1. **Setting Up the Problem**:    We start by representing the vertices of the equilateral triangles in the complex plane. Let ( omega ) be a complex cube root of 1, i.e., ( omega ) satisfies (omega^3 = 1) and (1 + omega + omega^2 = 0). Hence, ( omega = frac{-1 + isqrt{3}}{2} ) and ( omega^2 = frac{-1 - isqrt{3}}{2} ). 2. **Vertex Representation**:        In this setup, the vertices of the equilateral triangles can be represented as complex numbers of the form ( m + nomega ), where ( m ) and ( n ) are integers. This represents all possible positions of vertices in the tessellation created by the equilateral triangles. 3. **Vertices Distance Calculation**:        Suppose the vertices ( A = m + nomega ) and ( B = M + Nomega ) are given. We compute the distance between them using the modulus of their difference. The difference is:    [    A - B = (m - M) + (n - N)omega.    ]    The modulus of this difference calculates the Euclidean distance. 4. **Product of Vertices**:        Next, consider the product of two vertices. Suppose we have two vertices ( P = m + nomega ) and ( Q = M + Nomega ). To ensure the result is also a vertex, calculate ( PQ ):    [    PQ = (m + nomega)(M + Nomega) = mM + mNomega + nMomega + nNomega^2.    ]    Given ( omega^2 = frac{-1 - isqrt{3}}{2} ) and ( omega = frac{-1 + isqrt{3}}{2} ), the expression simplifies as:    [    PQ = (mM + nNomega^ 2) + (mN + nM)omega.    ] 5. **Verification**:         This form ensures that ( PQ ) is still of the form ( m' + n'omega ), thus also a vertex. This confirms if ( P ) and ( Q ) are a certain distance ( h ) and ( k ) apart, then their product will maintain the structure and correspond to new vertices spaced ( hk ). 6. **Specific Calculation**:    - Taking specific vertices ( 3 + omega ) and ( 19 + 6omega ), we compute their distances.        - Compute:      [      |3 + omega| = sqrt{3^2 + 1^2 - 3 cdot 1 cdot left( frac{-1}{2} right)} = sqrt{7}.      ]      For ( 19 + 6omega ):      [      |19 + 6omega| = sqrt{19^2 + 6^2 - 19 cdot 6 cdot left( frac{-1}{2} right)} = sqrt{283}.      ]      - The product of these distances is:      [      |3 + omega| times |19 + 6omega| = sqrt{7} times sqrt{283} = sqrt{1981}.      ] # Conclusion: There are vertices a distance ( sqrt{1981} ) apart since it satisfies the geometric properties and modulus calculations in the given tessellation.

Let's denote the speed of the boat in still water as ( V_b ), the speed of the water current as ( V_c ), and the effect of wind resistance as ( V_w ). When the boat is going downstream, the speed of the boat is the sum of its speed in still water, the speed of the water current, and the effect of wind resistance: [ V_{downstream} = V_b + V_c + V_w ] When the boat is going upstream, the speed of the boat is its speed in still water minus the speed of the water current and the effect of wind resistance: [ V_{upstream} = V_b - V_c - V_w ] We are given that the boat's speed upstream is 4 km/hr. We also know that the water current varies between 2-4 km/hr and the wind resistance affects the speed by -1 to +1 km/hr. To find the speed of the boat in still water, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for both downstream and upstream conditions. For the upstream condition, the worst-case scenario would be when the water current and wind resistance are at their maximum against the boat. This would mean the water current is at 4 km/hr and the wind resistance is at -1 km/hr (since negative wind resistance would slow the boat down).

Pipe a fills the tank in 20 minutes, so its rate is 1/20 of the tank per minute. Pipe b also fills the tank in 20 minutes, so its rate is also 1/20 of the tank per minute. Pipe c fills the tank in 30 minutes, so its rate is 1/30 of the tank per minute. When all three pipes are opened together, the combined rate at which the tank is filled per minute is: (1/20) + (1/20) + (1/30) = (3/60) + (3/60) + (2/60) = 8/60 = 2/15 of the tank per minute. In 3 minutes, the amount of the tank filled by all three pipes together is: (2/15) * 3 = 6/15 = 2/5 of the tank. Now, let's find out how much of solution r is contributed by pipe c in 3 minutes. Since pipe c's rate is 1/30 of the tank per minute, in 3 minutes it will fill: (1/30) * 3 = 3/30 = 1/10 of the tank. To find the proportion of solution r in the liquid in the tank after 3 minutes, we divide the amount contributed by pipe c by the total amount filled by all three pipes in 3 minutes: Proportion of solution r = (Amount of solution r) / (Total amount of liquid) Proportion of solution r = (1/10) / (2/5) = (1/10) * (5/2) = 5/20 = 1/4.

Since C is the center of the circle C at (3,4), and M is a point on line l, the angle angle ACB will be minimized when line l is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the points of intersection. Steps for the solution: - We note that angle ACB is minimized when line AB is tangent to the circle at one of the points, let's say A, because a tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. In this case, CA would be the radius and AB the tangent line. - Since l has to pass through M(1,2) and be perpendicular to the radius of the circle, we need to find the slope of the radius connecting C and M. The radius CM will have a slope calculated by frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}, which in our case is frac{2 - 4}{1 - 3} = 1.  - The line perpendicular to CM will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal, so the slope of line l is -1. - Now we use the point-slope formula for a line, which is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line. Substituting in the slope -1 and point M(1,2), we get y - 2 = -1(x - 1). - Simplifying the equation, we get y - 2 = -x + 1, and then by rearranging, we find x + y - 3 = 0.

The solution to determine the shortest and the longest distance of a point ( mathbf{P} ) from a straight line segment can be approached by distinguishing the following cases: 1. When the point ( mathbf{P} ) lies within the perpendicular zone extended from the endpoints of the segment ( mathbf{A}mathbf{B} ). 2. When the point ( mathbf{P} ) lies outside of this zone.  Case 1: ( mathbf{P} ) lies within the perpendicular zone: 1. The perpendicular zone is defined by two perpendicular lines erected at each endpoint of the segment ( mathbf{A} ) and ( mathbf{B} ). 2. The shortest distance, in this case, is the length of the perpendicular dropped from ( mathbf{P} ) to the segment ( mathbf{A}mathbf{B} ).  Case 2: ( mathbf{P} ) lies outside of the perpendicular zone: 1. If ( mathbf{P} ) lies outside this zone, the shortest distance is found by considering the line segments extending from ( mathbf{P} ) to the endpoints ( mathbf{A} ) or ( mathbf{B} ). 2.

Using the binomial theorem:    [    (x_{0} + sqrt{2003} y_{0})^{2k} = sum_{m=0}^{k} binom{2k}{2m} x_{0}^{2k-2m} (sqrt{2003} y_{0})^{2m}    ]    This simplifies to:    [    x = sum_{m=0}^{k} binom{2k}{2m} x_{0}^{2(k-m)} (2003)^{m} y_{0}^{2m}    ]    Let ( p ) be any prime factor of ( x ). According to the problem statement, ( p ) should divide ( x_{0} ). Thus, ( p mid x_{0} ).    However, for Pell's equation ( x^2 - 2003 y^2 = 1 ) to hold, it must be that ( gcd(x_{0}, 2003) = 1 ) since 2003 is a prime number (i.e., ( x_{0} ) and 2003 are coprime).    This leads to a contradiction if ( p ) divides ( x_{0} ) and also appears in the terms formed by powers involving 2003.    Therefore, ( k geq 1 ) does not yield any new solutions aside from the fundamental one due to coprimality issues.    **Case 2: ( n ) is Odd**    Suppose ( n = 2k + 1 ). Then:    [    (x_{0} + sqrt{2003} y_{0})^{2k+1}    ]    If ( k = 0 ), we simply get ( x = x_{0} ) and ( y = y_{0} ).    For ( k geq 1 ), we consider each prime factor ( p ) of ( x ). Using the expression derived from the binomial theorem for odd powers:    [    x = sum_{m=0}^{k} binom{2k+1}{2m+1} x_{0}^{2(k-m)+1} 2003^{m} y_{0}^{2m+1}    ]    Let ( x_0 = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} cdots p_t^{a_t} ) be the prime factorization of ( x_0 ). Using the properties of binomial coefficients and power terms, you can show that for each prime factor ( p_j ), the multiplicity in ( x ) must match that in ( x_0 cdot 2003^{k} cdot y_0^{2k} cdot (2k+1) ).    Due to the specific transformation properties, it leads to a similar contradiction that:    [    x > x_{0} cdot 2003^{k} cdot y_{0}^{2k} cdot (2k+1) > 0    ]    Given contradictions every increment step leads to ( x_0 ). Therefore, ( k geq 1 ) similarly fails to produce any solutions due to prime distribution properties. 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis above, we conclude that the only solution satisfying the given conditions is the fundamental solution: [ boxed{(x, y) = (x_{0}, y_{0})} ]"},{"instruction":"a certain kennel, there are 45 dogs.

The total number of employees is 50, so we have: W + 6D = 50 We also know that W is more than D, so W > D. Since all other days have an equal number of birthdays, we want to minimize the number of employees having birthdays on Wednesday while still having it be the largest count.

Find the weighted average number of surfers per day at the Festival.","output":"To find the weighted average number of surfers per day at the festival, we need to calculate the total number of surfers for each pair of days and then divide by the total number of days. First, let's find the total number of surfers for the first two days and the last two days separately. For the first two days, the ratio of surfers is 5:7. This means that for every 5 surfers on the first day, there are 7 on the second day. The total ratio parts for the first two days is 5 + 7 = 12 parts. For the last two days, the ratio of surfers is 3:2. This means that for every 3 surfers on the third day, there are 2 on the fourth day. The total ratio parts for the last two days is 3 + 2 = 5 parts. Now, let's find out how many parts there are in total for the four days: Total parts = 12 (first two days) + 5 (last two days) = 17 parts. Next, we need to find out how many surfers each part represents. Since there were a total of 12,000 surfers over the four days, we divide this number by the total number of parts: Surfers per part = 12,000 surfers / 17 parts = 705.88 surfers per part (approximately). Now we can calculate the number of surfers for each pair of days: First two days surfers = 12 parts * 705.88 surfers per part = 8,470.59 surfers (approximately). Last two days surfers = 5 parts * 705.88 surfers per part = 3,529.41 surfers (approximately). Finally, we find the weighted average number of surfers per day: Weighted average = (First two days surfers + Last two days surfers) / 4 days Weighted average = (8,470.59 + 3,529.41) / 4 Weighted average = 12,000 / 4 Weighted average = 3,000 surfers per day.

The probability distribution of X is: | X | 0 | 1 | 2 | |-----|-----|-----|-----| | P | frac{1}{10} | frac{3}{5} | frac{3}{10} | The expectation of X, E(X) = 0 times frac{1}{10} + 1 times frac{3}{5} + 2 times frac{3}{10} = 0 + frac{3}{5} + frac{6}{10} = frac{6}{5}.

In each step, randomly pair the numbers on the blackboard and replace each pair with their sum and their difference (the difference does not necessarily require the larger number minus the smaller number; all replacements occur simultaneously). Prove that it is not possible for (2n) consecutive integers to appear on the blackboard again.","output":"To solve this problem, follow these steps. 1. **Identify the Sum of Squares of Consecutive Integers**    We start by considering (2n) consecutive integers. The sum of the squares of the first (2^k) consecutive integers can be expressed as:    [    1^2 + 2^2 + cdots + (2^k)^2     ] 2. **Sum of Squares Formula**    The sum of squares of the first (m) integers is given by the formula:    [    1^2 + 2^2 + cdots + m^2 = frac{m(m+1)(2m+1)}{6}    ]    Applying this formula for (m = 2^k):    [    1^2 + 2^2 + cdots + (2^k)^2 = frac{2^k (2^k + 1)(2 cdot 2^k + 1)}{6}    ] 3. **Simplify the Expression**    Simplify the numerator:    [    frac{2^k (2^k + 1)(2^{k+1} + 1)}{6}    ]    This can be further rewritten as:    [    2^{k-1} cdot frac{(2^k + 1)(2^{k+1} + 1)}{3}    ] 4. **Divisibility Consideration**    Notice that the factor (2^{k-1}) implies that the sum of squares of (2^k) consecutive integers is divisible by (2^{k-1}) but not by (2^k) because the term (frac{(2^k + 1)(2^{k+1} + 1)}{3}) is not necessarily divisible by 2. 5. **Representation Using Another Form**    Now consider (2n = 2^k l) where (l) is an odd number (since (2n) can be factored accordingly as given). Therefore, the sum of squares of (2n) consecutive integers (2^k l) can be written as a sum of (l) terms each in the form (2^{k-1} t_i), where each (t_i) is an odd number. 6. **Simplifying Sum of Squares after Transformation**    On each transformation step, where we substitute a pair of numbers ((a, b)) with ((a-b)) and ((a+b)):    [    (a-b)^2 + (a+b)^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2)    ]    After each transformation, the transformed sum of squares is increased by a factor of 2. 7. **Conclusion**    From this, it follows that after a certain number of steps, we repeatedly double the sum of squares after each replacement step pair. Importantly, the sum’s divisibility properties guarantee that eventually, it will not be possible to have (2n) consecutive integers on the board. Thus, (2n) consecutive integers on the board will no longer appear.

This is denoted by the interval notation [-2, 3]. - Set B includes all numbers greater than 0, which is represented by the interval notation (0, +infty). The union of A and B, Acup B, includes all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. Since A already includes numbers from -2 up to 3, and B includes all numbers greater than 0, the union of these sets starts from -2 and extends indefinitely to the right, because B adds all positive numbers beyond 3, which are not already included in A.

Now, we can substitute x from the first equation into the second equation: 7(kd + 5) = jd + 8 7kd + 35 = jd + 8 Since 7kd and jd are both divisible by d, the remainders when they are divided by d are 0.

Combine the (2 times 2) square and the (6 times 6) square:     - Combined area (= 4 + 36 = 40).     - Since 40 is not a perfect square, this combination is also not feasible. 3. Combine the (3 times 3) square and the (6 times 6) square:     - Combined area (= 9 + 36 = 45).     - Since 45 is not a perfect square, this combination is not feasible either.  Step 3: Explore All Possibilities: If combining any two squares does not yield a feasible solution, we should consider all three squares. The total area of all three squares is: [4 + 9 + 36 = 49.] Since 49 is a perfect square ((7 times 7)), it is possible to form a (7 times 7) square from the pieces resulting from the cuttings.  Step 4: Practical Approach: Let's visually verify how this can be achieved by cutting the squares. The image provided shows that it is achievable by the following approach: 1. **Cutting the (6 times 6) square:**     - Cut the (6 times 6) square into four (3 times 3) smaller squares. 2. **Cutting the (3 times 3) square:**     - Keep the (3 times 3) square intact. 3. **Cutting the (2 times 2) square:**     - Keep the (2 times 2) square intact. Combine these pieces to form a larger square: - Place the four (3 times 3) squares to form part of the (7 times 7) square. - Place the remaining (3 times 3) square to continue forming the (7 times 7) square. - Arrange the (2 times 2) square accordingly.

(1) Discuss the monotonicity of f(x).   (2) If the maximum value of the function y = f(x) on the closed interval [0, a+1] is f(a+1), find the range of values for a.","output":"To solve the given problem, we proceed in two main parts, discussing the monotonicity of f(x) and finding the range of values for a under the given conditions. # Part 1: Monotonicity of f(x) Given the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3(a+1)x^2 + 6ax, where a > 0, we first find its derivative to analyze the monotonicity: 1. Differentiate f(x) with respect to x:    [    f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(2x^3 - 3(a+1)x^2 + 6ax) = 6x^2 - 6(a+1)x + 6a = 6(x-1)(x-a).    ] 2. Analyze f'(x) to determine the monotonicity of f(x):    - When a=1, we have f'(x) = 6(x-1)^2 geq 0 for all x, indicating f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}.    - When 0 < a < 1, f'(x) > 0 for x < a or x > 1, and f'(x) < 0 for a < x < 1. Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-infty, a), decreasing on (a, 1), and increasing again on (1, +infty).    - When a > 1, f'(x) > 0 for x < 1 or x > a, and f'(x) < 0 for 1 < x < a. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-infty, 1), decreasing on (1, a), and increasing on (a, +infty). # Part 2: Range of Values for a Given that the maximum value of f(x) on the closed interval [0, a+1] is f(a+1), we analyze the conditions for different ranges of a: 1. **When a=1**, f(x) is monotonically increasing on [0, a+1], so the maximum value is indeed f(a+1). 2. **When 0 < a < 1**:    - The function is increasing, then decreasing, then increasing again. The maximum value on [0, a+1] is either f(a) or f(a+1).    - Given f(a+1) is the maximum, we have f(a+1) - f(a) = 3a - 1 geq 0, leading to a geq frac{1}{3}. Thus, for 0 < a < 1, we have frac{1}{3} leq a < 1. 3. **When a > 1**:    - The function increases, then decreases, then increases. The maximum value on [0, a+1] could be f(1) or f(a+1).    - Since f(a+1) is the maximum, f(a+1) - f(1) = -a^3 + 3a^2 = -a^2(a - 3) geq 0, implying a leq 3. Thus, for a > 1, we have 1 < a leq 3.

Step 1: Let's denote the following: - AB and BC are the legs of the right trapezoid ABCD. - AD and BC are the bases. - AB is perpendicular to both AD and BC. Given that the height AB is equal to the sum of the lengths of the bases AD and BC: [ AB = AD + BC ]  Step 2: Let O be the midpoint of side DC. We will draw a line through points A and O and let M be the point of intersection of this line with line BC. We need to show that the triangles AOD and MOC are congruent.  Step 3: Considering triangles AOD and MOC, we notice that: - OA = OC because O is the midpoint of DC. - AD = CM by the property of the given height and bases. - The angle angle AOD = angle COM because both angles are right angles as AB is the height of the trapezoid which implies right angles at A and C. By the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) Congruence Theorem, the triangles AOD and MOC are congruent: [ triangle AOD cong triangle MOC ] Hence, we have: [ AO = OM ]  Step 4: Since AO = OM, it follows that AOM is an isosceles triangle where AO = OM. Therefore, triangle ABM is also an isosceles triangle, with AB as the bisector of angle BAM.

To find the intervals where this inequality holds, we look at the values that make x(x - 2) = 0, which occur at x = 0 and x = 2. We know that a quadratic function opens upward (as the coefficient of x^2 is positive) and the roots of the equation x(x-2)=0 split the x-axis into three intervals. We test points from each interval to determine where the inequality x(x-2) leq 0 holds: 1. For ( x < 0 ), pick x = -1. Then (-1)(-1 - 2) = 3 > 0. So the inequality does not hold for x < 0. 2. For ( 0 < x < 2 ), pick x = 1. Then (1)(1 - 2) = -1 < 0. Hence, the inequality holds for 0 < x < 2. 3. For ( x > 2 ), pick x = 3. Then (3)(3 - 2) = 3 > 0.

We define M to be the set of all numbers that are on the board when the game ends, i.e., when no more moves are possible.  2. The set M is a subset of the natural numbers, so it has a smallest element, which we denote by ( m ).  3. We will show that m = 1. Assume for contradiction that ( m > 1 ). Because every move consists of taking the difference of two numbers already on the board, ( m ) must be a common divisor of all numbers in M.  4. Suppose there is a number ( k > m ) in M such that ( m ) is not a divisor of ( k ). By repeatedly forming differences (using Euclid’s Algorithm), we can find a number ( operatorname{gcd}(k, m) ) that is smaller than ( m ). This contradicts the assumption that ( m ) is the smallest number in M. 5. Therefore, ( m ) must be a common divisor of 47 and 2016. Since the greatest common divisor of 47 and 2016 is 1, ( m ) must be 1. Hence, ( m = 1 ). 6. We now consider the implication of having ( m = 1 ) in M. If 1 is in M, every positive integer less than or equal to 2016 must eventually appear on the board because:    - If a number ( g ) is the greatest number missing from M, then ( g+1 ) must be in M.    - Since ( g+1 ) and 1 are in M, ( g = (g+1) - 1 ) must also be in M, which contradicts our assumption that ( g ) is missing. 7. Therefore, M contains all integers from 1 to 2016 by derivation. 8. The game begins with two numbers, 47 and 2016, and it involves adding differences of existing numbers to the set.  9. Since ( M ) eventually contains all numbers from 1 to 2016, the total number of moves is 2016 - 2 + 1 = 2015 (since we start with 2 numbers).  10. The total number of such moves is odd, specifically 2015 moves. 11. Alice and Bob start alternating moves, with Alice making the first move and thus also making the last, 2015th move. 12. This suggests, in contradiction, that Alice wins. However, as each number needs to be added carefully:     - Every difference formation eventually leads to including all numbers from 1 to 2016. It’s Bob’s strategic guarantee with certain specific subtractions that allows securing the win during intermediate steps.      - After the final analysis, with the maximal number of differences already stacked against (m) during any stalemate state post moves, Alice's first move becomes decisive but bounded sequentially in maximal moves pending.

Specifically,      [     widehat{PEF} = widehat{ABC} quad text{and} quad widehat{PFE} = widehat{ACB}     ]     Because of this angle similarity, we know that A, P, F, E lie on a common circle (denoted as odot) since A P F E forms a cyclic quadrilateral.          A fundamental property of a cyclic quadrilateral is that the opposite angles sum to 180^circ. This means we can write:     [     widehat{AFE} + widehat{APE} = 180^circ     ]      2. **Show that I Lies on the Circle:**     We now need to show that the incenter I of the triangle ABC also lies on this circle. Notice that in triangle ABC, I is the point where the internal angle bisectors intersect. Hence, it lies on the circle defined by A P F E.     Using the fact that the incenter I is equidistant from all sides of the triangle ABC, we know that the sum of angles at I formed by the coordinates with A:     [     widehat{AFI} + widehat{AEI} = 180^circ      ]          This equality holds because I is the point where the internal angle bisectors meet, partitioning the angles around it correctly. Therefore, I lies on the circle passing through A, P, F, and E. 3. **Angle Chasing to Prove Collinearity:**     We next consider the angles around I to establish the alignment of P, I, D. Start by noting the equality involving P and I:     [     widehat{FIP} = widehat{FEP}      ]     Since F and P define parts of both triangle PEF and triangle DEF (where D is the tangency point on BC):          [     widehat{FEP} = widehat{FBD}      ]     Based on the fact that FBD is actually an angle outside of the recognized established triangle segments, we have:     [     widehat{FIP} = 180^circ - widehat{FID} implies text{since} quad widehat{FIP} = widehat{FED}     ]     Therefore, combining angle equilibriums, we ultimately have: 4. **Alignment Conclusion:**     [     P, I text{ and } D text{ must be collinear}     ] Conclusion: (boxed{text{Therefore, } P, I, text{ and } D text{ are aligned.}})"},{"instruction":"f the result of the calculation ( 0.0077 ) ( 4.5 ) / ( some number ) ( 0.1 ) ( 0.007 ) is approximately 990, what is that number?","output":"To find the unknown number, let's call it x, we can set up the equation: (0.0077 * 4.5) / (x * 0.1 * 0.007) = 990 First, let's simplify the left side of the equation by multiplying 0.0077 and 4.5: 0.0077 * 4.5 = 0.03465 Now the equation looks like this: 0.03465 / (x * 0.1 * 0.007) = 990 Next, let's multiply 0.1 and 0.007: 0.1 * 0.007 = 0.0007 Now the equation is: 0.03465 / (x * 0.0007) = 990 To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by x * 0.0007 to get rid of the denominator: x * 0.0007 * 0.03465 = 990 * x * 0.0007 Now, divide both sides by 0.0007 to isolate x: x * 0.03465 = 990 * x Now, divide both sides by 0.03465 to solve for x: x = 990 / 0.03465 Now, let's do the division: x ≈ 28571.42 So, the number is approximately boxed{28571.42} ."},{"instruction":"The solution set of the inequality system left{begin{array}{l}{2x+9>6x+1}{xk<1}end{array}right. is x<2, then the range of values for k is ( ).

We also know that the segment O_1O_2 contains the point E which is the external tangency point of circles k_1 and k_2. 3. **Triangle in Consideration:**    According to the problem's conditions, the triangle O_1OO_2 is a right triangle, and based on previous points:    [    O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2, quad O_1O = R - r_1, quad O_2O = R - r_2    ] 4. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**    Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle O_1OO_2:    [    (O_1O)^2 + (O_2O)^2 = (O_1O_2)^2    ]    Substituting the values obtained:    [    (R - r_1)^2 + (R - r_2)^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2    ] 5. **Expanding and Simplifying:**    First, expand the squared terms:    [    (R - r_1)^2 + (R - r_2)^2 = R^2 - 2Rr_1 + r_1^2 + R^2 - 2Rr_2 + r_2^2    ]    Combine like terms:    [    2R^2 - 2Rr_1 - 2Rr_2 + r_1^2 + r_2^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2    ]    Which simplifies to:    [    2R^2 - 2Rr_1 - 2Rr_2 + r_1^2 + r_2^2 = r_1^2 + 2r_1r_2 + r_2^2    ] 6. **Isolating the Radius R:**    Isolating R requires rearranging the equation as follows:    [    2R^2 - 2Rr_1 - 2Rr_2 = 2r_1r_2    ]    [    2R^2 - 2R(r_1 + r_2) = 2r_1r_2    ]    Dividing every term by 2 yields:    [    R^2 - R(r_1 + r_2) = r_1r_2    ]    Thus, we can rearrange to form a quadratic equation in R:    [    R^2 - R(r_1 + r_2) - r_1r_2 = 0    ] 7. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**    Using the quadratic formula R = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, where a = 1, b = -(r_1 + r_2), and c = -r_1r_2:    [    R = frac{(r_1 + r_2) pm sqrt{(r_1 + r_2)^2 + 4r_1r_2}}{2}    ]    Simplify under the square root:    [    R = frac{(r_1 + r_2) pm sqrt{(r_1 + r_2)^2 + 4r_1r_2}}{2}    ]    [    R = frac{(r_1 + r_2) pm sqrt{(r_1 + r_2)^2 + 4r_1r_2}}{2}    ]    Only the positive root is valid because the radius must be positive:    [    R = frac{(r_1 + r_2) + sqrt{(r_1 + r_2)^2 + 4r_1r_2}}{2}    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    The radius R of the desired circle is:    [    boxed{R = frac{r_1 + r_2 + sqrt{(r_1 + r_2)^2 + 4r_1r_2}}{2}}    ]"},{"instruction":"Michael walks at 6 feet per second on a long straight path.

This transforms the map into cylindrical coordinates. On a cylindrical planet, the shortest path between two points (called orthodromes) will cross meridians at a constant angle.  2. **Conical Model:**     - Take a similar grid of meridians and parallels.     - Designate a specific point (N) on a parallel, and cut the map along the parallel that passes through (N).     - Roll the map into a cone with (N) as the tip of the cone.

This model offers a different system where every coordinate line intersects every other line twice, including self-intersection at one point.

From f(0)=0, we substitute x=0 into f(x)=frac{mx+n}{{x}^{2}+1} to get: frac{mcdot 0 + n}{0^2 + 1} = 0 implies n = 0. From f(1)=1, we substitute x=1 and n=0 into f(x)=frac{mx+n}{{x}^{2}+1} to get: frac{mcdot 1 + 0}{1^2 + 1} = 1 implies frac{m}{2} = 1 implies m = 2. Therefore, we find that m=2 and n=0.

Since the smaller triangles are homothetic to the original, it is clear that each triangle contributes to such a segment. 3. **Analyze the contribution of each segment parallel to the base.**    - On one side of such a segment, we will have some (possibly just one) triangle, whose sum of homothety ratios is r.    - On the other side of the segment, we must have triangles of opposite orientation that in total cover the same distance, and hence the same proportion of the base side length. The sum of the ratios for these triangles must be -r. 4. **Summing over all line segments.**    - Summing over all line segments, which is equivalent to summing over all smaller triangles, we get that the sum of homothety ratios must be 1. To formalize this, consider the following: - Let the homothety ratio of the larger triangle triangle ABC be 1. - Let the smaller triangles be triangle A_1B_1C_1, triangle A_2B_2C_2, ldots, triangle A_nB_nC_n with homothety ratios k_1, k_2, ldots, k_n respectively. - By the property of homothety, the sum of the areas of the smaller triangles must equal the area of the larger triangle. Since the area of a triangle is proportional to the square of the homothety ratio, we have: [ sum_{i=1}^n k_i^2 cdot text{Area}(triangle ABC) = text{Area}(triangle ABC) ] Dividing both sides by text{Area}(triangle ABC), we get: [ sum_{i=1}^n k_i^2 = 1 ] However, we need to show that the sum of the homothety ratios themselves equals 1. Consider the signed areas of the smaller triangles. The signed area takes into account the orientation (positive for triangles with the same orientation as the original, negative for the opposite orientation). Thus, the sum of the signed areas of the smaller triangles must equal the area of the original triangle: [ sum_{i=1}^n k_i cdot text{Area}(triangle ABC) = text{Area}(triangle ABC) ] Dividing both sides by text{Area}(triangle ABC), we get: [ sum_{i=1}^n k_i = 1 ] Therefore, the sum of all homothety ratios equals 1.

Proceed by checking these possible forms:    - **Case a**: Checking if ( p^2 + 11 = p_1^5 )      - Notice that if ( p = 2 ):        [        p^2 + 11 = 2^2 + 11 = 4 + 11 = 15        ]        ( 15 ) can be factored as ( 3 times 5 ), which does not meet the condition ( p_1^5 ).      - Thus, ( p ) must be an odd prime. 5.

We will check each condition step-by-step: 1. **Non-decreasing property:**    For ( x leq 0 ), ( F(x) = 0 ).    For ( 0 < x leq 2 ), ( F(x) = x^2 ). Since ( x^2 ) is an increasing function on the interval ( (0, 2] ), ( F(x) ) is non-decreasing in this interval.        For ( x > 2 ), ( F(x) = 1 ). Since ( 1 ) is a constant, ( F(x) ) does not decrease for ( x > 2 ).    This property is satisfied. 2. **Boundary conditions:**        [ lim_{x to -infty} F(x) = 0, ]    which is satisfied because ( F(x) = 0 ) for ( x leq 0 ).    [ lim_{x to infty} F(x) = 1, ]    which is satisfied because ( F(x) = 1 ) for ( x > 2 ). 3. **Right-continuity:**        For ( x leq 0 ), ( F(x) = 0 ), which is continuous.    For ( 0 < x leq 2 ), ( F(x) = x^2 ), which is a continuous function.    For ( x > 2 ), ( F(x) = 1 ), which is continuous.    At ( x = 0 ): (lim_{x to 0^+} F(x) = 0^2 = 0). Hence it matches ( F(0) = 0 ).    At ( x = 2 ): (lim_{x to 2^+} F(x) = 1) and (F(2) = 2^2 = 4). This is problematic because the left and right limits do not match at the boundary of the domain at ( x = 2 ). 4. **Range:**        For ( x in (-infty, 0] ), ( F(x) = 0 ), which belongs to ([0, 1]).    For ( x in (0, 2] ), ( F(x) = x^2 ). Since ( 0 < x leq 2 implies 0 < x^2 leq 4 ). Here, the function’s values lie outside the range ([0, 1]).

Conclusion:  Since ( F(x) > 1 ) in the interval ( (1, 2] ), it violates the condition that ( F(x) ) must be within ([0, 1]) for all ( x ).

Thus, from (E), (k) even numbers should be excluded, each denoted by (2m_i):    [    2n_i - 1 + 2m_i = 201    ]    Hence,    [    m_i + n_i = 101    ] 4. **Sum of Elements Calculation:**    From the sum conditions:    [    10100 - (2m_1 + 2m_2 + cdots + 2m_k) + [(2n_1 - 1) + (2n_2 - 1) + cdots + (2n_k - 1)] = 10080    ] 5. **Simplification:**    [    10100 - 2(m_1 + m_2 + cdots + m_k) + 2(n_1 + n_2 + cdots + n_k) - k = 10080    ]    Since (m_i + n_i = 101), summing (k)-times:    [    m_1 + n_1 + m_2 + n_2 + cdots + m_k + n_k = 101k    ]    Thus,    [    2(101k - 2(n_1 + n_2 + cdots + n_k)) + k = 20    ]    Which simplifies to:    [    203k = 20 + 4(n_1 + n_2 + cdots + n_k)    ]    Since ((203, 4) = 1), it follows that (4 mid k). 6. **Counting Odd Numbers:**    Therefore, the number of odd numbers in (G) must be a multiple of 4. 7. **Verify Constant Sum of Squares:**    Consider the sum of the squares:    [    sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 + sum_{i=1}^{100}(201 - a_i)^2 = sum_{i=1}^{200} i^2    ]    Simplifying, we have:    [    2 sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 = sum_{i=1}^{200} i^2 - 100 cdot 201^2 + 402 sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i    ]    Since (sum_{i=1}^{100}a_i = 10080),    [    2 sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 = sum_{i=1}^{200} i^2 - 100 cdot 201^2 + 402 cdot 10080    ]    Hence, (sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2) is a constant. 8. **Alternate Proof by Pairing in (E):**    Divide (E) into pairs:    [    {1, 200}, {2, 199}, ldots, {100, 101}    ]    Clearly, elements of (G) are from these 100 pairs, each having one element. 9. **Analysis of Type Distribution:**    Consider:    - Pairs like ({1, 200}, {4, 197}): one element resembles (4k) form and the other (4k+1).    - Pairs like ({2, 199}, {3, 198}): one element resembles (4k+2) and the other (4k+3).        If we let (x) (4k+1) numbers, (y) (4k+3) numbers, leaving (50 - x) for (4k) and (50 - y) for (4k+2): 10. **Final Congruences:**     [     sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i equiv (4k+1)x + 4k(50-x) + (4k+3)y + (4k+2)(50-y) equiv x + y equiv 10080 pmod{4}     ]     So,     [     x+y equiv 0 pmod{4}     ]     Therefore, the total number of odd numbers must be a multiple of 4. 11. **Conclusion:**     The number of odd numbers in (G) is a multiple of 4, and the sum of the squares of all numbers in (G) is a constant.

If we are considering the decomposition of water into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas, the balanced chemical equation would be: 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2 This equation shows that 2 moles of water decompose to produce 2 moles of hydrogen gas and 1 mole of oxygen gas. Now, if we have 7 moles of dihydrogen monoxide (H2O), we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find out how many moles of oxygen gas (O2) are required. From the balanced equation, we see that the molar ratio of H2O to O2 is 2:1. Therefore, for every 2 moles of H2O, we need 1 mole of O2. For 7 moles of H2O, the moles of O2 required would be: (7 moles H2O) × (1 mole O2 / 2 moles H2O) = 3.5 moles O2 Now, to find the mass of 3.5 moles of oxygen gas, we use the molar mass of oxygen gas (O2). The molar mass of O2 is approximately 32.00 g/mol (since the atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16.00 g/mol and O2 has two oxygen atoms). Mass of O2 = moles of O2 × molar mass of O2 Mass of O2 = 3.5 moles × 32.00 g/mol Mass of O2 = 112.00 g Therefore, the mass of oxygen gas required to completely react with 7 moles of dihydrogen monoxide (H2O) is boxed{112.00}  grams."},{"instruction":"For any positive real numbers (a_1, a_2, cdots, a_5), if (sum_{i=1}^{5} frac{a_i}{sqrt{a_i^2 + 2^{i1} a_{i+1} a_{i+2}}} geq lambda), find the maximum value of (lambda).","output":"1. **Define Substitution**: Let     [    t_i = 2^{i-1} frac{a_{i+1} a_{i+2}}{a_i^2}.    ]    This transforms each term in the sum:    [    sum_{i=1}^5 frac{a_i}{sqrt{a_i^2 + 2^{i-1} a_{i+1} a_{i+2}}} = sum_{i=1}^5 frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t_i}}.    ] 2. **Product of Substitution Terms**: Consider the product of all ( t_i ) terms:    [    prod_{i=1}^5 t_i = 2^{10}.    ] 3. **Transformation to Inequality**: We need to find the maximum of the expression     [    sum_{i=1}^5 frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t_i}} geq lambda     ]    by using properties of the transformed variables ( t_i ). 4. **Proof of the Inequality for Two Variables**: Begin by examining the behavior of the sum of two terms:      - Suppose ( xy = c ) is a constant.

We know that the green beans weigh 60 kg. Since the rice weighs 30 kg less than the green beans, the rice weighs: 60 kg (green beans) - 30 kg = 30 kg (rice) The sugar weighs 10 kg less than the green beans, so the sugar weighs: 60 kg (green beans) - 10 kg = 50 kg (sugar) Now, let's calculate the weight lost from the rice. Since 1/3 of the rice's weight was lost, the weight lost from the rice is: 1/3 * 30 kg = 10 kg The total weight of the goods before any was lost is the sum of the weights of the green beans, rice, and sugar: 60 kg (green beans) + 30 kg (rice) + 50 kg (sugar) = 140 kg The remaining stock weighed 120 kg after the loss, which means the total weight lost is: 140 kg (initial total weight) - 120 kg (remaining weight) = 20 kg (total weight lost) We already know that 10 kg was lost from the rice, so the remaining weight lost must have come from the sugar. Therefore, the weight lost from the sugar is: 20 kg (total weight lost) - 10 kg (weight lost from rice) = 10 kg (weight lost from sugar) To find the fraction of the sugar's weight that was lost, we divide the weight lost from the sugar by the original weight of the sugar: 10 kg (weight lost from sugar) / 50 kg (original weight of sugar) = 1/5 So, boxed{1/5}  of the sugar's weight was lost."},{"instruction":"Simplify sqrt{450}.","output":"1.

Suppose the number of honest ministers is H. The problem states that in any group of 10 ministers, there must be at least one cheat. This implies that in any group of 10 ministers, there can be at most 9 honest ministers. 4. If we assume there are more than 9 honest ministers, say H > 9, then we can always select a group of 10 ministers containing only honest ministers, which would violate the problem's condition. Therefore, there can be at most 9 honest ministers:    [    H leq 9    ] 5. The number of dishonest ministers (cheats), denoted by C, is then:    [    C = 100 - H    ] 6.

We start by rewriting the given equation ( x^2 - y^2 = 10^2 cdot 30^{2n} ) using the difference of squares formula:    [    x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) = 10^2 cdot 30^{2n}    ]    This implies that ( (x - y) ) and ( (x + y) ) are factors of ( 10^2 cdot 30^{2n} ). 2. Next, we factorize ( 10^2 cdot 30^{2n} ):    [    10^2 cdot 30^{2n} = 2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot (2 cdot 3 cdot 5)^{2n} = 2^{2n+2} cdot 3^{2n} cdot 5^{2n+2}    ] 3.

The number of ways to choose ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( ab = 2^{2n+2} cdot 3^{2n} cdot 5^{2n+2} ) is given by the number of divisors of ( 2^{2n+2} cdot 3^{2n} cdot 5^{2n+2} ). The number of divisors of a number ( p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ) is ( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1) ). 5.

We can also check modulo 4:     [     f(n) equiv 2n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 3 pmod{4}     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     f(n) equiv 2n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 3 pmod{4}     ]     We check the values for ( n = 0, 1, 2, 3 ):     [     f(0) equiv 3 pmod{4}, quad f(1) equiv 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 11 equiv 3 pmod{4}, quad f(2) equiv 16 + 12 + 6 + 3 = 37 equiv 1 pmod{4}, quad f(3) equiv 54 + 27 + 9 + 3 = 93 equiv 1 pmod{4}     ]     Since ( f(n) equiv 3 pmod{4} ) for ( n equiv 0, 1 pmod{4} ), it cannot be a perfect square. 12.

Let (n' = 2n'') for some integer (n''). 9. **Infinite Descent:**    Substitute (n' = 2n'') into the equation:    [    a^2 + 2(b')^2 + 6c''^2 = 5(2n'')^2    ]    Simplify:    [    a^2 + 2(b')^2 + 6c''^2 = 20(n'')^2    ]    This process can be repeated indefinitely, reducing the problem to smaller and smaller integers.

Find the geometric locus of points on the plane that are equidistant from these rays. (The distance from a point to a ray is defined as the distance from this point to the nearest point on the ray.)","output":"1. **Setup the problem**:     - We are given two rays on a plane, and we need to find the set of points on this plane that are equidistant from both rays.     - The distance from a point to a ray is defined as the distance from the point to the closest point on the ray. 2. **Case 1: The ends of the rays do not coincide**:     - Let's denote the two rays as ell_1 and ell_2.     - We need to find the locus of points that are equidistant from ell_1 and ell_2. 3. **Bissectors of angles formed by the containing lines of the rays**:     - Consider the lines that contain these rays, denoted as L_1 and L_2. These lines form an angle at their intersection point.     - The angle bisectors of the angles between L_1 and L_2 are part of the locus of points. There are two such bisectors:       - One bisector for the acute or right angle formed by the rays.       - One bisector for the obtuse angle, if the angle exceeds 90 degrees. 4. **Middle perpendicular of the segment connecting the ends of the rays**:     - Let the starting points (or ends) of the rays ell_1 and ell_2 be points A and B.     - Find the segment overline{AB} connecting these points.     - The perpendicular bisector of overline{AB} is another component of our geometric locus, as every point on this perpendicular bisector is equidistant from A and B and thus their respective rays. 5. **Parabolas**:     - Each point on a parabola is equidistant from a given point, called the focus, and a given line, called the directrix.     - In our scenario:       - One parabola will have its focus at the endpoint of ell_1 and its directrix being the line that contains ell_2, and vice versa for the other parabola.       - Therefore, we have two parabolas, each satisfying the equidistance property relative to one of the rays and the line containing the other ray. 6. **Combining the results**:     - The complete geometric locus consists of:       - The angle bisectors of the angles formed between L_1 and L_2.       - The perpendicular bisector of the segment overline{AB} if A neq B.       - The two parabolas as described. 7. **Case 2: The ends of the rays coincide**:     - When the ends of the rays coincide at a point O, the problem simplifies.     - Here, the angle between the rays is important.     - The geometric place consists of:       - The angle bisector of the angle formed by the rays at O.       - The part of the plane inside the angle, bounded by perpendiculars dropped to the rays from points on one of the bissectors. # Conclusion: - Therefore, the geometric locus of points consists of:   - If the ends of the rays do not coincide: two angle bisectors, the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the ray ends, and two parabolas.   - If the ends coincide: an angle bisector and the part of the plane inside the angle formed by the rays bounded by perpendiculars. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"f y=sqrt{xfrac{1}{2}}+sqrt{frac{1}{2}x}6, then xy=____.","output":"Given the problem, we need to find the value of xy when y=sqrt{x-frac{1}{2}}+sqrt{frac{1}{2}-x}-6.

However, since x cannot be both 4 and -5 at the same time, we need to find a value of x that minimizes the sum of |x - 4| and |x + 5|.

Which digit is hidden under which mask? Under the mask of the elephant is the digit: Under the mask of the mouse is the digit: Under the mask of the pig is the digit: Under the mask of the panda is the dig","output":"1. We start by analyzing the information given about the masks and the digits that they hide. We know that each example involves a product of two identical digits resulting in a two-digit number. 2. Let's consider all possible products of two identical digits that produce a two-digit number ending in a different digit. Here are the possible combinations: [ begin{aligned} &4 times 4 = 16,  &7 times 7 = 49,  &8 times 8 = 64,  &9 times 9 = 81. end{aligned} ] 3. From the problem statement, it is indicated that the product of the digit hidden behind the mouse's mask, when multiplied by itself, ends with the same digit as the mask of the elephant. We need to examine the parity (evenness or oddness) of the digits to match the given conditions. The parity of one's place digit must be the same.     Looking at the possible products:          - (4 times 4 = 16) (both digits are even)     - (7 times 7 = 49) (both digits are odd)     - (8 times 8 = 64) (both digits are even)     - (9 times 9 = 81) (both digits are odd)     This condition suggests that in the first example, the products show digits of the same parity. 4. Given the digits must have the same parity and knowing that the sums are products resulting in different digits means comparing the results to one another:     - (8 cdot 8 = 64): The final digit is 4. Thus the product (8 cdot 8 = 64) fits well; this identifies the digit for the pig's mask.     - Since the product (64) is derived from even digits and ends in a digit 4, this means (4) is the digit masked behind the mouse. 5. Extending this reasoning to the second example, the similar characteristics such as identical parity must align the final digits.  Since (4 times 4 = 16), the process splits clearly to differentiate the remaining digits:     - (4 times 4 = 16): This fulfills each resulting product with an end digit of 6, thus assigning the digit 6 to the elephant’s mask.     - Since ( (4 times 4 = 16), the result ends in 6; we conclude the correct digit masked behind the mouse is indeed 4. 6. Finally, through the incremental alignment:     - (8 times 8 = 64) resolves the pig.     - ( (4 times 4 = 16) fits the problem condition with ending integer for the elephant mask hence (6). # Conclusion: [ begin{aligned} &text{Digit for the elephant} = 6, &text{Digit for the mouse} = 4, &text{Digit for the pig} = 8, &text{Digit for the panda} = 1. end{aligned} ] [ boxed{ text{The digits under the masks are: Elephant = 6, Mouse = 4, Pig = 8, Panda = 1.} } ]"},{"instruction":"Dany owns a farm, in his farm he has 4 cows and some sheep that eat 2 bushels a day.

How many possibilities are there for the set of truthtellers on the U.S. Senate? *Proposed by James Lin*","output":"**    - We need to determine the possible sets of truth-tellers that satisfy the conditions for all (i). 6. **Simplifying the Problem:**    - Consider the last person in line (the 100th person). They say that more than half of the 1 person (themselves) is a truth-teller. This is trivially true if they are a truth-teller.    - Moving to the 99th person, they say that more than half of the 2 people (themselves and the 100th person) are truth-tellers. This means at least 2 out of 2 must be truth-tellers if the 99th person is a truth-teller.    - Continuing this logic, the (i)-th person’s statement imposes a condition on the number of truth-tellers among the last (101-i) people. 7. **Generalizing the Pattern:**    - For the (i)-th person to be a truth-teller, the number of truth-tellers among the last (101-i) people must be at least (lceil frac{101-i}{2} rceil + 1).    - This recursive condition must hold for all (i). 8. **Counting the Possibilities:**    - The problem can be reduced to counting the number of ways to distribute truth-tellers such that the conditions are satisfied for all (i). 9. **Conclusion:**    - By analyzing the conditions and the recursive nature of the problem, we find that there is only one way to distribute the truth-tellers such that all conditions are satisfied.

We know that 350 adults attended, so the total amount collected from adults is 350A dollars. Since there were 610 people at the play and 350 of them were adults, the remaining 610 - 350 = 260 people were children. Each child's admission price was 1 dollar, so the total amount collected from children is 260 * 1 = 260 dollars. The total admission receipts were 960 dollars, which is the sum of the amount collected from adults and children.

We need to determine the number of ways to form a \\"double staircase\\" in this grid. A double staircase is defined as a subset ( T ) of ( S ) (the set of all cells) that can be partitioned into ( n ) horizontal non-overlapping rectangles of dimensions ( 1 times 1, 1 times 2, ldots, 1 times n ) and also into ( n ) vertical non-overlapping rectangles of dimensions ( 1 times 1, 2 times 1, ldots, n times 1 ). 2. **Lemma 1: Distinct Rows and Columns:**    Each of the ( n ) horizontal rectangles must be in distinct rows, and each of the ( n ) vertical rectangles must be in distinct columns.    - **Proof:** Assume for contradiction that two horizontal rectangles are in the same row. This would leave at least one row uncolored, contradicting the requirement that each column must be fully colored. Similarly, vertical rectangles must be in distinct columns. 3. **Lemma 2: Contiguous Coloring:**    Given two colored cells in the same row, all cells between them in that row must also be colored.    - **Proof:** If there were uncolored cells between two colored cells in the same row, it would imply the existence of two separate horizontal rectangles in the same row, contradicting Lemma 1. The same logic applies to columns. 4. **Labeling Rows and Columns:**    Label each row with a distinct number from ( 1 ) to ( n ) corresponding to the number of colored cells in that row. Let these numbers be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) from top to bottom. Similarly, define ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ) for the columns from left to right. 5. **Lemma 3: Sequence Order:**    Suppose row ( a_k ) is the fully colored row for some ( 1 leq k leq n ). Then ( a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_k > a_{k+1} > ldots > a_n ).    - **Proof:** For any row ( a_i ) with ( i < k ), any colored cell in row ( a_i ) implies that the cells in the same column but in rows ( a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ldots, a_{k-1} ) must also be colored. Thus, ( a_i leq a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ldots, a_{k-1} leq a_k ). Since all ( a_1, ldots, a_k ) are distinct, we have ( a_i < a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ldots, a_{k-1} < a_k ). Similarly, for ( i > k ), we have ( a_i < a_{i-1}, a_{i-2}, ldots, a_{k+1} < a_k ). This proves the lemma. The same logic applies to ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ). 6. **Counting Valid Sequences:**    There are ( 2^{n-1} ) ways to pick ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) satisfying Lemma 3. This is because if the fully colored row is ( a_k ), there are ( binom{n-1}{k-1} ) ways to order the rest, and summing over ( 1 leq k leq n ) gives ( 2^{n-1} ). Similarly, there are ( 2^{n-1} ) ways to pick ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ). 7. **Claim: Unique Double Staircase for Each Pair of Sequences:**    For any two sequences ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) and ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ) satisfying Lemma 3, there is exactly one double staircase corresponding to these sequences.    - **Proof:** Place the ( 1 times n ) rectangle in its corresponding row. One of ( b_1 ) or ( b_n ) must be ( 1 ). Suppose ( b_1 = 1 ). Then, the ( 1 times (n-1) ) rectangle must intersect columns ( b_2, b_3, ldots, b_n ). Continue this logic iteratively to see that there is always exactly one position for the next rectangle. Thus, there is exactly one double staircase for each pair of sequences. 8. **Final Calculation:**    The total number of double staircases is ( 2^{n-1} times 2^{n-1} = 2^{2n-2} ).

The weights of each block in terms of its contribution to the top block can be thought of as a three-dimensional version of Pascal's triangle: - **Layer 1 (Bottom layer)**: 10 blocks, each contributes to the blocks directly above in the next layer. - **Layer 2**: 6 blocks, each formed by the sum of three blocks from Layer 1. - **Layer 3**: 3 blocks, each formed by the sum of three blocks from Layer 2. - **Layer 4 (Top block)**: 1 block, formed by the sum of three blocks from Layer 3.  Step 2: Calculating Weights for Each Block The weights for each block, starting from the top, distribute downwards: - **Top block**: Weight = 1 - **Layer 3**: Each block contributes to the top block, so weights are 1 each. - **Layer 2**: Each block in Layer 3 is supported by three blocks from Layer 2, so each of these contributing blocks in Layer 2 gets a weight of 1 (from Layer 3) distributed among them. - **Layer 1**: Similarly, each block in Layer 2 is supported by three blocks from Layer 1, distributing its weight among these three blocks. The distribution of weights from the top block down to the bottom layer is as follows: - **Layer 4**: 1 block with weight 1. - **Layer 3**: 3 blocks, each with weight 1. - **Layer 2**: 6 blocks, each with weight 3 (since each supports one block in Layer 3). - **Layer 1**: 10 blocks, with weights distributed as follows:   - Middle block directly under the top block gets the highest weight (6).   - The surrounding blocks in a hexagonal arrangement get weights of 3.   - The corner blocks get weights of 1.  Step 3: Assigning Numbers to Minimize the Top Block's Number To minimize the number on the top block, assign the smallest numbers to blocks with the highest weights: - Assign 1 to the block with weight 6. - Assign 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 to the blocks with weight 3. - Assign 8, 9, 10 to the blocks with weight 1.  Step 4: Calculating the Minimum Possible Number for the Top Block The sum for the top block is calculated as: [ text{Sum} = 6 times 1 + 3 times (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + 1 times (8 + 9 + 10) ] [ text{Sum} = 6 + 3 times 27 + 27 ] [ text{Sum} = 6 + 81 + 27 ] [ text{Sum} = 114 ] Thus, the smallest possible number that could be assigned to the top block is boxed{114}."},{"instruction":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,m+1) and overrightarrow{b}=(m,2), determine the necessary and sufficient condition for overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b} in terms of m= _____.","output":"Since overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b}, their cross product is zero, i.e., overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 0.

Can we manage to place all the pieces in the bottom 3 rows?","output":"To determine whether it is possible to move all the 24 pieces from the top 3 rows to the bottom 3 rows on a standard 8x8 checkerboard, we need to analyze the types of squares and the movement rules more carefully.   1. **Classification of Squares**:    We classify the squares based on the parity (even or odd) of their row and column numbers:    - (text{Even row, Even column}): Denoted as EE.    - (text{Even row, Odd column}): Denoted as EO.    - (text{Odd row, Even column}): Denoted as OE.    - (text{Odd row, Odd column}): Denoted as OO.        This classification ensures that each square on the board can be uniquely identified by one of these four types. 2. **Initial Positions**:    In the initial configuration, the pieces occupy the top 3 rows (rows 1 to 3). Let's calculate the number of pieces on each type of square:    - **Row 1 and Row 3 (odd rows)**:      - OE: 4 each row Rightarrow Total = 4 + 4 = 8.      - OO: 4 each row Rightarrow Total = 4 + 4 = 8.    - **Row 2 (even row)**:      - EE: 4 squares      - EO: 4 squares    So, in the initial configuration, the distribution of pieces is:    - 8 on OE.    - 8 on OO.    - 4 on EE.    - 4 on EO. 3. **Final Positions**:    In the desired final configuration, the pieces should occupy the bottom 3 rows (rows 6 to 8). Similarly, let's calculate the number of pieces ending on each type of square:    - **Row 6 and Row 8 (even rows)**:      - EE: 4 each row Rightarrow Total = 4 + 4 = 8.      - EO: 4 each row Rightarrow Total = 4 + 4 = 8.    - **Row 7 (odd row)**:      - OE: 4 squares      - OO: 4 squares    So, the distribution in the final configuration is:    - 8 on EE.    - 8 on EO.    - 4 on OE.    - 4 on OO. 4. **Analysis of Movement**:    By the movement rules (pieces jumping over others into an empty spot), the type of square (EE, EO, OE, OO) remains the same for each piece throughout the moves because the parity of the row and column of each piece changes consistent with its movement.    Upon comparison:    - Initial count (8 on OE, 8 on OO, 4 on EE, 4 on EO) does not match the final count (8 on EE, 8 on EO, 4 on OE, 4 on OO).    - Specifically, there is an imbalance.

No two segments share an endpoint. We must prove that it is impossible to number the segments such that the k-th segment contains exactly k endpoints of other segments, for each k from 1 to 1978. 2. **Restating the Given Conditions**:     - There are 1978 segments, none of which share endpoints.     - We need to find out if it's possible to number these segments in a way that for each k (from 1 to 1978), the k-th segment contains exactly k endpoints of other segments. 3. **Analyzing Parity**:     - Let’s denote a_k as the number of endpoints contained in the k-th segment.     - It is clear that a segment containing x endpoints would affect an even parity since endpoints always come in pairs.     - In other words, if segment AB contains x endpoints of other segments, and segment CD contains y endpoints of other segments, x and y must have the same parity (both even or both odd). 4. **Summing the Number of Endpoints**:     - The total number of endpoints all the segments should contain can be represented as the sum of all a_k, where k ranges from 1 to 1978.     - The general sum of the sequence of numbers from 1 to n is given by:     [     sum_{k=1}^{n} k = frac{n(n+1)}{2}     ]     - For n = 1978:     [     sum_{k=1}^{1978} k = frac{1978 times 1979}{2} = 1952 times 1979     ] 5. **Checking Parity**:     - The total sum frac{1978 times 1979}{2} must be checked for parity:     - 1978 times 1979 = 1969 + (1978 times 1978) = 1952 + 1952 n = 39581     - Since multiplying an even number (1978) with an odd number (1979) and dividing by 2 gives an odd number. 6. **Conclusion**:     - Summing up, we understand that each segment contains points that can show even parity. However, an overall odd parity generated by total endpoints makes it impossible to accurately distribute this sum sequentially (1 to 1978).     - Thus, it proves that we cannot number the segments in such a way that the k-th segment contains exactly k endpoints of other segments.

Thus, option C is incorrect. **Option D: Coefficient of the x^3 term** To find the coefficient of the x^3 term, we set 2r-5 = 3 and solve for r: [ 2r-5 = 3 implies 2r = 8 implies r = 4 ] Substituting r=4 into the expression for the coefficient: [ left(-2right)^4 cdot C_5^4 = 16 cdot 5 = 80 ] Therefore, the coefficient of the x^3 term is 80, making option D correct.

B's efficiency is 100%, and B can complete the work in 20 days. So, B's work done in one day is: ( frac{100%}{20} = frac{1}{20} ) of the work. C's efficiency is 75%, and C can complete the work in 30 days. So, C's work done in one day is: ( frac{75%}{30} = frac{0.75}{30} = frac{1}{40} ) of the work.

A critic counts faults: each pair of adjacent red dots counts as one fault, and each pair of blue dots exactly two apart (separated by one dot) counts as another fault. What is the smallest number of faults the critic could find?","output":"To solve the problem, we need to arrange the 1000 dots such that the number of faults is minimized according to the given rules. Let's start by analyzing a specific arrangement and then generalize to prove that it's optimal. 1. **Initial Arrangement (Red and Blue Alternation):**    Consider an arrangement where red (R) and blue (B) dots alternate in groups of two, i.e., \\"(text{..RRBBRRBB..})\\" and so on. Let's see how many faults arise in this arrangement:    - Each pair of adjacent red dots (\\"RR\\") counts as one fault.    - Since each group of RR is followed by BB, there are no two blue dots exactly two apart.        To determine how many faults result from this configuration, we count the number of (RR) pairs:    [    text{Number of RR pairs} = frac{1000}{4} times 1 = 250     ]    This is because in every 4 consecutive dots (\\"RRBB\\"), there is exactly one pair of \\"RR\\". 2. **Optimality Proof - Blocks of Five Dots:**    To show that every possible configuration contains at least 250 faults, consider the following proof:        - Divide the 1000 dots into overlapping blocks of 5 consecutive dots.    - Each overlapping block shares exactly one dot with the next block. There are 250 such blocks because the overlap is (1000 / 5) = 200 plus (1).    [    text{For each block of 5 consecutive dots:}    ]    [        begin{cases}         text{If any of the middle 3 dots are red:} & text{Either:}        begin{cases}             text{The middle red dot has a red neighbor,} & text{or}             text{Both its neighbors are blue,} & text{resulting in a RR or B-R dot arrangement}        end{cases}          text{If none of the middle 3 dots are red:} & text{All middle 3 dots are blue, meaning two blue dots are 2 apart}.        end{cases}    ]        Therefore, each block of 5 consecutive dots contains at least one fault. Also, since the faults are paired dots and no fault is counted twice due to the overlap, there are at least 250 faults. 3. **Alternative Proof - Non-overlapping Blocks:**    An alternative argument involves dividing the 1000 dots into non-overlapping blocks of 4 dots:    - Each block either contains an \\"internal fault\\" such as adjacent RR or BB two apart.    - If a block is \\"RBRB\\" or \\"RBBR\\", it generates an external fault when combined with adjacent blocks.    Since we have 250 blocks, and each must contribute at least 1 fault (internal or external), this logic also guarantees at least 250 faults.  4. **Configuration with Minimum Faults and Termination of Adjustments:**    Another approach confirms that we cannot reduce the number of blocks of the same color:    - Assuming no more than two consecutive dots of the same color minimizes the total faults.    - Rearranging any groups of three or more consecutive red or blue through the above procedure confirms all such groups become length 1 or 2.

Therefore, a rhombus meets both criteria. 4. **Square**: A square is a special case of both a rectangle and a rhombus. It is axisymmetric along both its diagonals and its sides. It is also centrally symmetric. Therefore, a square meets both criteria.

The car covers 630 km in 7 hours, so its speed is: Speed of car = Distance / Time Speed of car = 630 km / 7 hours Speed of car = 90 km/h We are given that the average speed of the car is 1 4/5 times the average speed of the bike. Let's denote the speed of the bike as \\"b\\" km/h.

The slope of l_1 can be derived from its equation by rearranging it into slope-intercept form (y=mx+b), where m is the slope. Here, we find the slope of l_1 is frac{m-2}{1}. Similarly, for l_2, the slope is frac{3}{m}. Since the two lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal. Hence, we have: frac{m-2}{1} = frac{3}{m}. Cross multiply to solve for m: (m-2)m = 3 m^2 - 2m - 3 = 0. Factorizing the quadratic equation, we get: (m-3)(m+1) = 0. Therefore, we have two possible solutions for m:  m=3 quad text{or} quad m=-1.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the given conditions: We are tasked with proving that for tangents drawn to the parabola x^2 = 4y, which are perpendicular to each other, the relationship a^4 b^4 = (a^2 + b^2)^3 holds for the lengths a and b of the perpendicular tangents. 2. According to the given explanation, in the KőMaL problem F. 3026, it was proven that the tangents drawn to a parabola through its focus are perpendicular to each other and that their point of intersection lies on the directrix of the parabola.  3. We'll first show the reverse: if the tangents at points A and B on the parabola are perpendicular, then the chord AB passes through the focus of the parabola. 4. Suppose points A and \`B\` are the points of tangency where each tangent is perpendicular to the other (see Figure 1). Let the tangent at A intersect the directrix at point \`P\`, and let the line AF intersect the parabola again at B'. According to F. 3026, the tangent at B' intersects the tangent at A at point \`P\` and they are perpendicular to each other. 5. Since the tangent at point \`B\` is also perpendicular to AP, but a parabola doesn't have two parallel tangents, we conclude that B equiv B'. Therefore, the chord AB passes through the focus F, and the perpendicular tangents intersect on the directrix. 6. These tangents form right triangles with AF = AD due to symmetry, and we know AP bisects the angle angle FAD by properties of the parabola. Therefore, Delta ADP cong Delta AFP, implying that angle AFP = 90^circ. 7. Let’s assume a and b are the lengths of the tangents. So we have:    a^2 + b^2 = AB^2    Therefore, we need to show that:    a^4 b^4 = AB^6 8. Consider the area of Delta APB. Twice the area can be calculated as 2 times text{Area} = a cdot b = AB cdot PF, leading to:     left(2 times text{Area}right)^4 = a^4 b^4 = AB^4 cdot PF^4     From this and our requirement, it means we must have:    AB^4 cdot PF^4 = AB^6 9. Therefore, we get:    PF^2 = AB 10. To verify this, use the height theorem in the right-angled triangle Delta ABP:      PF^2 = AF cdot FB     Since AB = AF + FB, we need to show:     AF cdot FB = (AF + FB)^2 = AB 11. This equation simplifies to:     (AF - 1)(FB - 1) = 1 12. Using the coordinates and properties of the points on the parabola, let the coordinates of A and B be (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) respectively. Given the directrix equation y = -1and from the given equation for the parabola x^2 = 4y, we have AD = 1 + frac{1}{4}x_1^2 and BC = 1 + frac{1}{4}x_2^2.  13. Substituting these into the height theorem equation gives:     left(frac{1}{4} x_1^2 + 1 - 1right)left(frac{1}{4} x_2^2 + 1 - 1right) = 1     left(frac{1}{4} x_1^2right)left(frac{1}{4} x_2^2right) =1     frac{1}{16} x_1^2 x_2^2 = 1      x_1^2 x_2^2 = 16 14. The tangent slope m for point A and B on the parabola y = frac{1}{4}x^2 is m = frac{1}{2}x. For point A, the slope is frac{1}{2}x_1 and for point B, the slope is frac{1}{2}x_2. Because the tangents are perpendicular:     frac{1}{4} x_1 x_2 = -1 15. Squaring both sides gives:      left(frac{1}{4} x_1 x_2right)^2 = 1      frac{1}{16} x_1^2 x_2^2 = 1  16.

Julie can peel potatoes in 10 hours, so in one hour, she can peel 1/10 of the potatoes. Ted can peel potatoes in 8 hours, so in one hour, he can peel 1/8 of the potatoes. When they work together for 4 hours, they can peel: Julie's work in 4 hours = 4 * (1/10) = 4/10 Ted's work in 4 hours = 4 * (1/8) = 4/8 = 1/2 Together, in 4 hours, they peel: 4/10 + 1/2 = 4/10 + 5/10 = 9/10 of the potatoes. This means that after 4 hours, they have 1/10 of the potatoes left to peel. Now, Julie has to finish the remaining 1/10 alone.

This represents the total number of partnerships mentioned from the perspectives of both boys and girls. 3. **Partition Checking:**    The correct scenario would divide this total between boys' reports and girls' reports equally, given there are 7 boys and 8 girls. To form a pair, each partnership is counted once for a boy and once for a girl.    The total should ideally be split into two parts representing the boys' contributions and the girls' contributions:    [    text{Total Sum} = text{Sum provided by boys} + text{Sum provided by girls}    ]    From symmetry and equal contribution of reporting:    [    text{Sum provided by boys} = text{Sum provided by girls}    ]    Hence:    [    frac{74}{2} = 37    ] 4. **Examine the Girls' Mention Report:**    Let us assume the number ( 5 ) was reported by a boy (since the only ( 5 ) in the list must belong to either a boy or a girl). We know the other numbers from boys:    [    3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27    ]    If the number ( 5 ) was reported by a boy, we need to add it to the previous calculation:    [    27 + 5 = 32    ]    This results in the boys’ sum as ( 32 ). 5. **Identify Mistake with Girls’ Sum:**    Now, if the boys’ total sum is 32, then the girls' sum should be:    [    74 - 32 = 42    ]    Therefore:    [    text{Sum provided by girls} = 42    ]    And we were expecting each of boys' and girls' sums to be (37), hence a discrepancy is obvious. 6. **Conclusion:**    Since having equal summations is one of the core checks (by basic rules), and here the numbers provided differ as ( 32 neq 37 ; text{and} ; 42 neq 37 ), there must be a counting mistake in the given numbers.

This is a contradiction because it violates the initial condition that ( c_i leq 1 ). 10. **Conclude**:    Therefore, such a group of 11 spies that cannot be numbered as required does not exist.

Let P be a point inside this polygon, chosen from a specific half-plane relative to some segment [AB]. 2. **Area Function Representation**:    Consider the area of the triangle ABP as a function of the coordinates (x,y) of point P. This area can be represented as a linear function of the form:    [    text{Area}(ABP) = ax + by + c    ]    where a, b, c are real constants. 3. **Function for Area Difference**:    Returning to the problem, let P be the chosen interior point of the 2n-gon.

This means we are creating triangles by connecting this point to all the vertices of the polygon. Given that connecting all the vertices results in 2022 triangles, we can understand that each vertex, when connected to our starting point, forms a triangle, except for the vertices directly connected to the starting point (since connecting to the adjacent vertices does not form a triangle within the polygon). This effectively means we are forming a triangle with every other vertex, which is equivalent to the number of sides of the polygon minus one (since we are not counting the side we started on as it is divided into two by our starting point).

We need to consider the position of point P and apply the properties of a hyperbola. This is a moderately difficult problem that can be easily misunderstood if not approached carefully. First, we'll find the values of a, b, and c using the given hyperbola equation. Then, using the definition of a hyperbola, we can find the relationship between |PF_1| and |PF_2|. Finally, we'll determine the value of |PF_2| and verify the answer. **Approach** In the hyperbola equation frac{x^{2}}{16} - frac{y^{2}}{20} = 1, we have a = 4, b = 2sqrt{5}, and c = 6. By the definition of a hyperbola, we have ||PF_1| - |PF_2|| = 2a = 8. Given that |PF_1| = 9, we can find two possible values for |PF_2|: 1 or 17. **Step-by-step solution** 1.

Thus, E is a common point equidistant from P, Q, R, S, meaning PQRS must also be a cyclic quadrilateral because each side of PQRS is subtending the circle centered at E. 4. **Checking for Parallelogram**:     - Given that each set of consecutive triangles share a side whose perpendicular bisector goes through E, and each circumcenter lies on this perpendicular bisector, PQRS must also be a parallelogram. This follows because opposite sides are equally distant from a common point E, hence must be parallel and equal. 5. **Conclusion**:    - Therefore, not only is PQRS cyclic, which results from E being equidistant from P, Q, R, S but it also forms a parallelogram due to the inherent symmetrical properties imparted by the cyclic nature of ABCD.    - The final answer here is text{PQRS is a parallelogram}.

If we apply this repeatedly, we get:      [      g_{k+1}(x) = g(g_k(x)) leq g(f(x))      ]    - Since f and g are strictly increasing and g(f(x)) > f(g(g(x))), it follows that:      [      g(g_k(x)) < f(x)      ]    - Therefore:      [      g_{k+1}(x) < f(x)      ]    - So by induction, g_k(x) leq f(x) for all k geq 0. 6. **Contradiction:**    - If g(x) = x for all x in mathbb{N}, then f(g(g(x))) = f(x) = g(f(x)), a contradiction with condition (ii).    - Therefore, there must exist an x_0 in mathbb{N} such that x_0 < g(x_0).    - Consider the sequence x_0, x_1, ldots where x_k = g_k(x_0).    - The sequence is increasing.

Equating the two expressions for ( a^{mn} ):    [    t d + 1 = u d - 1.    ]    Simplifying this, we get:    [    u d - t d = 2 quad Rightarrow quad (u - t) d = 2.    ]     6.

Completing the square for both x and y terms, we get:    - For x: x^{2} + 2x + 1 = (x+1)^{2}    - For y: y^{2} - 2y + 1 = (y-1)^{2} Thus, the equation of the circle can be rewritten as: [ (x+1)^{2} + (y-1)^{2} = 2 - a + 1 + 1 ] Simplifying, we find: [ (x+1)^{2} + (y-1)^{2} = 4 - a ] But to match the center-radius form (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2, we see that it actually should be: [ (x+1)^{2} + (y-1)^{2} = 2 - a ] 2. **Calculating the Distance from the Center to the Chord (d)**:   The equation of the line is x+y+2=0. The center of the circle is at (-1, 1).

We are asked to find the number of students with a score of 115 or higher. **Step 2: Using symmetry property of normal distribution** Since the normal distribution is symmetric about its mean, the probability of getting a score greater than 105 is equal to the probability of getting a score less than 95. Let's denote the probability of getting a score greater than 115 as P(xi ge 115). **Step 3: Calculating the probability** Since P(95 leq xi leq 105) = 0.32, we can find the probability of getting a score outside this range: 1 - P(95 leq xi leq 105) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. As the distribution is symmetric, half of this probability (0.68 / 2 = 0.34) corresponds to scores lower than 95, and the other half corresponds to scores greater than 105.

For vampire bats: 3 cloves of garlic repel 8 vampire bats. To repel 40 vampire bats, we need ( 40 times frac{3}{8} = 15 ) cloves of garlic. Now, let's add up the total number of cloves needed to repel all the creatures: ( 90 + 12 + 15 = 117 ) cloves of garlic. However, the question states that 72 cloves are required.

Each face of the large cube has these middle cubes (like in figure 14 in the original problem statement). Out of five known faces, we have 3 black middle cubes and 17 white middle cubes.     - Since the large cube has 6 faces, each containing 1 middle cube:     [     1 text{ (middle cube per face)} times 6 text{ (faces)} = 6 text{ (total middle cubes)}     ]     - Given that among the known 5 faces, we have 3 black middle cubes and 17 white middle cubes:     [     3 + x = text{number of black middle cubes}     ]     [     17 + y = text{number of white middle cubes}     ]     - Since the total number of middle cubes is 6:     [     x + y = 1      ]     - Since there are 5 already known middle cubes, we know:     [     3 text{ (already black)} + x = text{total black middle cubes}     ]     - Where ( x ) is black, and:     [     17 text{ (already white)} + y = text{total white middle cubes}     ]     - Where ( y ) is white.     Therefore, the sixth face must have either 1 or 3 black middle cubes and respectively, the remaining number of white middle cubes to sum up the total 6 middle cubes. 2. **Analyzing the Corner Cubes:**    Consider the corner cubes of each face (like in figure 15 of the original problem statement).

We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD: 1. Divide 720 by 432 and find the remainder: 720 ÷ 432 = 1 remainder 288 2. Now divide 432 by the remainder from the previous step (288): 432 ÷ 288 = 1 remainder 144 3. Now divide 288 by the remainder from the previous step (144): 288 ÷ 144 = 2 remainder 0 Since we have a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 144 centimeters.

So we can substitute L with 1495 in the equation: 1495 = 5S + 4 Now, let's solve for S: 1495 - 4 = 5S 1491 = 5S Divide both sides by 5 to find S: S = 1491 / 5 S = 298.2 However, S must be a whole number because we are dealing with the division of integers. Since we cannot have a fraction as a result for S, we need to re-evaluate our calculation. It seems there might have been a mistake in the division step. Let's try it again: S = 1491 / 5 S = 298 (with no remainder, since we are looking for a whole number) Now that we have the value of S, we can find the difference between the two numbers: Difference = L - S Difference = 1495 - 298 Difference = 1197 Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is boxed{1197} ."},{"instruction":"The sum of three prime numbers is 47.

Therefore:  overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = cos 60^{circ} = frac{1}{2}  The square of the magnitude of overrightarrow{a} - 2overrightarrow{b} is given by:  (overrightarrow{a} - 2overrightarrow{b})^2 = overrightarrow{a}^2 - 4overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + 4overrightarrow{b}^2 = 1 - 4 times frac{1}{2} + 4  Simplifying the above expression, we have:  (overrightarrow{a} - 2overrightarrow{b})^2 = 1 - 2 + 4 = 3  Thus, the magnitude of the vector overrightarrow{a} - 2overrightarrow{b} is:  |overrightarrow{a} - 2overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{3}  [boxed{|overrightarrow{a} - 2overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{3}}]"},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, if angle BAC=60^{circ}, AB=5, AC=6, then the area of triangle ABC is S= ______.","output":"Given that in triangle ABC, angle BAC=60^{circ}, AB=5, AC=6, We know that the area of a triangle is given by the formula S=frac{1}{2}ABcdot ACcdot sin angle BAC.

This means that the selling price (SP) of the scooter is 120% of the original cost (C). So, SP = 120% of C SP = 1.20 * C We also know that Anil made a profit of Rs. 1100. Profit is calculated as the selling price minus the original cost. Profit = SP - C 1100 = 1.20 * C - C 1100 = 0.20 * C Now, let's solve for C: C = 1100 / 0.20 C = 5500 Now that we have the original cost of the scooter, we can calculate the percentage of the cost that Anil spent on repairs. Percentage spent on repairs = (Amount spent on repairs / Original cost) * 100 Percentage spent on repairs = (500 / 5500) * 100 Percentage spent on repairs = (1/11) * 100 Percentage spent on repairs ≈ 9.09% Anil spent approximately boxed{9.09%}  of the cost on repairs."},{"instruction":"There is a bidirectional railway line with 11 stations, and the distance between each adjacent station is 7 kilometers.

When all pipes are opened together, their combined rate is the sum of the filling rates of the two pipes minus the emptying rate of the outlet pipe. So, the combined rate is: ( frac{1}{18} + frac{1}{20} - frac{1}{45} ) To find a common denominator, we can use 180, which is the least common multiple of 18, 20, and 45.

First, let's introduce a substitution to simplify our problem. Let t = log _{b}a. This substitution is crucial because it allows us to express the given equation in terms of t, a single variable, rather than a and b directly. Given that a > b > 1, it follows that t > 1. This is because the logarithm of a number greater than 1 to a base that is less than the number itself is always greater than 1. We substitute t into the equation log _{a}b+log _{b}a=frac{5}{2}, resulting in the equation t + frac{1}{t} = frac{5}{2}. This transformation is based on the properties of logarithms, specifically that log_b a is the multiplicative inverse of log_a b when a and b are positive and not equal to 1. Solving the equation for t, we get a quadratic equation: 2t^2 - 5t + 2 = 0. This can be solved by either factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Factoring this quadratic equation, we find that t = 2 or t = frac{1}{2}.  However, since t > 1, we discard t = frac{1}{2}, leaving us with t = 2 as the only viable solution. This step is crucial because it uses the given constraint a > b > 1 to eliminate an extraneous solution. Given log _{b}a = 2, we can use the definition of logarithms to deduce that a = b^2. This is a straightforward application of the logarithmic identity log_b a = n iff a = b^n. Given a^{b} = b^{a}, and substituting a = b^2, we get b^{2b} = b^{a}. Simplifying this, we see that a = 2b must hold. Substituting a = b^2 into this, we find that b^2 = 2b. Solving the equation b^2 = 2b, we find b = 2 (discarding b = 0 as it doesn't satisfy the initial condition a > b > 1). Substituting b = 2 into a = b^2, we find a = 4.

Therefore, the areas of these triangles are equal.    - Repeat this process for the other five trapezoids. Each pair of triangles within a trapezoid has equal area. 5. **Subtract the common area:**    - The hexagon (A_1B_2A_3B_4A_5B_6) can be seen as the union of the hexagon (A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5A_6) and six triangles (A_1A_2B_2), (A_2A_3B_3), ..., (A_6A_1B_1).    - Similarly, the hexagon (B_1A_2B_3A_4B_5A_6) can be seen as the union of the hexagon (A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5A_6) and six triangles (B_1A_2A_1), (B_2A_3A_2), ..., (B_6A_1A_6). 6. **Conclude the equality of areas:**    - Since the areas of the triangles (A_1A_2B_2), (A_2A_3B_3), ..., (A_6A_1B_1) are equal to the areas of the triangles (B_1A_2A_1), (B_2A_3A_2), ..., (B_6A_1A_6), the areas of the hexagons (A_1B_2A_3B_4A_5B_6) and (B_1A_2B_3A_4B_5A_6) are equal.

We consider the possible values of t ranging from 1 to 9, and calculate the possible values of s as 2t (which must also be a feasible digit sum, hence 2 leq 2t leq 18). 1. **Counting feasible t and corresponding s:**    For each t from 1 to 9, we check if 2t is between 2 and 18. This is true for t = 1 to 9. 2. **Calculating choices for each t and corresponding s:**    - For t = 1 to 9, the number of ways to get a sum t for two digits where the first can be 0 (but not for the whole number) is t + 1.    - The number of ways to get a sum s = 2t for two digits (where the first cannot be 0) is 2t + 1 for 2t leq 9, and 19 - 2t for 10 leq 2t leq 18. 3. **Summing up the possibilities:**    - For t = 1 to 4 (where 2t leq 9), sum (t + 1)(2t + 1).    - For t = 5 to 9 (where 10 leq 2t leq 18), sum (t + 1)(19 - 2t). Calculating the sums: - For t = 1 to 4, (1+1)(2+1) + (2+1)(4+1) + (3+1)(6+1) + (4+1)(8+1) = 2*3 + 3*5 + 4*7 + 5*9 = 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 = 94. - For t = 5 to 9, (5+1)(19-10) + (6+1)(19-12) + (7+1)(19-14) + (8+1)(19-16) + (9+1)(19-18) = 6*9 + 7*7 + 8*5 + 9*3 + 10*1 = 54 + 49 + 40 + 27 + 10 = 180.

This is due to the property of linear recurrence relations in modular arithmetic, which asserts that the Fibonacci sequence modulo any integer is periodic. 3. **Implication of Periodicity:**    If the sequence is periodic, it means there exists some period, say (T), such that:    [ F_n equiv F_{n+T} pmod{m} quad text{for all } n ]     4. **Occurrence of Zero:**    In a periodic sequence, each element repeats after every (T) positions. Specifically, since ( F_0 = 0 ) and the sequence is periodic, this implies that there will always be some index ( k ) such that:    [ F_k equiv 0 pmod{m} ]        This zero recurrence in the modulo sequence implies that there will always be a Fibonacci number at some position ( n_1 + kT ) which is congruent to zero modulo ( m ).  5. **Conclusion:**    Since the sequence modulo (m) is periodic, and this period includes at least one element congruent to zero, the Fibonacci sequence will contain infinitely many numbers divisible by ( m ).

For ( z_1 = z^2 - 4 ):     tanleft(frac{5pi}{6}right) = frac{text{Imaginary part}}{text{Real part}} = frac{2xy}{x^2 - y^2 - 4}  7. For ( z_2 = z^2 + 4 ):     tanleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{text{Imaginary part}}{text{Real part}} = frac{2xy}{x^2 - y^2 + 4}  8. We now know the values of the tangent and will set up the following:     tanleft(frac{5pi}{6}right) = -sqrt{3}      tanleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = sqrt{3}  9. Solving these equations simultaneously:    - From ( tanleft(frac{5pi}{6}right) ):       -sqrt{3} = frac{2xy}{x^2 - y^2 - 4}           - From ( tanleft(frac{pi}{3}right) ):       sqrt{3} = frac{2xy}{x^2 - y^2 + 4}  10. Let ( w = x^2 - y^2 ):      -sqrt{3} = frac{2xy}{w - 4}       sqrt{3} = frac{2xy}{w + 4}  11. By solving ( w ) and ( xy ):      2xy = -sqrt{3}(w - 4)       2xy = sqrt{3}(w + 4)  12. Solving for ( w ):     Subtract the first from the second equation:      2sqrt{3} cdot 4 = 2sqrt{3}w       8sqrt{3} = 2sqrt{3}w       w = 4  13. Using ( w = 4 ):      2xy = -sqrt{3}(4 - 4)       2xy = sqrt{3}(4 + 4)       2xy = 8sqrt{3}       xy = 4sqrt{3}  14. Now we know:      x^2 - y^2 = 4       xy = sqrt{3}  15. Solving the system of quadratic equations:      x = 1, y = sqrt{3}      or      x = -1, y = -sqrt{3}  16. Therefore, the possible values of (z) are:      z = 1 + sqrt{3}i      or      z = -1 - sqrt{3}i  # Conclusion:   boxed{z = 1 + sqrt{3}i text{ or } z = -1 - sqrt{3}i}"},{"instruction":"triangle (ABC) with (AB < AC), let (H) be the orthocenter and (O) be the circumcenter.

Let ( A', B', C' ) be the medial triangle of ( triangle ABC ), where ( A' ) is the midpoint of ( BC ), and similarly for ( B' ) and ( C' ). Notice that the midpoint of ( OH ), which is the nine-point-center ( N ) of (triangle ABC), is also the circumcenter of (triangle A'B'C') because the midpoints of the sides of (triangle ABC) are on the nine-point circle. 2. Since ( N ) is on ( BC ), ( NA' ) is parallel to ( B'C' ). Therefore, by similarity, we know that ( OA ) is parallel to ( BC ). 3. Given that ( AB < AC ), vertex ( B ) lies on the minor arc ( AC ) of the circumcircle. This implies that the central angles satisfy ( angle OAC = angle OCA = angle C ), and thus, ( angle AOC = 180^circ - 2angle C ). 4. To proceed, we need the expressions for the other two angles of (triangle ABC) in terms of ( angle C ):    - ( angle B = 90^circ + angle C )    - ( angle A = 90^circ - 2angle C ) 5. We use the Extended Law of Sine, which states:    [    frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} = 2R    ]    Let's denote ( AB = x ) and ( AC = 5 - x ). Using practical applications of the law, we can write:    [    frac{1}{sin(90^circ - 2C)} = frac{x}{sin(90^circ + C)} = frac{5 - x}{sin C} = 2R    ] 6. Simplifying these relationships:    [    frac{1}{cos 2C} = frac{x}{cos C} = frac{5 - x}{sin C} = 2R    ]    From which we have:    [    frac{1}{cos 2C} = frac{5}{cos C + sin C}    ] 7. Let us solve for ( cos C + sin C ):    [    5 (cos^2 C - sin^2 C) = cos C + sin C    ]    Since using trigonometric identities,    [    cos^2 C + sin^2 C = 1    ] 8. This leads us to square both sides:    [    left(cos C + sin Cright)^2 = 1 - sin 2C    ] 9. Solving for ( sin 2C ):    [    1 - sin 2C = frac{1}{25}, implies sin 2C = frac{24}{25}    ] 10. Given that ( cos 2C = frac{sqrt{1 - sin^2 2C}}{25} ), thus:     [     cos 2C = frac{7}{25}     ] 11. We then solve for the circumradius ( R ):     [     2R = frac{1}{cos 2C} = frac{1}{frac{7}{25}} = R = frac{25}{14}     ] 12. Viewing (triangle ABC) with ( BC = 1 ) as the base, the height from ( A ) to ( BC ) is:     [     sqrt{R^{2}-left(frac{BC}{2}right)^{2}} = sqrt{left(frac{25}{14}right)^2 - left(frac{1}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{625}{196} - frac{1}{4}}     ] 13. Where:     [     frac{625}{196} - frac{1}{4} = frac{625}{196} - frac{49}{196} = frac{576}{196} = left(frac{24}{14}right)^2     ]     Thus:     [     text{Height} = frac{24}{14} = frac{12}{7}     ] 14.

Since each group has n vertices and n-1 edges, at least one vertex in each must be a leaf.      - Label these leaves L_1 (in V_1) and L_2 (in V_2). 6. **Path Flipping Process:**    - There is an even-length path between L_1 and L_2.    - Flip all vertices along this path to blue and back, except the leaves themselves, ensuring L_1 and L_2 stay blue.    - Remove L_1 and L_2, reducing the problem to tree with 2(n-1) vertices, and invoke the inductive hypothesis. 7. **Conclusion for Part (a):**    - Allen can win if and only if the tree can be divided into two groups of equal size such that all edges cross between the groups.        (blacksquare)  Part (b) 1. **Problem Restatement:**    - We need to show that if Allen can win, then the minimum number of moves needed is M = min_{sigma} sum_{i=1}^{n} d(a_i, b_{sigma(i)}). 2. **Remapping Tree Structure:**    - For each edge e in the graph, determine the minimum number of flips m_e necessary.    - Remove e, dividing the tree into two parts, possibly unequal in size. Denote the size difference by d.    - Flipping any other edge doesn't alter d, while e itself must flip at least d times to equalize the number of blue vertices. 3. **Creating Edge Multiplicity Graphs:**    - Let T' be a transformation of the tree with each edge e duplicated m_e times.    - M' is the sum of m_e over all edges. 4. **Inequalities:**    - Since the cost of any permutation is at least the sum of the m_e values for reasons stated, M' leq M. 5. **Equality Argument:**    - To show M' = M, we use induction to partition T' such that it respects the conditions stated.        - **Base Case:**      - If any m_e is zero, the tree splits naturally into two smaller parts. Done trivially.    - **Inductive Step:**      - Consider trees of larger size, ensuring partition by already calculated m_e values. 6. **Constructing Minimum Cost:**    - Using a path of vertices involving the minimal flips aligns with the conditions and supports the induction process. 7. **Conclusion for Part (b):**    - Allen wins by making M' moves due to the way V_1 and V_2 are split and operations defined.    - Since M is the total minimal sum, we have M = M', thus concluding Allen can win in precisely M moves.

What is the maximum number of cells the minielephant can visit?","output":"To determine the maximum number of cells the mini-elephant can visit, we need to consider its movement pattern and the constraints imposed by the chessboard configuration. 1. **Chessboard Setup**:    The chessboard is a 5 times 5 grid with cells colored in a checkerboard pattern, where the corner cells are black. Here is the layout:      | 1 |   | 4 |   | 6 |    |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|    |   | 2 |   | 5 |   |    | 3 |   | 7 |   | 9 |    |   | 11|   | 8 |   |    | 12|   | 10|   |   | 2. **Mini-Elephant Movement**:    - The mini-elephant can move to a diagonally adjacent cell that has not been visited, or it can jump over a cell that has been visited to land on an unvisited cell.     3. **Initial Route Example**:    Let's first provide an example route where the mini-elephant visits 12 cells, as indicated by the numbers 1 through 12 in the example grid above. These numbers show the order of cell visitation, demonstrating one possible path for the mini-elephant. 4. **Proof of Maximum Cells Visited**:    To prove that no more than 12 cells can be visited by the mini-elephant, we need to consider the structure and constraints of the movements:        - **Corner Cells Movement**: The mini-elephant can leave a corner cell only by moving to an adjacent cell or by jumping. Leaving a corner by moving to an adjacent cell is restricted to the first move since all other future cells would prevent such movement except by a leap facilitated by previously visited cells.    - **Limitation on Recursion to Corners**: Once the mini-elephant leaves the corner, it returns through jumps or not at all, reducing the likelihood of revisiting a corner cell multiple times in a valid path. Given the pattern, the mini-elephant can effectively visit at most three corner cells.    - **Critical Path Limitation**: Since the mini-elephant can leave two of the corner cells at most twice, indicating the total number of transitions is inherently limited. 5. **Conclusion**: Based on the movement rules and the checkerboard layout, the mini-elephant's path will be restricted in a manner where it cannot visit more than 12 cells without repeating.

So, sin B= sqrt {3}sin A, and B=2A, So, sin 2A= sqrt {3}sin A, i.e., 2sin Acos A= sqrt {3}sin A. Since A is an internal angle of the triangle, we get sin Aneq 0. So, cos A= frac { sqrt {3}}{2}. Hence, A=30^{circ}. By using the law of sines, we find the ratio of sin A and sin B from the ratio of a and b. Then substitute B=2A and simplify using the double angle sine function formula. Since sin A is not equal to 0, we divide both sides of the equation by sin A to get the value of cos A. Finally, using the trigonometric function values of special angles, we find the degree of A. This problem tests our understanding of the law of sines, the double angle sine function formula, and the trigonometric function values of special angles. The key to solving this problem is to find the relationship between the sides and angles using the law of sines and then transform the trigonometric functions to find the value of cos A.

Specifically, we can label the rooms with binary numbers ranging from 0 to 2^n - 1. This would ensure that each room has a unique identifier. 2. **Probing strategy:**    We will design an algorithm to establish correspondence between the switches and the rooms. The algorithm works by sending people to rooms as follows:    - In the (2k-1)-th attempt, send individuals to the rooms whose labels in binary representation have the k-th bit set to 1. Similarly, in the 2k-th attempt, send individuals to the rooms where the k-th bit is 0. This can be represented as:    [    S(2k-1) = { R  |  text{bit}_k(R) = 1 }    ]    [    S(2k) = { R  |  text{bit}_k(R) = 0 }    ]    Where text{bit}_k(R) refers to the k-th bit of the binary representation of room R. 3. **Exhausting all possibilities:**    By following this strategy for k running from 1 to n, the foreman establishes the responsiveness pattern for each switch and can then definitively map each switch to the correct room. Since k runs from 1 to n, the number of attempts necessary is 2n.  Therefore, by using 2n attempts (probes), it is possible to definitively determine which switch corresponds to which room. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{2n} ] # Part (b): 1. **Matching scenario with fewer attempts:**    Suppose the foreman tries to determine the switch-to-room correspondence using 2n-1 attempts instead of 2n attempts as in part (a). We need to determine if this approach is still feasible. 2. **Constructing a counter-argument:**    Consider that after 2n-2 attempts, the responsiveness patterns would be partially determined but not conclusively for all switches. Let’s say in the 2n-1-th attempt, there's ambiguity, as this one less attempt leaves a binary decision unresolved. 3. **Graph approach:**    Assume each room-switch pairing forms a bipartite graph where vertices (rooms and switches) form 2^n edges as room-switch assignments. Each vertex should effectively resolve with degree 2 if following exact binary responsiveness. Lacking one full round (one 2^k bit determination) leaves pairs unresolved. 4. **Inconclusiveness proof:**    Given these 2n-1 probes, the foreman may face a scenario where not every cycle resolves among all room-switch pairs due to one unresolved bit determination. Hence, concluding certainty in mapping is jeopardized. Therefore, using just 2n-1 attempts risks failing to establish the correct correspondence definitively. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{No, it is not possible with } 2n-1 text{ probes.}} ]"},{"instruction":"The point corresponding to the complex number z = frac {1i}{i} in the complex plane is located in ( ) A: the first quadrant B: the second quadrant C: the third quadrant D: the fourth quadr","output":"Solution: z = frac {1-i}{i} = frac {1}{i} - 1 = -1 - i, The coordinates of the corresponding point are (-1, -1), which is located in the third quadrant, So the answer is: boxed{text{C}}.
