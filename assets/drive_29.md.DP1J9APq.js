The total distance covered when the train crosses the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform (300 + P). Using the speed of the train, we can set up the equation: 21.43 meters/second = (300 meters + P) / 39 seconds Now, we solve for P: 21.43 * 39 = 300 + P 835.77 = 300 + P P = 835.77 - 300 P = 535.77 meters Therefore, the length of the platform is approximately boxed{535.77} meters."},{"instruction":"Given a set of data: 10, 30, 50, 50, 70.

The normal vector to the plane (x + y - 2 = 0) is (overrightarrow{n_{2}} = (1, 1, 0)). These normal vectors are perpendicular to their respective planes. The angle between these vectors will be the same as the angle between the planes. 2. **Calculate the Dot Product of the Normal Vectors:** The dot product of (overrightarrow{n_{1}}) and (overrightarrow{n_{2}}) is calculated as follows: [ overrightarrow{n_{1}} cdot overrightarrow{n_{2}} = (2) cdot (1) + (-1) cdot (1) + (-3) cdot (0) = 2 - 1 + 0 = 1 ] 3. **Calculate the Magnitudes of the Normal Vectors:** The magnitude of (overrightarrow{n_{1}}) is: [ left|overrightarrow{n_{1}}right| = sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2 + (-3)^2} = sqrt{4 + 1 + 9} = sqrt{14} ] The magnitude of (overrightarrow{n_{2}}) is: [ left|overrightarrow{n_{2}}right| = sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2} = sqrt{1 + 1 + 0} = sqrt{2} ] 4. **Calculate the Cosine of the Angle:** The cosine of the angle (phi) between the normal vectors is given by: [ cos phi = frac{overrightarrow{n_{1}} cdot overrightarrow{n_{2}}}{left|overrightarrow{n_{1}}right| left|overrightarrow{n_{2}}right|} = frac{1}{sqrt{14} cdot sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{28}} = frac{1}{2 sqrt{7}} ] 5. **Find the Acute Angle (alpha):** The acute angle (alpha) between the planes is given by: [ alpha = arccos left(left|cos phiright|right) = arccos left(frac{1}{2 sqrt{7}}right) ] # Conclusion [ boxed{arccos left(frac{1}{2 sqrt{7}}right)} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that x=x_{1} and x=x_{2} are respectively the local minimum and maximum points of the function f(x)=2a^{x}ex^{2} where a>0 and aneq 1.

In graph theory terms, this setup describes a hypercube graph Q_n. 2. **Define Vertices and Edges:** Each school in Hyperland is represented by a binary sequence of length n. Thus, there are 2^n schools (vertices). Two schools are connected by an edge if and only if their binary representations differ by exactly one bit (Hamming distance of 1). 3. **Median Vertex:** To determine if Hyperland is harmonious, we consider any three vertices x, y, and z. We need to find a vertex m such that d(x, m) + d(y, m) + d(z, m) (the sum of distances from m to x, y, and z) is minimized. This vertex m is known as the median vertex. 4. **Sum of Pairwise Distances:** By the properties of the hypercube, [ text{sum of pairwise distances} = d(x, y) + d(x, z) + d(y, z). ] This sum is fixed for any three vertices. It can be shown that the sum of distances from any vertex to these three vertices will be at least half of the sum of all pairwise distances. 5. **Choosing the Median Vertex:** For each bit position in the binary sequence, consider the most frequent bit value among x, y, and z. Since there are three sequences, the most frequent value will appear at least twice (because three is not even, no tie). - For instance, let’s denote the sequences as: [ x = x_1 x_2 ldots x_n, quad y = y_1 y_2 ldots y_n, quad z = z_1 z_2 ldots z_n. ] - For each bit position i, determine the most frequent bit among x_i, y_i, and z_i. For example, if at the ith bit position 0 appears twice and 1 appears once, we select 0 as the ith bit of m. 6. **Construct the Median Vertex:** Construct m using the most frequent bits at each bit position. This construction ensures that m minimizes the sum of distances d(x, m) + d(y, m) + d(z, m). 7. **Verification:** Since we are always choosing the most frequent bit at each position, this approach minimizes changes at each bit position compared to the three vertices x, y, and z. There is no other single vertex that can minimize the distances more efficiently. 8. **Conclusion:** By proving that a median vertex exists and minimizes the total distance to the selected three vertices, we have shown that Hyperland is a harmonious country as per the problem's definition.

Since BC is perpendicular to both AB and CD, BC can also be represented as BF (the radius of the circle) in this context. - Therefore, the area becomes (AB + CD) times BF. 3. **Condition for Integer Area**: - For the area of trapezoid ABCD to be an integer, the product (AB + CD) times BF must yield an integer.

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 54 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 54 * (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 54 * (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 15 m/s Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken to cross the bridge is given as 51.99584033277338 seconds. Total distance covered = Speed in m/s * Time in seconds Total distance covered = 15 m/s * 51.99584033277338 s Total distance covered = 779.9376049916007 meters The total distance covered is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. We know the length of the bridge is 660 meters, so we can find the length of the train by subtracting the length of the bridge from the total distance covered. Length of the train = Total distance covered - Length of the bridge Length of the train = 779.9376049916007 m - 660 m Length of the train = 119.9376049916007 meters Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{119.94} meters."},{"instruction":"Let ABCD be a rectangle such that overline{AB}=overline{CD}=30, overline{BC}=overline{DA}=50 and point E lies on line AB, 20 units from A.

Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing in (-infty,3-2sqrt{3}) and (3+2sqrt{3},+infty), and monotonically decreasing in (3-2sqrt{3},3+2sqrt{3}).

The order of selection does not matter; for example, the pair of subsets {a, c},{b, c, d, e, f} represents the same selection as the pair {b, c, d, e, f},{a, c}.","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to select two subsets A and B of a set S with six elements such that the union of these two subsets is S. The order of selection does not matter, meaning {A, B} is considered the same as {B, A}. Step 1: Understanding the Problem Given a set S with n elements, we want to find the number of unordered pairs {A, B} of subsets of S such that A cup B = S. We denote this number as f(n). Step 2: Recursive Formula Derivation For each element x in S, there are three possibilities regarding its membership in A and B: 1. x in A only, 2. x in B only, 3. x in A and x in B. Thus, for each element added to a set of size n-1, we can create three new pairs of subsets for each existing pair, except when A = B. In the case where A = B, adding a new element x results in only two new pairs: {A cup {x}, B} and {A, B cup {x}}, since {A cup {x}, B cup {x}} is not a new pair but a repetition of the existing pair. From this, we derive the recursive formula: [ f(n) = 3f(n-1) - 1 ] where f(0) = 1 because the only subset of the empty set is the empty set itself. Step 3: Calculating f(6) Using the Recursive Formula Using the recursive formula, we calculate f(n) for n = 1 to n = 6: [ begin{align*} f(0) &= 1, f(1) &= 3 times 1 - 1 = 2, f(2) &= 3 times 2 - 1 = 5, f(3) &= 3 times 5 - 1 = 14, f(4) &= 3 times 14 - 1 = 41, f(5) &= 3 times 41 - 1 = 122, f(6) &= 3 times 122 - 1 = 365. end{align*} ] Thus, f(6) = boxed{365}. Step 4: Verification Using an Explicit Formula We can also derive an explicit formula for f(n): [ begin{align*} f(n) &= 3^n - left(3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + cdots + 1right) &= 3^n - frac{3^n - 1}{2} &= frac{3^n + 1}{2}. end{align*} ] Plugging n = 6 into this formula gives: [ f(6) = frac{3^6 + 1}{2} = frac{729 + 1}{2} = 365. ] This confirms our previous calculation: f(6) = boxed{365}."},{"instruction":"Prove that (4S = left(a^{2} (bc)^{2}right) operatorname{ctg}(alpha / 2)).","output":"1.

Let's compute the term ( (b - c)^2 ): [ (b - c)^2 = b^2 - 2bc + c^2 ] 4. Using the expressions for ( a^2 ) and ( (b - c)^2 ), calculate ( a^2 - (b - c)^2 ): [ a^2 - (b - c)^2 = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos(alpha)) - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) ] 5.

Now, recall the area ( S ) of the triangle, which is given by: [ S = frac{1}{2}bc sin(alpha) ] 7. Rearrange the expression for ( sin(alpha) ) in the context of the area formula: [ sin(alpha) = frac{2S}{bc} ] 8. Substituting this relation back into the expression ( 2bc(1 - cos(alpha)) ): [ 2bc(1 - cos(alpha)) = 4S frac{(1 - cos(alpha))}{sin(alpha)} ] 9.

Here is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Base Case:** Start with the smallest odd n, which is n = 3. For a 3 times 3 square, we can see that it is composed of 9 unit squares. To cover all the interior segments of this 3 times 3 square, we need at least 4 unit squares. This is because each unit square can cover one interior segment, and there are 4 interior segments in a 3 times 3 square. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for an (n-2) times (n-2) square, the least number of unit squares needed to cover all the interior segments is given by: [ f(n-2) ge frac{(n-2)^2 - 1}{2} ] 3. **Inductive Step:** Consider an n times n square where n is odd. Decompose this square into a central (n-2) times (n-2) square and a frame of width 1 around it. By the inductive hypothesis, the central (n-2) times (n-2) square requires at least: [ frac{(n-2)^2 - 1}{2} ] unit squares to cover all its interior segments. 4. **Covering the Frame:** The frame of width 1 around the (n-2) times (n-2) square consists of 2(n-1) unit squares. These unit squares are distinct from those used to cover the central square. Therefore, we need at least 2(n-1) additional unit squares to cover all the interior segments of the frame. 5. **Combining the Results:** Adding the number of unit squares needed for the central square and the frame, we get: [ f(n) ge frac{(n-2)^2 - 1}{2} + 2(n-1) ] Simplifying this expression: [ f(n) ge frac{(n-2)^2 - 1 + 4(n-1)}{2} ] [ f(n) ge frac{n^2 - 4n + 4 - 1 + 4n - 4}{2} ] [ f(n) ge frac{n^2 - 1}{2} ] 6. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that for any odd n, the least number of unit squares needed to cover all the interior segments of an n times n square is at least: [ f(n) ge frac{n^2 - 1}{2} ] For n = 25, we substitute into the formula: [ f(25) ge frac{25^2 - 1}{2} = frac{625 - 1}{2} = frac{624}{2} = 312 ] The final answer is boxed{312}"},{"instruction":"The minimum positive period of the function f(x)=sin(wx+varphi) (w > 0, |varphi| < frac{pi}{2}) is pi.

Translating back, we get four integers (a < b < c < d) such that (S) contains all three pairs ((a, c)), ((b, d)), and ((a, d)). # Case 3: If there are at least (2^n) pairs ((a, b) in S) satisfying (a leq 2^{n-1} < b), we consider the bipartite graph whose left vertices are the elements of (A = {1, 2, ldots, 2^{n-1}}), whose right vertices are the elements of (B = {2^{n-1} + 1, 2^{n-1} + 2, ldots, 2^n}), and whose edges are the pairs ((a, b) in S) satisfying (a leq 2^{n-1} < b). Since this graph has at least (2^n) edges, it has at least as many edges as it has vertices. Thus, it must contain a cycle. Let ((a_1, a_2, ldots, a_t)) be this cycle, where (t geq 3). Since any cycle in a bipartite graph has an even number of vertices, (t) is even. Assume (a_1 in A). Then, (a_i in A) for every odd (i), and (a_i in B) for every even (i). Since every element of (A) is smaller than every element of (B), we have (a_i < a_j) for every odd (i) and even (j). Let (a_{t+1}) denote (a_1). Since ((a_1, a_2, ldots, a_t)) is a cycle, ((a_i, a_{i+1}) in S) for every (i in {1, 2, ldots, t}). Assume (a_1 geq a_3). Then, (a_1 > a_3). We claim that (a_i > a_{i+2}) for every odd (i in {1, 2, ldots, t-1}). We prove this by induction on (i): - For (i = 1), we have (a_1 > a_3). - For the induction step, assume (a_{i-2} > a_i). Since (i) is odd, (a_{i-2} in A), (a_{i-1} in B), (a_{i+1} in B), and (a_{i+2} in A). Since every element of (A) is smaller than every element of (B), (a_{i-2} < a_{i+1}) and (a_{i+2} < a_{i-1}). If (a_{i-1} > a_{i+1}), then ((a_i, a_{i+2}, a_{i-1}, a_{i+1})) would contradict the assumption that there are no four integers (a < b < c < d) such that (S) contains all three pairs ((a, c)), ((b, d)), and ((a, d)). Thus, (a_{i-1} < a_{i+1}), and (a_i > a_{i+2}). Since (t) is even, (a_1 > a_3 > a_5 > ldots > a_{t+1}), which contradicts (a_{t+1} = a_1). This contradiction shows that our assumption was invalid, and the problem is proven in Case 3 as well. This completes the induction.

A median of a triangle connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. In a triangle formed by a diameter of a circle and a point on the circle, the midpoint of the diameter is also the center of the circle. Let's denote this center as O. 3. **Centroid's Distance from the Circle's Center**: The centroid divides each median into two segments, with the longer segment being twice the length of the shorter segment. This means the centroid is frac{1}{3} of the distance from the vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side along the median. Since O is the midpoint of overline{AB} and also the center of the circle, and C lies on the circle, the centroid is frac{1}{3} of the distance from O to C. 4. **Movement of Point C and the Centroid**: As point C moves around the circle, it traces out the circumference of the circle with radius 12.

Since pi approx 3.14, we have 16pi approx 16 times 3.14 approx 50.24. Rounding this to the nearest positive integer gives us 50.

(b) Linearity of the Generalized Lebesgue Integral 1. Consider the function f_c(x) = left[x^{+}right]_{c} for some c > 0. Due to the monotonicity of f_c, we have: f_c(x + y) leqslant f_cleft( x^{+} + y^{+} right), quad x, y in mathbb{R} 2. **Given the concavity of** f_c on mathbb{R}_{+} and f_c(0) = 0, it follows that: f_cleft( x^{+} + y^{+} right) leqslant f_c( x^{+} ) + f_c( y^{+} ) = f_c(x) + f_c(y) 3. Setting f_a^b(x) = left[x^{+}right]_{a} - left[x^{-}right]_{b} for a, b > 0, we observe that: f_a^b(x) = f_{a+b}(x-b) - b 4. Therefore, we have: begin{aligned} f_a^b(x + y) &= f_{a+b}(x + y - b) - b &leq f_{a+b}(x - b/2) - b/2 + f_{a+b}(y - b/2) - b/2 &= f_{a+b/2}^{b/2}(x) + f_{a+b/2}^{b/2}(y) end{aligned} 5. Additionally: f_a^b(-x) = left[(-x)^{+}right]_{a} - left[(-x)^{-}right]_{b} = left[x^{-}right]_{a} - left[x^{+}right]_{b} = -f_b^a(x) 6. Thus: begin{aligned} f_a^b(x + y) &= -f_b^a(-x - y) &geq -f_{a/2+b}^{a/2}(-x) - f_{a/2+b}^{a/2}(-y) &= f_{a/2}^{a/2+b}(x) + f_{a/2}^{a/2+b}(y) end{aligned} 7.

According to the definition of mathrm{E} f_{c n}^{d n}(X), converging to overline{mathrm{E}} X for all c, d > 0, and by taking limits as n rightarrow infty: lim_{n} mathbb{E} f_{a n}^{b n}(xi + eta) = overline{mathrm{E}} xi + overline{mathrm{E}} eta 9. **Therefore**, the equality overline{mathrm{E}}(xi + eta) = overline{mathrm{E}} xi + overline{mathrm{E}} eta holds.

Let ( R ) be the set of all reference integers. 4. **Lemma ( k in R ):** Since the integers ( x_{i} ) are distinct and ordered, we have: [ x_{i} geq x_{1} + (i-1) ] which immediately implies: [ x_{k} geq x_{1} + (k-1) ] Given ( P(x_{i}) in {1, 2, ldots, k-1} ), the values for ( P(x_{1}) ) and ( P(x_{k}) ) are in this range. Thus: [ |P(x_{k}) - P(x_{1})| leq (k-1) - 1 = k-2 ] Since polynomial ( P ) has integer coefficients, it follows that: [ |x_{k} - x_{1}| > |P(x_{k}) - P(x_{1})| ] Hence: [ |x_{k} - x_{1}| mid |P(x_{k}) - P(x_{1})| ] But since ( x_{k} - x_{1} geq k-1 ), we conclude: [ P(x_{k}) = P(x_{1}) = c ] Therefore, ( k in R ). 5. **Define the New Polynomial ( Q ):** Let: [ Q(X) = P(X) - c ] and consider the unitary polynomial: [ A(X) = prod_{r in R}(X - x_{r}) ] Since ( A ) is also a polynomial with integer coefficients, we can write: [ Q(X) = A(X) U(X) + B(X) ] where ( U, B in mathbb{Z}[X] ) and ( deg(B) < deg(A) ). 6. **Properties of ( B ):** Since ( P(x_{r}) = c ) for all ( r in R ), we have: [ Q(x_{r}) = 0 quad text{and} quad A(x_{r}) = 0 quad text{therefore} quad B(x_{r}) = 0 ] If ( B neq 0 ), then ( deg(B) geq |R| ). However: [ deg(B) < deg(A) = |R| ] Hence, ( B = 0 ) and: [ Q(X) = A(X) U(X) quad text{thus} quad P(X) = A(X) U(X) + c ] 7. **Lemma ( 3: )** For all ( i in {2, ldots, k-1} ), either: [ |x_{i} - x_{1}| geq frac{k-1}{2} quad text{or} quad |x_{i} - x_{k}| geq frac{k-1}{2} ] - If ( x_{i} - x_{1} geq frac{k-1}{2} ), then: [ |x_{i} - x_{1}| geq frac{k-1}{2} ] - Otherwise, ( x_{i} - x_{1} < frac{k-1}{2} ), and given: [ x_{k} - x_{1} geq k-1 ] it follows: [ x_{k} - x_{i} > frac{k-1}{2} quad text{i.e.} quad |x_{k} - x_{i}| > frac{k-1}{2} ] 8. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** Suppose, for contradiction, there exists ( i in {1, 2, ldots, k} setminus R ). We then have ( P(x_{i}) neq 0 ) and: [ P(x_{i}) - c = A(x_{i}) U(x_{i}) quad text{thus} quad U(x_{i}) neq 0 ] Given ( P(x_{i}) in {1, 2, ldots, k-1} ): [ |P(x_{i}) - c| leq k-2 ] With: [ A(x_{i}) leq k-2 ] 9. **Product Calculation:** For some ( e = 1 ) if ( |x_{i} - x_{1}| geq frac{k-1}{2} ) or ( e = k ) otherwise: [ |x_{i} - x_{e}| geq frac{k-1}{2} ] and since ( 1 in R ) and ( k in R ): [ |A(x_{i})| = |x_{i} - x_{e}| times prod_{r in R setminus {e}} |x_{i} - x_{r}| ] Therefore: [ k-2 geq frac{k-1}{2} times prod_{r in R setminus {e}} |x_{i} - x_{r}| ] which implies: [ prod_{r in R setminus {e}} |x_{i} - x_{r}| < 2 quad text{i.e.} quad prod_{r in R setminus {e}} |x_{i} - x_{r}| leq 1 ] As ( |R| leq 3 ), ( |R| < k ), but since ( k geq 6 ), this leads to a contradiction.

We need to show it holds for n = m + 1. Consider binom{m+1}{k} = binom{m}{k} + binom{m}{k-1}. By the inductive hypothesis, binom{m}{k} geq m - 2k + 2 and binom{m}{k-1} geq m - 2(k-1) + 2 = m - 2k + 4. Therefore, binom{m+1}{k} geq (m - 2k + 2) + (m - 2k + 4) = 2m - 4k + 6 geq m + 1 - 2k + 2 for sufficiently large m.

Then: [ T < binom{n}{k} frac{n(n-2k+2)}{binom{n}{k}} = n(n-2k+2) ] This implies: [ binom{n}{k} frac{n(n-2k+2)}{binom{n}{k}} > 2n binom{n}{k} ] Simplifying, we get: [ n(n-2k+2) > 2n binom{n}{k} ] Dividing both sides by n: [ n-2k+2 > 2 binom{n}{k} ] This contradicts our lemma binom{n}{k} geq n - 2k + 2.

The vertex form of a parabola is f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. The axis of symmetry is at x = h. For the given function, the axis of symmetry is at x = 3, which means the vertex is at x = 3. 2. **Find the Minimum Value**: Since the parabola opens upwards, the minimum value of f(x) occurs at the vertex. Substituting x = 3 into the function, we get f(3) = 3^2 - 6(3) - 16 = 9 - 18 - 16 = -25. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is -25. 3. **Determine the Values of x for f(x) = -16**: To find the range of m, we need to know when f(x) = -16. Setting f(x) = -16 gives us the equation x^2 - 6x - 16 = -16. Simplifying, we get x^2 - 6x = 0, which factors to x(x - 6) = 0.

By definition, N is the midpoint between R and S, thus N falls at S' with the scale factor. 3. **Characteristics of the Resulting Circle**: - **Center**: Due to the homothety with center R and factor frac{2}{3}, the center of the resultant circle for N will be shifted towards R.

This simplifies our calculations since the geometric properties of squares (equal sides, right angles) make the projection process easier to manage. 3. **Understanding the identity transformation**: According to Problem 30.4, a projective transformation is an identity transformation if there are three distinct fixed points. Hence, if we can identify three fixed points under our projection sequence, we are done. 4. **Identifying fixed points**: In the context of the square ( ABCD ): - The **vertex points ( A ) and ( B )** will be fixed points since various projections within the same square will not shift these vertices. - The **point at infinity along the line ( AB )** (considering lines extended to infinity in projective geometry) acts as another fixed point. 5. **Invariance over projections**: - Projections from a point onto a perpendicular side through vertices of a square ensure that the side lengths and angles remain unaltered, thereby re-aligning over each 4-step cycle (projection onto each side once). - Since the projections align with the vertices and the line at infinity every full rotation around the square, they will repeat after completing a cycle of 12 projections (3 full rotations around the square). 6. **Conclusion**: Given the fixed points ( A ), ( B ), and the point at infinity on ( AB ), the sequence of projections forms an identity transformation.

Since ( f(x) ) is continuous and strictly increasing, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a unique root ( r in (0, frac{1}{2}) ) such that: [ f(r) = 0 ] Hence, we have: [ 2r^3 + 5r - 2 = 0 ] 6. We aim to show that there is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers ({a_n}) such that: [ frac{2}{5} = r^{a_1} + r^{a_2} + r^{a_3} + cdots ] 7. Consider the infinite series: [ r + r^4 + r^7 + cdots ] This appears to be a geometric series. 8. Verify if the series converges to (frac{2}{5}). We know: [ sum_{n=0}^{infty} r^{3n+1} = r + r^4 + r^7 + cdots ] This geometric series has the first term ( r ) and common ratio ( r^3 ). 9. The sum of an infinite geometric series ( a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + cdots ) is given by: [ frac{a}{1 - r} ] Applying this formula: [ sum_{n=0}^{infty} r^{3n+1} = frac{r}{1 - r^3} ] 10. Substitute (2r^3 = 2 - 5r) into the equation to find: [ 1 - r^3 = frac{5r}{2} ] Hence: [ frac{r}{1 - r^3} = frac{2}{5} ] 11. We therefore have: [ r + r^4 + r^7 + cdots = frac{2}{5} ] 12.

Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 45 km/hr - 36 km/hr Relative speed = 9 km/hr To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s. We use the conversion factor 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s. Relative speed in m/s = 9 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed in m/s = 2.5 m/s The time taken for the faster train to pass the slower train is 36 seconds. In this time, the faster train covers the distance equal to the length of both trains. Distance covered = Relative speed * Time Distance covered = 2.5 m/s * 36 s Distance covered = 90 meters Since the distance covered is the combined length of both trains and both trains are of equal length, we can say that the length of each train is half of the distance covered. Length of each train (L) = Distance covered / 2 Length of each train (L) = 90 meters / 2 Length of each train (L) = 45 meters Therefore, the length of each train is boxed{45} meters."},{"instruction":"The negation of the proposition exists xin R, x^{2}x+1leqslant 0 is ______.","output":"To negate the given existential proposition, exists xin mathbb{R}, such that x^{2}-x+1leqslant 0, we follow two steps: 1. **Change the Quantifier**: Replace the existential quantifier (exists) with the universal quantifier (forall).

We are required to find the shortest path from ( P ) to ( Q ) such that the path intersects each side of the triangle exactly once. 1. **Introduction:** To find the shortest path from ( P ) to ( Q ) touching each side of the triangle ( ABC ), let’s consider reflecting the triangle and the problem in such a way that it simplifies the calculation. 2. **Reflection Technique:** We reflect the triangle (triangle ABC) around each of its sides sequentially and map the point (Q) in the final triangle. Let’s refer to these reflections as reflections over sides ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ). Upon reflection over the sides one by one: 1. Reflect (triangle ABC) over (BC) to get (triangle A'BC'), and let (P') be the reflection of (P). 1. Reflect (triangle A'BC') over (CA) to get (triangle A''B''C), and let (P'') be the reflection of (P'). 1. Reflect (triangle A''B''C) over (AB) to get (triangle A'''B''C), and let (P''') be the reflection of (P''). 3. **Finding (Q'):** Let ( Q' ) be the equivalent point corresponding to ( Q ) in the third reflection. 4. **Shortest Path Calculation:** The shortest path (P rightarrow Q), having the mandatory requirement of touching sides (BC), (CA), and (AB), is equivalent to the straight-line path from (P) to (Q'): [ P rightarrow P' rightarrow P'' rightarrow P'''rightarrow Q' ] 5. **Verification:** The straight line from (P) to (Q'), while reflecting back on each side, translates the shortest path within the constraints through corresponding intersections (P rightarrow P' rightarrow P''rightarrow Q'.) When such a line intersects the original triangle, it touches (BC), (CA), and (AB) exactly once, making sure all triangle sides are touched. 6. **Potential Multiple Paths and Comparison:** Since each reflection generates a side sequence in touching order (BC, CA,) and (AB), we can generate six different touching sequences (order of touching sides). We need to compare a few of these sequences for minimality. This only requires checking three construction orders due to symmetry in reflections (reversing the order). # Conclusion: The shortest path from (P) to (Q) touching each side of the triangle exactly once is achieved by reflecting ( triangle ABC ) step by step over its sides and mapping (P) to (Q'). The shortest path will then be along the straight path corrected back into the original triangle by examining possible symmetries and shortest travel options among candidate paths.

After ((m+1)) rounds, groups of sportsmen will halve in size, leading to: [ f(m + 1, 0) = frac{1}{2} f(m, 0) = frac{1}{2} cdot 2^{n - m} = 2^{n - (m + 1)} cdot binom{m + 1}{0} ] For ( k in {1, ldots, m} ): [ f(m + 1, k) = frac{1}{2} cdot f(m, k) + frac{1}{2} cdot f(m, k - 1) = 2^{n - m - 1} left( binom{m}{k} + binom{m}{k - 1} right) = 2^{n - (m + 1)} cdot binom{m + 1}{k} ] This completes the induction. 2. **Claim 2**: In a tournament with ( 2^n - 2 ) participants and fewer than ( n ) rounds, the number ( f(2m, k) ) is even for any ( k ) from 0 to ( n ); ( f(2m-1, k) ) is odd only for ( k = m - 1 ) or ( k = m ). Use induction on ( n ): - **Base Case**: When ( n = 2 ), it's evident. - **Inductive Step**: Assume for some ( n ), the statement holds. In a tournament with ( 2^{n + 1} ) participants, after the first round, groups of ( 2^n - 1 ) participants will have scored either 0 or 1 points. Applying the first claim shows how to proceed. 4. Introduce two fictitious participants ( A ) and ( B ). Assume they play each other in an odd round, with ( A ) winning and ( B ) losing. This does not affect other participants. In any even ( 2m )-th round, ( A ) and ( B ) maintain scores as per defined pairing rules, which doesn't affect the overall distribution. 5. Apply the established function for ( n = 8 ). The tournament will end after 8 rounds, and the number of participants attaining exactly 5 points is: [ binom{8}{5} = frac{8 cdot 7 cdot 6}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 56 ] It is crucial to note that the fictitious participants ( A ) and ( B ) accrue 4 points each, hence not included. # Conclusion: [ boxed{56} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = sqrt{3}sin^2x + sin x cos x, (1) Find the value of fleft(frac{25pi}{6}right).

To find x, the height of the light source, consider similar triangles: the triangle formed by the light source, a top vertex of the cube, and a corresponding corner of the shadow square. The ratio of the light source height x to the cube height (2 cm) is the same as the ratio of the shadow side length (sqrt{204}) to the cube side length (2 cm).

This immediately tells us that any option including gear 5 as rotating is incorrect. Therefore, option **B: Gears 3, 4, and 5** is eliminated because it includes gear 5 as rotating. 2. Moving on to **Condition ②**, it specifies that if gear 2 or gear 5 rotates, then gear 4 stops. Since we already know gear 2 rotates (from Condition ①), gear 4 must stop. This rules out any option that includes gear 4 as rotating. Consequently, option **A: Gears 2, 4, and 6** is eliminated because it incorrectly includes gear 4 as rotating. 3. **Condition ③** tells us that gears 3 and 4 can rotate simultaneously but cannot stop simultaneously. Since gear 4 stops (from Condition ②), gear 3 must rotate to satisfy this condition. This eliminates any option that does not include gear 3 as rotating. Therefore, option **D: Gears 2, 5, and 6** is eliminated because it does not include gear 3. 4. Lastly, **Condition ④** states that either gear 5 or gear 6 must be rotating. Given that gear 5 stops (from Condition ①), gear 6 must be the one that rotates. This condition does not eliminate any further options since the remaining option includes gear 6 as rotating.

Prove that ( f(x) = f(-x) ) for any real ( x ). 1. **Define Polynomial of Interest**: ( f(x) ) is a polynomial of degree 10. We know that ( f(1) = f(-1) ), ( f(2) = f(-2) ), ( ldots ), ( f(5) = f(-5) ). 2. **Formulate the Difference Polynomial**: Consider the polynomial ( g(x) = f(x) - f(-x) ). This polynomial represents the asymmetry of ( f(x) ). 3. **Determine the Degree of ( g(x) )**: Since ( f(x) ) is of degree 10, the polynomial ( g(x) = f(x) - f(-x) ) cannot have a higher degree than 10. However, because ( f(x) ) is 10th degree, and since subtracting ( f(-x) ) might cancel out some terms, ( g(x) ) can be at most of degree 9 (as any terms that cancel would be even-powered terms). 4. **Verify the Roots of ( g(x) )**: We know that: - ( g(1) = f(1) - f(-1) = 0 ) - ( g(2) = f(2) - f(-2) = 0 ) - ( g(3) = f(3) - f(-3) = 0 ) - ( g(4) = f(4) - f(-4) = 0 ) - ( g(5) = f(5) - f(-5) = 0 ) Since ( g(x) ) is a polynomial of degree at most 9 and has at least 10 roots (including ( pm 1, pm 2, pm 3, pm 4, pm 5 )), by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a non-zero polynomial of degree ( n ) can have at most ( n ) roots. Therefore, if ( g(x) ) has 10 roots, it must be the zero polynomial. 6. **Conclusion**: Since ( g(x) = f(x) - f(-x) ) is identically zero, ( f(x) = f(-x) ) for all ( x ).

Then [AP = sqrt{x^2 + (2 - x)^2}] and [BP = sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + (x + 2)^2}] so we want to minimize (AP + BP), subject to (P) lying on the line (y = x). First, calculate each distance: - The distance (AP) simplifies to (sqrt{x^2 + (2 - x)^2} = sqrt{x^2 + 4 - 4x + x^2} = sqrt{2x^2 - 4x + 4}). - The distance (BP) simplifies to (sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + (x + 2)^2} = sqrt{x^2 - 4x + 4 + x^2 + 4x + 4} = sqrt{2x^2 + 8}). We apply the Triangle Inequality, (AP + BP geq AB), where (AB = sqrt{(2 - 0)^2 + (-2 - 2)^2} = sqrt{4 + 16} = sqrt{20}). The equality occurs when (P) lies on the line segment (AB), which we determine by setting the gradients equal. The gradient between (A) and (B) is ((2+2)/(2-0) = 2), so it intersects (y=x) (gradient (1)) not directly, but through setting (x) values that minimize the sum (AP + BP). By calculating or estimating, one finds this occurs near (x = 1.5). Checking this, we get: - (AP = sqrt{2(1.5)^2 - 4(1.5) + 4} = sqrt{4.5 - 6 + 4} = sqrt{2.5}). - (BP = sqrt{2(1.5)^2 + 8} = sqrt{4.5 + 8} = sqrt{12.5}). Summing these, the minimum (AP + BP approx sqrt{2.5} + sqrt{12.5}), which does not neatly add up to (sqrt{20}), suggesting an error or adjustment is required. Conclusion: It seems there was an oversight in exact positioning or calculation, and thus the minimum sum of distances still equals to (sqrt{20}), which occurs near (x = 1.5). This needs to be confirmed by further detailed calculation.

It is known that P forms a triangle with points B and C on the y-axis, and the circle ((x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1) is the incircle of triangle PBC. The condition for the circle to be an incircle implies |t| > 1. 3. Assume the slope of the line passing through P and intersecting the y-axis (line PB or PC) is k. Thus, the equation of the line is given by: [ y - 2t = k(x - 2t^2) ] 4.

Therefore, the area of the square is: [ text{Area of the square} = 2 times 2 = 4 text{ square meters} ] 2. Next, we need to calculate the area of the circles. Each circle has a radius of 1 meter. Thus, the area of one circle is: [ text{Area of one circle} = pi times r^2 = pi times 1^2 = pi text{ square meters} ] 3. Each of these circles shares a portion with the square in the form of a quadrant (a quarter circle). As there are 4 circles, the total shared area (quadrants) can be calculated. Each quadrant has an area which is one-fourth of the circle's area: [ text{Shared area for one circle} = frac{1}{4} pi ] Therefore, the total shared area for all 4 circles: [ text{Total shared area} = 4 times frac{1}{4} pi = pi text{ square meters} ] 4. The total area covered by the portions of the circles not shared with the square is three-quarters of the total area of each circle, so we subtract the shared area from the total area of the four circles. This leaves us with: [ text{Non-shared area for one circle} = pi - frac{1}{4} pi = frac{3}{4} pi ] Therefore, the total non-shared area for all 4 circles: [ text{Total non-shared area} = 4 times frac{3}{4} pi = 3 pi text{ square meters} ] 5. Adding the area of the square and the non-shared portions of the circles, we get the total covered area: [ text{Total covered area} = text{Area of the square} + text{Total non-shared area} = 4 + 3 pi ] 6.

In our scenario, ( n = 80 ), but the actual number does not affect the generality of the proof. 2. **Range of acquaintances:** Each intern can know between ( 0 ) to ( n-1 ) other interns.

Given that 1 leq x leq 9 and 1 leq y leq 9, it follows that 2 leq x + y leq 18, which leads to x + y = 11. Therefore, N = 11(99x + x + y) = 11^2(9x + 1). Thus, 9x + 1 must be a perfect square. By trial calculation, when x = 7, the condition is satisfied. Hence, y = 4. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 7 times 4 = 28 text{ cm}^2.

There are three occurrences of 13, so a=3. - For b, which represents the number of salespersons with sales amounts of 26 (in units of 10,000), we count the occurrences of 26 in the data. There are four occurrences of 26, so b=4. Therefore, the answers are: a=3, b=4. boxed{a=3, b=4} Part 2: Calculating the Average, Mode, and Median - **Average Sales Amount (overline{x}):** The average sales amount is calculated by summing all the sales amounts and dividing by the total number of salespersons.

Since there are 30 salespersons, the median will be the average of the 15th and 16th values, both of which are 22 (in 10,000 units).

Among these, the median of 22 (in 10,000 units) is the highest, which is advantageous for the company as it implies the lowest cost. - For the employees, this amount is at an average level, making it an acceptable threshold for earning commissions. - Therefore, setting the median as the basic amount balances the interests of both the company and its employees. boxed{text{Basic Sales Amount} = 22 , (text{in } 10,000 text{ units})}"},{"instruction":"Two different natural numbers are selected from the set {1, 2, 3, ldots, 7}.

Simplify the trigonometric values: [ sin(30^circ) = frac{1}{2}, quad cos(60^circ) = frac{1}{2} ] Thus, [ T(n) = (2 cdot frac{1}{2} cdot sin(n))^2 + frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{2} + cos(2n) right) ] [ T(n) = sin^2(n) + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{2} cos(2n) ] 6.

Since (sin^2(n) + cos^2(n) = 1), we can rewrite: [ T(n) = 1 - cos^2(n) + frac{1}{4} ] 8. Simplify further: [ T(n) = frac{3}{4} ] 9. Now, we need to compute: [ 4 sum_{n=1}^{30} n cdot T(n) ] Since ( T(n) = frac{3}{4} ), we have: [ 4 sum_{n=1}^{30} n cdot frac{3}{4} = 3 sum_{n=1}^{30} n ] 10.

For the factor 2^4, we need at least 2^(4/3) in k. For the factor 3^3, we need at least 3^(3/3) = 3 in k. For the factor 5, we need at least 5^(1/3) in k.

This means F(x) is strictly increasing on this interval. - Evaluating F(x) at x = 0, we get F(0) = e^{0} - 0 - 1 = 0. Since F(x) is strictly increasing, for all x > 0, F(x) > F(0) = 0. Therefore, we have e^{x} - x - 1 > 0, which simplifies to e^{x} > x + 1. - This implies x > ln(x + 1) for all x > 0.

The equation of the line passing through ( A(t, 0) ) and the point ( (x_0, x_0^3 - x_0) ) is: [ y - (x_0^3 - x_0) = k(x - x_0) ] Substituting the value of ( k ), we get: [ y - (x_0^3 - x_0) = frac{x_0^3 - x_0}{x_0 - t}(x - x_0) ] 4.

Thus, the center of circle C is at point C(0, frac{a}{2}), with radius | frac{a}{2} |. The general equation of line l is 4x + 3y -8 = 0. Since the chord length cut by line l from circle C is sqrt{3} times the radius of circle C, the distance from center C to line l should be half of the radius of circle C. The distance from centre C to line l is given by frac{|3 cdot frac{a}{2} - 8|}{sqrt{4^2+3^2}} = frac{| frac{3a}{2} - 8|}{5}, which should equal to half the radius, frac{a}{4}. Solving the equation frac{| frac{3a}{2} - 8|}{5} = frac{a}{4}, we get a = 32 or a = frac{32}{11}.

If the selling price is reduced by 1 yuan per kilogram, the daily sales volume will increase by 80 kilograms. If the supermarket wants to make a daily profit of 3600 yuan from sales and also provide customers with more benefits, what should be the selling price of grapes per kilogram?","output":"To solve this problem, let's follow the steps closely aligned with the given solution: 1. **Define Variables:** Let the selling price of grapes per kilogram be x yuan. This means the profit per kilogram would be the selling price minus the cost price, which is (x - 16) yuan. 2. **Establish Relationship Between Selling Price and Sales Volume:** According to the given information, when the selling price is reduced by 1 yuan, the sales volume increases by 80 kilograms. When the selling price is 26 yuan, 320 kilograms are sold. Therefore, if the selling price is x yuan, the sales volume can be expressed as 320 + 80(26 - x). Simplifying this gives us the sales volume as a function of x: 320 + 80 times 26 - 80x = 2400 - 80x kilograms. 3. **Set Up the Equation for Desired Profit:** The supermarket wants to make a daily profit of 3600 yuan. The profit from selling grapes can be calculated by multiplying the profit per kilogram by the daily sales volume. Therefore, we have the equation: (x - 16)(2400 - 80x) = 3600. 4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:** Expanding and simplifying the equation gives us: begin{align*} (x - 16)(2400 - 80x) &= 3600 2400x - 80x^2 - 38400 + 1280x &= 3600 -80x^2 + 3680x - 38400 - 3600 &= 0 -80x^2 + 3680x - 42000 &= 0 x^2 - 46x + 525 &= 0 end{align*} 5. **Find the Roots of the Quadratic Equation:** Solving the quadratic equation x^2 - 46x + 525 = 0, we find the roots to be x_1 = 21 and x_2 = 25. 6. **Choose the Selling Price to Provide More Benefits to Customers:** Since we aim to provide customers with more benefits, we choose the lower selling price of 21 yuan per kilogram.

Since the amount of orange juice is equal to the amount of water on the first day, we have W = O. On the second day, twice the amount of water is used, so the amount of water on the second day is 2W. The total volume of orangeade on the first day is O (orange juice) + W (water) = O + O = 2O. The total volume of orangeade on the second day is O (orange juice) + 2W (water) = O + 2O = 3O. Since the revenue from selling the orangeade was the same for both days, we can set up the following equation: Revenue on the first day = Revenue on the second day (Price per glass on the first day) * (Number of glasses on the first day) = (Price per glass on the second day) * (Number of glasses on the second day) We know the price per glass on the first day is 0.82, and the number of glasses on the first day is proportional to the volume of orangeade, which is 2O. Let's denote the price per glass on the second day as \\"P\\". So we have: 0.82 * (2O) = P * (3O) Since the volume of orangeade on the second day is 3O, the number of glasses is also proportional to 3O. Now we can solve for P: 0.82 * 2O = P * 3O To isolate P, we divide both sides by 3O: P = (0.82 * 2O) / 3O The O's cancel out: P = (0.82 * 2) / 3 Now we calculate P: P = 1.64 / 3 P = 0.546666...

Let's break this down step-by-step. **Given:** 1. (AB) is perpendicular to (CD). 2. (angle ACB = angle ADB). **To Prove:** - The plane determined by (AB) and the midpoint of (CD) is perpendicular to (CD). # Proof: 1. **Identify Plane (S):** Since (AB) is perpendicular to (CD), there exists a plane (S) through (CD) that is perpendicular to (AB). Draw this plane (S), which will intersect (AB) perpendicularly (let's denote the intersection point as (T)). 2. **Reflection and Rotation:** Rotate triangle (ABD) about line (AB) until point (D) moves into plane (ABC) at point (D'). 3. **Visualize Geometry:** Since (angle ACB = angle ADB) and given that both angles are equal, when (D) is rotated, the new point (D') is also on the plane (S). In the plane (S), denote the midpoint of (CD) as (F). 4. **Angle Constraints:** By the given conditions, both points (D') and (C) visualize (AB) at the same angle, affirming they are positioned uniformly around (AB). Thus, the triangles (ABD') and (ABC) are reflections of one another about the plane containing (AB) and (F). 5. **Midpoint and Perpendicularity:** Because the rotation retains the angular properties equally, (D) and (D') coincide if and only if the specific (ABF) plane arrangement is maintained. This implies (F), the midpoint, ensures (D) is a location where the rotational postulate holds (around (AB)) while satisfying the initial angle reflections with (C). 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the specific midpoint condition of (CD) ensures that the plane defined by (AB) and midpoint (F) is perpendicular to (CD). This arrangement mirrors (angle ACB = angle ADB) and upholds the given perpendicular conditions in a line (CD-D'). Thus, we've shown that the original claim is valid under this geometric configuration, affirming the positional and relational constraints specified within the problem. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Hence, the given conditions yield the plane defined by (AB) and the midpoint of (CD) that is perpendicular to (CD).}} ]"},{"instruction":"Evaluate the expression frac{(2200 2081)^2 + 100}{196}. textbf{(A)} 72 qquad textbf{(B)} 73 qquad textbf{(C)} 74 qquad textbf{(D)} 75 qquad textbf{(E)} 76","output":"1. **Calculate the difference in the numerator**: [ 2200 - 2081 = 119 ] This is the exact value. 2. **Square the difference and add 100**: [ (2200 - 2081)^2 + 100 = 119^2 + 100 = 14161 + 100 = 14261 ] 3. **Divide by the denominator**: [ frac{14261}{196} ] Recognizing that 196 = 14^2 and simplifying the fraction: [ frac{14261}{196} = frac{14261}{14^2} = left(frac{14261}{14}right)^2 = 1019 ] After performing the division: frac{14261}{196} = 72.76 which rounds to 73. 4. **Conclude with the correct answer**: [ 73 ] The final answer is boxed{textbf{(B)} 73}"},{"instruction":"Julia has two tanks.

This implies that if the points were uniformly colored, there would be about 118 points of each color. 3. **Bounding the Problem**: - The problem implies that there might be some points with fewer than 118 and some with more than 118. - To maximize the number of non-intersecting same-color chords, we consider the worst case where each color has as evenly distributed points as possible. 4. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**: - By the pigeonhole principle, if points of each color are to be evenly distributed, each color will have as close to 118 points as possible. For simplicity, imagine there are exactly 118 points of two colors, this totals (2 times 118 = 236) points colored by two colors. 5. **Analyzing Chords**: - For points distributed such that each color has up to (2k-1) points on the circle, the maximum number of non-intersecting same-color chords is (k-1). - Simplifying this step for (k = 118), we need to show it is feasible with the arrangement. 6. **Inductive Step**: - Base Case: For (k = 2) (up to 3 points): We can form a single non-intersecting chord. - Assume this holds for (k = l). That is, with up to (2l-1) points, you can find (l-1) non-intersecting chords. - For (k = l+1): We need to find (l) non-intersecting chords. consider points of a specific same color as primary endpoints, there are (17 cdot (l + 1)) points, thus at least one color will have fewer points on at least one side. 7. **Applying the Induction Hypothesis**: - Construct non-intersecting same-color chords by considering smallest possible chords first and ensuring subsequent points are distant enough to avoid intersection, leading to exactly (l) chords. 8. **Conclusion**: Combining all these considerations, the counted segments form exactly ((118 - 1)) which totals to 117 non-intersecting same-color chords. Therefore, the maximum number of non-intersecting chords with endpoints of the same color that Kolya can make is [ boxed{117} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the equation arctan frac {x}{2} + arctan(2x) = a; (1) If a= frac {pi}{4}, find the value of arccos frac {x}{2}; (2) If the equation has real solutions, find the range of values for the real number a; (3) If the equation has two distinct solutions alpha, beta in the interval [5, 15], find the maximum value of alpha + beta.","output":"(1) When a= frac {pi}{4}, we have arctan frac {x}{2} + arctan(2-x) = frac {pi}{4}, so frac { frac {x}{2}+(2-x)}{1- frac {x}{2} cdot (2-x)}=1. Solving this equation gives us x=-1 or x=2. Therefore, when x=-1, we have arccos frac {x}{2} = arccos(- frac {1}{2}) = pi - arccos frac {1}{2} = frac {2pi}{3}. When x=2, we have arccos frac {x}{2} = arccos 1 = 0. (2) Since arctan frac {x}{2} + arctan(2-x) = a, we have tan a = frac { frac {x}{2} + (2-x)}{1 - frac {x}{2}(2-x)} = frac {4-x}{x^2 - 2x + 2}. When x=4, tan a = 0. When x neq 4, we have tan a = frac {1}{4-x + frac {10}{4-x} - 6}. Since 4-x + frac {10}{4-x} geq 2 sqrt {10} or 4-x + frac {10}{4-x} leq -2 sqrt {10}, it follows that 0 < tan a leq frac {1}{2 sqrt {10} - 6} or frac {1}{-2 sqrt {10} - 6} leq tan a < 0. Combining the above, we have frac {1}{-2 sqrt {10} - 6} leq tan a leq frac {1}{2 sqrt {10} - 6}, and thus a in left[arctan frac {1}{-2 sqrt {10} - 6}, arctan frac {1}{2 sqrt {10} - 6}right]. (3) From (2), we know that the function frac {4-x}{x^2 - 2x + 2} = tan a has two solutions, alpha and beta, in the interval [5, 15]. This means that the quadratic equation tan a cdot x^2 + (1-2tan a) cdot x + 2tan a - 4 = 0 has two solutions, alpha and beta, in the interval [5, 15]. The sum of roots is alpha + beta = frac {2tan a-1}{tan a} = 2 - frac {1}{tan a}. For the discriminant Delta = (1-2tan a)^2 - 8tan a(tan a - 2) = -4tan^2 a + 12tan a + 1 > 0, we find that - frac {11}{4} < tan a < frac {13}{2} and tan a neq 0. If tan a > 0, the axis of symmetry frac {2tan a-1}{2tan a} = 1- frac {1}{2tan a} < 2, the equation cannot have two solutions in [5, 15], which contradicts the condition, so we discard this case. If tan a < 0, solving 5 < 1 - frac {1}{2tan a} < 15, we find that - frac {1}{8} < tan a < - frac {1}{28}. Additionally, from the constraints for the equation to have solutions in [5, 15], we determine tan a leq - frac {1}{17}. Combining the above, we have - frac {1}{8} < tan a leq - frac {1}{17}. Therefore, when tan a = - frac {1}{17}, the sum alpha + beta reaches its maximum value, which is boxed{19}."},{"instruction":"Simplify: y = |x 1| + |x 2| + |x + 3|","output":"To solve this, we consider the expression in different intervals of x: 1.

Comparing points in the third quadrant to a point in the first quadrant, the y value of the point in the first quadrant (y_{3}) will be greater than those in the third quadrant (y_{1} and y_{2}) because the function's y values decrease as x moves from negative to positive through zero.

Simplifying, ( 2x equiv -5 equiv 1 mod 3 ) (since -5 mod 3 is 1), ( 2x equiv 1 mod 3 ). Solving this, we find that x equiv 2 mod 3 (since multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 2 mod 3, which is 2, yields 4x equiv 2 mod 3 and x equiv 2 mod 3). 2. **Divisibility by 5**: The units digit must be 0 or 5 for divisibility by 5. However, since it is fixed as 3 by problem construction, we only have to consider divisibility by 3 further and ignore this as we satisfy the problem statement's condition that the unit digit remains 3.

This is a common technique to simplify calculations without loss of generality. Let's denote the area of triangle ADF as m times the area of the square. We assign the lengths AD = r and EC = s. 2. **Using Similarity of Triangles**: Since triangles ADF and FEC are similar (by AA similarity, as they both have a right angle and share angle DFE), we can set up a ratio of their corresponding sides. This gives us frac{s}{1} = frac{1}{r}, based on the parallel lines creating proportional segments. 3. **Calculating the Area of Triangle ADF**: The area of triangle ADF can be expressed as frac{1}{2} times 1 times r = frac{1}{2}r. Given that this area is m times the area of the square (which is 1 times 1 = 1 unit squared), we have frac{1}{2}r = m. 4. **Finding the Area of Triangle FEC**: To find the area of triangle FEC, we use the fact that its area is frac{1}{2} times 1 times s = frac{1}{2}s. Using the similarity ratio, we substitute s with frac{1}{r} (from frac{s}{1} = frac{1}{r}), leading to the area of triangle FEC being frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{r}. 5. **Final Calculation**: Since frac{1}{2}r = m, we can express r as frac{1}{2m}. Substituting this into the expression for the area of triangle FEC, we get frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{frac{1}{2m}} = frac{1}{2} times 2m = frac{1}{4m}.

In this interval, the sign of f'(x) changes from positive to negative as x passes through a, which means that f(x) has a maximum at x=a, satisfying the problem's condition. 2. When a = -1: - For all x, it follows that f'(x) = a(x+1)(x-a) leq 0 because (x+1) could be zero or positive, and (x-a) will always be non-positive as x-a can be zero or negative when a=-1.

Therefore, the total number of strips required to cover the surface is: [ frac{486}{2} = 243 text{ strips} ] 4. **Define a bent strip**: A bent strip is a strip that covers two unit squares that are not on the same face of the cube. In other words, it bends around an edge of the cube. 5. **Analyze the placement of strips**: - Each face of the cube is a (9 times 9) grid, which contains (81) unit squares. - If all strips were placed entirely on the faces without bending, each face would require: [ frac{81}{2} = 40.5 text{ strips} ] Since we cannot have half a strip, this indicates that some strips must bend around the edges. 6. **Count the number of bent strips**: - Since each face requires (40.5) strips, and there are (6) faces, the total number of strips required to cover all faces without bending would be: [ 6 times 40.5 = 243 text{ strips} ] - However, since we cannot have half a strip, this means that some strips must bend around the edges to make up for the half-strip discrepancy on each face. 7. **Parity argument**: - Each face has an odd number of strips (40.5), which means that to cover the entire surface, we need an odd number of bent strips to account for the half-strip on each face. - Since there are (6) faces, and each face contributes a half-strip discrepancy, the total number of bent strips must be odd to make the total number of strips an integer. 8. **Conclusion**: The number of bent strips must be odd to ensure that the total number of strips used is an integer.

Therefore, ( angle F T_1 T_2 = angle F P_3 T_2 ). - Similarly, ( angle F T_1 T_3 = angle F P_2 T_3 ), implying ( angle F T_1 T_2 = angle F T_1 T_3 ), leading to ( angle F P_3 T_2 = angle F P_2 T_3 ). 4. **Collinearity and Concyclic Points**: - The above implies that ( F, P_1, P_2, P_3 ) are concyclic (i.e., they lie on the same circle). 5. **Tangents and Triangle Encirclements**: - Consider four tangents out of the set. Three out of these four will always form a triangle. - Each triangle's circumcircle includes the focus ( F ). Therefore, the different triangles indeed verify the same point ( F ). 6. **Determination of Focus**: - Since the focus ( F ) is common to all possible circumscribing circles for any three-tangent set from the four tangents given, this geometric property uniquely identifies ( F ). 7. **Construct the Tangent at Vertex**: - From the focus ( F ), draw two perpendiculars to any two of the given tangents ( e_1, e_2 ). - The feet of these perpendiculars lie on the tangent at the vertex ( e ). 8. **Find the Fifth Tangent**: - Given the direction of the fifth tangent, draw a line parallel to this direction from the point where the perpendicular to the given direction intersects the tangent at the vertex. - This line is the fifth tangent.

This line has a slope of - dfrac{1}{2} (since it can be rewritten in the slope-intercept form as y = -dfrac{1}{2}x).

This translates to solving the equation: [ 1 + 7n + 11m = 60 ] Simplifying, we get: [ 7n + 11m = 59 ] 3. **Checking for Solutions**: We need to find non-negative integer solutions for (n) and (m) that satisfy the equation (7n + 11m = 59). We can use the method of checking modulo 7 to simplify our search: [ 11m equiv 59 pmod{7} ] Simplifying (59 mod 7): [ 59 equiv 3 pmod{7} ] Thus, we need to solve: [ 4m equiv 3 pmod{7} ] We test values of (m) from 0 to 6 to find a solution: [ begin{align*} 4 cdot 0 &equiv 0 pmod{7} 4 cdot 1 &equiv 4 pmod{7} 4 cdot 2 &equiv 1 pmod{7} 4 cdot 3 &equiv 5 pmod{7} 4 cdot 4 &equiv 2 pmod{7} 4 cdot 5 &equiv 6 pmod{7} 4 cdot 6 &equiv 3 pmod{7} end{align*} ] We find that (m = 6) satisfies the equation. Substituting (m = 6) back into the original equation: [ 7n + 11 cdot 6 = 59 implies 7n + 66 = 59 implies 7n = -7 implies n = -1 ] Since (n) must be a non-negative integer, there are no valid solutions for (n) and (m) that satisfy the equation (7n + 11m = 59). Therefore, it is impossible to get exactly 60 pieces. 4. **Getting Numbers Greater than 60**: We now show that we can get any number of pieces greater than 60.

Can Vasya and Petya's numbers have common divisors greater than 1?","output":"**Step 1:** Let’s consider a number ( n ) that has an equal number of prime and composite divisors. **Step 2:** Denote the prime divisors of ( n ) by ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ). It’s important to mention that if ( n ) has ( k ) prime divisors, it will have exactly ( k ) composite divisors. This is because for each prime divisor ( p ) dividing ( n ), the quotient ( frac{n}{p} ) must also be an integer and thus a divisor of ( n ). **Step 3:** If ( n ) has at least one prime divisor, ( n ) itself must also be composite since it contains more than one prime factor. Therefore, for each prime divisor ( p_i ), ( frac{n}{p_i} ) is also a divisor. We need to investigate under which conditions the number of prime and composite divisors will be equal. **Step 4:** Consider the divisor ( n ) itself. Since ( n ) has to count as a composite divisor (assuming ( n neq p ) where ( p ) is any prime), it follows that for every prime ( p_i ), the quotient ( frac{n}{p_i} ) has to be different to be counted as a unique composite divisor. **Step 5:** Now let’s analyze if ( k geq 2 ). For every prime divisor ( p_i ), the pair ( (frac{n}{p_i}, p_i) ) contributes to a unique count of composite and prime divisors. This means the total number of divisors, taking into account all distinct prime factors ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ), would look like: [ k + (text{number of unique } frac{n}{p_i}text{'s}) ] Given ( n neq p_i ) for all involved prime factors ( p_i ), the composite divisor from the division ( frac{n}{p_i} ) will not repeat for all ( p_i ) and thus all will be unique distinct elements forming composite divisors of ( n ). **Step 6:** Hence, ( n ) must be represented as the product of two distinct primes ( p cdot q ) (not squares as they must retain their integrity for uniqueness). But then, the analysis laid out in simpler states (for reevaluation): if the structure maintains prime multiplied by the prime count (as shown ( sqrt{p} = p, t neq q ) etc.), then it results ( n = p^2, n = q^2 ) directly implying by structure analysis; and uniqueness translates ( p,q neq commonality ). **Step 7:** Ensure considered distinct numbers by fact traversal exam failure: - If ( n = p^2 ), then only unique boundaries sustain non-duplicate results in their contained prime factored beings. - If differing as ( m = q^2, n = p^2 ) no repetitive numerical ( gcd’s ), proving ( forall m,n vdash commonність neq hold ) **Conclusion:** Finally, for any two distinct values ( sqrt{​{text{prime squared alpha actions ensuring}] )), resulting to no commonality limit apart from single-element one implies operational structure for respective composite prime systems.

Then the third equation becomes: [ c(a^2 + b) = b(b + ca) ] [ 0 = b^2 ] This implies (b = 0). Substituting (b = 0) and (c = 0) into the first equation: [ a(0 + 0) = 0(0 + a cdot 0) ] [ 0 = 0 ] This is trivially true for any (a). Therefore, one solution is ((a, b, c) = (a, 0, 0)) for any real number (a). 2. **Case 2: None of the variables are zero** We rewrite the given equations in a more symmetric form: [ a(b^2 + c) = c(c + ab) ] [ b(c^2 + a) = a(a + bc) ] [ c(a^2 + b) = b(b + ca) ] By manipulating these equations, we can derive: [ ab(b - c) = c(c - a) ] [ bc(c - a) = a(a - b) ] [ ca(a - b) = b(b - c) ] Multiplying these three equations together, we get: [ (ab(b - c))(bc(c - a))(ca(a - b)) = (c(c - a))(a(a - b))(b(b - c)) ] [ a^2b^2c^2(b - c)(c - a)(a - b) = abc(a - b)(b - c)(c - a) ] Dividing both sides by (abc(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)) (assuming (a neq b), (b neq c), and (c neq a)), we get: [ abc = 1 ] 3. **Case 3: (abc = 1)** Substituting (abc = 1) into the original equations, we get: [ ab(b - c) = c(c - a) ] [ bc(c - a) = a(a - b) ] [ ca(a - b) = b(b - c) ] Adding these three equations, we get: [ ab(b - c) + bc(c - a) + ca(a - b) = c(c - a) + a(a - b) + b(b - c) ] [ ab(b - c) + bc(c - a) + ca(a - b) = ab(b - c) + bc(c - a) + ca(a - b) ] This is an identity, which means the equations are consistent under the condition (abc = 1). 4. **Conclusion** From the above cases, we conclude that the solutions are: [ (a, b, c) = (x, x, x) text{ for any } x in mathbb{R} ] and [ (a, b, c) = (a, 0, 0) text{ for any } a in mathbb{R} ] The final answer is ( boxed{ (a, b, c) = (x, x, x) text{ for any } x in mathbb{R} } ) and ((a, b, c) = (a, 0, 0) text{ for any } a in mathbb{R})."},{"instruction":"Prove the following inequality for any positive numbers: frac{(ab)^2}{2(a+b)} leq sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}} sqrt{ab} leq frac{(ab)^2}{sqrt{2}(a+b)}","output":"We are given the inequality to prove for any positive numbers (a) and (b): frac{(a - b)^2}{2(a + b)} leq sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}} - sqrt{ab} leq frac{(a - b)^2}{sqrt{2}(a + b)} 1. **Special Case (a = b):** If (a = b), then the inequality reduces to: 0 leq 0 leq 0 which is obviously true.

The sum for these two faces when combined should be 2 times S_{short}. - Long faces should have the same sum, S_{long} each, and total 4 times S_{long}. Balancing these sums: [ 2 times S_{short} + 4 times S_{long} = 3 times 60 = 180. ] Choose S_{short} = 46 and S_{long} = 35 (as it balances and forms integers within the range). Step 2: Test vertex configuration: By placing the highest and lowest values on diagonally opposite vertices and similarly balancing other sums, analyze: - Short face using (4,5,10,11) and (6,7,8,9). - For consistency, ensure that (4,11) and (5,10) are diagonally opposite in one configuration, and similar for (6,9) and (7,8). - Extend this logic to label vertices such that they respect S_{long} = 35 on each long face. Step 3: Count the distinct arrangements: Focus on distinctive transitions between short face and long face configurations. With certain placements: (4,11), (5,10), (6,9), and (7,8) provide a geometrically feasible valid set. Similar opposite pairs on long faces are interchanged.

Also, as a < b, a^2 < b^2. Therefore, combining both inequalities a^3 < a^2 < b^2; this option is correct. For option B: Exponential functions are strictly increasing; 2^x is increasing for increasing x. Given that a < b and both a and b are positive, 2^a < 2^b.

By factoring, we find: [ (x+6)(x-1) = 0 ] which gives the solutions x=-6 and x=1. Hence, A = {-6,1}. - For B with m=0, the equation becomes x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0. By factoring, we find: [ (x+3)(x-1) = 0 ] which gives the solutions x=-3 and x=1. Hence, B = {-3,1}. Therefore, Acup B = {-6, 1, -3}. The subsets of Acup B are thus: [ varnothing, {-6}, {1}, {-3}, {-6,1}, {-6,-3}, {1,-3}, {-6,1,-3} ] boxed{varnothing, {-6}, {1}, {-3}, {-6,1}, {-6,-3}, {1,-3}, {-6,1,-3}} # Part (2): Finding the range of real numbers for m Given that \\"xin A\\" is a necessary condition for \\"xin B\\", we infer Bsubseteq A. We examine cases based on the discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation for B: - **Case 1**: B has no elements (B=varnothing).

This occurs if Delta = 0: [ Delta = 0 implies m = -2 ] Substituting m = -2 into B's equation, we find B = {1}, which is a subset of A. - **Case 3**: B has two elements (Delta > 0). In this scenario, m > -2. However, since Bsubseteq A and both sets must have the same elements for B to be a subset of A, we need to check if the solutions match. By Vieta's formulas: [ m^2 - 3 = -6 times 1 ] This leads to a contradiction since m^2 cannot equal -3. In conclusion, the viable range for m ensuring Bsubseteq A is m leq -2.

This means that, for each (1 leq i leq n), there exists subsets (A_i) and (B_i) where (i notin A_i) and (B_i = A_i cup {i}). Consider representing the given subsets as vertices of a graph. Connect (A_i) and (B_i) with an edge (e_i) for every (i). Given there are (n) subsets and (n) edges, the graph is simple and has (n) vertices and (n) edges. 2. **Graph Analysis:** Since the graph is simple and has (n) vertices with (n) edges, it must contain at least one cycle. Let’s consider the cycle (H_1, H_2, ldots, H_k) of the subsets where (k geq 3). Each (H_i) is connected to (H_{i+1}) by an edge, with indices considered modulo (k). 3. **Cycle Property and Contradiction:** Without loss of generality, assume the indexing such that (H_1 = A_j) and (H_2 = B_j) for some (1 leq j leq n). By construction, (j notin H_1) and (j in H_2). Moving around the cycle, since (H_2 = B_j) and the edges beyond this point do not involve (e_j), we observe: [ j in H_3, j in H_4, ldots, j in H_k. ] But because the cycle closes back to (H_1), for (k geq 3), it implies (j in H_1), contradicting our initial assumption that (j notin H_1). This contradiction proves that our assumption was false, and hence, there must exist a number that can be removed from every subset while retaining their uniqueness. 4. **Inductive Proof:** Now, let us prove the general case using induction on the number of subsets: **Base Case:** - If there is only one subset, it trivially remains unique even if any number is removed. - If there are two subsets and they differ by at least one number, one such distinguishing number can be removed. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for all collections of subsets with fewer than (m) elements. Now consider (m geq 3) subsets. Select a number (k) that appears in exactly (b) subsets ((0 < b < m)). By the inductive hypothesis, within these (b) subsets, the remaining (b-1) numbers are sufficient to distinguish between them. Similarly, the remaining (m-b) subsets (lacking (k)) are distinguishable by (m-b-1) numbers. Thus, all (m) subsets are distinguishable by at most: [ 1 + (b-1) + (m-b-1) = m-1 ] numbers. Therefore, at least one number can be removed from all subsets while keeping them distinct. **Conclusion:** The reasoning holds for any (n) subsets, as proved.

Next, examine the sequence: [ T_n = alpha^n + beta^n ] We get: [ T_{n+1} = T_n - T_{n-1} ] Continuing, we find: [ T_{n+2} = T_{n+1} - T_n = (T_n - T_{n-1}) - T_n = -T_{n-1} ] Therefore: [ T_{n+3} = -T_{n-2} ] 5. By induction or continued calculation, the sequence exhibits periodicity of 6: [ T_{n+6} = T_n ] 6. Hence, ( T_{2005} = T_{2005 mod 6} = T_5 ). 7. Now determine ( T_5 ): [ T_0 = 2, quad T_1 = 1, quad T_2 = 0, quad T_3 = -1, quad T_4 = -1, quad T_5 = 1 ] The periodic sequence is: ( 2, 1, 0, -1, -1, 1 ) 8. Therefore, the value of ( alpha^{2005} + beta^{2005} ) is: [ T_{2005} = T_5 = 1 ] 9. Since the problem requires the sum of coefficients of the polynomial in terms of ( alpha + beta ) and ( alpha beta ), this sum is obtained by substituting ( alpha + beta = 1 ) and ( alpha beta = 1 ). 10. Consequently, the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial is: [ boxed{1} ] \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"A circle is inscribed in a regular hexagon, then a regular hexagon is inscribed in this circle, and finally, a circle is inscribed in this hexagon.

Consider the circle defined by the equation: [ x^2 + y^2 = sqrt{2} ] 2. Suppose there exists a rational point ((x, y)) on this circle. Then (x) and (y) are rational numbers. 3. Substituting ((x, y)) into the circle equation, we get: [ x^2 + y^2 = sqrt{2} ] 4. Since (x^2 + y^2) equals (sqrt{2}) and (sqrt{2}) is irrational, (x^2 + y^2) can never be rational.

Suppose a rational point (left( frac{p}{q}, frac{s}{q} right)) lies on this circle, where (p, q, s) are integers and (q neq 0). 3. Substituting this point into the circle's equation, we get: [ left( frac{p}{q} - sqrt{2} right)^2 + left( frac{s}{q} right)^2 = 2 ] 4. Simplifying and expanding the left-hand side, we get: [ frac{p^2 - 2psqrt{2}q + 2q^2 + s^2}{q^2} = 2 ] 5. By rearranging terms and clearing the denominator, we obtain: [ p^2 + s^2 = 2(1 + sqrt{2})pq ] 6.

The perpendicular bisectors of the chords formed by any two pairs of these points will intersect at the center of the circle. 3. These bisectors are defined by linear equations with rational coefficients as they pass through rational points. 4. The resulting system of linear equations must have a unique rational solution for the center since the points are not collinear and provide distinct equations. 5.

Similarly, y=frac{x-2}{x+1} is increasing on the interval (-1, +infty). Therefore, f(x), being the sum of two increasing functions on this interval, is also increasing. This implies that f(x_0) < f(0) = -1, which contradicts our previous statement that f(x_0) > f(0). 2. If x_0 < -1, then a^{x_0} > 0 because a>1, and x_0 being negative does not affect the positivity of a^x. Additionally, since x_0 < -1, both x_0-2<0 and x_0+1<0, which makes frac{x_0-2}{x_0+1} a positive fraction. Thus, f(x_0) is the sum of two positive numbers and therefore f(x_0) > 0, which again contradicts the assumption that f(x_0)=0.

If in the cross of an unmarked cell ( A ) there are at least ( k ) other marked cells, then cell ( A ) can also be marked. It turned out that by repeating such actions, any cell on the grid can be marked. What is the smallest ( N ) for which this could happen? (G. Chelnokov)","output":"1. Consider the natural number k and denote N(k) to be the minimum number of initial marked cells required to ensure that any cell in the plane can eventually be marked through a chain of operations. 2. Define the function: [ f(k) = leftlfloor frac{k+1}{2} rightrfloor cdot leftlfloor frac{k+2}{2} rightrfloor ] 3. Our goal is to show that N(k) = f(k). 4. First, we establish a lower bound for N(k) using an inequality. We claim: [ N(k) geq N(k-1) + leftlfloor frac{k+1}{2} rightrfloor quad text{for } k geq 2 ] 5. Assume we have N(k-1) cells initially marked. We need to show at least leftlfloor frac{k+1}{2} rightrfloor additional cells to ensure property differences for moving from k-1 to k. 6. Assume without loss of generality that we need leftlfloor frac{k+1}{2} rightrfloor cells in some \`k-row' to be marked in addition to the N(k-1) cells. This new row gives an additional leftlfloor frac{k+1}{2} rightrfloor marked cells. 7. Thus, for ensuring that any cell in the cross (k-cross) becomes marked, it is necessary to have at least N(k-1) + leftlfloor frac{k+1}{2} rightrfloor initially marked cells. 8. Since N(1) = 1, we can express N(k): [ N(k) geq 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + cdots + leftlfloor frac{k+1}{2} rightlfloor ] This summation equals f(k). Hence: [ N(k) geq f(k) ] 9. Next, we need to demonstrate that this bound is achievable, i.e., N(k) = f(k). 10. Consider the grid designed in the form of two \`ladders' of heights p = leftlfloor frac{k}{2} rightrfloor and q = leftlfloor frac{k+1}{2} rightrfloor shown in a diagram similar to Figure 11. This forms a specific structural marking. 11. Using induction, we show that this structure achieves the bound: - Base Case: When k=1, it is trivially true with 1 initial marked cell. - Inductive Step: Given a induction hypothesis for k, we mark \`cell a_1, a_2, ldots, a_p' in sequence ensuring a new row with p+q=k cells guaranteed to ensure any cell in that row can be marked eventually. 12. After placing these marked cells, reduce k by one and apply the induction step in the remaining plane minus one row, hence continuing the marking process. 13. Therefore, the minimum number of initially marked cells that can ensure any cell can eventually be marked by this process is: [ N = leftlfloor frac{k+1}{2} rightlfloor cdot leftlfloor frac{k+2}{2} rightrfloor = left{ begin{array}{ll} m(m+1), & text{if } k=2m m^2, & text{if } k=2m-1 end{array} right. ] Conclusion: [ boxed{leftlfloor frac{k+1}{2} rightlfloor cdot leftlfloor frac{k+2}{2} rightrfloor} ]"},{"instruction":"For the multiplication operation of square roots, generally, sqrt{a}cdot sqrt{b}=sqrt{ab}.

The convex polygon A_{1} ldots A_{n} lies within S_{1} and outside S_{2}, and the convex polygon B_{1} ldots B_{m} lies within S_{2} and outside S_{1}. 5. **Analyze Intersection Line**: - If the circles intersect, they do so at two points.

Therefore, 49 moves are insufficient, and 50 moves are necessary. 2. **Strategy with 50 Moves:** - Color the board in a checkerboard pattern with black and white squares. - First, John checks the 32 white squares on the interior of the board. - If any of these squares have treasure, he checks the 4 surrounding squares to identify the exact location of the treasure. - This step ensures that if the treasure is found in the interior, John can identify it within 50 moves. 3. **Checking the Edge Squares:** - If no treasure is found in the 32 interior white squares, John next checks the 16 white squares on the edge but not in a corner. - If any of these edge squares have treasure, he checks 2 of the 3 surrounding squares to identify the exact location of the treasure. - This step ensures that if the treasure is found on the edge, John can identify it within 50 moves. 4. **Final Check for Corner Squares:** - If John has not found any treasure in the 48 moves so far, the only remaining white squares that can have treasure are the two white corners, which we will call ( S ) and ( T ). - John checks ( S ) first. - If ( S ) has treasure, his final move is to check a square adjacent to ( S ), and the result of that check will be enough to identify the exact location of the treasure. - If ( S ) does not have treasure, his final move is to check a square adjacent to ( T ), and since he can be certain ( T ) has treasure, this will be enough to identify the exact location of the treasure. By following this strategy, John can always find the cells with the hidden treasure within 50 moves. The final answer is ( boxed{50} )"},{"instruction":"There are k points on a straight line.

For any two points A and B, we draw a circle with AB as the diameter. Each circle is colored in one of n colors, and no two intersecting circles are the same color. Prove that k leq 2^n. Proof 1: 1. **Define Set S_A**: - For each point A, define the set ( S_A ) as: S_A = {text{colors of the circles passing through } A text{ and on the left side of } A}. 2. **Count Maximum Sets**: - Since there are n colors in total, the number of distinct sets S_A can be at most 2^n. 3. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle**: - If k > 2^n, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two points A and B such that: S_A = S_B. 4. **Contradiction with Intersecting Circles**: - Suppose B is on the left side of A. Consider the circle C with AB as its diameter. - From the definition of S_A and S_B, the color of circle C must be in both S_A and S_B. - However, this implies there's a circle passing through B and on the left side of B with the same color as circle C, leading to a contradiction because no two intersecting circles should have the same color. 5. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the assumption that k > 2^n is incorrect, hence: k leq 2^n.

This forms a complete directed graph. - Each directed edge corresponds to a circle with A_i A_j as its diameter and is colored with one of the n colors. 3. **Using Mathematical Induction**: - Base Case ( n = 1 ): Easily verified. - Assume the statement holds for ( n-1 ). 4. **Divide into Subsets**: - For ( n ), divide the 2^n + 1 points into two subsets ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ). 5. **Count Red Edges**: 1. **If ( |M_2| geq 2^{n-1} + 1 )**: - Within ( M_2 ), there is either at least one red edge ( overrightarrow{A_j A_i} ) or not. - If there is, find a point A_k such that ( overrightarrow{A_k A_j} ) is also red. - Use the inductive hypothesis within ( M_2 ) if it contains no red edges. 2. **If ( |M_1| geq 2^{n-1} + 1 )**: - Any two points A_i and A_j in ( M_1 ) (with ( i < j )) have directed edge ( overrightarrow{A_j A_i} ) not red. - Thus, the arguments follow similarly due to symmetry. 6. **Conclusion**: - By induction, the statement holds proving ( k leq 2^n ). # Final Conclusion: boxed{k leq 2^{n}} \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"Last winter, 40% of the birds observed at Crystal Lake were geese, 20% were swans, 15% were herons, 15% were ducks, and 10% were pelicans.

Let's denote the number of boxes as ( n ) and the total number of balls as ( k ). Each box can contain anywhere from 0 to ( k ) balls, giving us ((k+1)^n ) possible distributions of balls. - Additionally, the box from which the balls will be taken next is specified, resulting in ( n times (k+1)^n ) different states. 3. **Transition Between States:** - From any given state, the system transitions to another state through the operation of distributing the balls from the chosen box. Each move is deterministic given the state, meaning the next state is uniquely determined by the current state. 4. **Cycle Detection:** - According to the pigeonhole principle, because the number of states is finite, and we are always transitioning from one state to another deterministically, the system must eventually revisit a state it has been in before. - Once a state is revisited, the sequence of states will repeat, hence the initial arrangement of balls must eventually reappear. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{The initial distribution of balls will eventually repeat.}} ] Part (b) 1. **System State Consideration:** - In this part, the state of the system is simpler and only defined by the distribution of balls in the boxes. We no longer need to track which box is the designated starting point for the next move. 2. **Reversible Moves:** - By the result from part (a), if a state ( A ) can transition to a state ( B ), we can return from ( B ) to ( A ) by following the reverse sequence of moves. This property holds due to the deterministic nature of the state transitions. 3. **Reaching Any Given State:** - If we can reach a state ( C ) from an initial state ( A ) in ( t ) moves, we can construct a path back to ( A ) by reversing these moves. - Hence, if we can reach some fixed state ( M ) from ( A ), then we can also reach ( A ) from ( M ). This implies that ( M ) serves as an intermediary via which transitions between arbitrary states are feasible. 4. **Special State ( M ):** - Let ( M ) be the state where all the balls are concentrated in a single box (say box ( m )). - Through a sequence of operations, any state can be converted into this special state ( M ) by repeatedly moving balls towards box ( m ). - If a box adjacent to ( m ) contains balls, transfer these until the box adjacent to ( m ) is empty, then move to the next adjacent box, and proceed similarly. - This strategy guarantees that eventually all balls will collect in box ( m ). 5. **Any Given State From ( M ):** - Once all balls are in box ( m ), distribute them to achieve any desired configuration. For example, if we want ( x_1 ) balls in box 1, ( x_2 ) in box 2, and so on: - Perform a single distribution operation where balls are taken from box ( m ) and placed into other boxes accordingly. - Adjust the specific distribution to achieve the goal state through a series of similar operations as needed. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{Any given initial state can be transformed into any other desired state.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Beth has 4 packs of crayons.

We aim to find the smallest ( n ) such that the probability of having at least 5 working lightbulbs is at least 0.99. **Step-by-Step Solution:** 1. **Calculate for 6 lightbulbs (( n = 6 )):** [ P(text{at least 5 out of 6 work}) = P(X=5) + P(X=6) ] [ P(X=5) = binom{6}{5} (0.95)^5 (0.05)^1 = 6 times (0.95)^5 times 0.05 ] [ P(X=6) = binom{6}{6} (0.95)^6 (0.05)^0 = (0.95)^6 ] Combining these probabilities: [ P(text{at least 5 out of 6 work}) = 6 times (0.95)^5 times 0.05 + (0.95)^6 ] Calculating each term: [ 6 times (0.95)^5 times 0.05 approx 6 times 0.7737809375 times 0.05 approx 0.23213428125 ] [ (0.95)^6 approx 0.735091890625 ] Thus, [ P(text{at least 5 out of 6 work}) approx 0.23213428125 + 0.735091890625 = 0.967226171875 approx 0.9672 ] This probability (0.9672) is less than 0.99, so 6 lightbulbs are not sufficient. 2. **Calculate for 7 lightbulbs (( n = 7 )):** [ P(text{at least 5 out of 7 work}) = P(X=5) + P(X=6) + P(X=7) ] [ P(X=5) = binom{7}{5} (0.95)^5 (0.05)^2 = 21 times (0.95)^5 times (0.05)^2 ] [ P(X=6) = binom{7}{6} (0.95)^6 (0.05)^1 = 7 times (0.95)^6 times 0.05 ] [ P(X=7) = binom{7}{7} (0.95)^7 (0.05)^0 = (0.95)^7 ] Combining these probabilities: [ P(text{at least 5 out of 7 work}) = 21 times (0.95)^5 times (0.05)^2 + 7 times (0.95)^6 times 0.05 + (0.95)^7 ] Calculating each term: [ 21 times (0.95)^5 times (0.05)^2 approx 21 times 0.7737809375 times 0.0025 approx 0.040891778125 ] [ 7 times (0.95)^6 times 0.05 approx 7 times 0.735091890625 times 0.05 approx 0.25728216109375 ] [ (0.95)^7 approx 0.698337296875 ] Thus, [ P(text{at least 5 out of 7 work}) approx 0.040891778125 + 0.25728216109375 + 0.698337296875 = 0.99651123609375 approx 0.9962 ] This probability (0.9962) exceeds 0.99, confirming that having 7 lightbulbs ensures that, with a probability of 0.99, at least 5 will be working. **Conclusion:** The minimal number of lightbulbs needed is: [ boxed{7} ]"},{"instruction":"Petya cut a rectangular sheet of paper along a straight line.

By Vieta's formulas, we have: x_1 + x_2 = frac{4(k + 1)}{k^2 + 1}, quad x_1x_2 = frac{7}{k^2 + 1}. It follows that: y_1y_2 = (kx_1 + 1)(kx_2 + 1) = frac{12k^2 + 4k + 1}{k^2 + 1}. Now, calculate the dot product overrightarrow{AM} cdot overrightarrow{AN}: overrightarrow{AM} cdot overrightarrow{AN} = (x_1, y_1-1) cdot (x_2, y_2 - 1) = x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 - (y_1 + y_2) + 1 = frac{7}{k^2 + 1} + frac{12k^2 + 4k + 1}{k^2 + 1} - kfrac{4(k + 1)}{k^2 + 1} - 2 + 1 = 7, which is a constant value. (3) Since overrightarrow{OM} cdot overrightarrow{ON} = 12, we have: x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = frac{12k^2 + 4k + 8}{k^2 + 1} = 12. Solving for k, we get k = 1.

We know that the combined balance of Gina's accounts is 1,728, which is half of Betty's account balance of 3,456. Since the combined balance of Gina's accounts is half of Betty's, we can say that: [ f_1 + f_2 = frac{1}{2} ] Now, we need to find the individual fractions ( f_1 ) and ( f_2 ). However, with the information given, we cannot determine the exact fractions for each of Gina's accounts because there are infinite combinations of ( f_1 ) and ( f_2 ) that can add up to ( frac{1}{2} ). For example, if ( f_1 = frac{1}{4} ) (which is 864, a quarter of Betty's balance), then ( f_2 ) would be ( frac{1}{4} ) as well, because ( frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{2} ).

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. The train's speed is given in kilometers per hour (kmph), so we need to convert it to meters per second (m/s) to match the time unit (seconds) given. We can do this by using the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s. Speed in m/s = 60 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 16.6666667 m/s Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 16.6666667 m/s * 14.998800095992321 s Distance ≈ 250 m (rounded to the nearest meter) Since the total distance covered is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge, we can find the length of the bridge by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance: Length of the bridge = Total distance - Length of the train Length of the bridge = 250 m - 110 m Length of the bridge = 140 m Therefore, the length of the bridge is approximately boxed{140} meters."},{"instruction":"Let ( A B C D E F ) be a regular hexagon, and let ( P ) be a point inside quadrilateral ( A B C D ).

Each ( A_i ) contains exactly ( 2n ) elements. 2. ( A_i cap A_j ) (for ( 1 leq i < j leq 2n+1 )) contains exactly one element. 3. Every element of ( B ) belongs to at least two different subsets ( A_{i_1} ) and ( A_{i_2} ), where ( 1 leq i_1 < i_2 leq 2n+1 ). Determine for which ( n in mathbb{N} ), it is possible to assign to each element of ( B ) a label of 0 or 1 such that each ( A_i ) contains exactly ( n ) elements labeled 0. Provide an explanation for your answer. 1. **Reformulating Condition (3)**: Given conditions (1)-(3), we derive a stronger condition: - (3') Every element in ( B ) belongs to exactly two of the subsets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2n+1} ). If this were not the case, suppose there exists an element ( b in B ) such that ( b in A_1 cap A_2 cap A_3 ). Since ( A_i cap A_j ) contains exactly one element for any ( i neq j ), it follows that: [ A_1 cap left( bigcup_{j=2}^{2n+1} A_j right) = [A_1 cap (A_2 cup A_3)] cup left[ A_1 cap left( bigcup_{j=4}^{2n+1} A_j right) right] ] which includes at most ( 2n-1 ) elements. On the other hand, by condition (3), each element of ( A_1 ) must belong to some other ( A_i ) (with ( i neq 1 )), so ( A_1 cap left( bigcup_{i=2}^{2n+1} A_j right) ) actually should contain ( 2n ) elements, leading to a contradiction. 2. **Conclusion from (3')**: From condition (3'), for each ( a in B ), ( a ) corresponds to exactly one pair ( { i, j } ). Hence, each element ( a ) is uniquely associated with an integer pair ( { i, j }, 1 leq i < j leq 2n+1 ). Clearly, this forms a bijective relationship. 3. **Labeling Elements**: If it is possible to label elements of ( B ) with 0 and 1 as described: - Half of these pairs ( {i, j} ) should correspond to label 0. The number of such pairs is given by: [ frac{1}{2} binom{2n+1}{2} = frac{1}{4} (2n+1) 2n = frac{1}{2} n(2n+1) ] This number of pairs must be possible to split into equal parts. 4. **Condition for ( n )**: For ( frac{1}{2} n (2n+1) ) to be an integer, ( n ) must be an even number. Observing that ( 2n+1 ) is always odd, ensuring half-integers split equally, we conclude ( n ) must be even. 5. **Construction for ( n ) even**: To demonstrate the validity: Consider a circle divided into ( 2n+1 ) equal parts (points). Label these points in cyclic order as ( 1, 2, ldots, 2n+1 ). For any ( 1 leq i < j leq 2n+1 ), consider the arc between ( i ) and ( j ): - If there are odd segments in the arc, label the pair ( {i, j} ) as 1. - If there are even segments, label the pair as 0. Given ( n ) is even, each ( A_i ) will have exactly half of the elements labeled 0 and the other half labeled 1. # Conclusion For ( n in mathbb{N} ), it is possible to assign labels such that each ( A_i ) contains exactly ( n ) elements labeled 0 if and only if ( n ) is an even number.

This affects the x,y coordinates significantly and allows the kangaroo to access new areas in the coordinate plane. - After making a big jump, the kangaroo can make several small jumps: (x-5+5, y+7-5) = (x, y+2). This means that for as long as x > 5, the kangaroo can alternate between big jumps and small jumps to travel with big vertical progress and minimal horizontal regression. 3. **Analyze Accessible Regions**: - **Region I**: Defined by x+y > 6. - If x > 5, the kangaroo can make a big jump and then series of five small jumps thereby effectively moving upwards by 2 units (x, y+2). This sequence can be repeated indefinitely for large movements. - If x leq 5: Then some small steps can transform (x, y) to (x, y+1). This can keep x within the range (0, 5] while effectively moving y higher without leaving the region where future big jumps are possible. - **Region II**: Defined by x+y < 5. - In this region, only the small jumps are possible. A small jump preserves the sum x+y, meaning the kangaroo cannot increase y as needed to sustain any long journey. Therefore, the kangaroo cannot escape this zone to attain distances greater than 1000 units from the origin. 4. **Combine and Summarize Results**: - The kangaroo can achieve large distances given it starts in Region I, where x+y > 6, or within triangular regions marked with horizontal chipping(x>5 and sufficiently positive y>0). - In **horizontally striped triangles** (entire innards and inside points of diagonals), and the lower bounded by horizontal bands. - **Vertically striped triangles** can only decrease in y-coordinate without sufficient capacity for upward jumps (no escape zone). 5. **Boundary Considerations**: - If considering the positive quadrant's exercise with boundary shut points included (x geq 0, y=0 or x=0, y geq 0), points on these lines in these respective triangles can also allow kangaroo mobility. # Conclusion: - The kangaroo can jump to at least 1000 units away from the origin if it starts from: boxed{text{Region I and interiors of horizontally striped triangles including their outlines if applicable on boundaries}}"},{"instruction":"Square each integer n in the range 1 leq n leq 6 and find the remainders when the squares are divided by 13.

In terms of our function and for equal weights ( w_i = frac{1}{n} ): [ fleft(frac{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i}{n}right) leq frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} f(a_i). ] 3. **Simplifying the Left Side:** Given ( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = a ): [ frac{a}{n} = frac{sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i}{n}. ] Thus, [ fleft(frac{a}{n}right) leq frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} f(a_i) ] or equivalently, [ frac{frac{a}{n}}{ka - frac{a}{n}} leq frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{a_i}{ka - a_i}. ] 4. **Simplifying Further:** [ fleft(frac{a}{n}right) = frac{frac{a}{n}}{ka - frac{a}{n}} = frac{frac{a}{n}}{ka - frac{a}{n}} = frac{a}{n (ka - frac{a}{n})} = frac{a}{nka - a}. ] Replacing ( frac{a}{nka - a} ) back into the inequality: [ frac{frac{a}{n}}{ka - frac{a}{n}} = frac{a}{n (ka - frac{a}{n})} = frac{a}{nka - a} leq frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{a_i}{ka - a_i}. ] 5. **Combining the Terms:** It can be seen that: [ frac{n}{n(ka - frac{a}{n})} = frac{n}{nk-k} = frac{n}{kn-1} ] Thus, we have: [ frac{a}{nka - a} leq frac{n}{n(ka - a_n)} implies frac{a}{nka - a} leq frac{n}{kn - 1}. ] Hence, we conclude: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{a_i}{ka - a_i} geq frac{n}{kn - 1}. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{a_1}{ka - a_1} + frac{a_2}{ka - a_2} + cdots + frac{a_n}{ka - a_n} geq frac{n}{kn - 1}}. ]"},{"instruction":"The coordinates of the intersection points of the parabola y=x^{2}4 and the yaxis are: A: (0,4) B: (4,0) C: (2,0) D: (0,2)","output":"To find the intersection points of the parabola y = x^2 - 4 with the y-axis, we substitute x = 0 into the equation of the parabola, since any point on the y-axis has an x-coordinate of 0.

There is no scenario in this problem where the base angles would be calculated as 50^{circ} based on the given information.

The game proceeds by players taking turns to break the chocolate along either a row or column, thus dividing the chocolate into two smaller rectangular pieces. 3.

This move ensures that after each round, both halves will be symmetrical, and thus the second player will be forced to break a (1 times 1) piece first. Therefore, in variant (a) the strategy is effective for the initial mover to ensure that the opponent is the one to break the first (1 times 1) piece. Hence, the first player wins. **Variant (b): The one who breaks the first square piece wins.** 1. Again, starting with dimensions (5 times 10), where (mn = 50) (even). 2.

Conclusion: In summary, the analysis of new distance and its constraints condition the geometric shapes that result: - **New Ellipses** arise from the sum condition ( c + d leq a ). - **New Hyperbolas** arise from the difference condition ( c + d geq a ).

We assume that a median ( BM_2 ) is drawn from vertex ( B ) to the midpoint ( M_2 ) of the side ( AC ). Given that the median passes through the circumcenter ( O ) of triangle ( ABC ), we need to prove that the triangle ( ABC ) is right-angled if the triangle is scalene (i.e., all sides have different lengths). 1. **Assume the Contrary:** Assume that triangle ( ABC ) is not right-angled. This leads us to several geometric properties and relationships. 2. **Median Properties:** The median ( BM_2 ) from ( B ) to ( M_2 ) bisects the side ( AC ). Therefore, ( M_2 ) is the midpoint of ( AC ). [ M_2 = left( frac{A + C}{2} right). ] 3. **Relationship between Median and Perpendicular Bisector:** For a median in a non-right-angled triangle: - The median ( BM_2 ) must also act as a perpendicular bisector of the side ( AC ) when it passes through the circumcenter ( O ). Let ( O ) be the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ), which implies ( O ) is equidistant from ( A, B, ) and ( C ). Therefore, [ OA = OB = OC = R, ] where ( R ) is the circumradius. 4. **Contradiction using Perpendicularity:** By definition, the circumcenter ( O ) is located at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle. Since ( BM_2 ) is assumed to pass through ( O ) and is the perpendicular bisector of ( AC ), it implies: - The perpendicular bisector of ( AC ) (a line that is both the median and perpendicular) must align with the median ( BM_2 ). The perpendicular bisector property leads to: [ text{angle bisectors and perpendicular bisectors being congruent results in a right angle at the midpoint.} ] Hence, ( angle C = 90^circ ), meaning ( ABC ) must indeed be a right-angled triangle for this specific setup. This is a contradiction to our earlier assumption. 5. **Conclusion from Contradiction:** Since our assumption that the triangle ( ABC ) is not right-angled leads to a contradiction, we conclude that the triangle ( ABC ) must be right-angled if it is scalene and if a median (drawn from a vertex and passing through the middle of the opposite side) passes through the circumcenter.

Consider a grid of size (10 times 10) with some cells connected by walls such that one can travel through all the cells without passing through these walls. The grid is also surrounded by walls on its boundary. Suppose a robot starts in an arbitrary cell, and can understand commands to move left (L), right (P), up (V), and down (N). If it encounters a wall, it stays in its current cell. 2. We'll begin by enumerating all possible starting states, defined by the robot’s initial position and the layout of the labyrinth. Since the robot can start in any cell and the labyrinth is fixed, the total number of possible starting states is finite. Let's denote these states as (S_1, S_2, ldots, S_N). 3. Let's create a program (Pi_1) that will allow the robot to traverse the labyrinth starting from the initial state (S_1). This initial program (Pi_1) should cover the entire labyrinth efficiently from the beginning state (S_1). 4. After determining (Pi_1), we will analyze the movements commanded by (Pi_1) assuming the robot starts from state (S_2).

Use the double angle formula for cosine and sine: cos 2alpha = cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha and sin 2alpha = 2sin alpha cos alpha. 2. Recall that tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha}, so sin alpha = tan alpha cos alpha. Substitute tan alpha = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} into this equation to get sin alpha = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cos alpha. 3. Now, substitute these values into the expressions for cos 2alpha and sin 2alpha:    - cos 2alpha = cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha = cos^2 alpha - frac{1}{2}cos^2 alpha = frac{1}{2}cos^2 alpha.    - sin 2alpha = 2sin alpha cos alpha = 2 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cos^2 alpha = sqrt{2} cos^2 alpha. 4.

The distance from ( O ) to ( B ) can be calculated using Pythagoras' theorem within the great circle formed by the intersection of the plane with the sphere:     [     B K = sqrt{1 - left(frac{1}{3}right)^2} R = frac{sqrt{8} R}{3}     ] Thus, the side length is:     [     A B = A K sqrt{3} = sqrt{frac{8}{3}} R     ]  Step 2: Confirmation that the Pyramid is a Tetrahedron 3. We check the length of the other sides. Given:     [     A T = sqrt{left(frac{4 R}{3}right)^2 + left(frac{sqrt{8} R}{3}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{16 R^2}{9} + frac{8 R^2}{9}} = sqrt{frac{24 R^2}{9}} = sqrt{frac{8 R^2}{3}}     ]     Hence, we see:     [     A B = A T = sqrt{frac{8}{3}} R     ] All the edges of the pyramid are equal, indicating that the pyramid is a regular tetrahedron.  Step 3: Slice through Median of Base We consider a slicing plane through the median ( TG ) of the base triangle: - This plane intersects one of the tetrahedron's edges ( BC ) at point ( M ). 4. Define ( a = AB = AT ). We find relationships within the tetrahedron:     - The perpendicular from point ( T ) to ( BC ) falls within plane ( AD ) as ( OK ).     - Construct the projections and triangular relations vertically and horizontally.  Step 4: Area Calculation & Dimensional Minimalization 5. Using similarity and proportions within intersecting planes, the smallest cross-sectional area calculation across various vertical slices involves minimizing it at the median plane with respect to ( ABC ):     [     S_{Delta TGM} = frac{1}{2} cdot TG cdot PM = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{a sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{a sqrt{2}}{sqrt{11}} = frac{a^2 sqrt{6}}{11}     ]     Resulting evaluation of intersection slices and geometric transformations leads to:     [     S_{Delta TGM} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{sqrt{33}} R^2     ]  Step 5: Volume Ratio Determination 6. We build upon pyramid division results, confirming volumetric breakdown via sectional plane:     Utilizing volume ratios:     [     frac{V_{TBMG}}{V_{TABC}} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{3}{11} (V_{TABC}) = frac{3}{22}     ] This results in the remaining volume proportion:     [     frac{V_{text{Slice1}}}{V_{text{Slice2}}} = frac{3}{19} text{to its complement within systematic 3D analysis.}     ] # Conclusion Consequently, the smallest cross-sectional area and the volumes between parts into which the pyramid is split can be outlined as: [ boxed{frac{2 sqrt{2}}{sqrt{33}} R^2 ; 3 : 19} ]"},{"instruction":"When you add 3 consecutive natural numbers, you get 48.

Let ( M ) be the center of the base ( ABC ), and let ( K ) be the midpoint of the side ( BC ) of the base. 2. Since the line ( AK ) is the orthogonal projection of the slanted edge ( AD ) on the plane of the base and ( AK perp BC ), by the Three Perpendiculars Theorem (if a line is perpendicular to a plane, it is perpendicular to all lines in that plane that it intersects), we can conclude that ( AD perp BC ). 3. Next, we know that line ( AD ) is perpendicular to two intersecting lines ( BC ) and ( BF ) in the plane ( BFC ).

Each row i with x_i chips contributes (2x_i - 2) connections because each chip (other than the first and last) has two connections, except for the edge chips which have only one connection.    Similarly, each column j with y_j chips contributes (2y_j - 2) connections.    Therefore, the total number of connections is:    [    k = sum_{i=1}^{20} (2x_i - 2) + sum_{j=1}^{15} (2y_j - 2)    ] 4.

Each chip can have at most 2 connections, so the maximum number of connections is:    [    2S geq k    ] 6. Combining the inequalities from the previous steps:    [    2S geq k geq 4S - 70    ] 7.

Let's suppose every resident of the city is the president of the same number k of clubs. Here, ( k ) is a non-negative integer. 2. **Counting the Total Number of Clubs:** Since each resident presides over k clubs and there are 1001 residents, the total number of clubs can be counted in two different ways:    - First, the number of clubs is ( 1001 times k ) because every resident is a president of exactly k clubs and there are 1001 residents.    - Second, the number of clubs is the number of ways to choose 13 members out of 1001. This is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{1001}{13} ). 3. **Setting the Two Counts Equal:** Therefore, we have:    [    binom{1001}{13} = 1001 times k    ] 4. **Simplifying the Binomial Coefficient:**    The binomial coefficient ( binom{1001}{13} ) is given by:    [    binom{1001}{13} = frac{1001 times 1000 times 999 times ldots times 989}{13 times 12 times ldots times 1}    ] 5. **Factorization and Division:**    The right-hand side needs to simplify to an integer. We know every term in the numerator starts from ( 1001 ) and ends at ( 989 ). Let’s express 1001 as ( 1001 = 13 times 77 ). Hence:    [    binom{1001}{13} = 77 times frac{1000 times 999 times ldots times 989}{12 times 11 times ldots times 1}    ] 6. **Implication for Division by 13:**    Since 13 is a prime number, for ( binom{1001}{13} ) to be divisible by 13, the prime number 13 must divide the numerator ( 1000 times 999 times ldots times 989 ). 7. **Evaluate Multiple:** Let’s check the terms starting from ( 1000 ) to ( 989 ). None of these terms are multiples of 13 because:    - ( 989 < 1000 )    - The next closest multiple of 13 greater than 988 but less than 1001 is ( 1001 = 13 times 77 ). 8. **Contradiction:**    Since none of the terms ( 1000, 999, ldots, 989 ) is divisible by 13 and ( mathrm{gcd}(1001, 13^2) = 13 ), it leads to ( k ) must force the divisions paradox of ( binom{1001}{13} = 13 times 77 times k ). 9. **Conclusion:**    This assumption leads to an inherent contradiction because it implies a non-divisibility in terms supposed to be assumed divisible precisely per our assumed structure. 10. **Final Proof:**    Hence, our assumption that every resident is president of the same number of clubs is incorrect. Thus, there must be residents who are presidents of different numbers of clubs, hence proving the statement.

Therefore, we can write the equation: Baseball cards + Football cards = Total cards 3F + 5 + F = 125 Combining like terms, we get: 4F + 5 = 125 Now, we need to solve for F, the number of football cards. We'll subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with F: 4F + 5 - 5 = 125 - 5 4F = 120 Next, we'll divide both sides by 4 to solve for F: 4F / 4 = 120 / 4 F = 30 So, Jack has 30 football cards.

First, let's manipulate the second equation: [f(x) + g(x-3) = 2 implies f(x+3) + g(x) = 2] Comparing this with the first equation f(1-x) + g(x) = 2, we get: [f(x+3) = f(1-x)] Given f(x+1) is an odd function, we have: [f(-x+1) = -f(x+1)] This implies: [f(x+3) = -f(x+1)] Which leads to: [f(x+2) = -f(x)] And consequently: [f(x+4) = -f(x+2) = f(x)] Therefore, f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 4. 3. Since f(x+1) is odd, f(1) = 0. This implies f(3) = 0 because f(x) is periodic with a period of 4. 4.

First, we convert 37 ½ minutes to a fraction to make calculations easier. 37 ½ minutes is the same as ( 37 + frac{1}{2} = frac{75}{2} ) minutes. The rate at which pipe A fills the cistern is ( frac{1}{frac{75}{2}} = frac{2}{75} ) of the cistern per minute. The rate at which pipe B fills the cistern is ( frac{1}{t} ) of the cistern per minute. When both pipes are opened together for 9 minutes, they fill ( 9 times (frac{2}{75} + frac{1}{t}) ) of the cistern. After 9 minutes, pipe B is turned off, and pipe A continues to fill the cistern for the remaining 21 minutes (since half an hour is 30 minutes and 30 - 9 = 21). In those 21 minutes, pipe A fills ( 21 times frac{2}{75} ) of the cistern. The total amount of the cistern filled when both pipes work together for 9 minutes and then pipe A alone for 21 minutes is equal to 1 (the whole cistern).

Doubling the figure means doubling the rectangle along the diameter to form a 3 times 2 rectangle (where 3 is the length and 2 is the total width). 2. **Calculating the Circle's Diameter:**    - The diagonal d of the newly formed 3 times 2 rectangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:      [      d = sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{9 + 4} = sqrt{13}      ] 3. **Calculating the Radius of the Circle:**    - The radius of the circle is half the diameter:      [      r = frac{d}{2} = frac{sqrt{13}}{2}      ] 4. **Calculating the Area of the Semicircle:**    - First, calculate the area of the complete circle:      [      A_{text{circle}} = pi r^2 = pi left(frac{sqrt{13}}{2}right)^2 = frac{13pi}{4}      ]    - The area of the semicircle is half the area of the full circle:      [      A_{text{semicircle}} = frac{A_{text{circle}}}{2} = frac{13pi}{8}      ] **Conclusion with boxed answer:**    The area of the semicircle is frac{13pi{8}}.

This means that the amount of manganese in the mixture is 20% of 1 kg, which is: 0.20 * 1 kg = 0.2 kg of manganese. The rest of the mixture is iron, so we have: 1 kg - 0.2 kg = 0.8 kg of iron. Now, we add 1 kg of iron to the mixture. The new total weight of the mixture becomes: 1 kg (original mixture) + 1 kg (added iron) = 2 kg. The amount of manganese remains the same, which is 0.2 kg, but it is now a part of a larger total mixture. To find the new percentage of manganese in the mixture, we divide the weight of manganese by the new total weight of the mixture and multiply by 100: (0.2 kg manganese / 2 kg total mixture) * 100 = 10%.

By shifting the variable x to x+1, we get:    [    xf'(x+1) + f(x+1) > 0,    ]    which means F'(x) > 0 for x > 0.

Notice that ( N ) is a very large number. 2. **Existence of Many Primes**:    Since ( N > 17489 ), and given that 17483 and 17489 are consecutive primes, in a sequence of ( 2011^{2011} ) numbers, we should definitely have more than 2011 prime numbers. Specifically, the sequence ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, N ) contains more than 2011 prime numbers. 3. **Existence of Composite Sequences**:    Now we need to demonstrate that there exists a sequence of ( N ) consecutive composite numbers.        **Proof**:    Consider the sequence       [    (N + 1)! + 2, (N + 1)! + 3, (N + 1)! + 4, ldots, (N + 1)! + N, (N + 1)! + (N + 1)    ]    Here, ((N + 1)! + k) is divisible by ( k ) for each ( k ) in the range ( 2 le k le N + 1 ), ensuring all the numbers are composite.

The new sequence is:    [    a - 1, a, a+1, ldots, a + N - 2    ]    This operation either retains, increases by one, or decreases by one the number of primes in the sequence. 6. **Reduction to Initial Sequence**:    By continuously performing the described operation, we eventually adjust the sequence such that it becomes ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, N ). This final sequence is known to have more than 2011 prime numbers. 7. **Intermediate Step Confirmation**:    Starting from a sequence with no primes and transitioning to a sequence with more than 2011 primes, there must exist intermediate sequences in which the number of primes transitions through every integer value from 0 to greater than 2011. Hence, there must exist some sequence during this transformation where the number of primes exactly equals 2011. # Conclusion: Therefore, there indeed exists a sequence of ( 2011^{2011} ) consecutive positive integers that contains exactly 2011 prime numbers.

Thus, the profit function g(x) = 16x - (frac{2}{3}x^2 + 4x) - 30 = -frac{2}{3}x^2 + 12x - 30.    - When 14 < x leq 35, f(x) = 17x + frac{400}{x} - 80. Thus, the profit function g(x) = 16x - (17x + frac{400}{x} - 80) - 30 = 50 - x - frac{400}{x}. Therefore, the analytical expression of g(x) is: g(x) = begin{cases} -frac{2}{3}x^2 + 12x - 30, & 0 leq x leq 14,  50 - x - frac{400}{x}, & 14 < x leq 35. end{cases} **(2)** To maximize the annual profit g(x), we analyze it in the given intervals: - For 0 leq x leq 14, g(x) = -frac{2}{3}x^2 + 12x - 30. The function is a downward-opening parabola, indicating it increases to a maximum point and then decreases. By analyzing the derivative or the nature of quadratic functions, we find that the maximum occurs at x = 9, yielding g(9) = -frac{2}{3} times 9^2 + 12 times 9 - 30 = 24 thousand yuan. - For 14 < x leq 35, g(x) = 50 - x - frac{400}{x}. To find the maximum, we can use the AM-GM inequality, which suggests the maximum profit in this interval is less than or equal to 10 thousand yuan, achieved when x = 20. Comparing the maximum profits in both intervals, we find that the maximum annual profit is higher when x = 9, with a profit of 24 thousand yuan. Thus, to maximize the annual profit, the company should produce 9 ten thousand units of this chip each year. boxed{x = 9}"},{"instruction":"Given vectors (vec{a} = {1,2}) and (vec{b} = {3,2}), find the real number (k) such that (k vec{a} + vec{b}) is in the same or opposite direction as (vec{a}  3 vec{b}).","output":"1. **Given Vectors:**    We are provided with vectors:    [    vec{a} = {1, 2}, quad vec{b} = {-3, 2}    ]     2. **Expression for (k vec{a} + vec{b}):**    We need to find the vector expression for (k vec{a} + vec{b}):    [    k vec{a} + vec{b} = k {1, 2} + {-3, 2} = {k cdot 1, k cdot 2} + {-3, 2}    ]    Simplifying the vector addition, we get:    [    k vec{a} + vec{b} = {k - 3, 2k + 2}    ] 3. **Expression for (vec{a} - 3 vec{b}):**    We need to find the vector expression for (vec{a} - 3 vec{b}):    [    vec{a} - 3 vec{b} = {1, 2} - 3 {-3, 2} = {1, 2} - {-9, 6}    ]    Simplifying the vector subtraction, we get:    [    vec{a} - 3 vec{b} = {1 + 9, 2 - 6} = {10, -4}    ] 4. **Determine (k) such that the vectors are collinear:**    The vectors (k vec{a} + vec{b}) and (vec{a} - 3 vec{b}) are collinear if:    [    frac{k - 3}{10} = frac{2k + 2}{-4}    ]     5. **Solve the equation for (k):**    Starting with the proportion:    [    frac{k - 3}{10} = frac{2k + 2}{-4}    ]    Cross multiplying to eliminate the fractions, we get:    [    -4 (k - 3) = 10 (2k + 2)    ]    Expanding both sides:    [    -4k + 12 = 20k + 20    ]    Rearranging terms to isolate (k):    [    12 - 20 = 20k + 4k    ]    [    -8 = 24k    ]    Solving for (k):    [    k = -frac{8}{24} = -frac{1}{3}    ] # Conclusion: The value of (k) that makes (k vec{a} + vec{b}) collinear with (vec{a} - 3 vec{b}) is: [ boxed{-frac{1}{3}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let the complex number z= dfrac {2i}{1+i}.

One of them must be in ( S_d ). If it is ( d_2 ), then ( c_1 - d_2 - b_2 ) forms a 3-cycle. If it is ( d_1 ), then ( d_1 ) is a neighbor of both ( b_3 ) and ( b_2 ), forming a 4-cycle. If it is ( d_3 ), then ( d_3 ) is a neighbor of both ( b_1 ) and ( b_3 ), forming a 4-cycle. 11. **Contradiction**: In all cases, we have attained a contradiction.

Solving the system of equations begin{cases} y = k(x + 2) + 2  x^2 = 4y end{cases}, we get y² - 4(k² + k + 1)y + 4(k + 1)² = 0. Hence, y_1 + y_2 = 4(k^2 + k + 1) and y_1y_2 = 4(k + 1)^2.

Cross multiplying gives: 9(6 - lambda) = 8sqrt{lambda^2 + 5} cdot 3. Simplifying further: 54 - 9lambda = 24sqrt{lambda^2 + 5}. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root: (54 - 9lambda)^2 = (24sqrt{lambda^2 + 5})^2. 2916 - 972lambda + 81lambda^2 = 576(lambda^2 + 5).

We proceed as follows: 1. Understand that all four-digit numbers from 1000 to 9999 are written sequentially without spaces. Each four-digit number contributes four digits to the sequence. 2. To form (k)-digit subsequences, the underlined subsequences can overlap between adjacent four-digit numbers. 3. Consider a specific example where (k=7). If Kostya and Andrey underline the segment (2229223), this sequence can be found at the junction of different four-digit numbers in two ways:        - Kostya might underline from the end of (2229) to the start of (2230):      [      2229|2230 quad  rightarrow quad 2229223      ]    - Andrey might underline from the end of (9222) into (9223):      [      9222|9223 quad rightarrow quad 2229223      ]          This sequence (2229223) fits the requirement that both underlines, though from different starting points, result in the same sequence. 4. To ensure that (k) cannot be greater than 7, consider an (k=8). Let's use a general representation for an eight-segment selection ( text{abcdefg}h ).

Analyze the overlap with respect to different ways of selection. Let’s assume that the boys chose different overlapping consecutive eight-digit sequences. By construction and the properties of digits in the context of joining of four digit numbers, no two such selections will result in the same sequence unless k leq 7.    This is corroborated by examining the digits around overlap points, particularly near the boundary of changing the digit structure ((9) to (0)) in four-digit transitions. For instance, if you try (k=8) with ( text{abcd}) and (text{efgh}) from different overlaps, like:    - (text{abcd}|efgh)    - (text{jklm}|nopq)    The sequence constraints force differing numbers, a contradiction when (k=8).

If it is small (side length 2 or 3), we are done.    - If it is large (side length 4 or greater), remove this cube and add its progeny. 4. **Iterate the process:**    - The progeny is still a good cube and is properly contained within the removed cube, so it could not have been in the original set.    - If any cube in the original set properly contains the progeny, it must be larger than the removed cube, which is a contradiction.    - If the progeny properly contains any cube, the removed cube also properly contained it, which is another contradiction.    - This process generates sets of cubes of the same order, fulfilling the pairwise-non-properly-containing property, with successively smaller total side lengths. 5. **Conclude the process:**    - Eventually, this process stops, generating a set with no large cubes.    - The set has an order no larger than the set of all ( 2 times 2 times 2 ) and ( 3 times 3 times 3 ) cubes. 6. **Calculate the maximal set:**    - The number of ( 2 times 2 times 2 ) cubes in an ( n times n times n ) grid is ( (n-1)^3 ).    - The number of ( 3 times 3 times 3 ) cubes in an ( n times n times n ) grid is ( (n-2)^3 ).    - Therefore, the maximal set of good cubes is ( (n-1)^3 + (n-2)^3 ).

A ball is released from one of the sides of the angle, with a speed directed into the sector at an angle of (110^circ) relative to this side. The ball reflects elastically off the boundaries of the sector, following the rule that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. We need to determine how many times the ball will hit the sector walls before it escapes indefinitely. 1. **Understanding the Geometry:**    - The sector has an angle of (theta = 30^circ = frac{pi}{6}).    - The ball is released from the boundary at an angle of (110^circ) relative to the starting boundary. 2. **Analyzing Initial Direction:**    - The initial velocity vector makes an angle of (alpha = 110^circ) with the starting boundary.    - The direction of the ball relative to the horizontal baseline (assuming the boundary it starts from as a horizontal) is (180^circ - 110^circ = 70^circ). 3. **Reflection Analysis:**    - For each reflection on the boundaries, the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.    - We transform the sector and reflections by considering duplicates or mirrored images of the sector—part of which constructs a virtual scenario where the ball does not reflect but continues in a straight line through multiple adjacent sectors. 4. **Calculating Reflection Events:**        Since the sector angle is (30^circ), let's transform the coordinate system, folding the reflections into repeated sector patterns. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:    - The ball initially travels at (110^circ) to the horizontal boundary.    - The ball will reflect (180^circ - 110^circ = 70^circ) with respect to the boundary.    - After unfolding, we define a new virtual trajectory where the ball passes through repeated sectors without \\"bouncing\\", following the path directly. 5. **Finding the Number of Sectors Crossed:**    - To determine how many (30^circ) sectors (therefore boundary hits) the ball crosses, divide the total internal angle equivalent to one full (180^circ) turn by the (30^circ) sector angle:      [      n = frac{theta_{text{travel}}}{theta_{text{sector}}}      ]    - Where (theta_{text{travel}}) is the total angle traversed in a straight line through the equivalent transformed sectors until the ball escapes, and (theta_{text{sector}} = 30^circ). 6. **Outcome Calculation:**    - The internal angle, related to (110^circ) considered the direction, resolving the 180 degrees transform, the ball trajectory including repeated travel and turns making (180^circ):      [      text{Total traversed sectors} = leftlfloor frac{70^circ}{30^circ} rightrfloor + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3       ] Conclusion: Therefore, after hitting (3) times on the walls of the sector, the ball will escape to infinity.

The standard equation of an ellipse is related to its semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b through the relation a^2 = b^2 + c^2. Since c^2 = 8, we have a^2 = b^2 + 8. Let's assume the equation of ellipse C is frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (where a > b > 0),   which can be written as frac{x^2}{b^2 + 8} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. Since point A(3, 0) lies on the ellipse, we have the equation frac{3^2}{b^2 + 8} + frac{0^2}{b^2} = 1. Solving this, we find b^2 = 1.

Given these constraints, possible scores that Ella could have received in the other tests are S={1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.  The constraint that the average score is always an integer implies that the total score after each test is divisible by the number of tests.  After eight tests, the possible sum of scores, considering that the eighth test score is 3, must be a multiple of 8. The ranges of potential sums for the seven tests (excluding the eighth) are from the smallest possible seven distinct scores in S, i.e., 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 33, to the largest one, i.e., 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 51. Adding the eighth test score, the sums thus range from 33 + 3 = 36 to 51 + 3 = 54. The sum of scores for eight tests should be between 36 and 54. The only feasible sums from this set that are multiples of 8 are 40 and 48. Since the eighth test score is 3, and we're solving backwards now, we set (text{sum of first seven tests}) + 3 = 40.

We need to prove that: angle ADB = frac{pi}{2} Leftrightarrow GE = EH. # Part 1: Rightarrow Assume that angle ADB = frac{pi}{2}. 1. From angle ADB = frac{pi}{2}, triangle ADB is a right-angled triangle. This leads to several trigonometric relationships: 2. Consider the length GE. Using the Law of Sines in triangle GAE:    [    GE = frac{c sin angle GAE}{sin angle GEA}.    ] 3. Given that angle GAE = angle ABC = B and the angle angle GEA should be calculated:    [    GE = frac{c sin B}{sin angle AEH}.    ] 4. Consider the opposite length EH. Using the Law of Sines in triangle AEH:    [    EH = frac{b sin C}{sin angle AEH}.    ] 5. Since angle GEA = angle AEH, we can simplify:    [    GE = EH.    ]  # Part 2: Leftarrow Assume now that GE = EH and we want to prove that angle ADB = frac{pi}{2}. 1. Let angle GAE = B' and angle EAH = C'. From the assumption:    [    frac{c sin B'}{sin angle GEA} = GE = EH = frac{b sin C'}{sin angle AEH}.    ] 2. Since sin angle GEA = sin angle AEH, we obtain:    [    c sin B' = b sin C'.    ] 3. Recall the known equation from triangle properties:    [    c sin B = b sin C,    ]    therefore:    [    sin B' sin C = sin C' sin B.    ] 4. By applying the angle addition and subtraction identities:    [    cos(B' - C) - cos(B' + C) = cos(B - C') - cos(B + C'),    ]    under the condition:    [    B' + C' = B + C.    ] 5. Therefore:    [    B' - C = B - C'.    ] 6. Thus, from the relationship between cosines:    [    cos(B' + C) = cos(B + C'),    ]    then:    [    B' + C = B + C'.    ] 7. Combining the equations:    [    B = B'.    ] Finally, in triangle ABD, as: [ angle ADB = pi - B - angle BAD, ] we determine: [ angle ADB = pi - B' - angle BAD = angle GAB = frac{pi}{2}. ] Conclusion: [ boxed{angle ADB = frac{pi}{2} Leftrightarrow GE = EH.} ]"},{"instruction":"Chelsea has 24 kilos of sugar.

Chelsea divided 24 kilos of sugar into 4 bags equally, so each bag had: 24 kilos / 4 bags = 6 kilos per bag After the accident, Chelsea has 21 kilos of sugar remaining. This means that the amount of sugar that fell to the ground is: 24 kilos (original amount) - 21 kilos (remaining amount) = 3 kilos Now, we know that the torn bag originally had 6 kilos of sugar, and 3 kilos fell to the ground. To find the ratio of the sugar that fell to the ground to the sugar in the torn bag before it fell, we compare the amount that fell to the original amount in the bag: 3 kilos (fell) : 6 kilos (original amount in the torn bag) To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by the common factor, which is 3: (3 kilos / 3) : (6 kilos / 3) = 1 : 2 So, the ratio of the sugar that fell to the ground to the sugar in the torn bag before it fell is boxed{1:2} ."},{"instruction":"Given the sets M={x|(x3)(x+1)geqslant 0} and N={x|2leqslant xleqslant 2}, determine the set Mcap N=(quadquad).

For any ( a, b in A ) with ( a > b ), it is given that:    [    frac{[a, b]}{a - b} in A    ]    where ([a, b]) denotes the least common multiple (LCM) of ( a ) and ( b ). 2. **Relatively Prime Case:**    If ( x ) and ( y ) are relatively prime, then ([x, y] = xy). Therefore:    [    frac{[x, y]}{|y - x|} = frac{xy}{|y - x|}    ]    This expression is not an integer unless ( {x, y} = {2, 1} ). Hence, if ( x ) and ( y ) are relatively prime and not equal to 1 and 2, the set ( A ) cannot contain both ( x ) and ( y ). 3. **Power of 2 Analysis:**    Let ( f(a) ) denote the highest power of 2 that divides ( a ). Suppose ( A ) has at least 3 elements. We will analyze the cases based on the parity (odd or even) of the elements in ( A ). 4. **Odd and Even Elements:**    - If ( p ) and ( q ) are both odd, then ([p, q]) is odd, and ( p - q ) is even. Thus:      [      frac{[p, q]}{p - q}      ]      is not an integer, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, ( A ) cannot contain two odd elements.    - If ( r ) is odd and ( s ) is even, then ([r, s]) is even, and ( r - s ) is odd. Thus:      [      frac{[r, s]}{r - s}      ]      is not an integer, which is again a contradiction. Therefore, ( A ) cannot contain both an odd and an even element. 5. **All Elements Even:**    Since ( A ) cannot contain both odd and even elements, all elements in ( A ) must be even. Let ( x ) and ( y ) be the smallest powers of 2 in ( A ). Without loss of generality, assume ( x = 2^d cdot m ) and ( y = 2^e cdot n ) where ( m ) and ( n ) are odd and ( d < e ). 6. **LCM and Difference Analysis:**    - The LCM of ( x ) and ( y ) is ( [x, y] = 2^e cdot text{lcm}(m, n) ).    - The difference ( |x - y| = |2^d cdot m - 2^e cdot n| ) has the highest power of 2 as ( 2^d ).    Therefore:    [    frac{[x, y]}{|x - y|} = frac{2^e cdot text{lcm}(m, n)}{2^d cdot k} = 2^{e - d} cdot frac{text{lcm}(m, n)}{k}    ]    where ( k ) is an integer. Since ( e - d geq 1 ), ( 2^{e - d} ) is at least 2, and thus ( frac{[x, y]}{|x - y|} ) is an integer. 7. **Contradiction and Conclusion:**    If there were more than two elements in ( A ), we would find another element ( z ) such that ( f(z) < f(y) ), contradicting the minimality of ( y ). Hence, ( A ) must contain exactly two elements. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Three containers are filled with whole liters of water.

Calculate the difference and fraction:    [    C = frac{5}{9}(64.25) = frac{5 times 64.25}{9} = frac{321.25}{9} approx 35.6944    ] 3. Rounded, ( C approx boxed{35.7} ). Conclusion: We found ( F = 96.25 ) and recalculated ( C approx 35.7 ) using a different formula, demonstrating a valid conversion between temperature scales."},{"instruction":"A person goes out to attend an event. The probabilities of him taking a train, ship, car, and airplane are 0.3, 0.1, 0.4, and 0.2, respectively. The probability of him not taking a ship is __________.","output":"Let the event \\"taking a ship to the event\\" be denoted as event A. According to the formula for the probability of the complementary event, we can find: The probability of him not taking a ship, P, is P = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9; Therefore, the answer is boxed{0.9}. By using the formula for the probability of the complementary event, we can directly find the probability of him not taking a ship, P = 1 - P(A). The key to solving such problems is to be proficient in the formula for the probability of complementary events and the basic properties of probability. This question is a basic one and is relatively simple in terms of its concept."},{"instruction":"Consider the equation 5z^2 + 4iz  k = 0, where z is a complex variable and i^2 = 1.

By Vieta's formulas, we know: [ r_1 + r_2 = -frac{4i}{5} ] [ r_1 r_2 = frac{-k}{5} ] # Step 2: Analyze the sum of the roots Since r_1 + r_2 = -frac{4i}{5} is purely imaginary, the real parts of r_1 and r_2 must be equal and opposite, so we can write: [ r_1 = a + bi quad text{and} quad r_2 = -a + ci ] where a, b, and c are real numbers. # Step 3: Product of the roots Using the expression for the product of the roots: [ r_1 r_2 = (a + bi)(-a + ci) = -a^2 + aci - abi - bci^2 ] [ r_1 r_2 = -a^2 - bc + (ac - ab)i ] Since r_1 r_2 = frac{-k}{5}, equating the real and imaginary parts gives: [ -a^2 - bc = text{Re}left(frac{-k}{5}right) ] [ ac - ab = text{Im}left(frac{-k}{5}right) ] # Step 4: Consider k as a pure imaginary number If k is a pure imaginary number, then text{Re}left(frac{-k}{5}right) = 0, which implies: [ -a^2 - bc = 0 ] [ ac - ab = text{Im}left(text{some value}right) neq 0 ] This shows that a = 0 and b neq c, leading to r_1 = bi and r_2 = ci, both roots are purely imaginary.
