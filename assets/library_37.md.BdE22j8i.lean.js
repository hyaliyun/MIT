Given that the roots are real and positive (t > 0), we can infer that a > 0 to ensure the parabola opens upwards and the inequality ax^{2}+bx+c < 0 holds between the roots. Also, since t > 0, and we are dealing with real numbers, t > 1 to maintain the order frac{1}{t} < t. 2. **Sum and Product of Roots:** From the sum and product of roots of a quadratic equation, we have: - Sum of roots: frac{1}{t} + t = -frac{b}{a} - Product of roots: frac{1}{t} cdot t = frac{c}{a} These imply b = -a(frac{1}{t} + t) and c = a cdot t cdot frac{1}{t} = a, showing a = c > 0. 3. **Analysis of Inequalities:** - We see that frac{1}{t} + t > 2sqrt{frac{1}{t} cdot t} = 2, which leads to b < -2a < 0. Therefore, abc < 0 and 2a + b < 0, implying both A and B are correct. - For option C, (frac{1}{4}a+frac{1}{2}b+c)(4a+2b+c) = left[frac{1}{4}a-frac{1}{2}a(frac{1}{t}+t)+aright]cdot[4a-2a(frac{1}{t}+t)+a] = frac{1}{4}a^{2}[5-2(frac{1}{t}+t)]^{2} geq 0, showing C is incorrect because this expression is always non-negative. - For option D, considering the equation ax+bsqrt{x}+c=0 and substituting sqrt{x} = m (with m geq 0), we get am^{2} + bm + c = 0, which has solutions identical to our initial setup, i.e., frac{1}{t} and t. Thus, x_{1} + x_{2} = (frac{1}{t} + t)^{2} - 2. Since frac{1}{t} + t > 2, we have (frac{1}{t} + t)^{2} - 2 > frac{1}{t} + t, indicating D is correct.

In other words, they are standing in the sequence 10, 9, ..., 1. 3. **First Method - Counting Minimum Moves**:    We need to determine the least number of swaps sufficient to arrange the children in the correct order.    - Suppose less than 8 swaps are made. This means at least 3 children would remain in their initial positions. However, since their initial sequence is entirely reverse, retaining any 3 children in their initial positions will ensure that their order would still be wrong. Hence, you will need at least 8 moves. 4. **Second Method - Complexity Measure**:    Define complexity as the number of inversions that need to be corrected by making swaps.    - Initially, the complexity is maximal because the children are in completely reverse order.    - Complexity = total number of places a child must move to reach its correct spot.    - Let ( Delta ) be the change in complexity after each step: (Delta leq 1). 5. **Detailed Calculation**:    - Initially, when all are in reverse order ( (10, 9, ..., 1) ), swap complexity is highest.    - Each swap of positions reduces the complexity by exactly one. Hence, transitioning from a complexity of 9 (full reverse order) to 1 implies a minimum of 8 swaps to correct the entire sequence. 6. **Practical Example - 8 Required Moves**:    Consider an example that achieves the optimal number of swaps:    - Leave 1 and 2 in their original positions.    - Place 3 after 2.    - Place 4 after 3.    - Continue in this manner. 7. **Conclusion**:    Given this rigorous assessment, the minimum number of moves necessary to arrange the children correctly in a circle is exactly 8.

To determine whether this critical point corresponds to a minimum, we examine the sign of the derivative on either side of x = 2: - For x < 2, left(x-2right) < 0 and since e^{x} > 0 for all x, {f'}left(xright) < 0.

To ensure there isn't another configuration where (angle AIC = 60^{circ}), recall that if (angle AIC = 60^{circ}), then it implies:    [    angle IAC + angle ICA = 120^{circ}    ]    However, since ( angle IAC = frac{angle BAC}{2} ) and ( angle ICA = frac{angle BCA}{2} ), we would have:    [    frac{angle BAC}{2} + frac{angle BCA}{2} = 120^{circ} implies angle BAC + angle BCA = 240^{circ}    ]    This is impossible because angles in a triangle must sum to (180^{circ}). # Conclusion: We have proved that one of the angles in triangle (ABC) must be (60^{circ}). blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given that the graph of the power function f(x) passes through the point (2, frac{1}{4}), what is the value of f(frac{1}{2})?

The term ( 18 ) is also a multiple of 24, so the remainder when ( p^3 + 17 ) is divided by 24 is 0 for ( p = 6k + 1 ).

So to find the units digit of 93 raised to the 45th power, we can find the remainder when 45 is divided by 4, because the pattern repeats every 4 powers. 45 ÷ 4 = 11 remainder 1 This means that the units digit of 93^45 will be the same as the units digit of 3^1, which is 3. Now we have the units digit of 35 raised to a certain power (which is 5) and the units digit of 93^45 (which is 3). We want the sum of these two units digits to be 8. 5 (from 35 raised to any power) + 3 (from 93^45) = 8 Since the units digit of 35 raised to any power is always 5, and we have already determined that the units digit of 93^45 is boxed{3,}  the sum is already 8.

By the properties of angle bisectors in a circle, angle BKM = angle BDM and angle CLN = angle CDN. 3. **Parallel Lines:**    Given that KL parallel MN, we can use this to establish that the angles angle BKL and angle BMN are equal. This is because corresponding angles formed by a transversal with parallel lines are equal. Therefore, angle BKL = angle BMN. 4. **Tangent Lines:**    From the angle chasing, we have:    [    angle BKL = angle BMN = angle BMC + angle CMN = angle BDC + angle DBN = angle BLC    ]    This implies that DC is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle AKL.

This homothety also maps AD to the tangent at M to k, say ell_M, and CD to the tangent at N to k, say ell_N. Since AD cap CD = D, the tangents ell_M and ell_N intersect on BD. 6. **Symmedian:**    The intersection of the tangents ell_M and ell_N on BD implies that BD is a symmedian in triangle BMN.

Our goal is to show that there exists a rational number ( r ) such that both ( (s_i - s_j) r ) and ( frac{(t_i - t_j)}{r} ) are integers for all ( i ) and ( j ).  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Initial Observation**:     We first address a trivial edge case.    **Claim**: For some indices ( i ) and ( j ), we have ( (s_i - s_j)(t_i - t_j) neq 0 ).    **Proof**:     Assume the contrary, that for all ( i, j ), ( (s_i - s_j)(t_i - t_j) = 0 ).         - If ( s_1 neq s_2 ), then we must have ( t_1 = t_2 ).    - Now choose an index ( i ) such that ( t_i neq t_1 = t_2 ). This implies either ( t_i - s_1 neq 0 ) or ( t_i - s_2 neq 0 ), both cases leading to a contradiction.    Therefore, it must be that ( (s_i - s_j)(t_i - t_j) neq 0 ) for some ( i, j ). 2. **Assumption without Loss of Generality**:    By permuting the sequences, we can assume:    [    n = (s_1 - s_2)(t_1 - t_2) neq 0.    ]        We can further assume by shifting and scaling appropriately that:    [    s_1 = t_1 = 0, quad s_2 = 1, quad t_2 = n.    ]     3. **Integer Properties Deduction**:    We deduce the following properties:    [    s_i t_i in mathbb{Z}, quad s_i t_j + s_j t_i in mathbb{Z} quad forall i, j.    ]        **Claim**: For any index ( i ), it holds that ( t_i in mathbb{Z} ) and ( s_i in frac{1}{n}mathbb{Z} ).    **Proof**:     - Given ( s_i t_i in mathbb{Z} ) and ( t_i + n s_i in mathbb{Z} ) by the problem condition.    - By looking at the ( p )-adic valuation ( nu_p ):      - We find that both ( n s_i ) and ( t_i ) must be integers. If either had a negative ( p )-adic value, the product ( s_i t_i ) would no longer be an integer. 4. **Greatest Common Divisor Argument**:    **Claim**: If ( d = gcd(t_1, t_2, t_3, ldots) ), then ( d s_i in mathbb{Z} ) for all ( i ).    **Proof**:    - Consider a prime ( p ) dividing ( n ), and let ( e = nu_p(t_j) ).    - We aim to show that ( nu_p(s_i) geq -e ) for any ( i ).      This is straightforward for ( i = j ), so assume ( i neq j ) and for contradiction, suppose ( nu_p(s_i) < -e ).            - This implies ( nu_p(t_i) > e = nu_p(t_k) ).      - As ( nu_p(s_k) geq -e ), thus ( nu_p(s_i t_k) < nu_p(s_k t_i) ).      - Therefore, ( nu_p(s_i t_k) geq 0 ), implying ( nu_p(s_i) geq -e ) as needed.

When both pipes are opened together, they fill the cistern at a rate of (1/12 + 1/15) per minute. To find a common denominator, we can use 60 (the least common multiple of 12 and 15): 1/12 = 5/60 1/15 = 4/60 So together, they fill (5/60 + 4/60) = 9/60 of the cistern per minute, which simplifies to 3/20.

For example, ( f(x) ) for 0 to 1, 1 to 2, etc., are identical.    - This implies that ( f(x) ) is periodic with a period ( T = 1 ). 4. **Formal proof of periodicity:**    To show that ( T = 1 ) is a period of ( f(x) ), we compute ( f(x+1) ):    [    begin{aligned}    f(x+1) & = (x+1) - [x+1]            & = (x+1) - ([x] + 1) quad text{(since ( [x+1] = [x] + 1 ) for all real ( x ))}            & = x + 1 - ([x] + 1)            & = x - [x]            & = f(x).    end{aligned}    ]    Therefore, ( f(x+1) = f(x) ), confirming ( f(x) ) is periodic with period ( T = 1 ). 5. **Smallest positive period:**    We need to verify if ( T = 1 ) is the smallest period.    - Assume ( 0 < l < 1 ) is a period of ( f(x) ). This means ( f(x + l) = f(x) ) for all ( x ).    - Consider ( x = 0 ):      [      f(l) = f(0) = 0.      ]    - Since ( f(l) = l - [l] ) and ( [l] = 0 ) (because ( 0 < l < 1 )), we get:      [      f(l) = l.      ]      Therefore, ( l = 0 ), which is a contradiction since ( 0 < l < 1 ). Hence, no such ( l ) exists.    - The contradiction implies there is no period ( l ) such that ( 0 < l < 1 ). **Conclusion:** ( boxed{T=1} ) is the smallest positive period for the function ( f(x) = x - [x] )."},{"instruction":"Determine the coefficient of (x^6) in the polynomial expansion of [(1  3x + 2x^2)^5.] A) 810 B) 1080 C) 1970 D) 162","output":"1. **Identify the Polynomial and the Target Term**: We need to calculate the coefficient of (x^6) in the expansion of ((1 - 3x + 2x^2)^5). 2. **Apply the Multinomial Theorem**: According to the theorem,    [    (a+b+c)^n = sum_{k_1+k_2+k_3=n} binom{n}{k_1, k_2, k_3} a^{k_1} b^{k_2} c^{k_3},    ]    where here (a=1), (b=-3x), and (c=2x^2).

Prove that these chords are diameters.","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**:    We are given that three equal chords pass through a single point inside a circle. The task is to prove that these chords are diameters of the circle. 2. **Represent the Circle and Chords**:    Let the circle be centered at ( O ) with radius ( R ). Let ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) be the points where each of these three equal chords intersects the circumference of the circle, and ( P ) the common point through which all the chords pass. 3. **Properties of Chords**:    Recall that a chord is a segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, and the longest chord of a circle is its diameter. 4. **Symmetry Argument**:    Since the chords are equal and symmetrical, let’s denote the length of each chord as ( d ).  5. **Use Diameter Properties**:    A key property of a circle is that the perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center of the circle. Given that all chords are equal and pass through ( P ), the perpendicular bisectors of these chords will coincide at point ( P ). 6. **Determine Chord Length**:    Because the chords are equal and pass through point ( P ) within the circle, ( P ) should be equidistant from the points ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) where each chord touches the circle.      7. **Consider Chords Intersection at ( P )**:    Since ( P ) is the point of intersection and is not the center, we can state that the chords split into segments such that they make an isosceles triangle in the circle. To further elaborate:     8. **Angle Properties**:    For a chord to be diameter, the angle subtended by it at the circumference must be ( 90^circ ). Here, since all equal chords intersect at ( P ), the angles formed at ( P ) between any two chords should be equal, hence ( 120^circ) each (sum of angles in a circle being ( 360^circ)). 9. **Visualization**:    Because all equal chords cross at point ( P ) and need to form identical angles of ( 120^circ) between each pair, the only way they retain their equal properties and balancing center symmetry is if they are diameters.  10. **Chords being Diameters**:     We conclude that since each chord passes through the center ( O ) with ( P ) being on the line of symmetry, each chord splits the circle into two equal halves and thus must be diameters. # Conclusion: The three equal chords in the circle that intersect at point ( P ) are indeed diameters of the circle.

By balancing these, we have: [  L_i + 2L_i + k_i + 9 = 24  ] Here, (L_i) represents the number of hours she works on a given day (i) and (k_i) represents the number of hours she spends on rest and household chores. Simplifying: [  3L_i + k_i = 15  ] This can be rearranged as: [  k_i = 15 - 3L_i  ] 2. Her earnings from tutoring each day can be expressed as: [  text{Daily earnings} = 2L_i  text{(in thousand rubles)}  ] 3. The daily donations are given by: [  text{Daily donation} = frac{k_i}{3}  text{(in thousand rubles)}  ] Using the substitution (k_i = 15 - 3L_i): [  text{Daily donation} = frac{15 - 3L_i}{3} = 5 - L_i  ] 4. Maria Ivanovna has a passive investment income of 30 thousand rubles per month and spends a fixed amount of 60 thousand rubles per month, excluding donations. Hence, the monthly equation is: [  30 + sum_{i=1}^{20} 2L_i = 60 + sum_{i=1}^{20} frac{k_i}{3} ] Combining the equations: [  30 + 2L_1 + 2L_2 + cdots + 2L_{20} = 60 + frac{k_1 + k_2 + cdots + k_{20}}{3} ] Using the substitution for (k_i): [  30 + 2L_1 + 2L_2 + cdots + 2L_{20} = 60 + frac{(15 - 3L_1) + (15 - 3L_2) + cdots + (15 - 3L_{20})}{3} ] Simplifying the sum components: [  sum_{i=1}^{20} k_i = 20 cdot 15 - 3sum_{i=1}^20 L_i = 300 - 3sum_{i=1}^{20} L_i ] Thus, the equation becomes: [  30 + 2sum_{i=1}^{20} L_i = 60 + frac{300 - 3sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i}{3} ] [  30 + 2sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i = 60 + 100 - sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i ] [  30 + 2sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i - 100 + sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i = 60  ] [  3sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i = 130  ] [  sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i = frac{130}{3} approx 43.33  ] Summarizing the months: [  text{Total monthly donation} = frac{300 - 3L - 3sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i}{3} = frac{300 - 3 times frac{130}{3}}{3}  = frac{170}{3} approx 56.67  ] Therefore, Maria Ivanovna can donate: [  boxed{56.67}  text{thousand rubles per month} ]  Part (b): Parents are proposing additional tutoring hours at an increased rate ( A ), where Maria has to make a decision whether the extra pay compensates for her time spent on rest and hobbies.  To ensure she accepts, the additional pay ( A ) must satisfy that she is not foregoing her personal and donation time. Therefore, ( A ) should be: Each additional hour ((L_{text{extra}})): [  text{Earnings per extra working hour} = 2 times text{previous rate} = 2 times 2 = 4  text{To make it acceptable, the increment must exceed this extra pay rate or } boxed{A geq 4} ] Hence, it must be: [  boxed{4}  text{thousand rubles per hour} ]"},{"instruction":"Observe the following equations: 3^{1}=3, 3^{2}=9, 3^{3}=27, 3^{4}=81, 3^{5}=243, 3^{6}=729, 3^{7}=2187…, answer the following question: The last digit of 3+3^{2}+3^{3}+…+3^{2015} is (　　) A: 1 B: 3 C: 7 D: 9","output":"Since 3^{1}=3, 3^{2}=9, 3^{3}=27, 3^{4}=81, 3^{5}=243, 3^{6}=729, 3^{7}=2187…,   the last digit cycles every 4 numbers,   since 2015 div 4 = 503 remainder 3,   the last digit of 3+3^{2}+3^{3}+3^{4}…+3^{2015} is equivalent to the last digit of 3+7+9+1+…+3+7+9=(3+9+7+1)×503+19=10079, which is 9.

Using the properties of trigonometric functions, we know that sin(-x) = -sin(x) and cos(x) = cos(-x). Applying these to our equation gives:    [    -sin left(3pi -alpha right)=2cos left(4pi -alpha right),    ]    because sin is an odd function and cos is an even function. 2. Since sin left(pi - xright) = sin(x) for any angle x, and knowing that cos(x) = cos(-x), we can simplify the equation to:    [    -sin left(pi -alpha right)=2cos left(-alpha right).    ] 3. Recalling that sin(pi - x) = sin(x), we further simplify the equation to:    [    sin(alpha) = -2cos(alpha).    ]    This gives a relation between sin(alpha) and cos(alpha). Knowing that cos(alpha) neq 0 to avoid division by zero, we substitute sin(alpha) and cos(alpha) in the given expression: [ frac{{sin({pi-alpha})+5cos({2pi-alpha})}}{{2sin({frac{{3pi}}{2}-alpha})-sin({-alpha})}} = frac{sin(alpha) + 5cos(alpha)}{-2cos(alpha) + sin(alpha)} ] Simplifying the fraction: [ = frac{3cos(alpha)}{-4cos(alpha)} = -frac{3}{4}. ] Thus, the value is boxed{-frac{3}{4}}.  Part (2) Given sin x + cos x = frac{1}{5}, we square both sides and use sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1: 1. Squaring both sides gives:    [    sin^2 x + 2sin xcos x + cos^2 x = frac{1}{25}.    ] 2. Since sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1, the equation simplifies to:    [    1 + 2sin xcos x = frac{1}{25}.    ] 3. Rearranging for 2sin xcos x:    [    2sin xcos x = frac{1}{25} - 1 = -frac{24}{25}.    ] With -frac{pi}{2} < x < 0, we know sin x < 0 and cos x > 0. Therefore, sin x - cos x is negative, and we use the negative square root: [ sin x - cos x = -sqrt{(sin x - cos x)^2} = -sqrt{1 - 2sin xcos x} = -sqrt{1 + frac{24}{25}} = -sqrt{frac{49}{25}} = -frac{7}{5}. ] So, the value is boxed{-frac{7}{5}}."},{"instruction":"Given the set A={x|x^2+2x+1=0}={a}, find the proper subset of the set B={x|x^2+ax=0}.","output":"According to the problem, we first find the root of the equation x^2+2x+1=0 to determine the value of a, and then we can determine the set B.

To solve the given equation x^2+2x+1=0, we find that it can be rewritten as (x+1)^2=0, which means x=-1. Therefore, a=-1. Substituting a=-1 into the equation for set B, we get x^2-x=0, or x(x-1)=0. Thus, the elements of set B are 0 and 1. The proper subsets of set B are emptyset, {0}, and {1}.

At the center of each face of the cube is a number equal to the product of the numbers at the vertices of that face. Can the sum of the resulting 14 numbers be equal to 0?","output":"1. Let us define the vertices of the cube and assign the numbers (+1) or (-1) to each vertex. 2. Each face of the cube has four vertices and is thus associated with a number equal to the product of the numbers at its vertices. 3. Since the cube has 6 faces, we need to examine these products to determine if their sum can be zero. First, let's consider the product of the numbers at the vertices of one face. Each face of the cube is a quadrilateral formed by 4 vertices, denoted as (a), (b), (c), and (d). The number assigned to the center of this face is (abcd). 4. For the cube, there are a total of 14 unique centers to consider:     - 8 centers from the faces.     - 6 centers from the pairs of opposite faces.    We need to check whether the sum of all these values can be zero. 5. The product of all numbers assigned to the vertices can be calculated. Since each vertex number is either +1 or -1, the product of all the vertex numbers of the cube (total 8 vertices) is ((+1)^a cdot (-1)^b cdot (+1)^ccdot ldots cdot (-1)^{h}). 6. Consider the initial analysis of the behavior of signs:     - Due to symmetry of a cube, any configuration that has an equal number of +1's and -1's will return an even number of (-1) values, and thus will not affect the signs essentially changing the result to positive. 7. When each edge center involves a product as + or -, the overall product must again maintain balance to zero net-product summations. 8. If the quantity of +1 and -1 are balanced equally for the surface computations to 14 derivatives, mapping each association on the face-level summarization, it inherently confirms:         [    left| sum_{i=1}^{14} product_i (+1, -1)right|     ] The product of all 14 face-related numbers relates as ( (+1 text{ or } -1 )^4 ), given they are in higher orders maintaining total group values symmetry. 9. Any summation proving zero requires minus one forms derived themselves equalizing the format to 7 negatives and 7 positives inherently. 10. Due to symmetry in cube configurations, creating such balance forming equal 7 and 7 across cannot directly prove aligning zero summation contradicting structure forms. # Conclusion: Thus it cannot meet an exact configuration returning; - The product of all vertex numbers is inherently positive. - The sum of products of vertices for 14 configurations cannot logically equal zero integrating cube symmetries.

The ball is initially shot from one corner at an angle of (45^circ) to the side. 3. Reflect the billiard table along all walls it touches. In this setup, the table will form a grid of repeated rectangular cells with heights (1) unit and widths (sqrt{2}) units. 4. The movement of the ball through this repeated rectangular cells grid can be simplified to a straight line with the slope equal to the ratio of the sides' lengths, which in this case is (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}).  5. Since the slope is (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}), the line passes through coordinates that satisfy (sqrt{2}y = x) in an extended, reflective grid of the billiard table. 6. The important observation here is that the equation (sqrt{2}y = x) never leads to both (x) and (y) simultaneously being integers.

To determine which alternative correctly represents the folded cube from the given net, we should carefully consider the relative positions of each face when the net is folded into a cube. Here’s a step-by-step detailed analysis: 1. **Analyzing the Net**:     - The net consists of six faces arranged in a cross-like pattern.     - We denote the symbols on each face as follows:       - Let the faces be numbered 1 to 6.       - Assume face 1 is the central square.       - Faces 2 to 6 surround face 1. 2. **Determining Neighboring Faces**:     - When folded into a cube:       - Face 1 touches faces 2, 3, 4, and 5.       - Face 2 touches faces 1, 3, and 6.       - Face 3 touches faces 1, 2, and 4.       - Face 4 touches faces 1, 3, and 5.       - Face 5 touches faces 1, 4, and 6.       - Face 6 touches faces 2 and 5. 3. **Matching with Options**:     - Analyze option (a):       - It shows certain pairs of faces next to each other.       - Check if any pairs can be adjacent in the cube (net configuration).     - Analyze option (b):       - Similar analysis for option (b).            - Analyze option (c):       - Check face adjacency.     - Analyze option (d):       - Check face adjacency.     - Analyze option (e):       - Check face adjacency. 4. **Conclusion from Analysis**:     - From careful examination:       - We can see that options (a) and (e) are the same because they show the same adjacency.       - Options (c) and (d) similarly show the same adjacency.       - Correct folding maintaining circle and star formations leads to option (b) being the suitable one based on neighbor checks and correct face adjacencies when the net is folded.

The average of a set of consecutive integers is the middle number when there is an odd number of terms, or the average of the two middle numbers when there is an even number of terms.

The entire expansion can be split as follows:        - (100a^2) contributes (00) in the last two digits (since (100a^2) is always a multiple of 100).    - (20ab) contributes (20ab mod 100).    - (b^2) contributes (b^2 mod 100). So, the significant part is the last two digits combined from (20ab) and (b^2). 4. According to the problem, the last digit is odd.

However, since we are interested in c^{2}, and both (2)^2 and (-2)^2 equal 4, we have c^{2} = 4. Now, we calculate a+b+c^{2} step by step: [ a+b+c^{2} = 2 + left(-frac{2}{3}right) + 4 ] First, we add 2 and 4, which gives us 6. Then, we add -frac{2}{3}: [ 6 + left(-frac{2}{3}right) = 5frac{3}{3} - frac{2}{3} = 5frac{1}{3} ] Therefore, the value of a+b+c^{2} is 5frac{1}{3}.

How many ways are there to place the coins?","output":"To solve the problem of distributing 99 coins in a 2 times 100 grid, such that no two coins are placed in adjacent cells and no cell contains more than one coin, we need to account for the following: 1. **Understanding the Grid Layout and Constraints:**     - We have a total of 200 cells (2 times 100 grid).     - We must leave one column completely empty to place 99 coins across the remaining 99 columns.     - We need to ensure that no two coins are placed in cells that share a common side, meaning adjacent horizontal and vertical cells can't both have a coin. 2. **Identifying Columns with Potential Coin Placement Patterns:**     - Since we need to leave precisely one column completely empty, this gives us 100 choices for which column is left empty.     - For the remaining 99 columns, we need to place coins adhering to the non-adjacency rule. 3. **Possible Coin Placements in Columns:**     - Each column can have coins in either the first row, the second row, or no coins in that column at all if it doesn't violate the adjacency rule.     - We will analyze the placement in terms of left and right to the empty column and consider the patterns. 4. **Setting Up the Pattern Combinations:**     - Let us focus on the patterns that can occur around any empty column:         - Denote an empty column as a separator.         - Consider independently the coin placements in columns to the left of the empty column and those to the right of the empty column.         - Let L denote the number of ways to fill columns to the left and R denote the number of ways to fill columns to the right. 5. **Counting Patterns Around the Empty Column Placement:**     - Each side (left/right) has exactly 99 columns spread across them, and we count feasible combinations:     - If the empty column is *not* at the far right or far left, we have the following calculations:         [         L = 2 quad (text{Two ways to place coins to the left of an empty column: [00,10,01]})         ]         [         R = 2 quad (text{Two ways to place coins to the right of an empty column: [00,10,01]})         ]     - This results in:         [         text{Total placements} = 2 cdot 2 = 4 text{ (for middle columns)}         ]     - However, if the empty column is at the far left or far right edge, we have only 2 patterns, as one side will have no constraints:         [         text{Edge cases} = 2 , (text{one side uniformity})         ] 6. **Combining All Possible Placements:**     - Therefore, we compute the total number of unique ways to arrange the coins:         [         text{Central columns} = 98 quad (text{choices}) cdot 4 = 392         ]         [         text{Edge columns} = 2 + 2 = 4           ]     - Summing all possibilities:         [         text{Total ways} = 392 + 4 = 396         ] # Conclusion: The total number of ways to distribute 99 coins in the 2 times 100 grid with the given constraints is: [ boxed{396} ]"},{"instruction":"Vishal invested 10% more than Trishul.

We need to find the length of (FG). 2. **Analyzing the fold**: Since (B) and (D) are folded to meet at (E), (E) must lie on the diagonal (AC). The creases (CF) and (CG) bisect the angles (angle ACB) and (angle ACD) respectively, making (angle ECF = angle ECG = 22.5^circ) (since (angle ACB = angle ACD = 45^circ)). 3. **Using trigonometry**: Let (EF = EG = x).

The total weight of the male students decreased by 45 kg after the student left: M' = M - 45 Now, we can express the total weight of the class after the student left in terms of the average weight before the student left: M' + F' = (M - 45) + F' = 59 * (A + 0.2) Since M + F = 60 * A, we can substitute M - 45 + F' for M + F - 45: M - 45 + F' = 60 * A - 45 Now we have: 59 * (A + 0.2) = 60 * A - 45 Expanding both sides: 59A + 11.8 = 60A - 45 Subtracting 59A from both sides: 11.8 = A - 45 Adding 45 to both sides: A = 56.8 Now we have the average weight of the class before the student left. To find the average weight of the remaining 59 students (A'), we add 0.2 kg to A: A' = A + 0.2 A' = 56.8 + 0.2 A' = 57 kg Therefore, the average weight of the remaining 59 students is boxed{57}  kg."},{"instruction":"Find the sum of the xcoordinates of the solutions to the system of equations y=|x^28x+12| and y=4x.","output":"The quadratic x^2-8x+12 factors as (x-6)(x-2), so it crosses the x-axis at x=2 and x=6.

We will provide a step-by-step solution to illustrate why it is not possible to have more than 11 people sitting at the same time.  Step 1: Understand the Constraints - There are 12 chairs in a row. - A person can sit on an empty chair, causing one of their neighbors to stand up and leave if there are any.    Our task is to maximize the number of people sitting simultaneously while adhering to the above constraints.  Step 2: Proving that not all 12 chairs can be occupied simultaneously - If all 12 chairs were occupied, each time a new person sits, one of the neighboring people must stand up and leave.  Consider the scenario where seating progresses to the last chair: 1. When the last person sits on the 12th chair, they will force one of their immediate neighboring chairs (either the 11th or the 11th chair) to be vacated. 2. Therefore, it is impossible to have all 12 chairs occupied simultaneously under these rules. Thus, the maximum number of chairs that can be occupied simultaneously is strictly less than 12. We hypothesize that the number is 11 and then prove this by construction.  Step 3: Construction to achieve maximum seating of 11 people We will incrementally construct a scenario where we can successfully seat 11 people. 1. **Labeling the Chairs:** Number the chairs from 1 to 12. 2. **Initial Occupation:**      - Place the first person on chair 1: ( P_1 ). 3. **Sequential seating with neighbor displacement:**    - To place the second person in a manner that maintains a maximum number of people seated, the following specialized sequence is followed:      - Seat the second person on chair 3 (( P_2 rightarrow C_3 )). No displacement occurs as chair 2 is empty.      - Then seat another person on chair 2 (( P_3 rightarrow C_2 )). This will cause ( P_2 ) on chair 3 to stand up. Continue this iterative process: - For seated chairs 1 to k:   - First, sit a person on chair ( k+2 ).   - Then displace someone by sitting on chair ( k+1 ). - Applying this process for ( 1 leq k leq 10 ):    Example steps from 4th person onwards:    - Seat 4th person on 5th chair (( P_4 rightarrow C_5 )): ( P_4 ) seats without anyone to displace.    - Seat 5th person on the 4th chair (( P_5 rightarrow C_4 )): ( P_5 ) sits, causing ( P_4 ) to vacate.    - Extend this similar steps for subsequent seating till the 11th person. Through this process: - You will iteratively get up to the 11th chair occupied without violating the rules, finally:    - ( P_i ) on chairs ( 1 leq i leq 11 ). One chair will always remain empty since the last seated person's presence will always displace the adjacent.

Given that x_1 < x_2, we want to determine the relationship between y_1 and y_2. Since the slope of the line is positive (k = 2 > 0), as x increases, y also increases. This is a fundamental property of linear functions with a positive slope. Therefore, since x_1 < x_2, it follows that y_1 < y_2. This is because moving from x_1 to x_2 along the x-axis (with x_1 < x_2), the corresponding y values increase due to the positive slope of the line.

By the induction hypothesis, 2^{2^k} + 2^{2^{k-1}} + 1 has at least k distinct prime divisors. Since 2^{2^k} - 2^{2^{k-1}} + 1 is coprime to it, it provides at least one more distinct prime divisor. Thus, 2^{2^{k+1}} + 2^{2^k} + 1 has at least k+1 distinct primes. **Conclusion**: We have successfully shown by induction that the given number has at least n distinct prime divisors for any natural number n. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=2xln x.

Let f'(x) > 0 to find the increasing interval (frac{1}{e},+infty), and let f'(x) < 0 to find the decreasing interval (0,frac{1}{e}). (2) Let the coordinates of the point of tangency be (x_{0},2x_{0}ln x_{0}), and let the slope of the tangent line be k. On one hand, k=frac{2x_{0}ln x_{0}-(-2)}{x_{0}-0}, and on the other hand, k=f'(x_{0})=2ln x_{0}+2. Hence, frac{2x_{0}ln x_{0}-(-2)}{x_{0}-0}=2ln x_{0}+2, which simplifies to x_{0}=1. Thus, the coordinates of the point of tangency are (1,0), and the equation of the tangent line is boxed{y=2x-2}. (3) Given that 2xln x < lambda(x^{2}-1) holds for all xin(1,+infty), it is equivalent to 2ln x < lambda(x-frac{1}{x}) for xin(1,+infty). Construct g(x)=2ln x-lambda(x-frac{1}{x}), then g(x)<0 holds for xin(1,+infty). From g(2)<0, i.e., 2ln 2-frac{3}{2}lambda<0, we get the necessary condition lambda > 0. Then, g'(x)=frac{2}{x}-lambda(1+frac{1}{x^{2}})=frac{-lambda x^{2}+2x-lambda}{x^{2}}. Let h(x)=-lambda x^{2}+2x-lambda, and the discriminant triangle = 4-4lambda^{2}. If lambdageqslant 1, then triangle leqslant 0, and h(x)leqslant 0 always holds since h(x) opens downward. In this case, g'(x)leqslant 0 always holds, which means g(x) is decreasing on (1,+infty). Therefore, g(x)<g(1)=0, satisfying the requirement. If 0<lambda<1, then triangle > 0, and h(x)=0 has two real roots x_{1} and x_{2}. Without loss of generality, let x_{1}<x_{2}. By Vieta's theorem, x_{1}+x_{2}=frac{2}{lambda}>0 and x_{1}cdot x_{2}=1>0, so x_{1} and x_{2} are both positive, and x_{1}<1<x_{2}. Thus, h(x)=0 has a unique real root x_{2} in (1,+infty). From the graph, we know: When xin(1,x_{2}), h(x)>0, i.e., g'(x)>0. Therefore, g(x) is increasing on (1,x_{2}), and g(x)>g(1)=0 for xin(1,x_{2}), which does not satisfy the requirement.

Calculate the total cost price for all three items.","output":"To calculate the total cost price for all three items, we need to find the cost price for each item individually and then sum them up. Let's start with Item A: The selling price (SP) of Item A is Rs. 150, and the profit is 25%. We know that profit is calculated on the cost price (CP), so we can write the following equation: SP = CP + Profit 150 = CP + (25% of CP) 150 = CP + (0.25 * CP) 150 = 1.25 * CP Now, we can solve for CP (Cost Price) of Item A: CP = 150 / 1.25 CP = 120 So, the cost price of Item A is Rs. 120. Next, let's calculate the cost price for Item B: The selling price (SP) of Item B is Rs. 200, and the profit is 20%. Using the same method as above: SP = CP + Profit 200 = CP + (20% of CP) 200 = CP + (0.20 * CP) 200 = 1.20 * CP Solving for CP of Item B: CP = 200 / 1.20 CP = 166.67 (rounded to two decimal places) So, the cost price of Item B is Rs. 166.67. Finally, let's calculate the cost price for Item C: The selling price (SP) of Item C is Rs. 250, and the profit is 15%. Again, using the same method: SP = CP + Profit 250 = CP + (15% of CP) 250 = CP + (0.15 * CP) 250 = 1.15 * CP Solving for CP of Item C: CP = 250 / 1.15 CP = 217.39 (rounded to two decimal places) So, the cost price of Item C is Rs. 217.39. Now, we can calculate the total cost price for all three items by adding the cost prices of Item A, Item B, and Item C: Total CP = CP of Item A + CP of Item B + CP of Item C Total CP = 120 + 166.67 + 217.39 Total CP = 504.06 (rounded to two decimal places) Therefore, the total cost price for all three items is Rs. boxed{504.06} ."},{"instruction":"The operation is defined for all integers a and b by the equation ab = (a  1)(b  1).

So the total fodder available (F) can be calculated as: F = (15B + 8O + 24C) * 48 When 40 more cows and 15 more buffaloes are brought in, the fodder will last for 24 days. So we can write: F = (15B + 40C + 24C + 15B) * 24 Simplifying the above equation, we get: F = (30B + 64C) * 24 Now, we know that the total fodder is the same in both cases, so we can set the two equations equal to each other: (15B + 8O + 24C) * 48 = (30B + 64C) * 24 Dividing both sides by 24, we get: (15B + 8O + 24C) * 2 = 30B + 64C Expanding the left side, we get: 30B + 16O + 48C = 30B + 64C Since 3B = 2O, we can replace 16O with 24B (because 16O = 8 * 2O = 8 * 3B = 24B), and we get: 30B + 24B + 48C = 30B + 64C 54B + 48C = 30B + 64C Subtracting 30B and 48C from both sides, we get: 24B = 16C Dividing both sides by 8, we get: 3B = 2C This means that 3 buffaloes eat as much as 2 cows.

To construct the x^5 term from the product, we can use the terms where r=5 and r=4 correspondingly: - For the x^5 term from (1+x)^7, we have r=5 and the term is binom{7}{5}x^5. - For the x^4 term from (1+x)^7, we have r=4 and the term is binom{7}{4}x^4.

This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Given sides of lengths 5 and 6 units, the sum of these two sides is 5 + 6 = 11 units. Therefore, for the triangle to exist, the length of the third side x must be less than 11 units but more than 6 - 5 = 1 unit (to satisfy the triangle inequality theorem from the other direction). Since x is an integer, the largest possible value for x is 10 units. This ensures that all three sides (5 units, 6 units, and 10 units) satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, making a valid triangle. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides.

As ( MA leq CB leq MB ), one critical inequality is:    [    MB < MA + BC    ]    This simplifies to:    [    MB - MA < BC    ] 4. **Square and Simplify the Inequality:**    - The left side of the inequality is non-negative so we can square both sides:    [    MB^2 + MA^2 - 2MB cdot MA < BC^2    ] 5. **Express in Terms of Coordinates:**    - Using the fact that ( MB^2 + MA^2 = AB^2 = 2BC^2 ):    [    2MB cdot MA > 2BC^2 - BC^2 = BC^2    ]    Simplifying gives:    [    MB cdot MA > frac{BC^2}{2}    ]    Since ( AB = 2BC ), and ( M ) is beyond the midpoint:    [    MB cdot MA > frac{AB^2}{4}    ] 6. **Height Comparison:**    - Given ( AB = O C ):    [    MB cdot MA = AB cdot MT > frac{AB^2}{4}    ]    Solving for ( MT ):    [    MT > frac{AB}{4} = frac{OC}{2}    ] 7. **Arc Segments Analysis:**    - Therefore, the point ( M ) should lie on specific segments of ( k ). These segments start at points where ( AB ) parallel lines through points on the (AB)-perpendicular ( CC' ) intersect with ( k ). Points at ends cannot form a triangle as equality holds. Conclusion: - ( M ) lies on specific segments of ( k ) away from endpoints identified above.

Diagonals meet this given ( 2NB^2 + 2NC^2 = 4BC^2 ).    - Known result relates sides and diagonals, thus:    [    NN_3^2 = 3BC^2    ]    Hence, for ( N ):    [    NG = frac{sqrt{3}BC}{2}    ]    This geometric setup is such that ( N ) lies on a circle ( k_N ) radius ( GN_c ) centered at ( G ). 3. **Path Coverage:**    - As ( M ) covers segment ( i ), with now endpoints included, ( N ) sweeps the circle ( k_N ) fully. Point ( N ) thus covers the entire circle centered at ( G ). # Conclusion: The path of point ( N ) is a circle centered at the midpoint of ( BC ) with radius ( frac{sqrt{3}BC}{2} ).

Point ( C ) is on the tangent to the circle at point ( A ). From point ( C ), a second tangent ( CD ) is drawn to the circle. We are asked to prove that segment ( DB ) is parallel to segment ( OC ). 2. **Understanding the tangent properties:**    Since ( AB ) is the diameter, any line segment from the center to a point on the circle is a radius. Let's denote the radius ( OA ).    By the property of tangents, the tangent at any point of the circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Therefore, the tangent at point ( A ), which includes point ( C ), is perpendicular to ( OA ). 3. **Establish perpendicularity relations:**    Because ( OA ) is a radius and ( AB ) is the diameter, ( AB ) extends through the center ( O ). Hence, ( AB ) is a straight line.    We know ( CD ) is a tangent from point ( C ) and touches the circle at point ( D ). Thus, ( OD ), where ( O ) is the center and ( D ) the point of tangency, must be perpendicular to ( CD ). 4. **Proving parallel segments using perpendicularity:**    Since ( DA ) is also perpendicular to ( CD ) (by the property that any radius to a point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line at that point), we establish a right-angled triangle with vertices ( D ), ( A ), and ( B ).

We will explore whether such an arrangement is possible for all natural numbers (n). 2. **Case 1: n is even (n = 2k):**     - We will demonstrate this by constructing an example where (n = 2):       [       begin{array}{cc}       0 & 1        -1 & 0        end{array}       ]     - For (n = 2), the sums of rows and columns are (-1, 0, 0, 1), each unique.     - Our goal is to generalize this for any even (n = 2k). 3. **Induction Hypothesis:**     - Assume that for a given even number (n = 2k), it is possible to fill a (2k times 2k) grid such that the sums of the rows and columns are all unique and fall in the range -2k, -2k+1, ldots, 0, ldots, 2k-1. 4. **Induction Step:**     - Prove that if it holds for (n = 2k), it must hold for (n = 2(k + 1)).     - Suppose we have a correctly filled (2k times 2k) grid.     - Extend this to a ((2k + 2) times (2k + 2)) grid by adding new rows and columns. The existing sums won’t change, but we introduce new sums corresponding to (2k) and (2k + 1).     - The new sums {-(2k+2), -(2k+1), 2k, 2k+1}, combined with the old sums, yield (2k + 4 = 2(k + 1)), satisfying the unique sums requirement. 5. **Conclusion for Even n:**     - By mathematical induction, if (n = 2(k+1)), then the hypothesis holds true. Hence, the configuration is feasible for any even (n). 6. **Case 2: (n) is odd ((n = 2k + 1)):**     - Assume for contradiction that we can fill the grid for some odd (n = 2k + 1).     - Let the sums of rows be (r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n) and sums of columns (s_1, s_2, ldots, s_n).     - These sums must cover the integers from -n to n without repetition.     - Thus the total absolute sum is:       [       sum_{i=1}^{n}|r_i| + sum_{j=1}^{n}|s_j| geq sum_{k=-n}^{n}|k| - n = n^2.       ] 7. **Contradiction:**     - The (2n) different sums split between negative and non-negative:       [       sum_{i=1}^n |r_i| + sum_{j=1}^n |s_j| = 2 sum_{text{positive}} - 2 sum_{text{negative}}.       ]     - Evaluate the filled entries (a_{ij}) in the grid for sums sum_{i,j} a_{ij}.     - This sum is bounded above:       [       sum_{i,j} a_{ij} leq 4k(n - k),       ]     implying:       [       n^2 leq 4k(n - k).       ]     - Simplifying leads to:       [       (n - 2k)^2 leq 0,       ]       - Since (n = 2k+1), (n - 2k)^2 = 1^2 = 1 > 0, a contradiction indicating that it is impossible for odd (n). # Conclusion: For n even, the desired grid exists and can be constructed.

We have g'(x) = e^x - 1. 3. **Monotonicity Analysis**:    - For x < 0, since e^x < 1, we have g'(x) < 0. This means g(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (-infty, 0).    - For x > 0, since e^x > 1, we have g'(x) > 0. This implies g(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval (0, +infty). 4. **Minimum Value of g(x)**:    Since g(x) is decreasing before 0 and increasing after 0, it reaches its minimum at x=0.

Here, the key requirement is that the 12th roll should be the first time the consecutive roll appears. Let's break down the computation: - The first roll can be anything (8 choices out of 8), so we don't worry about its probability. - From the second roll to the 11th roll, each roll should be different from the immediately preceding roll. Since there are 8 possible outcomes per roll, and she must avoid only one specific outcome, there are 7 acceptable outcomes per roll. - The probability for each of rolls 2 through 11 not matching the preceding roll is therefore frac{7}{8}. - For the 12th roll, it must be the same as the 11th roll, which has a probability of frac{1}{8}. The total probability calculation is: [ left(frac{7}{8}right)^{10} times frac{1}{8} ] Using the above formula, we calculate: [ left(frac{7}{8}right)^{10} approx frac{282475249}{1073741824} ] Thus, multiplying frac{282475249}{1073741824} by frac{1}{8}, we get: [ frac{282475249}{1073741824} times frac{1}{8} = frac{282475249}{8589934592} approx boxed{0.033} ]"},{"instruction":"A numerical sequence is defined by the conditions: ( a_{1} = 1 ), ( a_{n+1} = a_{n} + leftlfloor sqrt{a_{n}} rightrfloor ).

Since (1048576 > 1000000), (4^{10}) is not counted. 5. **Final Calculation:**    - The relevant powers of 4 are (4^0) through (4^9):      (      4^0, 4^1, 4^2, 4^3, 4^4, 4^5, 4^6, 4^7, 4^8, 4^9.      )    - Therefore, we get 10 perfect squares in total. # Conclusion: There are exactly (boxed{10}) perfect squares in the sequence that do not exceed (1,000,000)."},{"instruction":"Jimin gave 2 persimmons to Yuna and 7 apples to Minyoung.

(The term threedigit is used conditionally: some groups may start with zeros and actually be twodigit or fewer; the leftmost group will not be threedigit if the total number of digits is not a multiple of three.)","output":":  To prove the given divisibility rule for 37, we will show that the resulting sum S obtained by grouping the digits of the number into groups of three, from right to left, gives the same remainder when divided by 37 as the original number n.  We start by observing that the number 999 is divisible by 37, as  [ 999 = 27 times 37.] Thus, proving the divisibility of S and n by 37 reduces to showing that S and n give the same remainder when divided by 999.  To proceed, we consider the number n which can be expressed in terms of its decimal digits. Suppose n is given in its expanded form as:  [ n = a_k 10^{3k} + a_{k-1} 10^{3(k-1)} + cdots + a_1 10^3 + a_0, ] where a_i are the groups of digits obtained by splitting n into groups of three. This can be represented as the sum  [ n = sum_{i=0}^{k} a_i 10^{3i}. ] The key observation here is that 10^3 = 1000 equiv 1 pmod{999}. Thus, each power of 10^3 is congruent to 1 modulo 999, meaning:  [ 10^{3i} equiv 1^i equiv 1 pmod{999}. ] Therefore, substituting these congruences back into our expression for n gives: [ n equiv a_k cdot 1 + a_{k-1} cdot 1 + cdots + a_1 cdot 1 + a_0 pmod{999}, ] which simplifies to: [ n equiv a_k + a_{k-1} + cdots + a_1 + a_0 pmod{999}. ] This sum of the groups, S: [ S = a_k + a_{k-1} + cdots + a_1 + a_0, ] is therefore congruent to n modulo 999: [ S equiv n pmod{999}. ] Since 999 is divisible by 37, if S is divisible by 37, then n must also be divisible by 37, and vice versa. Hence, the rule is proven. Both the number n and the sum S of its three-digit groups will have the same remainder when divided by 37.

Let's break down the solution step by step. 1. **Symmetry of f(x)**: The given condition f(-x) = 2 - f(x) can be rearranged to show that f(x) + f(-x) = 2. This indicates that the function f(x) is symmetric about the point (0,1) on the graph. In other words, for every point (x, f(x)) on the graph, there is a corresponding point (-x, 2 - f(x)) that maintains this symmetry. 2. **Symmetry of y=frac{x+1}{x}**: The function y=frac{x+1}{x} simplifies to y=1+frac{1}{x}. This graph is also symmetric about the point (0,1), meaning that for every point (x, y) on this graph, there is a corresponding point (-x, 2-y) that maintains the symmetry. 3. **Intersection Points**: Given the symmetry of both graphs about the same point, we can deduce that if (x_{1}, y_{1}) is an intersection point, then (-x_{1}, 2-y_{1}) is also an intersection point. This applies to all intersection points (x_{i}, y_{i}). 4. **Sum of Coordinates**: We are interested in finding sum_{i=1}^m(x_{i}+y_{i}), which can be expanded as (x_{1}+y_{1}) + (x_{2}+y_{2}) + ldots + (x_{m}+y_{m}). Given the symmetry and the fact that for each (x_{i}, y_{i}), there is a corresponding (-x_{i}, 2-y_{i}), we can pair each term with its symmetric counterpart. 5. **Calculation**: The sum can be rewritten as frac{1}{2}[(x_{1}+y_{1}) + (-x_{1}+2-y_{1}) + (x_{2}+y_{2}) + (-x_{2}+2-y_{2}) + ldots + (x_{m}+y_{m}) + (-x_{m}+2-y_{m})]. Simplifying this expression, we notice that each pair (x_{i}+y_{i}) + (-x_{i}+2-y_{i}) simplifies to 2. Since there are m pairs, the sum simplifies to m.

To find out how many minutes apart each stop is, we divide the total time by the number of intervals between the stops. Since there are 6 stops, there are 5 intervals between them (because the intervals are between each pair of consecutive stops).

From these, we can determine the angular velocity, omega, using the formula omega = frac{2pi}{T}. Substituting the given value of T: [ omega = frac{2pi}{3} ] When t = 0, the point P is at the lowest point of the Ferris wheel, which means the height y above the ground is 0. Substituting the given values into the equation y = Asin(omega t + varphi) + b: [ 0 = 50sin(varphi) + 50 ] This simplifies to sin(varphi) = -1, which implies varphi = -frac{pi}{2}, considering varphi in [-pi, pi]. Therefore, substituting A = 50, omega = frac{2pi}{3}, and varphi = -frac{pi}{2} into the equation, we get: [ y = 50sinleft(frac{2pi}{3}t - frac{pi}{2}right) + 50 = -50cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}tright) + 50 ] Thus, the analytical expression of y with respect to t is: [ y = f(t) = -50cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}tright) + 50 ] # Part 2: Time for Best Visual Effect Given that the best visual effect is achieved when the height above the ground reaches 85 meters, we set f(t) geqslant 85: [ -50cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}tright) + 50 geqslant 85 ] Solving for cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}tright), we find: [ cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}tright) leqslant -frac{7}{10} ] Given t in [0, 3), we solve for t: [ arccosleft(-frac{7}{10}right) leqslant frac{2pi}{3}t leqslant 2pi - arccosleft(-frac{7}{10}right) ] This leads to: [ frac{3}{2pi}arccosleft(-frac{7}{10}right) leqslant t leqslant frac{3}{2pi}left[2pi - arccosleft(-frac{7}{10}right)right] ] Therefore, the time for visitors to have the best visual effect is: [ t = 3 - frac{3}{pi}arccosleft(-frac{7}{10}right) text{ minutes} ] Encapsulating the final answer: [ boxed{t = 3 - frac{3}{pi}arccosleft(-frac{7}{10}right) text{ minutes}} ]"},{"instruction":"On May 21, 2023, the main campus of the Parent School in Yancheng officially started the May classroom, with a live broadcast reaching 105,000 viewers.

Thus, we have: [ left{begin{array}{l} 7-a > 0  a geq 0 end{array}right. ] Solving these inequalities, we find: [ 0 leq a < 7 ] **Step 2: Solving the Fractional Equation** Given the fractional equation frac{6x}{x-1}=3+frac{ax}{x-1}, we simplify it to find the value of x in terms of a: [ frac{6x}{x-1} - frac{ax}{x-1} = 3 ] [ frac{6x - ax}{x-1} = 3 ] [ frac{(6-a)x}{x-1} = 3 ] Setting the numerators equal since the denominators are the same, we get: [ (6-a)x = 3(x-1) ] Solving for x, we find: [ x = frac{3}{a-3} ] **Step 3: Ensuring x is an Integer** For x to be an integer, and given x neq 1 to avoid division by zero in the original equation, we examine the denominator a-3. The numerator 3 is fixed, so for x to be an integer, a-3 must be a divisor of 3. Considering the range of a from Step 1 (0 leq a < 7), the possible values of a that make x an integer are a=0, 2, and 4. **Conclusion:** The number of integers a that satisfy all conditions is 3.

The lowest possible winning score is calculated by the sum of the four lowest positions, which are ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 ). The highest possible winning score is just one less than half of the total score, which is ( 18 - 1 = 17 ) (because 18 would mean a tie).  We need to check if scores from 10 to 17 are achievable: - For scores 10, 11, ..., 17, we can easily create configurations by increasing the highest number in the winning team's score from ( 4 ) upwards (as done in 1 + 2 + 3 + 5, 1 + 2 + 3 + 6, etc., up to 1 + 2 + 3 + 9). - Each set of positions chosen for one team uniquely determines the positions of the other team, ensuring there are no ties.

The tiling with cubes, often referred to as a cubic lattice, is straightforward since cubes naturally tessellate in three dimensions without leaving any gaps. 2. **Transforming Cubes into Rhombic Dodecahedra:**    To proceed further, consider subdividing parts of this cubic lattice. Specifically, select one cube in the center and leave it intact. Surround this central cube with adjacent cubes in the lattice.  3. **Subdividing Surrounding Cubes:**    For the surrounding cubes, imagine slicing these \\"framing\\" cubes with planes that pass through all six pairs of opposite edges. This slicing results in each surrounding cube being divided into six congruent pyramids. Each pyramid has a square base (since the original cube's faces are squares) and lateral edges that are equal to half the cross-diagonal of the cube. 4. **Formation of Rhombic Dodecahedron:**    The pyramids that adjoin the central cube combine with the central cube itself to form a geometric shape known as a rhombic dodecahedron. Specifically, the edges of the central cube serve as the principal diagonals of the faces of the rhombic dodecahedron.         Each face of the rhombic dodecahedron is a rhombus, with the diagonals meeting at equal lengths, confirming the structure as a rhombic dodecahedron. 5. **Filling Space with Rhombic Dodecahedra:**    By repeating the above process for each cube in the original cubic lattice, it becomes clear that the entire space can be tessellated or filled using rhombic dodecahedra. Hence, it is demonstrated that space can indeed be filled with rhombic dodecahedral cells. 6. **Volume Relation:**    As a consequence of this transformation, it is also evident that the volume of each rhombic dodecahedron is equal to double the volume of a cube, where the cube's edge corresponds to the shorter diagonal of the face of the rhombic dodecahedron. This relation helps in understanding the volume properties of these geometric shapes. # Conclusion: Thus, it has been shown through geometric construction and analysis that space can be completely filled using cells in the form of rhombic dodecahedra. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"The minimum value of the distance from a point on the curve y=e^{x}+1 to the line xy2=0 is: A: 3 B: sqrt{2} C: 2 D: 2sqrt{2}","output":"To find the minimum distance from a point on the curve y=e^{x}+1 to the line x-y-2=0, we follow these steps: 1. **Identify a Point on the Curve**: Let's consider a point P(x_{0}, e^{x_{0}}+1) on the curve y=e^{x}+1. 2. **Find the Condition for Minimum Distance**: The distance from point P to the line x-y-2=0 is minimized when the tangent line at P is parallel to the line y=x-2. The slope of the line y=x-2 is 1. 3. **Calculate the Derivative of the Curve**: The derivative of y=e^{x}+1 with respect to x is y'=e^{x}. This derivative represents the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve. 4. **Set the Slope of the Tangent Equal to the Slope of the Line**: To find the point where the tangent is parallel to the line y=x-2, we set e^{x_{0}}=1 because the slope of the tangent line must equal 1. 5. **Solve for x_{0}**: Solving e^{x_{0}}=1 gives x_{0}=0. 6. **Find the Coordinates of the Point of Tangency**: Substituting x_{0}=0 into the equation of the curve, we get the point of tangency as (0, e^{0}+1) = (0, 2). 7. **Calculate the Distance from the Point of Tangency to the Line**: The distance d from a point (x_{1}, y_{1}) to a line Ax+By+C=0 is given by d=frac{|Ax_{1}+By_{1}+C|}{sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}}.

Given that the compound has 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 carbon atom, we can calculate the total weight of these atoms: Weight of hydrogen atoms = 2 * 1 = 2 Weight of carbon atom = 1 * 12 = 12 Now, we subtract the total weight of hydrogen and carbon from the molecular weight of the compound to find the weight of the oxygen atoms: Weight of oxygen atoms = Molecular weight of compound - (Weight of hydrogen atoms + Weight of carbon atom) Weight of oxygen atoms = 62 - (2 + 12) Weight of oxygen atoms = 62 - 14 Weight of oxygen atoms = 48 Now, we divide the weight of the oxygen atoms by the atomic weight of oxygen to find the number of oxygen atoms: Number of oxygen atoms = Weight of oxygen atoms / Atomic weight of oxygen Number of oxygen atoms = 48 / 16 Number of oxygen atoms = 3 Therefore, the compound contains boxed{3}  oxygen atoms."},{"instruction":"36 people { a 1 , a 2 … a 36 } meet and shake hands in a circular fashion . in other words , there are totally 36 handshakes involving the pairs , { a 1 , a 2 } , { a 2 , a 3 } , … , { a 35 , a 36 } , { a 36 , a 1 } . then size of the smallest set of people such that the rest have shaken hands with at least one person in the set","output":"The smallest set of people such that the rest have shaken hands with at least one person in the set is 2.

To ensure that the rest have shaken hands with at least one person in the set, we need to select people who are not adjacent to each other. If we select person a1, then a2 and a36 have already shaken hands with someone in the set. We can skip a2 and a3 because they have already shaken hands with a1. The next person we can select is a4, which covers a3 and a5. Continuing this pattern, we can select every third person in the circle to ensure that all people have shaken hands with someone in the set. However, since there are 36 people, we can optimize this by selecting two people who are adjacent to each other, such as a1 and a2. This way, a1 covers a36 and a2, and a2 covers a1 and a3. Then, a3 will cover a2 and a4, and so on, until a36, which covers a35 and a1. By selecting a1 and a2, we ensure that every person in the circle has shaken hands with at least one person in the set.

This implies:   - When x < 1, f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is strictly decreasing.   - When x > 1, f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is strictly increasing.      In this scenario, f(x) can have at most two zeros, which contradicts the requirement of having 3 distinct zeros. - **Case ②:** For 0 < a < frac{e}{2}, solving f'(x) = 0 gives x = 1 or x = ln(2a) < 1. The function's behavior can be summarized as follows:   - For x in (-infty, ln(2a)), f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is increasing.   - At x = ln(2a), f(x) reaches a maximum.   - For x in (ln(2a), 1), f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is decreasing.   - At x = 1, f(x) reaches a minimum.   - For x in (1, +infty), f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is increasing again.

Analyzing g(t), we find: - For t in (0, 1), g'(t) > 0, so g(t) is strictly increasing. - For t in (-infty, 0), g'(t) < 0, so g(t) is strictly decreasing. Thus, g(t) geqslant g(0) = 0, with equality only when a = frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the solution set for a is (0, frac{1}{2}) cup (frac{1}{2}, e-2), ensuring f(x) has 3 distinct zeros.

Is it necessarily possible to assign a natural number to each point such that the number on each arrow equals the product of the numbers at its endpoints?","output":"1. **Induction Base Case:**    Consider the simplest case where the product of the numbers on all arrows is 1. This is equivalent to the scenario where the number on each arrow is 1. For this setup, we can place the number 1 at each point, and the condition of the problem will be satisfied. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:**    Assume that for any product of the numbers on the arrows less than a given number n, it is possible to assign natural numbers to each point such that the number on each arrow equals the product of the numbers at its ends. 3. **Induction Step:**    Let's consider the product of the numbers on the arrows to be n > 1. Let p be an arbitrary prime divisor of n. We know that p divides the number on some arrow from point A to point B.    To advance our proof, we need to show that either:    - the numbers on all arrows originating from A are divisible by p, or     - the numbers on all arrows ending at B are divisible by p.    Let's assume the contrary: there is an arrow from A to point C, the number on which is not divisible by p, and an arrow from point D to B, the number on which is also not divisible by p. 4. **Contradiction:**    Consider a closed path A rightarrow B rightarrow D rightarrow C rightarrow A. By the problem's condition, the product of the numbers on the arrows in the direction of movement (from A to B and from D to C) must equal the product of the numbers in the opposite direction (from D to B and from A to C). However, this results in a contradiction because:    - the product involving A to B and D to C is divisible by p,    - while the product involving D to B and A to C is not divisible by p. 5. **Conclusion from Contradiction:**    Since we reach a contradiction, we conclude that either all numbers on arrows from A are divisible by p, or all numbers on arrows to B are divisible by p. 6. **Reducing the Problem:**    Suppose all numbers on all arrows from A are divisible by p. Divide these numbers by p. Consider the new configuration. By the induction hypothesis, we know that with this reduced product, we can assign values to each point such that the numbers on the arrows follow the problem's condition.    After solving for this reduced problem, increase the number at point A by a factor of p, which maintains the structure required by the problem since we accounted for p in each arrow's multiplication.    If instead all numbers on arrows to B are divisible by p, a similar argument applies by dividing and increasing the number at B by a factor of p after solving the reduced problem using the induction hypothesis.    This completes the induction step. Thus, we have demonstrated through induction that no matter the product of numbers on the arrows, it is always possible to accurately assign natural numbers to each point to satisfy the condition. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Obligatory}} ]"},{"instruction":"A restaurant makes some more pizzas than hot dogs every day.

We are given that H = 60 and that the total number of pizzas and hot dogs made in June is 4800. We also know that June has 30 days, so the total production of pizzas and hot dogs for the month will be 30 times the daily production. The equation representing the total production in June is: 30(P + H) = 4800 We know H is 60, so we can substitute that into the equation: 30(P + 60) = 4800 Now, let's solve for P: 30P + 30(60) = 4800 30P + 1800 = 4800 30P = 4800 - 1800 30P = 3000 P = 3000 / 30 P = 100 So the restaurant makes 100 pizzas every day.

Base Step 1. **First question (k=1):**    - If ( T leq S - n ):      - At the first question, A is asked if he knows ( n ).      - If ( T leq S - n ), then ( T leq m ) where ( T = m+n-x ) for some ( x ).      - A can deduce that ( n leq x leq 0 ). Since ( n ) is positive, this is impossible.      - Therefore, ( T ) must actually be ( S = m+n ), and hence A knows the answer. 2. **Second question (k=1):**    - If ( T geq S + n ):      - At the second question, B is asked if he knows ( m ).      - If ( T geq S + n ), then ( T ) is the number such that ( n leq T - S leq T - m ).      - B can deduce that ( m leq x leq 0 ). Since ( m ) is positive, this is impossible.      - Hence, ( T ) must actually be ( S ) and B knows ( m ). Thus, the claim holds for ( k=1 ).  Inductive Step Suppose the claim holds for some integer ( k ). We will show it also holds for ( k+1 ): 3. **Question ( 2k+1 ):**    - Suppose ( T leq S - frac{n}{k+1} ):      - At question ( 2k+1 ), A is asked if he knows ( n ).      - A considers ( T leq S - frac{n}{k+1} ).

Thus, the claim holds for ( k+1 ).  Conclusion By induction, we have shown that for any ( k ): - A knows the answer at question ( 2k-1 ) if ( T leq S - frac{n}{k} ). - B knows the answer at question ( 2k ) if ( T geq S + frac{n}{k} ). Since there exist positive integers ( k ) such that ( T leq S - frac{n}{k} ) or ( T geq S + frac{n}{k} ), one player will eventually deduce the other player's number after a finite number of questions. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"my drawer, I have 13 distinguishable socks: 5 white, 5 brown, and 3 blue.

Let's break it down step-by-step. 1. First, use the logarithm properties: log_{10} (2007^{2006} times 2006^{2007}) = 2006 log_{10}(2007) + 2007 log_{10}(2006)  2.

Using a similar induction argument as above, we can show that:     [     b_{i+1} = b_i + b_{i-1}     ]     and thus, ( b_{i+1} geq b_i ). 7. **Combining Both Sequences:**     Next, note that the equations hold:     [     a_{i+1} = a_i + a_{i-1}     ]     [     b_{i+1} = b_i + b_{i-1}     ]     Let us continue these sequences and prove by induction that ( a_i < b_i leq a_{i+1} ):     - For ( i = 1 ), ( a_2 = b_1 > a_1 ).     - For ( i = 2 ), the inequalities hold as ( b_{0} = a_{0}, b_{1} = a_{2} ).     - For ( i geq 3 ), by induction hypothesis ( a_{i-2} < b_{i-2} < b_{i-1} leq a_i ) implies:     [     a_i = a_{i-1} + a_{i-2} < b_{i-1} + b_{i-2} = b_i leq a_i + a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}     ] 8. **Final Contradiction:**     Hence, we have:     [     d = a_0 = b_0 leq a_1 < b_1 leq a_2 < b_2 leq ldots     ]     which implies that the equality ( b_l = a_k ) is possible only if ( k = l+1 ). Thus, the total number of numbers would be ( k + l = 2l + 1 ), which cannot be 300, as 300 is even. # Conclusion:      Therefore, it is impossible to arrange 300 positive numbers in such a way that each number, except one, equals the difference of its neighbors.

The product of the numbers rolled is given as 7776. Additionally, the largest number rolled occurs only once. 2. **Prime factorize the given product (7776):**    [    7776 = 2^5 times 3^5    ]     3. **Determine possible number distributions:**    Each die rolled must be a number between 1 and 6. We need to distribute the prime factors (2^5 times 3^5) amongst these numbers such that their product is 7776. Let's consider the prime factors distribution:    Any number on a die can be written in the form (2^a times 3^b) where (a) and (b) are non-negative integers. 4. **Find the largest possible number that meets the condition of appearing only once:**    Given the constraints of the largest number appearing only once, we should seek out the highest possible    value within the limit of dice numbers:        - The largest number we can possibly achieve on a die using the factors 2 and 3 is (6 = 2^1 times 3^1).    - Using factors of (2^5 times 3^5), the highest factor should be (3^5).

The total production for the month was 8,000 cars, so we can write the equation: [ x + 4x + 1.5x = 8000 ] Combining like terms, we get: [ 6.5x = 8000 ] Now, we can solve for ( x ) by dividing both sides of the equation by 6.5: [ x = frac{8000}{6.5} ] [ x = 1230.7692 ] Since the number of cars produced cannot be a fraction, we round the number to the nearest whole number: [ x approx 1231 ] So, the second shift produced approximately 1231 cars.

However, since four digits need to be different, we must subtract the instances where this result is the same as any of the first three digits. Assuming no repeating values, this gives a single unique result each time naturally. Step 5: Calculate total possible numbers The total number of such four-digit numbers is:  [ 4 text{ (choices for 1st digit)} times 5 text{ (choices for 2nd digit)} times 8 text{ (choices for 3rd digit)} times 1 text{ (unique result for 4th digit)} = 4 times 5 times 8 times 1 ] Calculating this product: [ 4 times 5 = 20, quad 20 times 8 = 160, quad 160 times 1 = 160 ] Thus, there are 160 four-digit numbers that satisfy the conditions.

By examining the scenario where Sally is in position 2:    - Positions 3, 4, and 5 remain for Dolly, Kelly, and Elly.    - However, the positioning constraints result in contradictions, making it impossible to satisfy all given conditions. 3. **Analyze Sally sitting in position 3:**    - Dolly cannot be in positions 1 (far left), 2, or 4.    - Dolly would be forced into position 5 (far right), but Elly must sit to the right of Dolly, which is impossible. 4. **Analyze Sally sitting in position 4:**    - Dolly cannot be in position 1 (far left).    - Kelly cannot be in positions 3 or 5 because Kelly cannot sit next to Sally.    - Therefore, position 1 (far left) is the only position left for Kelly.        With Sally in position 4, we can place:    - Kelly in position 1.    - Dolly in position 2 (ensuring Elly can be to the right of Dolly).    - Molly cannot sit in position 5 (far right), so she must be in position 3.    - Finally, Elly must sit in position 5 (far right). 5. **Conclusion:**    - Elly is the only person who can sit at the far right position 5.

Find the product of all possible values of ( n ).","output":"The problem is to determine the product of all possible values of n when a round cake is cut into n pieces using 3 straight cuts. 1. **Understanding the cuts:**    - With zero cuts, the cake remains whole: n = 1.    - With one cut, it divides the cake into 2 pieces: n = 2.    - With two cuts, you can create up to 4 pieces (depending on how the cuts intersect).    - With three cuts, you can create a maximum of 7 pieces depending on the positions and intersections of the cuts. 2. **Range of possible values for n:**    - The minimum number of pieces with 3 cuts is achieved when the cuts do not intersect at all, which results in: n = 4.    - The maximum number of pieces with 3 cuts is achieved when all cuts intersect in such a way that maximizes the number of pieces. For 3 cuts, this is the maximum configuration yielding: n = 7.    Specifically, the maximum number of pieces created by k cuts using optimal positioning (due to combinatorial geometry) is given by:    [    n = frac{k(k+1)}{2} + 1    ]    Plugging in ( k = 3 ):    [    n = frac{3(3+1)}{2} + 1 = frac{12}{2} + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7    ] 3. **Values within the range:**    - All intermediate values between the minimum and maximum are also achievable by different placements of cuts.    - Thus, the possible values of n when the cake is cut with 3 cuts are 4, 5, 6, and 7. 4. **Product of all possible values:**    - Calculate the product of 4, 5, 6, and 7:    [    4 times 5 times 6 times 7    ]    Breaking down the calculation:    [    4 times 5 = 20    ]    [    20 times 6 = 120    ]    [    120 times 7 = 840    ] 5. **Conclusion:**    The product of all possible values of n when a round cake is cut into n pieces with 3 cuts is:    [    boxed{840}    ]"},{"instruction":"Using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, form several sevendigit numbers without repeating any digits.

Given that ( a_6 neq 0 ), and ( a_i ) (for ( i = 0, 1, cdots, 6 )) are digits taken from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. 2. Define ( A = a_6 + a_4 + a_2 + a_0 ) and ( B = a_5 + a_3 + a_1 ). We also know that the sum of all the digits from 0 to 6 is:     [     0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21     ] 3. Therefore, the equation for the sum of digits translates to:     [     A + B = 21     ] 4. A number that is divisible by 55 must be divisible by both 11 and 5. We take into account the divisibility rule for 11, which requires:     [     |A - B| = 11k     ]     Here ( k ) is an integer, natural number, or zero. 5. Given the constraints ( |A - B| < 21 ) and ( A - B neq 0 ), the possibilities for ( k ) are limited. The only suitable value is ( k = 1 ), hence:     [     |A - B| = 11     ] 6. Based on the above equation, we have two scenarios:     [     A - B = 11 quad text{or} quad B - A = 11     ]     Since ( A + B = 21 ), we solve for both:     - If ( A - B = 11 ):         [         A + B = 21 implies A = 16, , B = 5         ]     - If ( B - A = 11 ):         [         A + B = 21 implies B = 16, , A = 5 implies text{not possible since } A > B         ] 7. Thus, we have ( A = 16 ) and ( B = 5 ). 8. We now need to form ( B = 5 ) using any three digits from the set ( {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ) excluding the digits used in ( A ). Since ( A ) is composed of four digits that add to 16, it uses the highest four digits: ( 2, 3, 5, 6 ). 9.

The point ( M ) is an arbitrary point on the arc ( AC ), and we know that the diameters ( AB ) and ( CD ) are perpendicular. 2. To simplify our work, we rotate the triangle ( AMB ) around the center ( O ) by ( 90^circ ) so that the point ( A ) moves to the point ( C ). Since the angle ( angle AMB ) is right, point ( M ) will move to some point ( E ) on the circle such that ( CE parallel MB ). This is due to the fact that by rotating ( AM ) by ( 90^circ ), which is perpendicular to ( MB ), it will map to ( CE ), which is parallel to ( MB ). 3. Consequently, quadrilateral ( MBEC ) is an isosceles trapezoid, meaning ( angle MBE = angle BMC ). Given that ( angle BMC ) is an inscribed angle standing on the arc ( BC ), which is ( 90^circ ), we have: [ angle BMC = angle MBE = 45^circ. ] 4. Now, let's drop perpendiculars from ( C ) and ( E ) to the line ( MB ), meeting ( MB ) at points ( K ) and ( P ), respectively. Since ( angle MBE = 45^circ ), the projection lengths can be calculated using trigonometric principles.

This means that it is possible for one of the triangles formed by the centroid and two of the vertices to contain O. Let's consider that this is the case for triangle SAB. 3. **Triangle Inequalities Involving Medians:** Since triangle SAB contains triangle OAB, we have: [ SA + SB geq OA + OB ] with equality only if O coincides with S. 4. **Lengths of Medians and the Circumradius:** The segment between a vertex of a triangle and the opposite midpoint, i.e., the median, is frac{2}{3} of the distance from the vertex to the centroid. Therefore, applying this property: [ frac{2}{3}s_a + frac{2}{3}s_b geq 2R quad Rightarrow quad s_a + s_b geq 3R ] 5. **Considering the Remaining Median (s_c):** We now analyze the position of O relative to the median s_c: - If O = C_1, then clearly CO = CC_1. - If O neq C_1, then the perpendicular bisector of the segment OC_1 intersects the interior of triangle ABC. This implies C is closer to O than C_1: [ s_c geq r ] 6. **Combining Inequalities:** Adding the inequalities for the medians s_a, s_b, and s_c, we get: [ s_a + s_b + s_c geq 3R + R = 4R ] However, equality cannot hold as O cannot simultaneously be identical with two points, say S and C_1. **Comments:** - The condition that triangle ABC must not be obtuse is crucial. If the triangle were slightly over 90^circ, the inequality would not be precise. - For an obtuse triangle, the sum of the medians is less than four times the circumradius. **Additional Remarks:** 1. **Exact Maximum Bound for General Triangles:** For any triangle, the sum of the medians can at most be 4.5 times the circumradius. This bound is attained for equilateral triangles. 2. **Three-dimensional Generalization:** The sum of the medians of a tetrahedron is less than or equal to frac{16}{3} times the circumradius of the circumscribed sphere. If a tetrahedron contains its circumcenter, this sum is strictly greater than 4 times the circumradius.

This transformation allows us to analyze the behavior of m as a function of x. 2. **Analyzing the Function m(x)**: The function m(x)=x-frac{1}{x} is defined for x in (1,3), excluding the endpoints. We need to analyze how this function behaves within this interval to understand the possible values of m. 3. **Behavior of m(x) on (1,3)**: The function m(x) is increasing on the interval (1,3). This is because the derivative of m(x) with respect to x, which is m'(x)=1+frac{1}{x^2}, is always positive for x in (1,3). Therefore, as x increases from 1 to 3, m(x) also increases. 4. **Calculating the Range of m**: Since m(x) is increasing on (1,3), the minimum value of m occurs at x=1 and the maximum value occurs at x=3. Substituting these values into m(x)=x-frac{1}{x}, we get: - At x=1, m(1)=1-frac{1}{1}=0. - At x=3, m(3)=3-frac{1}{3}=frac{8}{3}.

This means B only has to cover ( (1 - 0.43333333333333335)L ) or ( 0.5666666666666667L ) of the race. Since time is the same for both A and B to finish the race, we can equate the time it takes for A to run the entire length L to the time it takes for B to run the remaining ( 0.5666666666666667L ) of the race. The time it takes for A to run the race is ( frac{L}{v_a} ), and the time it takes for B to run the race is ( frac{0.5666666666666667L}{v_b} ).

The derivative of the function is f'(x)=e^{x}-2. Let f'(x)=0, then x=ln 2. When x < ln 2, f'(x) < 0; when x > ln 2, f'(x) > 0. Therefore, f(x) is a decreasing function on (-infty,ln 2) and an increasing function on (ln 2,+infty). When x=ln 2, the function attains its minimum value f(ln 2)=2-2ln 2. Since 2-2ln 2 > 0, it follows that f(x) > 0 always holds. Solution (2): From the problem, we have f'(x)=e^{x}-2a. Let f'(x)=0 and a > frac {1}{2}, we get x=ln 2a > 0. When a > frac {1}{2}, let M(a)=2a-ln 2a. The derivative of M(a) is M'(a)=2- frac {2}{2a}= frac {2a-1}{a} > 0. Therefore, M(a) is increasing on (frac {1}{2},+infty). Also, M(frac {1}{2})=1-ln 1=1, so M(a)=2a-ln 2a > 0 always holds. That is, when a > frac {1}{2}, 2a > ln 2a. Therefore, when 0leqslant x < ln 2a, f'(x) < 0 and f(x) is decreasing; when ln 2a < xleqslant 2a, f'(x) > 0 and f(x) is increasing. Hence, f(x) attains its minimum value 2a(1-ln 2a) at x=ln 2a. Furthermore, f(0)=e^{0}-0=1 and f(2a)=e^{2a}-4a^{2}. Let h(a)=f(2a)-f(0)=e^{2a}-4a^{2}-1. When a > frac {1}{2}, h'(a)=2e^{2a}-8a > 0. h(frac {1}{2})=e-1-1=e-2 > 0, so h(a)=e^{2a}-4a^{2}-1 > 0.

Sum these results: [ 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + yz + zx) = 20 + 8 + 12 = 40 ] 11. Therefore: [ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + yz + zx = frac{40}{2} = 20 ] 12.

Thus, the only combination that can give us the term with x^3 is: [ (-4x)(-4x) = 16x^2 ] However, as this is a mistake in calculation (I computed x^2 term), let’s correct it.

If the supermarket wants to make a profit of at least 2000 yuan per day, how many boxes of yuanxiao must be sold per day at least?","output":"# Problem Solution: Part 1: Functional Relationship between Daily Sales Volume y and Selling Price per Box x Given that at a selling price of 25 yuan per box, the supermarket sells 250 boxes per day. For every 1 yuan increase in the selling price, 10 fewer boxes are sold. Thus, we can establish the relationship as follows: - When the price is 25 yuan, y = 250 boxes. - For each 1 yuan increase in price, the number of boxes sold decreases by 10. Therefore, the change in the number of boxes sold can be represented as -10(x - 25). Incorporating this into the equation for y, we get: y = 250 - 10(x - 25) = 250 - 10x + 250 = -10x + 500 Thus, the functional relationship is y = -10x + 500. Part 2: Maximizing Daily Sales Profit P The profit P for selling each box can be calculated as the selling price per box minus the cost per box, multiplied by the number of boxes sold. The cost per box is 20 yuan, so the profit per box is (x - 20). The total profit P is then: P = (x - 20)(-10x + 500) = -10x^2 + 700x - 10000 To find the maximum profit, we can complete the square for the quadratic equation: P = -10(x^2 - 70x + 1000) = -10[(x - 35)^2 - 1225 + 1000] = -10(x - 35)^2 + 2250 The maximum value of P occurs when (x - 35)^2 = 0, which is when x = 35. Substituting x = 35 into the equation for P gives: P = -10(0) + 2250 = 2250 Therefore, to maximize daily sales profit, the selling price per box should be set at 35 yuan, resulting in a maximum profit of boxed{2250} yuan. Part 3: Selling Boxes to Achieve a Profit of at Least 2000 Yuan Given the profit equation P = -10(x - 35)^2 + 2250 and the requirement for a profit of at least 2000 yuan, we set P geq 2000: -10(x - 35)^2 + 2250 geq 2000 -10(x - 35)^2 geq -250 (x - 35)^2 leq 25 Solving for x, we find that x = 30 or x = 40. However, the selling price per box must not exceed 38 yuan, so 30 leq x leq 38. To find the minimum number of boxes that must be sold, we use the highest price within the allowed range, which is 38 yuan. Substituting x = 38 into the equation for y gives: y = -10 times 38 + 500 = -380 + 500 = 120 Therefore, to achieve a profit of at least 2000 yuan per day under the price restriction, the supermarket must sell at least boxed{120} boxes of yuanxiao per day."},{"instruction":"Find the integer n, 0 le n le 9, that satisfies [n equiv 4229 pmod{10}.]","output":"1.

Finding the minimum value of y on this circle corresponds to finding the lowest point on the circle, which is vertically under the center: y_{min} = 10 - sqrt{325} Substituting the radius: y_{min} = 10 - sqrt{325} y_{min} = 10 - 5sqrt{13} Thus, the minimum value of y is boxed{10 - 5sqrt{13}}.

We start by leveraging the classic approach applying the properties of the game and specific calculations. Step-by-Step Analysis and Verification: 1. **Characters of Position P**: According to Proposition 3.1.7: - If the move options from a position x in V are empty, ( C(x) = emptyset ), then ( x in P ). This is true since in terminal positions, where no further moves can be made, it results in a loss for the player making a move. Thus, the position (0, ldots, 0) is clearly in P because no move can be made, and it's represented as: [ 0 oplus 0 oplus ldots oplus 0 = 0. ] 2. **Verification of Winning Positions N**: - Consider the position ( left( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n right) ) where ( x_1 oplus x_2 oplus ldots oplus x_n = s neq 0 ). To move to a losing position (P-position), one must convert the current position to some ( left( y_1, y_2, ldots, y_n right) ) where ( y_j = x_j ) except for one ( y_k ) such that ( y_k = x_k oplus s ). Thus: [ x_1 oplus x_2 oplus ldots oplus y_k oplus ldots oplus x_n = s oplus s = 0 ] by the properties of the XOR operation, specifically the property that ( a oplus a = 0 ). 3. **Validation of Losing Positions P**: - Suppose we are currently in a losing position, where (bigoplus_{i=1}^n x_i = 0). From any such position, we will try to ensure the next position cannot yet be losing. Assume there exists some ( k, y_k < x_k ) such that: [ x_1 oplus x_2 oplus ldots oplus y_k oplus ldots oplus x_n = 0. ] Simplifying the equation yields: [ x_k oplus y_k = 0 implies y_k = x_k. ] This contradicts the assumption ( y_k < x_k ). Hence, such a move from position ( P ) leads to positions being winning for the opponent. 4. **Conclusion about Strategy**: Based on the definition, a position ( left( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n right) ) is of type P if and only if (bigoplus_{i=1}^n x_i = 0 ).

If we assume the triangle sides are in a simple proportion (e.g., 3:4:5 ratio, but scaled differently), let's estimate h: 6u:2:sqrt{36u^2+4}. The ratio 6:2 simplifies to 3:1. If this were a 3:1:k triangle, then k = sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{10}, meaning h should be sqrt{10} times the length unit used (here, u = log_3 2), so: h = sqrt{36u^2 + 4} = sqrt{10} h = log_3 3^{sqrt{10}} = sqrt{10}. Thus, the hypotenuse h = sqrt{10}, and therefore: 3^h = 3^{sqrt{10}}.

Therefore, it must pass through the midpoint of AC and be perpendicular to AC. 3. **Finding Midpoint D of AC**: The midpoint of AC can be calculated straightforwardly given the lengths. If AC is taken as the hypotenuse, then D exactly bisects it, meaning D is at 6.5 inches from either A or C along AC. 4. **Distance from D to B (the Crease Length)**: To find the length of the crease, we need to measure from D to B, since AC is bisected, and the fold brings the middle of the hypotenuse (D), into alignment with side AB at the point on AC. Since the triangle is being folded symmetrically upon itself, B (being the right-angle vertex) is the point along the crease we measure to. The crease runs from midpoint D to where it hits the base line, which in this symmetric fold, must also be at B. The length of the crease is hence the distance from D to B, which is along the triangle's height from B (which bisects AC). By the properties of the right triangle, and knowing that triangle ABD (formed by the fold) is smaller but similar to triangle ABC, the height to the hypotenuse divides the hypotenuse proportionally. Therefore, the length from D to B (crease length) in inches is calculated by (5+12)/2 - 6.5 = 12 - 6.5 = 5.5. The crease length is 5.5 inches.

Let's proceed step by step: 1. **Sort the numbers:** Assume that the numbers are ordered such that [ a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_n. ] 2. **Construct sums:** We will construct sums in the following manner: - Single element sums: (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) - Two-element sums: (a_1 + a_n, a_2 + a_n, ldots, a_{n-1} + a_n) - Three-element sums: (a_1 + a_{n-1} + a_n, a_2 + a_{n-1} + a_n, ldots, a_{n-2} + a_{n-1} + a_n) - And so on until the final sum: (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n). 3. **Verify the number of unique sums:** To show that all these sums are unique, we'll observe that if we construct sums in this strictly increasing manner, we avoid duplicates. 4. **Number of sums:** - There are n single element sums. - There are n-1 two-element sums. - There are n-2 three-element sums. - And so on until there is 1 sum involving all n elements. 5. **Sum of the number of sums:** We calculate the total number of sums as follows: [ n + (n-1) + (n-2) + cdots + 1 ] This is an arithmetic series with the first term a = 1 and last term l = n, and the number of terms n. The sum of the first n natural numbers can be given by the formula: [ frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] 6. **Result:** Therefore, the total number of unique sums is: [ frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] # Conclusion: In these sums, there are at least frac{n(n+1)}{2} different sums.

It preserves the parallelism of lines but may distort lengths and angles. 3. **Parallel projection of a regular pentagon:** - If we apply a parallel projection to a regular pentagon, the resulting figure will generally become an irregular (non-regular) pentagon. This is because the lengths of sides and diagonals may change due to distortion. However, the parallelism of sides and diagonals will be maintained. 4. **Conclusion in parallel projection:** - Therefore, a non-regular pentagon can be constructed where each diagonal is parallel to one of its sides by applying parallel projection to a regular pentagon. Method 2: Direct Construction through Stretching or Shrinking 1. **Starting with a regular pentagon:** Consider a regular pentagon with all sides and angles equal. 2. **Applying linear transformation:** - Perform a linear transformation that involves stretching or shrinking along one or more axes. For instance, compress the pentagon horizontally or vertically. - Let’s assume we compress the pentagon horizontally. This transformation will change the lengths of sides and diagonals but preserve the parallelism between corresponding sides and diagonals. 3. **Resulting figure:** - After applying the transformation, we obtain an irregular pentagon where: - Some sides are altered in length but keep their relative orientation. - The diagonal that was initially parallel to a specific side in the regular pentagon remains parallel to that side, although their lengths have changed. 4. **Conclusion in stretching or shrinking:** - By applying such a linear transformation, we can easily obtain the required non-regular pentagon where each diagonal is parallel to one side. In conclusion, both methods show that it is indeed possible to construct a non-regular pentagon with the desired properties. Therefore, the claim that there exists a non-regular pentagon where each diagonal is parallel to one of its sides is proven. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Altitudes overline{AD} and overline{BE} of triangle ABC intersect at H.

Let (a, b, c) be three distinct positive integers such that the sum of the reciprocals of any two integers among them is an integral multiple of the reciprocal of the third integer. Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume (a > b > c). 2. We claim that (a = 6), (b = 3), and (c = 2) is a solution. First, we verify that this set satisfies the given conditions: - The sum of the reciprocals of (a) and (b) is (frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} + frac{2}{6} = frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2}), which is an integral multiple of (frac{1}{2}). - The sum of the reciprocals of (a) and (c) is (frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{6} + frac{3}{6} = frac{4}{6} = frac{2}{3}), which is an integral multiple of (frac{1}{3}). - The sum of the reciprocals of (b) and (c) is (frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{2} = frac{2}{6} + frac{3}{6} = frac{5}{6}), which is an integral multiple of (frac{1}{6}). 3. To prove our claim, we need to show that if ((a, b, c) neq (6, 3, 2)), then (a + b + c) is at least 12. Note that (6 + 3 + 2 = 11). 4. Since (a > b > c), we have (frac{1}{a} < frac{1}{b} < frac{1}{c}). This implies (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} < frac{2}{c}). 5. Given that (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b}) is an integral multiple of (frac{1}{c}), we can write: [ frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = k cdot frac{1}{c} ] for some integer (k). Since (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} < frac{2}{c}), it follows that (k = 1), so: [ frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{c} ] 6. Consider the case (c = 2): - If (b = 3), then (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{2}). Solving for (a), we get: [ frac{1}{a} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3} = frac{3 - 2}{6} = frac{1}{6} implies a = 6 ] Thus, ((a, b, c) = (6, 3, 2)), which is our original solution. - If (b = 4), then (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{2}). Solving for (a), we get: [ frac{1}{a} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{4} = frac{2 - 1}{4} = frac{1}{4} implies a = 4 ] This leads to (a = b = 4), which contradicts (a > b). Therefore, (b geq 5), implying (a geq 6). Thus, (a + b + c geq 6 + 5 + 2 = 13). 7. Consider the case (c geq 3): - Then (b geq 4) and (a geq 5). Therefore, (a + b + c geq 5 + 4 + 3 = 12). 8. In both cases, if ((a, b, c) neq (6, 3, 2)), then (a + b + c geq 12). Thus, the smallest sum of three distinct positive integers satisfying the given conditions is (6 + 3 + 2 = 11).

There seems to be a mistake in the given information. Let's re-evaluate the numbers based on the total of 50 chairs. We know that: - Red chairs = 4 - Yellow chairs = 2 * Red chairs = 2 * 4 = 8 - Blue chairs = 3 * Yellow chairs = 3 * 8 = 24 - Green chairs = 1/2 * Blue chairs = 1/2 * 24 = 12 - Orange chairs = Green chairs + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14 Now let's add them up again: 4 (red) + 8 (yellow) + 24 (blue) + 12 (green) + 14 (orange) = 62 chairs The total number of chairs is still 62, which is not the 50 chairs we were initially told. There must be an error in the problem statement. Assuming the relationships between the numbers of chairs of different colors are correct, we need to adjust the total number of chairs to 62. Now, let's calculate how many chairs are left after Lisa and Carla borrow some: Lisa borrows 10% of the total chairs: 10% of 62 chairs = 0.10 * 62 = 6.2 chairs Since we can't have a fraction of a chair, we'll round down to 6 chairs (assuming we round to the nearest whole chair). Remaining chairs after Lisa borrows: 62 chairs - 6 chairs = 56 chairs Carla borrows 1/5 of the remaining chairs: 1/5 of 56 chairs = 56 / 5 = 11.2 chairs Again, rounding to the nearest whole chair, Carla borrows 11 chairs.

This means: - For every coin ( B ) places at position ( x ), ( A ) places a coin at the symmetric position ( -x ) relative to the axis midpoint. 3. **Handling cases where ( B ) places a coin on the axis:** - If ( B ) places a coin on the axis, player ( A ) places their coin at the reflection point over the midpoint. Thus, maintaining symmetry. - Because the initial point is the center and all moves mirror ( B )'s moves, ( A )'s last placed coin will always ensure that none of ( B )'s coins outplay ( A)'s symmetry strategy. 4. **Generalization to centrally symmetric shapes:** - The game can be extended to any shape that is centrally symmetric with the center point being an internal point. - Examples include shapes where every placed point within the shape has a symmetrical counterpart also within the shape, preventing unwanted anomalies like boundary limitations. 5. **Handling different coin sizes:** - The game accommodates coins of different sizes (diameters), ensuring that the symmetric nature of placement is preserved. - ( A ) matches the size of the coin used by ( B ) to avoid violating the symmetry strategy. 6. **Conclusion:** - Based on the placed strategy, player ( A ) always mirrors ( B )'s moves perfectly.

Let the coins be ( A, B, C, D ) with ( E ) being determined from the second session. Then you can choose a combination such as ( B, C, E, X ) where ( X ) represents a coin such as ( A ) or ( D ). The lightest coin in this group might still be a candidate for the median, and this will help identify the one true median coin that remains. Thus, the middle-valued coin among five can be identified after three sessions, as we systematically eliminate those that can't be the median. **Method 2:** A slight variation in the approach: 1. **First Session**: Examine any group of four coins, say ( A, B, C, D ), to find the highest and lowest among them. 2. **Second Session**: Replace the highest valued coin from the first session with the fifth coin (the coin not examined in the first session, say ( E )). Now examine ( B, C, D, E ). This provides more information about which coins might not be the median. 3. **Third Session**: Return to the first set and swap out the lowest valued coin for the fifth coin. This time examine ( A, B, C, E ). This again rules out additional candidates for the least valued coins. Finally, we will be left with only one coin that fits the criteria of being neither the highest nor the lowest in any session, identifying it as the median. To conclude with a concrete result: By following either of these methods, the median valued coin among the five coins can be determined accurately within three sessions. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"A candidate got a certain percentage of the votes polled and he lost to his rival by 2280 votes. There were 7599.999999999999 votes cast. What percentage of votes did the candidate get?","output":"Let's denote the percentage of votes the candidate got as P. Since the candidate lost by 2280 votes, we can say that the rival got P% of the votes plus 2280 votes. The total number of votes cast is 7599.999999999999, but since the number of votes should be a whole number, we can round this to 7600 for calculation purposes. The candidate's votes can be represented as (P/100) * 7600. The rival's votes can be represented as (P/100) * 7600 + 2280. Since the total votes are the sum of the candidate's votes and the rival's votes, we have: (P/100) * 7600 + (P/100) * 7600 + 2280 = 7600 Combining the terms with P gives us: 2 * (P/100) * 7600 + 2280 = 7600 Now, let's solve for P: 2 * (P/100) * 7600 = 7600 - 2280 2 * (P/100) * 7600 = 5320 Now, divide both sides by 2 * 7600 to isolate P: (P/100) = 5320 / (2 * 7600) P = (5320 / (2 * 7600)) * 100 Now, calculate the value of P: P = (5320 / 15200) * 100 P = 0.35 * 100 P = 35 So, the candidate got boxed{35%} of the votes."},{"instruction":"June, the cost per pound of milk powder, coffee, and sugar were the same.

In July, the price changes are as follows: - Coffee increased by 300%, so the new price is x + 300% of x = x + 3x = 4x. - Milk powder decreased by 80%, so the new price is x - 80% of x = x - 0.8x = 0.2x. - Sugar increased by 45%, so the new price is x + 45% of x = x + 0.45x = 1.45x. The mixture in July is made of 40% milk powder, 35% coffee, and 25% sugar. Since the quantities are equal, we can assume that the mixture is made of 1 lb of each component to simplify the calculations. The total cost for 4 lbs of the mixture is 11.70, so the cost for 1 lb of the mixture is 11.70 / 4 = 2.925. The cost of 1 lb of the mixture is the sum of the costs of the individual components, which are in the ratio of 40% milk powder, 35% coffee, and 25% sugar. Therefore, we can write the equation: 0.4(0.2x) + 0.35(4x) + 0.25(1.45x) = 2.925 Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.08x + 1.4x + 0.3625x = 2.925 Combining like terms, we get: 1.8425x = 2.925 Now, we can solve for x: x = 2.925 / 1.8425 x ≈ 1.587 So, the cost per pound of milk powder in June was approximately 1.587. In July, the cost per pound of milk powder dropped by 80%, so the new price is: July milk powder price = 0.2 * 1.587 July milk powder price ≈ 0.3174 Therefore, the cost per pound of milk powder in July was approximately boxed{0.3174} ."},{"instruction":"Given real numbers (theta_{1}, theta_{2}, cdots, theta_{n}) satisfying sin theta_{1} + sin theta_{2} + cdots + sin theta_{n} = 0, prove that left| sin theta_{1} + 2 sin theta_{2} + cdots + n sin theta_{n} right| leqslant left[ frac{n^{2}}{4} right].","output":"We need to prove that for any real numbers (theta_1, theta_2, ldots, theta_n) that satisfy [ sin theta_1 + sin theta_2 + cdots + sin theta_n = 0, ] the following inequality holds: [ left|sin theta_1 + 2 sin theta_2 + cdots + n sin theta_nright| leq leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor. ] 1.

This transformation allows us to analyze the behavior of f(x) relative to e^x in a more manageable way. 1. **Derivative of g(x)**: We calculate the derivative of g(x) as follows: [g'(x) = frac{f'(x)e^x - f(x)e^x}{(e^x)^2} = frac{f'(x) - f(x)}{e^x}.] 2. **Monotonicity of g(x)**: Given that {f'}(x) - f(x) > 0, we substitute this inequality into our expression for g'(x) to find: [g'(x) > 0.] This indicates that g(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}. 3. **Value of g(2023)**: Knowing that f(2023) = e^{2023}, we compute g(2023) as: [g(2023) = frac{f(2023)}{e^{2023}} = frac{e^{2023}}{e^{2023}} = 1.] 4. **Implication for g(x) when x < 2023**: Since g(x) is monotonically increasing and g(2023) = 1, for any x < 2023, it must be that: [g(x) < 1.] 5. **Transforming the Inequality**: We are given the inequality f(ln x) < x.

Thus, assuming three collinear points would mean the straight line passes through these three points which contradicts the fundamental property of a circle (as no straight line can have more than two points from a circle unless the circle degenerates, which is not a common consideration). - Therefore, ( S_1 ) holds true by the definition of a circle. 3. **Analyze ( S_2 )**: - If a straight line intersects a circle, it can do so in at most two points. This is due to the geometric property of circles and lines in Euclidean space where the intersection of a line and a circle is a maximum of two points (this is derived from solving the system of equations of the circle and line which results in a quadratic equation). - Therefore, ( S_2 ) holds true according to the properties of intersections in Euclidean geometry. 4. **Compare ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 )**: - ( S_1 ) says no three points on the circle can be collinear, implying any straight line can intersect the circle in at most two distinct points. - ( S_2 ) directly states the same fact: a line cannot have more than two intersection points with a circle. **Conclusion**: Both statements define the same geometric truth from different perspectives, hence the statements are logically equivalent.

We calculate the probability distribution and expectation of X (the number of inspections) as follows: - **Probability Distribution of X:** (a) For X=2, the probability P(X=2) corresponds to the scenario where the first two products inspected are defective.

This can be calculated as: [ P(X=3) = frac{binom{2}{1}binom{4}{1}}{binom{6}{2}} times frac{1}{4} = frac{2}{15} ] (c) For X=4, the probability P(X=4) can be seen as two scenarios: either finding the second defective product on the fourth inspection after one was found earlier, or all four inspected products are non-defective. This can be calculated as: [ P(X=4) = frac{binom{2}{1}binom{4}{2}}{binom{6}{3}} times frac{1}{3} + frac{binom{4}{4}}{binom{6}{4}} = frac{4}{15} ] (d) For X=5, the probability P(X=5) corresponds to finding the two defective products at the end of five inspections, which can be calculated as: [ P(X=5) = frac{binom{4}{1}binom{2}{1}}{binom{6}{4}} = frac{8}{15} ] - **Expectation of X:** The expectation E(X) is calculated by taking the sum of each value multiplied by its probability: [ E(X) = 2 times frac{1}{15} + 3 times frac{2}{15} + 4 times frac{4}{15} + 5 times frac{8}{15} = frac{64}{15} ] Therefore, the probability distribution of X is: | X | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----| | P | frac{1}{15} | frac{2}{15} | frac{4}{15} | frac{8}{15} | And the expectation is boxed{frac{64}{15}}.

Let the points of tangency be: - ( K ), - ( M ), - ( N ). Given the problem statement: - ( O_1K = O_1N = 1 ), - ( O_2K = O_2M = 2 ), - ( O_3N = O_3M = 3 ). Step 2: Understanding the Tangency Points We know that the point of tangency between two circles is located on the line segment joining their centers. This implies: - ( K ), ( M ), ( N ) are points on the sides of the triangle ( O_1O_2O_3 ). Step 3: Inscribed Circle Insight It is evident that since the equality conditions ( O_1K = O_1N ), ( O_2K = O_2M ), and ( O_3N = O_3M ) hold, these points ( K, M, N ) are exactly the points of tangency of the inscribed circle (incircle) to the triangle ( O_1O_2O_3 ). Hence, the desired circle is the incircle of the triangle ( O_1O_2O_3 ).

These points are on the circumference of the circle. ![Circumcircle and angle](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_d5665cf918a07cfd6450g-1.jpg?height=756&width=1506&top_left_y=259&top_left_x=298) 2. **Find the Locus of the Incircle's Center**: Knowing the radius ( r ) of the incircle, we find the locus of its center ( O_1 ). This locus is given by: - A line parallel to the line segment ( BC ) at a distance of ( r ). - A circle with center on the ( BC ) segment and having an angle of ( 90^circ + frac{alpha}{2} ) subtended at the center. The orientation of the angle ( alpha ) (whether it is acute or obtuse) will determine which segment of the circle ( BC ) is on, and hence where to place the center of the incircle ( O_1 ). 3. **Intersection of Loci**: The intersection of the two loci (parallel line to ( BC ) and circle described above) gives the center ( O_1 ) of the incircle. We can now draw the incircle with radius ( r ). 4. **Construct Tangents from ( B ) and ( C )**: From points ( B ) and ( C ), draw the tangents to the incircle. These tangents will intersect at point ( A ), which is the last vertex of the triangle. 5. **Verify the Triangle**: The tangents drawn should indeed give the triangle with vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) on the circumcircle and tangents intercepted by the circle correctly. We conclude that the triangle satisfying the given conditions can be constructed following these steps. If there exists a solution, generally two solutions will be symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of ( BC ). There could be one solution if the circles are tangential to each other precisely, or no solution if the intersection does not exist. 6. **Condition for Existence of the Triangle**: For the triangle to be constructed under given conditions: - The angle must be within the range ( 0^circ < alpha < 180^circ ). - The radius of the circumcircle must be greater than or equal to ( 2r ).

D: Any two similar triangles are definitely similar.","output":"To analyze each statement for correctness, we proceed as follows: - **Statement A**: It claims that any two right-angled triangles are similar. For two triangles to be similar, their corresponding angles must be congruent, and their corresponding sides must be in proportion. While all right-angled triangles share one angle of 90^circ, the other two angles can vary, leading to different shapes and sizes that do not necessarily have their sides in proportion. Thus, statement A is incorrect. - **Statement B**: This statement suggests that any two rectangles are similar. Similarity in rectangles would require that all corresponding angles are equal (which is true for all rectangles as they have right angles) and that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. However, rectangles can have different aspect ratios (the ratio of length to width), meaning they are not necessarily similar. Therefore, statement B is incorrect. - **Statement C**: It posits that any two rhombuses are similar. Similar to rectangles, for rhombuses to be similar, all angles would need to match, and the sides would need to be in proportion. While all rhombuses have equal sides and their opposite angles are equal, the angles themselves can vary from one rhombus to another, affecting the proportionality of their sides in relation to another rhombus. Hence, statement C is incorrect. - **Statement D**: This statement declares that any two similar triangles are definitely similar. By definition, similar triangles have corresponding angles that are congruent and corresponding sides that are in proportion.

The content of a polynomial is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of its coefficients. Since the coefficients (a), (b), (c), and (d) are integers, dividing by their GCD (which is still an integer and does not change the property that (ad) is odd) will not alter the hypotheses about the roots. 2. **Assume Rational Roots (Contradiction Approach):** Assume that all roots of (P(x)) are rational. Given that (P(x) in mathbb{Z}[x]), any rational root must, by the Rational Root Theorem, be an integer. Hence, our assumption implies that all roots are integers. 3. **Analyze the Parity of Roots:** Since (P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) with (d) being odd, the product of the roots (since (d) is the constant term and also odd) implies that the product of the roots must be odd. For this product to be odd, all roots must themselves be odd integers. 4. **Use Vieta’s Formulas:** By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots taken one at a time is given by (-b/a). Since (a) is non-zero and an integer (specifically non-zero because (a neq 0)), (-b/a) must also be an integer. Given all roots are integers, if all roots are odd, the sum of odd numbers is odd, implying that (-b/a) is odd, hence, (b) must be odd provided (a) is odd. 5. **Check Coefficients for Consistency:** Given also by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is given by (c/a). With (a) as an integer, (c/a) is an integer, implying (c) must be an integer. Specifically, the sum of the product of three odd roots (in pairs) results in an odd product. 6. **Contradiction on (b) and (c):** - From the previous steps, if all roots are odd integers, then (b) (sum of the roots taken one at a time and must be odd) is odd. - The product condition (bc) being even implies (b) and (c) must have opposite parities. Thus, (b) is assumed odd (as established), (c) must be even. - However, we established that both (b) and (c) must be odd which contradicts (bc) being even and (b) and (c) having opposite parity. Given these contradictions, our initial assumption that all roots are rational must be false. Therefore, at least one root of the polynomial (P(x)) must be an irrational number.

The number of divisors ( tau(n) ) of ( n ) is given by: [ tau(n) = (a+1) prod_{i=1}^ell (e_i + 1) ] Substituting this into the original equation, we get: [ 167^a prod_{i=1}^ell p_i^{e_i} = 167 cdot (a+1) cdot prod_{i=1}^ell (e_i + 1) ] 4. To simplify, divide both sides by 167: [ 167^{a-1} prod_{i=1}^ell p_i^{e_i} = (a+1) prod_{i=1}^ell (e_i + 1) ] 5. We need to find the largest ( a ) such that the equation holds. If ( a > 1 ), then ( 167^{a-1} ) would be a large factor on the left-hand side, making it difficult for the right-hand side to match unless the product ( prod_{i=1}^ell (e_i + 1) ) is also very large. This is impractical for large ( a ), so we consider ( a = 1 ): [ 167^0 prod_{i=1}^ell p_i^{e_i} = 2 prod_{i=1}^ell (e_i + 1) ] Simplifying, we get: [ prod_{i=1}^ell p_i^{e_i} = 2 prod_{i=1}^ell (e_i + 1) ] 6. We now need to solve ( m = 2 tau(m) ) for ( m ), where ( m = prod_{i=1}^ell p_i^{e_i} ). We know that ( p nmid m ) for ( p > 5 ), as otherwise ( m > 2 tau(m) ). 7. If ( 3 = p_i ) for some ( i ), then ( e_i = 1 ) by similar logic. Let ( p_1 = 2 ) since ( 2 mid m ). Then ( e_1 ) can be 1, 2, or 3. We check these cases: - If ( e_1 = 1 ), then ( m = 2 cdot prod_{i=2}^ell p_i^{e_i} = 2 cdot 3 = 6 ), but ( 6 neq 2 cdot tau(6) = 2 cdot 4 = 8 ). - If ( e_1 = 2 ), then ( m = 2^2 cdot prod_{i=2}^ell p_i^{e_i} = 4 cdot 3 = 12 ), and ( 12 = 2 cdot tau(12) = 2 cdot 6 = 12 ). - If ( e_1 = 3 ), then ( m = 2^3 = 8 ), and ( 8 = 2 cdot tau(8) = 2 cdot 4 = 8 ). 8. The possible values for ( m ) are 8 and 12. The largest ( n ) is obtained by taking the largest ( m ): [ n = 167 cdot 12 = 2004 ] The final answer is (boxed{2004})."},{"instruction":"Prove that if alpha, beta, and gamma are the angles of a triangle, then cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma < 2","output":"**Reference Solution I** 1.

Find the ratio of the radii of the circumscribed and inscribed circles and determine for which value of alpha this ratio will be the smallest.","output":"Given a right-angled triangle with one of the acute angles denoted as alpha, we need to find the ratio of the circumradius R to the inradius r and determine for which alpha this ratio is minimal. 1. Firstly, consider the formula for the circumradius R of a right-angled triangle. For such a triangle, the circumradius R is half the hypotenuse: [ 2R = text{Hypotenuse} ] 2. Now, consider the formula for the inradius r of the same triangle: [ r = a cot left(frac{alpha}{2}right) + b cot left(frac{pi}{4} - frac{alpha}{2}right) ] where a and b are the legs of the triangle. 3. From these relationships, we need to express frac{R}{r}. Using the trigonometric identities for the cotangent function and some algebraic manipulation, we get: [ 2R = r cot left(frac{alpha}{2}right) + r cot left(frac{pi}{4} - frac{alpha}{2}right) ] We simplify: [ 2R = r left[cot left(frac{alpha}{2}right) + cot left(frac{pi}{4} - frac{alpha}{2}right)right] ] Using the cotangent addition formula and properties of cotangent: [ cot left(x + yright) = frac{cot x cot y - 1}{cot x + cot y} ] 4. The expression for alpha now simplifies to: [ 2R = r left[frac{2r}{sqrt{2} cos left( alpha - frac{pi}{4} right) - 1} right] ] 5. We then isolate the ratio frac{R}{r}: [ frac{R}{r} = frac{1}{sqrt{2} cos left( alpha - frac{pi}{4} right) - 1} ] 6. The ratio frac{R}{r} is minimized when the denominator sqrt{2} cos left( alpha - frac{pi}{4} right) - 1 is maximized. Since the maximum value of cos is 1, the term sqrt{2} cos left( alpha - frac{pi}{4} right) - 1 is maximized when cos left( alpha - frac{pi}{4} right) = 1. 7. Therefore, alpha - frac{pi}{4} = 0 which implies alpha = frac{pi}{4}. 8. Substituting alpha = frac{pi}{4} into the expression for the ratio gives: [ frac{R}{r} = frac{1}{sqrt{2} cdot 1 - 1} = frac{1}{sqrt{2} - 1} ] 9. Rationalizing the denominator: [ frac{1}{sqrt{2} - 1} cdot frac{sqrt{2} + 1}{sqrt{2} + 1} = frac{sqrt{2} + 1}{1} = sqrt{2} + 1 ] Therefore, the minimal ratio frac{R}{r} occurs when alpha = frac{pi}{4} and the ratio is: [ boxed{sqrt{2} + 1} ]"},{"instruction":"Let P be any point on the ellipse frac{x^2}{a} + frac{y^2}{b} = 1 (where a > b > 0), and let F_1 and F_2 be the foci of the ellipse, with |PF_1| + |PF_2| = 4 and the eccentricity being frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.
