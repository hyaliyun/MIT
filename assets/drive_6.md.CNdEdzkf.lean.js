Between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea, the United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz, Frank Jack Fletcher, and Raymond A. Spruance decisively defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto, Chuichi Nagumo, and Nobutake Kondo near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. Military historian John Keegan called it \\"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare.\\"  - Yamamoto held several important posts in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and undertook many of its changes and reorganizations, especially its development of naval aviation. He was the commander-in-chief during the decisive early years of the Pacific War and so was responsible for major battles such as Pearl Harbor and Midway. He died when American codebreakers identified his flight plans and his plane was shot down. His death was a major blow to Japanese military morale during World War II.  - Midway Atoll (also called Midway Island and Midway Islands; Hawaiian: \\"Pihemanu Kauihelani\\") is a atoll in the North Pacific Ocean at . As its name suggests, Midway is roughly equidistant between North America and Asia. Midway Atoll is an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the United States. Midway continues to be the only island in the Hawaiian archipelago that is not part of the state of Hawaii. Unlike the other Hawaiian islands, Midway observes Samoa Time (i.e., eleven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time), which is one hour behind the time in the state of Hawaii. For statistical purposes, Midway is grouped as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands. The Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, encompassing of land and water (mostly water) in the surrounding area, is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The refuge and most of its surrounding area are part of the larger Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument.  - The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's seven uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II.  - The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought during 48 May 1942, was a major naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and naval and air forces from the United States and Australia. The battle was the first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other, as well as the first in which neither side's ships sighted or fired directly upon the other.  - The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN; Kyjitai: Shinjitai: \\"\\" or \\"Nippon Kaigun\\", \\"Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire\\") was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1868 until 1945, when it was dissolved following Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II. It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff and the Ministry of the Navy, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) was formed after the dissolution of the IJN.  - The attack on Pearl Harbor, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, and Operation Z during planning, was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II.  - Pearl Harbor is a lagoon harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, west of Honolulu. Much of the harbor and surrounding lands is a United States Navy deep-water naval base. It is also the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. The U.S. government first obtained exclusive use of the inlet and the right to maintain a repair and coaling station for ships here in 1887. The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941 was the immediate cause of the United States' entry into World War II.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .  - A Naval Aviator is a commissioned officer or warrant officer qualified as a pilot in the United States Navy, United States Marine Corps or United States Coast Guard.  - Raymond Ames Spruance (July 3, 1886  December 13, 1969) was a United States Navy admiral in World War II.  - Sir John Desmond Patrick Keegan (15 May 1934  2 August 2012) was a British military historian, lecturer, writer and journalist. He was the author of many published works on the nature of combat between the 14th and 21st centuries concerning land, air, maritime, and intelligence warfare, as well as the psychology of battle.  - Frank Jack Fletcher (April 29, 1885  April 25, 1973) was an admiral in the United States Navy during World War II. Fletcher was the operational commander at the pivotal Battles of Coral Sea and of Midway. As a lieutenant, Fletcher was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in battle at Veracruz. He was the nephew of Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, who was also awarded the Medal of Honor for actions at Veracruz.  - Ensign Don T. Griswold , Jr. , ( 8 July 1917 -- 6 June 1942 ) was a United States Naval Aviator , who was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions during the Battle of Midway .  - The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for providing power projection, using the mobility of the United States Navy, by Congressional mandate, to deliver rapidly, combined-arms task forces on land, at sea, and in the air. The U.S. Marine Corps is one of the four armed service branches in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States.

She has blue shoelaces that look flimsy and green shoelaces that look more bulky. Which shoelaces would be more likely to snap? (A) the blue shoelaces (B) the green shoelaces.  What is the most sensical answer between \\"blue shoelaces\\" and  \\"green shoelaces\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"blue shoelaces\\" and \\"green shoelaces\\" would be (A) the blue shoelaces. Before we delve into the reasons behind choosing the blue shoelaces, it is important to understand the context of the short story. Dana is looking for shoelaces for her running shoes and wants to ensure that they won't break. In this scenario, two options are presented: blue shoelaces that appear flimsy and green shoelaces that look more bulky. Now let's analyze each of the options: (A) The blue shoelaces: From the description, we can infer that the blue shoelaces might not be very sturdy because they look flimsy. A flimsy shoelace would likely be made of thinner material and may not be as strong or durable as a bulkier one. Such shoelaces might not be able to withstand the constant stress and pressures resulting from running, and therefore, could have a higher tendency to snap or wear out. (B) The green shoelaces: On the other hand, the green shoelaces appear to be a more robust and bulkier option. Bulkier shoelaces typically have a more reinforced structure, leading to a stronger and more durable product. The likelihood of these shoelaces snapping or wearing out over time will generally be lower, making them a more reliable choice for Dana's purpose, which is running. Having considered the properties of both options, the blue shoelaces appear more likely to snap, due to their flimsy appearance and potentially weaker material composition. It seems more reasonable to conclude that the green shoelaces would be a better choice for Dana, as their bulkier appearance suggests a more durable and reliable product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name.

Choose your answer from:  (1). World;  (2). Sports;  (3). Business;  (4). Science/Tech;","output":"(3). Business; The news about renowned radio personality Howard Stern transitioning from free AM/FM radio to a subscription-based satellite radio has brought immediate attention to the budding industry of satellite radio. This development has significant implications for the business of radio broadcasting, particularly regarding changes in revenue models—moving from an advertising-based model, which is common for traditional AM/FM broadcasting, to a subscription-based model favored by satellite radio.  In addition to the shift in revenue streams, Howard Stern's transition also affects competition within the broadcasting industry. As a highly popular and influential figure in radio, his move might attract more listeners to satellite radio, thereby challenging the dominance of traditional radio. This could potentially lead to an increased competitive environment between AM/FM and satellite radio, possibly triggering a shift in listener preferences and changes in the radio industry's structure. Meanwhile, Howard Stern's move can also impact business negotiations and contracts involving radio hosts, broadcasters, and satellite radio companies. Given Stern's influence and the significant media attention his decision to switch mediums has garnered, it is likely that his contract terms could set a precedent for other radio personalities considering a similar transition. Also, the fact that the news has brought quick attention to satellite radio speaks to the business's potential marketing and public relations effects. While the satellite radio industry is relatively young, notable transitions like Stern's can significantly boost its name recognition and credibility among consumers, potentially driving subscriptions and revenue growth. In all these aspects, the news about Howard Stern's move from free AM/FM radio to pay satellite radio prominently involves business-related issues, including revenue models, industry competition, contract negotiations, and marketing strategies.

Answer the following question: Jason is an average guy who goes to work each day, lives in an apartment, exercises sometimes, goes out and drinks some weekends and just generally enjoys life. Brad, however, has chosen to live in a dark cave that has no windows. He lives in a cave that has almost no light except for some candles he lights from time to time. If he needs food or supplies, he pays someone to go get them, and they slide them through a hole that can open in the steel door at the entrance of the cave.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day?  Hint: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. Answer:","output":"Jason is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day. His exposure to natural light and daily routines, such as going to work and exercising, help regulate his circadian rhythms. In contrast, Brad's living situation in a dark cave with minimal light exposure may disrupt his biological clock, making it less likely for him to maintain regular daily routines, including meal times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Groove recordings, first designed in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century—withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette. In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles. First the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies. Now answer this question: What was a major cause of declined vinyl sales?","output":"A major cause of the decline in vinyl sales can be attributed to the changes in return policies implemented by major label distributors between 1988 and 1991. Retailers had initially relied on the ability to return and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles to maintain their inventory.

The 'Shark' being in 'Northern California' cancelled out 'Sea World' as it's located in Southern California. The 'Tropical Waters' option can be negated as Northern California doesn't have a tropical climate. 'Aquarium' isn't the most likely choice because it's too generalized and ideally, the shark could be in any aquarium worldwide. 'Great Oceans' is too broad and unspecific.

A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio are told by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they overcome the monsters, but as they reach the gates of the palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock in the midst of a stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight. In the palace garden Armida prepares to kill Almirena. Rinaldo draws his sword, but Armida is protected from his wrath by spirits. Suddenly Goffredo and Eustazio arrive, but as they touch the garden with their wands it disappears, leaving them all on an empty plain with the city of Jerusalem visible in the distance. Armida, after a last attempt to kill Almirena, also disappears as Rinaldo strikes her with his sword. The remaining four celebrate their reunion, while Goffredo announces that the attack on Jerusalem will begin the next day. In the city, Argante and Armida, in danger from a common enemy, become reconciled and prepare their troops for battle. Goffredo's army advances, and battle finally commences.

Rinaldo and Almirena celebrate their love and forthcoming marriage. Armida, accepting her defeat, breaks the wand which is the source of her evil power and together with Argante embraces Christianity. Goffredo expresses his forgiveness to his beaten foes and sets them free, before victors and vanquished join in a chorus of reconciliation.

Cancer Bats are a Canadian hardcore punk band from Toronto, Ontario. They have released five studio albums and six extended plays. The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock. Bass player Andrew McCracken left to concentrate on his design company Doublenaut. His spot was filled in by Jason Bailey (former member of Figure Four and Shattered Realm) for most of 2007. However, Bailey was then replaced by Jaye R. Schwarzer (formerly of Left Behind, Hope to Die, Minesweeper, and Kover) as he wanted to focus on being a graphic designer; he still designs artworks for Cancer Bats and remains friends with Liam Cormier.  The band released their second studio album called Hail Destroyer on April 22, 2008. The album features guest vocals by Wade MacNeil of Alexisonfire and Black Lungs, Tim McIlrath of Rise Against and Ben Kowalewicz of Billy Talent. The release was held at the Mod Club in downtown Toronto with Liam Cormier not only singing for Cancer Bats, but also performing drums for Black Lungs. On May 17, 2008, Cancer Bats were put on the cover of Kerrang!, a publication which gave their album Hail Destroyer a KKKKK review (highest possible) as well as a 5k Live review on their headlining UK tour. Cancer Bats were also nominated for 2008 Album of the Year for the 2008 Kerrang! awards.  Cancer Bats have performed at the Download Festival in 2007, Groezrock 2007 and at both Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2007 and 2008. In the summer of 2008, the band did an extensive summer and autumn tour with Bullet for My Valentine, Black Tide and Bleeding Through, as part of the No Fear music tour across North America. Also in 2008, they were a support act for Welsh band Funeral for a Friend during their tour of Britain and northern Europe.

You may have heard of the age-old adage, 'Do not squeeze or pop a deep pimple with a head.' So, what should be the correct modus operandi? It is optimal to use natural remedies that can gently and effectively deal with such skin issues. Here, we'll explore such tactics, including using a honey-baking soda exfoliant, oatmeal exfoliant, sugar-olive oil exfoliant, and a sea salt exfoliant.  Tempting as it may be, it is crucial not to squeeze or try to pop a deep pimple with a head. Such actions can lead to serious consequences, including skin inflammation, scars, and even infections. Dermatologists suggest that popping pimples pushes the bacteria further into the skin, leading to an increased risk of these complications. Now, knowing this, the next question that arises is - how should we manage these painful, stubborn zits then? Let's dive into the alternative effective methods for resolving this issue. One great alternative is using a honey-baking soda exfoliant. The antibacterial properties found in honey, coupled with the coarse texture of baking soda, helps unclog the pores and eliminate excess sebum, the prime cause of pimples. Incorporating this exfoliant into your skincare routine can help manage and even prevent the development of deep pimples. Another effective method to reduce the frequency and apparent size of deep pimples is to use an oatmeal exfoliant. Oatmeal is known for its soothing properties and can help reduce redness and inflammation resulting from deep pimples. By combining oatmeal with warm water, a gentle and effective exfoliant can be created that can remove dead skin cells and minimize the presence of pimples. If soothing isn’t your sole requirement and you need something for nourishment too, try a sugar-olive oil exfoliant. This exfoliant is a perfect blend of sugar’s abrasive texture that can help remove dead skin and sebum, and olive oil’s antioxidant-rich compounds can nourish the skin. This combination creates an environment in the pores that’s not conducive for the growth of acne-causing bacteria and hence, preventing the formation of deep pimples. Last but not least, a sea salt exfoliant can also effectively manage the deep pimple issue. Sea salt has been esteemed for its antibacterial and exfoliating properties for ages. The small granules of salt not only scrub away the dead skin and excess sebum but also disrupt the bacterial milieu leading to a decrease in the frequency of deep pimples. In conclusion, eradicating deep pimples necessitates a gentle approach rather than aggressive popping or squeezing. A variety of natural exfoliants like honey-baking soda, oatmeal, sugar-olive oil, and sea salt can be game-changers in your fight against those stubborn pimples. Remember, skincare is a journey, and patience is key. Trust in the process and give your skin the care and time it needs to heal."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. A Purveyor of Brie, Prosciutto and Anthems Thirty minutes before Stinky Bklyn opens for business, its proprietor strolls the floor singing in a powerhouse tenor to Parmigiano-Reggiano and hickory-smoked Benton’s bacon. He is not being a ham. Patrick Watson is getting his pipes in shape to sing the national anthem at the Barclays Center, where he is better known as the supplier of Stinky Brown Butter Rice Krispy Treats and the crumbled blue cheese topping on the Nathan’s Famous hot dogs sold at the concession stand. Mr. Watson, 38, is a trained opera singer but has not sung before an audience since 2006, the year he and his wife opened Stinky Bklyn, their specialty cheese shop, on Smith Street in Carroll Gardens. He has never publicly performed “The Star-Spangled Banner.” On Monday, before the second-to-last Brooklyn Nets game of the season, the cheesemonger will face upward of 15,000 sports fans. “I’ll be ready,” he said. Confidence has never been an issue for Mr. Watson. He can sell a Massenet aria. He can sell 1,000 pounds of cheese a week. But he says he has never been particularly good at selling himself. “I’m a terrible self-promoter, and maybe that’s why I didn’t go further with opera,” he said. Mr. Watson’s voice, rich as a triple-cream Brillat-Savarin, has a wide range. But that proved an obstacle, he said. “Out of the gates I was too loud,” he said. “I couldn’t find the right teacher. They’d hear me sing and say, ‘Stop it, you’re not supposed to sing like that in your 20s.’ They’d try to dial me back into some sort of lyrical Mozart thing, telling me I had to wait until I was in my 30s to sing the big, dramatic roles.” After graduating from McGill University’s opera program, Mr. Watson, who grew up on Cape Cod, occasionally sang at the Metropolitan Opera (Pavarotti, he says, once told him to never give up) while supporting himself as a waiter and sommelier at top Manhattan restaurants like Gotham Bar and Grill, and Lupa. At the latter, he met Michele Pravda, a fellow server and singer. They married, and in 2004 they opened Carroll Gardens’ first boutique wine shop, Smith and Vine. Time for auditioning and performing dwindled as the couple followed up with Stinky Bklyn, a wine bar called the JakeWalk and two children. Mr. Watson’s singing became more or less consigned to blow-the-roof-off renditions of “Happy Birthday” and serenading his son and daughter with Puccini at bath time despite their complaints of “It’s too loud, Daddy.” “My neighbor must have a stock of earplugs,” he said. But Mr. Watson’s volume did not pose a problem for Petra Pope, a senior vice president for event marketing for the Brooklyn Nets, who heard his audition tape. When the Barclays arena opened in September, Ms. Pope had 44 national anthem spots to fill for the season and received about 150 recorded submissions, performed by everyone from violinists to school choirs to soloists. Some, she said, were not listenable. “It’s a very hard song to sing,” Ms. Pope said. “As soon as I heard Patrick I said yes instantly, it’s so beautiful.” “I had a little inside track,” Mr. Watson joked, explaining that a contact he had made at the arena offered to pass his tape to Ms. Pope. Practicing scales and phrasing is Mr. Watson’s main preparation for the big night. He has been trying to assist customers silently, in order to protect his vocal cords (though when he does reel off the names of cheeses, his French, Italian and Spanish pronunciations are impeccable, thanks to his operatic training). Rather than look back on what might have been, Mr. Watson keeps his focus forward. “I hope they’ll ask me back for the playoffs,” he said. “Michele and I could sing a duet.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Patrick Watson, the proprietor of Stinky Bklyn cheese shop, is a trained opera singer who has not sung before an audience since 2006.

Mr. Watson has faced several obstacles in his singing career, including being told he was too loud and needed to wait until he was older to sing dramatic roles. However, his talent impressed Petra Pope, a senior vice president for event marketing for the Brooklyn Nets, who heard his audition tape and chose him to perform the national anthem. 3. Despite his setbacks and not having performed publicly for years, Mr. Watson remains confident about his upcoming performance and hopes to be asked back for the playoffs.

She announced Frank had earned forgiveness, and a supermarket tabloid was accused of having paid the flight attendant to lure poor, naive Frank into the tryst. Eight years ago, when Gifford announced she was exiting \\"Live,\\" she said it was because she no longer felt \\"comfortable sharing the ordinary, innocent, everyday details of my family life, only to watch the tabloid media turn them into harmful, misleading and libelous stories.\\" Yesterday, on \\"Today,\\" it took under three minutes for her to bring up her son, Cody -- who, it seems like, just yesterday successfully \\"pottied\\" in the bidet of Donald Trump's private jet.

By 1935, both sisters are movie actors, but Blanche has achieved stardom, while Janeâs films have flopped, leading Jane to drink heavily. One night, returning from a party, one of the sisters gets out of the car to open the gate leading up to the house, while the other attempts to run her over. The resulting accident leaves Blanche paralyzed. In 1962, a wheelchair-bound Blanche (Joan Crawford) and a bitter, irritable Jane (Bette Davis) are living together in Blanche's mansion. Because she is wheelchair-bound, Blanche rarely leaves her bedroom on the second floor and becomes close with her cleaning woman, Elvira (Maidie Norman). Elvira believes that Jane is exhibiting symptoms of mental illness and becomes concerned for Blanche's well-being, but Blanche defends her sister. Later, when Blanche informs Jane she may be selling the house, Jane's mental health begins to deteriorate further. During an argument, she removes the telephone from Blanche's bedroom, cutting Blanche off from the outside world. Later, Jane begins denying Blanche food, killing her pet parakeet and serving it to her on a platter. Later, when Jane leaves the house to put an advertisement in the paper, Blanche tries to get the attention of her neighbor, Mrs. Bates (Anna Lee), by writing a note pleading for help and throwing it out her bedroom window. Jane returns in time to notice the note and prevents Mrs. Bates from seeing it. When Jane reads the note, the two sisters quarrel again. The next time Elvira comes to clean the house, Jane initially pays her and gives her the day off, but when Elvira returns later on, Jane abruptly fires her and sends her away. Meanwhile, Edwin Flagg (Victor Buono) sees Jane's newspaper advertisement for a piano player and arrives at the mansion, where he is officially hired by Jane to help her in her delusional plan to regain her childhood stardom.

WASHINGTON—The European Union delegation meeting with President Donald Trump Wednesday agreed to some concessions in an effort to avoid a trade war with the U.S., according to a European official in the room.      The official said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his top trade official Cecilia Malmström agreed to work with the U.S. administration to lower industrial tariffs on both sides, increase LNG exports and soy beans to Europe, and align regulatory standards to allow for medical devices to have better market access in Europe, the official said.      Both delegations were still fine tuning language in a common statement on car tariffs, the official said.      A joint news conference between Mr. Trump and Mr. Juncker was hastily being organized as the meeting was coming to an end.      (more to come)      Previously...      WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump slammed critics of his trade policies on Wednesday, warning they are undermining his negotiating position while American farmers are being “ripped off.”      Mr. Trump’s remarks, aimed at critics he didn’t name, came hours ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in which trade tensions between the U.S. and the European bloc are expected to dominate.      The Europeans come to Washington with potential auto tariffs weighing heavily on their minds. Last week, Mr. Trump threatened “tremendous retribution” if his meeting with the EU officials doesn’t lead to what he considers to be a fair auto-trade deal.      In the Oval Office Wednesday, Mr. Trump leaned over and tapped Mr. Juncker’s hand while describing him as a “very smart and a very tough man” who represents the European member states well.      “Over the years, the United States has lost hundreds of billions of dollars to the European Union and we just want it to be a level playing field for our farmers, our manufacturers, for everybody,” Mr. Trump added.      “We are close partners, allies, not enemies, we have to work together,” Mr. Juncker said.      Mr. Trump didn’t respond to questions on whether he will impose auto tariffs but said that “the United States would be very pleased” to create a trade partnership where there are no tariffs, no barriers and no subsidies.      Mr. Trump is also scheduled to meet with lawmakers on Wednesday to discuss his administration’s proposed plan to offer 12 billion in aid to farmers hardest hit by retaliatory tariffs imposed by U.S. trading partners. Many lawmakers expressed skepticism that the plan would yield long-term prosperity for American farmers.      Mr. Trump insisted on Wednesday that the domestic political pushback accomplishes nothing but delays and hinders his ability to negotiate a deal.      “When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity,” he said. “Negotiations are going really well, be cool. The end result will be worth it!”      Related Video WSJ's Gerald F. Seib looks at the trade deal between Japan and the EU, and explains how President Trump’s trade policy might drive other countries to form their own agreements. Photo: Martin Bureau/Press Pool      He wrote, “Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off?”      U.S. trading partners are retaliating against Mr. Trump’s decision to order tariffs on imports including metals, clothing and electronics from a broad range of countries, including China, Mexico, Canada and European Union member states.      The retaliatory tariffs have already been felt across America’s Farm Belt. China, a huge market for U.S. agricultural exports, has applied tariffs on 34 billion worth of U.S. goods, including soybeans and pork. Canada, Mexico and the EU have also hit back with tariffs of their own.      “China is targeting our farmers, who they know I love & respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S.,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter Wednesday. “They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice - until now!”      Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue wrote on Twitter late Tuesday that the farm aid package “is clear statement that other nations can’t bully our agricultural producers to force the U.S. to cave in to unfair trade practices & retaliatory tactics.”      On Tuesday, many lawmakers from Mr. Trump’s own Republican party criticized the announcement that his administration would offer farmers a one-time aid package, describing it as a bailout lacking any long-term solutions.      Republican lawmakers from farm states said they expected to meet Wednesday with Mr. Trump to discuss a pending farm bill and farm aid. Some Republicans are jittery about the potential for political repercussions heading into the November midterm elections.      “The action that I’d like to see is resolving this tariff fight and moving forward with trade opportunities, ” said Sen. Cory Gardner (R., Colo.), who chairs the Senate Republican campaign arm for the Senate Republicans.      Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow said Wednesday morning on CBS, “Nobody is really thrilled about this. We’re just trying to protect American agriculture from some of the unfair trading practices.”      Ahead of Mr. Trump’s meeting, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem met with lawmakers, seeking insights about how to approach Mr. Trump. Republican lawmakers, who have been hoping to persuade Mr. Trump to step back from the brink, said they urged her to reach an agreement to lower tariffs.      House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said he and the trade commissioner discussed “how we can come to an agreement to lower tariffs and trade barriers, avoiding the escalation of trade tensions.” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) encouraged her to work with the president to strengthen the trans-Atlantic partnership, including through the reduction of tariffs, a spokeswoman said.      While Mr. Trump’s aggressive trade policies with China have been celebrated by members of both the major political parties, his decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico have been met with more skepticism. The Trump administration justifies the move on the grounds of national security and a growing trade deficit—arguments those countries dismiss as farcical.      Mr. Trump repeatedly complains that the EU imposes 10% tariffs on auto imports, compared with 2.5% imposed by the U.S. He declines to mention the 25% tariffs the U.S. imposes on light trucks, versus the 10% rate in Europe. Mr. Trump recently described the EU as “a foe” on trade.      —Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article. ||||| Traders Michael Milano, center, and Robert Oswald, right, work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Wednesday, July 25, 2018.

Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters.\\" Then he panted heavily. \\"Hush, sire,\\" she whispered. \\"Rest easy.\\" The Kings wife: - was not in the room - was beautiful - not enough information - was also tall Answer:","output":"From the given passage, we understand that Countess Nicolette de Gobignon is attending to the King in his final moments. The room is crowded with people, including the King's family and courtiers, making it uncomfortably hot and stuffy. However, there is no explicit mention of the King's wife being present in the room. Instead, we only know that she, along with the King's mother, grieves for him but is too distracted to alleviate his suffering effectively. In this scenario, we cannot conclude that the King's wife is present in the room, beautiful, or also tall, as there is not enough information provided in the passage to make those assertions. The only aspect we can confidently deduce about the King's wife is that she is saddened and distracted by her husband's deteriorating condition, preventing her from fully supporting him during his time of need."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 1997 TNM staging system for prostatic carcinoma and the 2002 revision thereof classified prostatic carcinoma with bladder neck involvement classified as pT4 disease. This classification is based on the belief that tumors that invade surrounding structures are more aggressive and warrant higher staging than tumors that do not invade surrounding structures. Recent reports in the literature suggested that microscopic involvement of the bladder neck does not carry independent prognostic significance. Therefore, resection specimens with bladder neck involvement should not be classified as pT4. The current study prospectively examined the prognostic significance of bladder neck involvement by prostatic carcinoma.', 'The authors analyzed the totally embedded and whole-mounted radical prostatectomy specimens from 364 consecutive patients. The mean patient age was 66 years (range, 41-77 years). The bladder neck, which had been coned from the specimen, was cut in a perpendicular fashion. Involvement of the bladder neck was defined as the presence of neoplastic cells within the smooth muscle bundles of the coned bladder neck. The data were prospectively collected. Bladder neck involvement was analyzed in relation to age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, prostate weight, Gleason score, final pathologic classification, tumor volume, surgical margin status, the presence of high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasm, multifocality, seminal vesicle invasion, extraprostatic extension, perineural invasion, and PSA recurrence.', 'Bladder neck involvement was found in 22 (6%) of 364 patients. Univariate results indicated that bladder neck involvement versus no bladder neck involvement was significantly associated with preoperative PSA (P < 0.001), higher pathologic classification (P < 0.001), larger tumor volume (P < 0.001), extraprostatic extension (P < 0.001), positive surgical margins (P < 0.001), and PSA recurrence (P = 0.003). In a multivariate logistic regression model controlling for pathologic classification, Gleason score, and surgical margin status, bladder neck involvement was an independent predictor of PSA recurrence (P = 0.04). The adjusted odds ratio for bladder neck involvement was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-10.03). A:","output":"Part #1: Construct a question based on the information present in the passage. Usage: \\"What relationship does bladder neck involvement have with preoperative PSA levels in prostatic carcinoma patients?\\" This question is based on the information provided in the passage, which states that bladder neck involvement is significantly associated with preoperative PSA levels. Part #2: The question should be unambiguous. Usage: As shown, the question is unambiguous because it clearly asks about the relationship between bladder neck involvement and preoperative PSA levels.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Everyone argues with those they feel close to. The strongest relationships involve partners who argue, but do so with resolution in mind. If you don't argue at all, it's a bad sign. If even the simplest arguments turn into week-long drama-fests, it's also a bad sign.  When couples don't fight, it usually means that one or both people are not being entirely honest. When needs, desires, and difficulties are not voiced, they are not addressed, and the relationship remains weakened. Healthy arguments are free of violence in all its forms: verbal and physical. The fights are fair, and no one tries to manipulate the other party. The two of you should be able to laugh with each other and at each other. There should be room for seriousness in a serious relationship, of course, but you also need to balance that out with a healthy dose of humor. The teasing that goes on between you two should be gentle and playful, though. If one person routinely breaks into tears, you're doing something wrong. If the two of you need constant chatter and excitement to make your relationship work, it could be a sign that your relationship won't work, or it may just mean that your relationship is still too new to predict the future.  Enjoying the mundane means wanting to learn the little details about your partner's past and present life. Enjoying the ordinary also means feeling content to sit in and spend a quiet evening together. It's natural to crave excitement from time to time, but you need to be able to enjoy your partner's presence during the dull times, as well. The two of you should connect in little ways and big ways. Look for shared interests and similar quirks. Also ask yourself if the two of you share similar priorities and goals.  If the two of you have different goals, your lives will naturally move in different directions. For example, if you want to settle down, marry, and have children, but your partner wants to explore the world and has no interest in raising kids, the things you want out of life may simply be too different to make things work. Hobbies and everyday interests are less important than goals, but still worth paying attention to. Having one or two shared interests will make it easier for you to spend time together. The more unusual or obscure those interests are, the better. A strong relationship is built around respect and commitment. You need to be able to respect your partner, but you also need a partner who will respect you in equal amounts. Respect leads to everything else a healthy relationship requires: commitment, trust, communication, and general satisfaction. Without respect, none of these other qualities can take root. Think about past conversations the two of you had concerning the future. When the topic comes up, both of you should feel comfortable discussing it, and both of you should be able to picture the other as a part of your own future. Your talks about the future don't always need to be serious. If it's still early in your relationship, you might casually of the things you should do together \\"next month\\" or \\"next year.\\" As your commitment grows, however, the two of you should be able to talk about your long-term future and the rest of your lives. Your significant other should be the one person you want to share everything with. “Everything” means just about everything—exciting news, fears, that great new coffee shop you found, and so on.  Ask yourself how often you stumble upon interesting things you want to share with your partner later on. The more often this happens, the more deeply rooted that person is in your mind. A deep connection signifies a deeper level of commitment. More significantly, honesty needs to feel natural for both of you. If you find yourself keeping secrets or know that your partner routinely hides information from you, that's a bad sign. While a committed relationship definitely runs deeper than mere physical attraction, good chemistry is also important. Fireworks do not need to go off every time your eyes meet, but there should at least be an occasional spark. Physical intimacy and emotional intimacy are closely related. You need both to balance out a romantic relationship. \\" Both of you should have a greater interest in working through things together than working through them separately. You may need to put the welfare of the relationship above your own individual desires from time to time, and you both should be okay with doing so when the situation really calls for it.  The first \\"we\\" thoughts are usually positive. The mind shifts from \\"what am I doing this weekend?\\" to \\"what are we doing this weekend?\\" Eventually, though, your \\"we\\" thoughts need to shift to more serious matters. For instance, if you're offered a new job in a different location, you should be just as interested in how it will affect your future as a couple instead of only thinking of how it will affect your future as an individual.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: It is obvious that television brings us not only advantages but also disadvantages .    At first, television is both a convenient channel of amusement, and a  ly cheap one. If we have a TV set in the family, we are not necessary to go to the cinema or theatre to enjoy programme with expensive tickets. All that they have to do is press a button with a finger, and they can watch all the programmes they like, such as TV talk shows , movies, opera and so on. But some people think of it as a danger. When we watch TV, we don't need to do anything . We do not even have to leave our sofa because we have a remote control in our hand. We don't need to make any judgment or statement about it. We are totally passive and don't use our head to think hard about some matters.    As we all know, television keeps us informed about world events--including all the events in society, science and politics .We can get a good idea of the most remote countries and the strangest customs in their country. Of course the radio performs this service too, but the effect of the programme is not better than on the television. Everything we enjoy on the television is much more vivid and realistic. However, in turn there is a great danger. Usually we cannot resist the television screen, because it has a great harm for us. We have been so accustomed to enjoying the screen, so dependent on its pictures. But when our TV sets are out of order, we are surprised to find that we have much more time to do things. And at this time we actually begin to have a talk to each other again. It is really worth thinking.    Of course the arguments about the advantages and disadvantages of television are on the go.We can not simply say television itself is good or bad. The truth is that how we use it determines its true value to our society. Question: According to the passage , whether TV is good or not depends on   _   .

Here's a step-by-step breakdown as to why: 1. The reviewer starts with \\"One star is being entirely too generous,\\" suggesting that their experience was so negative that even the lowest rating feels too high. 2. The phrase \\"This place stinks\\" further reinforces the negativity. 3. They mention that the staff was friendly, which is a positive aspect, but it's overshadowed by the rest of the review. 4. They emphasize the poor quality of the nail technician's skills, stating they are \\"lacking.\\" 5. The reviewer points out the limited design options and the unskilled execution for pedicures. 6. The design is compared to that of a kindergartener's work, emphasizing its poor quality. 7. They note that the nail color was applied hastily due to increasing business. 8. The reviewer complains about the price (65) being high for the low-quality services received. 9. They mention they could have done a better job at home, further highlighting their dissatisfaction. 10. The review ends with the reviewer expressing they \\"left in tears\\" because of the mess and wasted money. 11. The last sentence highlights that the reviewer does not mind paying for good quality, but it is clear they feel the quality was not present in this experience. Given the mentions of poor quality, high price, dissatisfaction, and the overall negative tone, the sentiment of this review is negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question about text: Then I heated the soy milk in a small sauce pan on medium heat until it started to bubble , and then whisked in the agar agar powder .

Then I quickly poured the agar mixture in the yogurt bowl while whisking it vigorously , and when everything was all combined , I immediately poured the filling in the cooled shells . what lifestyle might this person follow ?","output":"Based on the text provided, it appears that the person might follow a vegan or plant-based lifestyle. There are several indicators in the text that suggest this conclusion: 1. Use of soy milk: Choosing soy milk instead of regular dairy milk is common among those who follow a vegan or plant-based lifestyle. Vegans refrain from consuming animal products, which includes dairy milk. Soy milk, made from soybeans, is a popular dairy alternative and is often used in vegan recipes. 2. Agar agar powder: Agar agar is a gelatin substitute that comes from red algae and is often used in vegan or plant-based recipes. Gelatin, which is derived from animal collagen, is not considered vegan, so agar agar is a suitable alternative for those who avoid animal products. 3. Dairy-free yogurt: The text refers to a \\"yogurt bowl.\\" Since regular yogurt is made from dairy milk, one can assume that the person is using a dairy-free or plant-based yogurt in this recipe. This is another indication of a vegan or plant-based lifestyle. 4. Mention of a cooled shell: The mention of pouring the filling into a cooled shell could also suggest that the person is following a plant-based lifestyle. Vegan or plant-based pie shells may be made without the use of animal-based ingredients such as butter or lard. In conclusion, based on the choice of ingredients, methods and, the nature of the recipe, it can be inferred that the person engaged in this activity might follow a vegan or plant-based lifestyle. They are opting for non-animal alternatives for milk, yogurt, and gelatin, which are traditionally animal-based ingredients. Their choice of ingredients supports the idea that they exclude animal products from their diet and prioritize using plant-based substitutes to create their dishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It talks about Mary Davies inheriting the property from Sir Hugh Audley, who is the property tycoon. In order to accurately answer the question, you could rephrase the sentence like this: In the late 17th century, the property tycoon who inherited the property was Sir Hugh Audley. However, it should be noted that the freehold was eventually transferred from Sir Hugh Audley to the great heiress Mary Davies. Step 1: Identify the main subject of the question (property tycoon who inherited the property). Step 2: Clarify the time period mentioned in the question (late 17th century).

Make this proper case","output":"Cross stitching on white pearl Aida fabric with a thread count of 4.4 per centimeter (or 11 threads per inch) can create a beautifully detailed and intricate design. To ensure the best results, follow the steps below using a black and white counted pattern: 1. Gather materials: Before beginning, ensure you have the necessary materials at hand. These may include:    a. White pearl Aida fabric with 4.4 threads per centimeter (11 threads per inch)    b. Embroidery floss in the colors required by your pattern    c. Cross stitch needle    d. Embroidery hoop or frame (optional, but helpful to maintain fabric tension)    e. Scissors    f. Black and white counted cross stitch pattern 2. Prepare the fabric: To prevent fraying, carefully serge or sew the edges of your Aida fabric. If using an embroidery hoop or frame, secure the fabric within it, ensuring it's taut and evenly tensioned. 3. Find the center: Fold the Aida fabric in half lengthwise and then in half widthwise, gently creasing the fabric at the corners to locate the center. This step is crucial, as you will begin stitching from this central point outward to ensure your design remains centered. 4. Thread the needle: Cut a length of embroidery floss (approximately 45-60cm) and separate the strands as needed, according to your pattern's specifications. Most patterns call for two strands of floss. Thread the required number of strands through the eye of your cross stitch needle, leaving a tail of about 2.5 cm. There's no need to knot the tail end. 5. Begin stitching: Referring to the black and white counted pattern, identify the center and match it with the center of your fabric. Begin stitching by bringing the needle up through the fabric from the back, leaving the tail end at the rear. As you make more stitches, the tail will become secured in place. Proceed with stitching in the direction indicated by your pattern, counting the squares on both the fabric and pattern for precise placement. 6. Cross your stitches: Work the stitches in rows, completing a series of half stitches (diagonal) in one direction before going back to finish the cross with the other diagonal half. 7. Follow the pattern: Continue to reference the black and white pattern as you stitch, ensuring that you accurately count each square and place stitches according to the design. Periodically check your work against the pattern to confirm correct placement and maintain consistency. 8. Finish off: When you complete a section of a particular color, or when you're nearing the end of a cut length of floss, you'll need to secure the thread at the back of your work. To do this, pass the needle through the back of several nearby stitches without piercing the fabric, and then trim any excess floss. 9. Frame or finish your project: Once the entire pattern is stitched, gently hand wash or spot clean the fabric if necessary. Press the completed piece from the back, and either frame it, make it into a pillow, or use it in any other way you desire. By following these steps and carefully adhering to the black and white counted cross stitch pattern, you can create a stunning work of hand-stitched art on white pearl Aida fabric with 4.4 threads per centimeter (11 threads per inch). Enjoy the process and the satisfaction of bringing your intricate design to life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are. I also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop® are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just £45. The larger calendars included some full size products too which I thought was great. There’s also going to be a Countdown to New Year calendar priced at just £50 which I thought was a great fun idea.

Summarize this article: At a winding-up hearing at the High Court, Orient owner Francesco Becchetti has been given until 12 June to pay off debts or sell the club. The League Two side were the subject of a winding-up petition brought by HM Revenue & Customs over unpaid taxes. Those debts have now been paid, but money is owed to four other creditors. Chief executive Alessandro Angelieri gave the court a statement saying Becchetti would invest £1m to pay off remaining debts in eight to 10 weeks. Adam Michaelson, legal adviser to the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust, told BBC Radio London: \\"It leaves the club in a state of significant uncertainty and frankly mortal danger. \\"In respect of a potential sale, we would call upon Mr Becchetti now to look to sell the club at the earliest possible opportunity and make good on the promise that he's made.\\" In January, Becchetti said he would be willing to consider selling the struggling League Two side, which he bought in 2014. The club's latest set of accounts, from the year ending 30 June 2015, showed the club had debts of £5,512,449 - more than the value of the club's assets of £5.5m. Analysis - Phil Parry, BBC Radio London So, with a sword of Damocles still swinging over their heads, Orient will have to battle on. Mathematically they still have a chance to avoid relegation, although form would suggest that is unlikely. They have eight games left, are seven points from safety and have picked up just three points from the last 24 available. Off the pitch, with outstanding bills yet to be paid, operations at Brisbane Road may be difficult. For example, a company which provides matchday stewards is on the list of creditors, and perhaps the remaining matchday programmes may not return to full size. As we wait to see if the extra £1m investment promised in court materialises, fans will continue to make preparations for all eventualities. The Fans' Trust has already raised more than £100,000 and are planning to keep Leyton Orient alive in some guise, including a possible 'phoenix club'. Meanwhile, all eyes will be peeled to see if talk of a buy-out comes to fruition.","output":"Leyton Orient football club's owner Francesco Becchetti has until 12 June to pay off debts or sell the club following a winding-up hearing that was held at the High Court.

The premise is very intersting and I'm a fan of Rufus Sewell. The only thing scary about this film was how boring it was. The director lingers way too long on scenes with no dialogue and random images. Possibly to make up for the total lack of story or characters to care about. I kept waiting for the film to pick-up and do something that made sense. One thing that would have made sense is for the lead male character to leave his crazy, pouty-mouthed wife in the jungle to talk to the trees. But alas, we're expected to believe that a pampered European couple could wander aimlessly through the jungles of Southwast Asia without running into anything worse than a pack of children with pointy sticks. Yes, the imagery was intriguing but I could have gotten that from a documentary film about Burma which would have been more interesting. However, a bowl of cereal would have been more interesting. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review is negative. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the movie, stating that it was frightfully boring. They criticize the lack of an engaging story and interesting characters and complain about the slow pacing and unnecessary long scenes without dialogue and random images.

They also sarcastically comment on the unrealistic nature of the lead characters' journey through the jungle.

It was principally the widespread introduction of a single feature, the pointed arch, which was to bring about the change that separates Gothic from Romanesque. The technological change permitted a stylistic change which broke the tradition of massive masonry and solid walls penetrated by small openings, replacing it with a style where light appears to triumph over substance. With its use came the development of many other architectural devices, previously put to the test in scattered buildings and then called into service to meet the structural, aesthetic and ideological needs of the new style. These include the flying buttresses, pinnacles and traceried windows which typify Gothic ecclesiastical architecture. But while pointed arch is so strongly associated with the Gothic style, it was first used in Western architecture in buildings that were in other ways clearly Romanesque, notably Durham Cathedral in the north of England, Monreale Cathedral and Cathedral of Cefalù in Sicily, Autun Cathedral in France.

Question: suppose more evaporation happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less Step 1: Identify how the process of weathering works in the given context. In this context, water gets into cracks in rocks and eventually freezes into ice, causing the cracks to expand and rocks to split into smaller pieces over time. This is an example of freeze-thaw weathering. Step 2: Understand the concept of evaporation. Evaporation is the process of liquid water turning into water vapor, which eventually gets removed from the surface. Step 3: Evaluate the impact of more evaporation on the weathering process. If more evaporation occurs, there will be less liquid water available to seep into the cracks in rocks. As a result, the formation of ice within those cracks will be reduced. Step 4: Determine the effect of decreased ice formation on the weathering process. Since ice formation is essential in causing the expansion of cracks and splitting of rocks, less ice formation due to increased evaporation will likely result in less weathering occurring.  Based on these steps, the correct answer is B: less weathering will occur due to increased evaporation."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Context: Taylor lied and told Alex they were going out of town to avoid going to Alex's party.

Scott Fitzgerald. Born in Montgomery, Alabama, she was noted for her beauty and high spirits, and was dubbed by her husband as \\"the first American Flapper\\". She and Scott became emblems of the Jazz Age, for which they are still celebrated. The immediate success of Scott's first novel This Side of Paradise (1920) brought them into contact with high society, but their marriage was plagued by wild drinking, infidelity and bitter recriminations. Context: Zelda first met the future novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in July 1918, when he had volunteered for the army, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, outside Montgomery. Scott began to call her daily, and came into Montgomery on his free days. He talked of his plans to be famous, and sent her a chapter of a book he was writing. He was so taken by Zelda that he redrafted the character of Rosalind Connage in This Side of Paradise to resemble her. He wrote, \\"all criticism of Rosalind ends in her beauty,\\" and told Zelda that \\"the heroine does resemble you in more ways than four.\\" Zelda was more than a mere muse, however--after she showed Scott her personal diary, he used verbatim excerpts from it in his novel. At the conclusion of This Side of Paradise, the soliloquy of the protagonist Amory Blaine in the cemetery, for example, is taken directly from her journal. Gloria Patch, in The Beautiful and the Damned, is also known to be a permutation of the \\"subjects of statement\\" that appear in Zelda's letters.  F. Scott Fitzgerald was known to appreciate and take from Zelda's letters, even at one point borrowing her diary while he was writing This Side of Paradise. In 1918, Scott showed her diary to his friend Peevie Parrot who then shared it with George Jean Nathan. There was allegedly discussion between the men of publishing it under the name of \\"The Diary of a Popular Girl\\". Zelda's letters stand out for their \\"spontaneous turn of phrase and lyrical style\\" and tendency to use dashes, visually similar to the poems by Emily Dickinson, and experimental grammar.  According to Nancy Milford, Scott and Zelda's first encounter was at a country club dance in Montgomery, which Scott fictionalised in his novel, The Great Gatsby, when he describes Jay Gatsby's first encounter with Daisy Buchanan, although he transposed the location in the novel to a train station. Scott was not the only man courting Zelda, and the competition only drove Scott to want her more. In the ledger that he meticulously maintained throughout his life, Scott noted in 1918, on September 7, that he had fallen in love. Ultimately, she would do the same. Her biographer Nancy Milford wrote, \\"Scott had appealed to something in Zelda which no one before him had perceived: a romantic sense of self-importance which was kindred to his own.\\"  Their courtship was briefly interrupted in October when he was summoned north. He expected to be sent to France, but was instead assigned to Camp Mills, Long Island. While he was there, the Armistice with Germany was signed. He then returned to the base near Montgomery, and by December they were inseparable. Scott would later describe their behavior as \\"sexual recklessness.\\" On February 14, 1919, he was discharged from the military and went north to establish himself in New York City.  They wrote frequently, and by March 1920, Scott had sent Zelda his mother's ring, and the two had become engaged. Many of Zelda's friends and members of her family were wary of the relationship, as they did not approve of Scott's excessive drinking, and Zelda's Episcopalian family did not like the fact that he was a Catholic. Question: Did they marry? Answer:","output":"Yes, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald got married. After getting engaged in March 1920, they eventually got married on April 3, 1920 in New York City."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Taliban-held U.S. soldier released in exchange for Afghan detainees Bergdahl, 28, who had been held captive nearly five years, broke down in tears. His release was secured after the Obama administration, working through Qatari government intermediaries, agreed to free five high-profile Afghan inmates held by the U.S. military in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The influential commanders, including the former head of the Taliban’s army, were loaded onto a U.S. military aircraft bound for Qatar after U.S. officials got confirmation that Bergdahl had been freed. Bergdahl’s “safety and health were both in jeopardy,” and officials had to act quickly to obtain his release, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Sunday, according to the Associated Press. President Obama hailed Bergdahl’s recovery as a triumph of years of high-wire diplomatic efforts that reached a breakthrough in the waning months of the U.S. combat mission there. “He wasn’t forgotten by his country,” Obama said Saturday evening in the Rose Garden, standing alongside Bergdahl’s parents, Robert and Jani. “The United States of America does not ever leave our men and women in uniform behind.” His father, who grew a long beard in a gesture of solidarity with his son, said a few words to him in Pashto, the language spoken in southern Afghanistan, saying that he understood his son is having trouble speaking English. “I am your father, Bowe,” Robert Bergdahl said. “I look forward to continuing the recovery of our son which will be a considerable task for our family.” While leaders across the political spectrum expressed relief at the news, prominent Republican lawmakers chided the White House for skirting a legal requirement to notify them about the planned release of Guantanamo inmates. Some criticized the president for breaking with longtime U.S. policy against negotiating with militant groups. “This fundamental shift in U.S. policy signals to terrorists around the world a greater incentive to take US hostages,” Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. The AP reported Hagel, who was traveling to Afghanistan to meet with U.S. troops, as saying that the action was not relayed to Congress because of its urgency. He said intelligence indicated that Bergdahl’s “health was deteriorating.” Bergdahl’s release at 10:30 a.m. in Khost province, which borders Pakistan, capped a week of intense, secret negotiations conducted through the Qataris. A team of dozens of Special Operations forces took custody of Bergdahl from a group of 18 Taliban fighters. The rare encounter on the battlefield between warriors who have spent years killing one another lasted just a few minutes and was peaceful, U.S. officials said. Bergdahl walked onto the aircraft, U.S. officials said, suggesting he is in relatively stable health. Officials said it was too early to know anything definitive about the mental state of a soldier who bewildered his comrades after he walked off base in volatile Paktika province on June 30, 2009. Officials at the Pentagon, who had grown concerned that the end of the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of the year would dim the prospect of getting Bergdahl back alive, rejoiced. “It is our ethos that we never leave a fallen comrade,” Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a statement. “Today we have back in our ranks the only remaining captured soldier from our conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Welcome home Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.” There was no indication that the soldier would face any reprimand for the circumstances under which he was taken, which led some of his comrades to call him a deserter. While it is unclear whether he will remain on active duty, a senior U.S. military official said the Army plans to promote Bergdahl to staff sergeant next month. “I can’t imagine there would be repercussions,” said the official, who was among several who would speak about the case only on the condition of anonymity. Defense officials said they were working to get Bergdahl to the United States as soon as possible. After passing through Bagram air base in Afghanistan, Bergdahl was en route to the U.S military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, according to Pentagon officials traveling with Hagel. They said his first U.S. stop would likely be the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, where after a thorough medical screening he will likely be debriefed by intelligence officials. The released inmates include Mullah Mohammad Fazl, a former Taliban deputy defense minister. U.S. officials said that under a memorandum of understanding signed by Washington and Doha, the men will be subject to a year-long travel ban in Qatar. They declined to offer more details about any restrictions the men would face but expressed confidence that their release would not put Americans in harm’s way. “The United States has coordinated closely with Qatar to ensure that security measures are in place and the national security of the United States will not be compromised,” Hagel said in a statement from Singapore, where he was attending a security conference. “Sgt. Bergdahl’s return is a powerful reminder of the enduring, sacred commitment our nation makes to all those who serve in uniform.” Hagel informed members of Congress on Saturday about the prisoner swap deal. The administration is required by law to notify Congress about its intention to release Guantanamo detainees 30 days in advance. “Due to a near-term opportunity to save Sergeant Bergdahl’s life, we moved as quickly as possible,” a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to explain the timing of the congressional notification. “The administration determined that given these unique and exigent circumstances, such a transfer should go forward notwithstanding the notice requirement” in the law. The Obama administration began seriously exploring the possibility of negotiating Bergdahl’s release in late 2011, when secret talks between U.S. diplomats and members of the Taliban appeared to be gaining traction. The talks, part of a broader effort to explore a negotiated end of a conflict that had only become deadlier as the White House approved a surge of 30,000 troops in 2009, collapsed in March 2012 when the Taliban suspended them, arguing that the United States was not acting in good faith. Last summer, when the Taliban was allowed to open a political office in the Qatari capital, American officials grew hopeful that prisoner swap negotiations could resume. The effort foundered just hours after the office formally opened after the Afghan government protested that the Taliban had been given de-facto diplomatic status. Unexpectedly, representatives of the Taliban conveyed to U.S. officials last fall that they were once again amenable to discussing the release of Bergdahl, but set as a condition that they would only deal with Washington through intermediaries, American officials said. U.S. officials received a video of Bergdahl last fall after they had demanded proof that he remained alive. Unlike past videos of the captive, the one released last year was delivered privately, rather than through the Taliban’s media operatives. It showed the soldier looking “very gaunt, haggard,” a U.S. military official who has seen clips said. In a departure of its former negotiating stance, the administration sought to enhance the American offer of a prisoner exchange by proposing to release the five men simultaneously. Taliban representatives had objected to the previous proposed plan, under which the inmates would be turned over in stages in an effort to test whether the Taliban and the Qatari intermediaries could guarantee that the men would not return to militancy. A statement issued Saturday by the Taliban said the men would be residing with their families in Qatar, a tiny, wealthy Gulf emirate. U.S. officials said they had no indication that the Taliban was open to more substantive talks but expressed hope that the swap would build trust. “We continue to hope there will be a decision by the Taliban to move forward to initiate a political dialogue with the Afghan government, and it is our hope that the events leading to Sergeant Bergdahl’s return could potentially open the door for broader discussions with the Taliban by building confidence that the two sides can negotiate honestly with each other,” a senior administration official said. The Obama administration has sought to keep Bergdahl’s profile relatively low over the years, fearing that widespread publicity of his plight would boost his value in the eyes of the Taliban and strengthen the group’s negotiating hand. For a period, White House officials asked that several U.S. newspapers refrain from publishing his name in the context of peace talks. As his hopes dimmed, Bergdahl’s father sought to personally secure his son’s release by learning Pashto and attempting to contact the Taliban online. Bergdahl’s parents had traveled to Washington for a Memorial Day event and stayed in town for a few days to attend meetings with senior U.S. officials. They were in Washington when Obama called them Saturday morning to deliver the news, U.S. officials said. “We were so joyful and relieved when President Obama called us today to give us the news that Bowe is finally coming home!” Bergdahl’s parents said in a statement. “We cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son. Today, we are ecstatic!” In Bergdahl’s home town of Hailey, Idaho, there was jubilation Saturday. Residents had been planning a June 28 concert to call attention to his plight. They were expecting up to 7,000 people to attend, and singer Carole King was going to perform for free. The concert will go on, said organizer Stefanie O’Neill, but it is now going to be “the biggest welcome-home party the country has ever seen.” Kim Harrison, who said she was listed as Bergdahl’s godmother in his military records, said, “I’m excited, I’m kind of numb, and I hope that they take it easy on him when he gets back.” She said she knows Bergdahl as the precocious teenager who took ballet with her daughter and came to spend hours at the Harrison house in Ketchum, Idaho, reading poetry and studying philosophy. She described Bergdahl as a sensitive young man who “questioned everything” and who went to Afghanistan because he wanted to help people. “Now the only thing I can think of worth talking about is protecting him from people criticizing him and trying to find a negative source of why he left in the first place,” she said. Karen DeYoung, traveling in Asia with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Anne Gearan, Julie Tate and Stephanie McCrummen in Washington contributed to this report.","output":"A US soldier named Bergdahl was held by the Taliban for five years. The US government worked with the Qatari government to make a deal to get him back. In exchange for Bergdahl, the US released five Afghan prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. When Bergdahl was released, he was very emotional and cried. US officials said they acted fast to get Bergdahl back because they were worried about his health and safety. Some lawmakers were upset about the deal because they think it will encourage more hostage situations in the future, but many people were happy to have Bergdahl back."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: What is Ischemia or infarction??","output":"Ischemia and infarction are medical conditions related to the blood supply in the body. They are often discussed in the context of cardiovascular disease, but can affect various organs and tissues. Here is a detailed explanation of each term: Ischemia: Ischemia occurs when there is a reduced blood supply to a part of the body. Blood carries vital nutrients and oxygen that cells need to function. When blood flow is restricted or blocked for any reason, it can lead to inadequate oxygen and nutrient delivery, causing the cells in the affected area to become starved and dysfunctional.  Some common causes of ischemia include: 1. Atherosclerosis: Fatty deposits called plaques narrow the arteries, reducing blood flow. 2. Blood clots: Clots can block blood vessels and hinder the blood flow. 3. Vasospasm: Constriction of blood vessels, which can lead to a temporary decrease in blood supply. 4. Compression of blood vessels: Injuries or tumors may compress blood vessels, restricting blood flow. Ischemia can affect various organs, including the heart (myocardial ischemia or angina), brain (cerebral ischemia or stroke), intestines (intestinal ischemia), and limbs (peripheral artery disease). Symptoms can vary depending on the affected organ, and the severity and duration of ischemia. Treatment usually involves restoring blood flow, adopting healthy lifestyle choices, and managing contributing risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Infarction: Infarction refers to the death of tissue resulting from prolonged ischemia. When blood supply to a tissue is insufficient for an extended period, the affected cells are unable to receive adequate oxygen and nutrients, eventually leading to cell death or necrosis. An infarct is the region of dead tissue caused by the ischemic event. The most common types of infarction include: 1. Myocardial infarction (heart attack): Infarction of heart muscle cells due to blocked coronary arteries. 2. Cerebral infarction (stroke): Infarction of brain cells, often caused by a blood clot or atherosclerosis in the cerebral arteries. 3. Renal infarction: Infarction of the kidney, which can result from a clot, atherosclerosis, or other causes of decreased blood flow to the kidney. 4. Pulmonary infarction: Infarction of the lung tissue, usually as a result of a blood clot blocking a pulmonary artery. Treatment for infarction depends on the location and severity of the tissue death. Immediate interventions to restore blood flow and prevent further damage are crucial. Specific treatments may include medications to dissolve clots, anticoagulants, pain relief, supplementary oxygen, surgery, or other specialized therapies. Like ischemia, it's essential to adopt lifestyle changes and address underlying risk factors to prevent infarctions from recurring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It reveals her traumatic  childhood and institutionalisation , followed by her escape to the cul-de-sac where her analyst lived. There, for many years, she made the journey towards recovery through Freudian psychoanalysis. A worldwide bestseller, translated into eighteen languages, it remains one of the most highly-praised books of our age. Jade Millie Murray PS4.99 Jade Wilson is smart, young, black and ambitious. And she's just been given the chance of a lifetime - a try-out for the Commonwealth Games swimming team. Jade lives with her mum, Jojo, a successful business woman. Jojo is overprotective of Jade, but she has her reasons. As a young model with a wonderful career ahead of her, she fell pregnant  with Jade, and, much as she loves her daughter, she's determined not to let anything get in the way of Jade's success. So when Jade starts dating Dicey, there is hell to pay. Will Jade survive her Mum's constant nagging  ? And what if she were to get pregnant - would she, could she, do the same as Jojo and give up her career? As things start hotting up with Dicey, Jade is faced with some very tough choices... . The book is very popular with people all over the world. Question: Which of the following can prove the book The Words to Say it is very successful ? Options: A: It is the first book about psychoanalysis. B: It has a successful beginning and ending. C: It has translated into 18 languages. D: It remains the complete book about personal experiences. A:","output":"Option C: It has translated into 18 languages.  This option can be justified because the translation of a book into many languages often indicates its success.

Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the site for which the responsible Trust warden has chosen to leave the patch of scorched earth rather than seeding it over?, what is it ?

However, access for disabled visitors is regarded as poor. Another issue at the site is litter left behind by visitors; nevertheless, the Pagans who regularly visit often clean up the litter.  In the center of the monument, there is a patch of scorched earth, possibly used by both Pagans and non-Pagans. The Trust warden responsible for the site decided to leave this patch rather than seeding it over. The reason for this choice is to encourage those who set fires to do so in the same spot, thereby keeping the flames further away from the stones."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gage (1823-1860) was an American railroad construction foreman remembered for his improbable[B1]:19 survival of an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe, and for that injury's reported effects on his personality and behavior over the remaining 12 years of his life--effects sufficiently profound (for a time at least) that friends saw him as \\"no longer Gage\\". [H]:14 Long known as the \\"American Crowbar Case\\"--once termed \\"the case which more than all others is calculated to excite our wonder, impair the value of prognosis, and even to subvert our physiological doctrines\\" --Phineas Gage influenced 19th-century discussion about the mind and brain, particularly debate on cerebral localization,  [M]:ch7-9[B] and was perhaps the first case to suggest the brain's role in determining personality, and that damage to specific parts of the brain might induce specific personality changes.  [M]:1,378[M2]:C  :1347  :56 Context: Despite his own optimism, Gage's convalescence was long, difficult, and uneven. Though recognizing his mother and uncle (summoned from Lebanon, New Hampshire, 30 miles away)[H]:12[M]:30 on the morning after the accident, on the second day he \\"lost control of his mind, and became decidedly delirious\\". By the fourth day, he was again \\"rational ... knows his friends\\", and after a week's further improvement Harlow entertained, for the first time, the thought \\"that it was possible for Gage to recover ... This improvement, however, was of short duration.\\"  Beginning 12 days after the accident,[M]:53 Gage was semi-comatose, \\"seldom speaking unless spoken to, and then answering only in monosyllables\\", and on the 13th day Harlow noted, \\"Failing strength ... coma deepened; the globe of the left eye became more protuberant, with [\\"fungus\\"--deteriorated, infected tissue][M]:61,283 pushing out rapidly from the internal canthus [as well as] from the wounded brain, and coming out at the top of the head.\\" By the 14th day, \\"The exhalations from the mouth and head [are] horribly fetid. Comatose, but will answer in monosyllables if aroused. Will not take nourishment unless strongly urged. The friends and attendants are in hourly expectancy of his death, and have his coffin and clothes in readiness.\\"  Galvanized, Harlow \\"cut off the fungi which were sprouting out from the top of the brain and filling the opening, and made free application of caustic [i.e. crystalline silver nitrate][M]:54[H1]:392 to them. With a scalpel I laid open the [frontalis muscle, from the exit wound to the top of the nose][H1]:392 and immediately there were discharged eight ounces [250 ml] of ill-conditioned pus, with blood, and excessively fetid.\\"  (\\"Gage was lucky to encounter Dr. Harlow when he did\\", wrote Barker. \\"Few doctors in 1848 would have had the experience with cerebral abscess with which Harlow left [Jefferson Medical College] and which probably saved Gage's life.\\" [B]:679-80 See SS Factors favoring Gage's survival, below.)  On the 24th day, Gage \\"succeeded in raising himself up, and took one step to his chair\\". One month later, he was walking \\"up and down stairs, and about the house, into the piazza\\", and while Harlow was absent for a week Gage was \\"in the street every day except Sunday\\", his desire to return to his family in New Hampshire being \\"uncontrollable by his friends ... he went without an overcoat and with thin boots; got wet feet and a chill\\". He soon developed a fever, but by mid-November he was \\"feeling better in every respect ... walking about the house again\\". Harlow's prognosis at this point: Gage \\"appears to be in a way of recovering, if he can be controlled\\". Question: Did he fully recover?. Whats the answer?","output":"Phineas Gage did not fully recover. Although he survived the accident and could walk and talk, his personality changed a lot because of the damage to his brain. His friends even said he was \\"no longer Gage.\\" He lived for 12 more years after the accident, but his life was never the same as it was before."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Review: An old vaudeville team of Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other. Over 20 years later they agree to get together for a TV special...but find out they STILL hate each other. Willy's nephew/agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to get them to work together. A big hit in its day and it won George Burns an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I (somewhat) liked it. It was written by Neil Simon so its non-stop one-liners. Some of it was funny but making jokes of Willy and Al's senility was NOT. Also I never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way. Also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly. All that aside this was fun. Burns is just great tossing off one-liners with ease and even Matthau was good matching him. Their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie. Also Benjamin is very good as Willy's nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other. For me it's worth seeing for Burns alone. This jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had ANOTHER hit with \\"Oh God\\". So, this is good. Just good--not great. Matthau's character really makes this hard to love. I give it a 7. Now, what is this review like? OPTIONS: [a]. negative [b]. positive","output":"This review can be considered as [b]. positive, because although the reviewer mentioned some negative aspects, they still enjoyed the movie overall, giving it a 7 and focusing on the performances of George Burns and Richard Benjamin.

Dido's \\"Thank You\\" was released in 1998 as part of her debut album, \\"No Angel.\\" The song became a massive hit and received critical acclaim. Eminem's decision to sample the song was significant in several ways. Firstly, it demonstrated Eminem's ability to appreciate and incorporate various music styles into his work. While Eminem is primarily a hip-hop artist, Dido's music is more closely associated with pop and trip-hop genres. Her song's inclusion in \\"Stan\\" bridged the gap between these styles and expanded the appeal of the track to a wider audience. Secondly, the sampling of \\"Thank You\\" helped to anchor the narrative of \\"Stan\\" and provided an emotional backdrop to Eminem's verses. Dido's haunting vocals and the song's somber tone convey a sense of vulnerability, isolation, and longing, further highlighting the plight of Stan in Eminem's storytelling. Furthermore, Eminem's use of \\"Thank You\\" resulted in increased exposure for Dido and her music. The unlikely collaboration between the two artists led to a surge in Dido's popularity, and the success of \\"Stan\\" brought her work to the attention of a larger global audience. Dido and Eminem even performed \\"Stan\\" together at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. The duo's performance during the award show was widely discussed and analyzed, as the controversial nature of Eminem's lyrics had attracted criticism from several quarters. Nonetheless, the live rendition of \\"Stan\\" was generally well received and was later remembered as a defining moment in the careers of both artists. In conclusion, Eminem's single \\"Stan\\" sampled Dido's \\"Thank You,\\" and their collaboration serves as a notable example of cross-genre music-making. The use of \\"Thank You\\" in \\"Stan\\" not only enhanced the song's narrative and emotional depth, but it also helped propel Dido to international fame."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Collard greens. These were the foods Chris Ross grew up on in rural Kentucky. \\"One of the earliest food memories I have is my grandfather making hamburgers ... my grandmother frying potatoes,\\" he says. \\"Of course, in those days, everything was fried in lard.\\" Ross still enjoys those foods, despite having lost -- and kept off -- more than 100 pounds. He doesn't make substitutions or skip the bun. His weight loss secret isn't really a secret at all. He simply eats less. Ross, the executive chef at Bristol Catering in Louisville, Kentucky, started gaining weight after high school while working in restaurants, first as a waiter, then as a cook. At the time, he was studying law enforcement in college, but in between classes, he came home to watch the Food Network. \\"I just got consumed,\\" he says. He didn't really notice that he had gained 20 or 30 pounds over his freshman year. He ignored the signs when his clothes stopped fitting. Later, when an overweight friend at work mentioned their similarities, he was confused. \\"I never saw it,\\" Ross says. \\"It's a weird realization when you're gaining weight. You think, you're getting older. Maybe it's normal.\\" Then in late 2004, Ross stepped on a scale for the first time in years. The scale, which only went up to 300 pounds, refused to register his weight. That was bad. When he finally found another scale to tell him the truth, it was worse. The 6-foot-2-inch chef was 327 pounds. \\"To realize that you're not just obese, but morbidly obese, it was pretty tough on the mental psyche.\\" Ross started looking at his daily habits a little closer. He switched from regular Coke to Coke Zero and lost 10 pounds over a couple months. Then he picked up a book -- \\"French Women Don't Get Fat\\" by Mireille Guiliano -- that he saw Oprah Winfrey discussing on her show. As a chef, he'd always had a love for Paris. If anything could motivate him, this was it. The book talked about eating smaller portions, drinking water and walking everywhere. So Ross started doing the same. He tried to drink eight glasses of water every day, and he made an effort to walk for at least an hour before or after work. Take upwave's challenge: Drink more water! The book's tips helped him drop another 20 pounds. But it wasn't enough. After reading about a New Orleans chef who had lost weight, Ross decided to conduct an experiment. For one day, he wrote everything that he tasted at his restaurant down on disposable spoons and tossed the spoons into a pan. At the end of the day, he tallied the calories. He had consumed more than 4,000 just from tasting his dishes. \\"Breakfast, lunch, dinner in addition to that -- I was taking in 6,000 calories a day,\\" Ross says. \\"And not being an Olympic athlete, it was kind of hard to burn it off.\\" Ross couldn't stop tasting his food. So he started discreetly spitting out his tastes into the trash. From that point on, nothing could stop him. When he hit 250 pounds, he started jogging. When he lost 10 more pounds, he ran a 5K race. When he got down to 230 pounds, he proposed. Then he and his fiancee started taking a friend's Zumba class. \\"Man, the weight really started falling off then,\\" he says. \\"I'm a 36-year-old white guy with no rhythm. It's a fun exercise when you get over the fact that you feel stupid doing it.\\" By the time the couple married in July 2011, Ross weighed 190 pounds. \\"I think the only way to really consistently lose weight and keep it off is to develop moderation and portion control,\\" he says. \\"You need to eat what you want to eat, just try to maintain control.\\" With three kids and a growing catering company, the days of a 40-hour work week are long gone. Still, Ross makes time to run at least four days a week as he trains for the Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon on April 19. His weight fluctuates. Some days, dinner is a McDonald's double cheeseburger and kid-sized fries. He refuses to give up margarine, despite the FDA's warnings about the health risks of partially hydrogenated oils. But overall, Ross has adopted the healthy lessons he learned in \\"French Women Don't Get Fat.\\" More importantly he's adopted the author's attitude:. \\"The key? Not guilt or deprivation but learning to get the most from the things you most enjoy.\\" Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Question: How long has it been since Jurassic Park was overrun by cloned dinosaurs? Title: The Lost World: Jurassic Park Movie plot: Four years after Jurassic Park was overrun by cloned dinosaurs on the Central American island of Isla Nublar, a young girl named Cathy Bowman wanders around on nearby Isla Sorna during a family vacation, and survives an attack by a swarm of Compsognathus. Her parents file a lawsuit against the genetics company InGen, now headed by John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who plans to use Isla Sorna to relieve the company of financial losses. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm meets Hammond at his mansion. Hammond explains that Isla Sorna, abandoned years earlier during a hurricane, is where InGen created their dinosaurs before moving them to Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar. Hammond hopes to stop InGen by sending a team to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs, to help rally public support against human interference on the island. After learning that his girlfriend, paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding, is part of the team and is already on the island, Ian agrees to go to Isla Sorna, but only to retrieve her. Ian meets his teammates, Eddie Carr, an equipment specialist and engineer, and Nick Van Owen, a video documentarian. After arriving on the island, they locate Sarah and discover that Ian's daughter, Kelly, had stowed away in a trailer being used as a mobile base. They then watch as an InGen team of mercenaries, hunters and paleontologists led by Ludlow arrive to capture several dinosaurs. Meanwhile, team leader Roland Tembo hopes to capture a male Tyrannosaurus by luring it to the cries of its injured infant. That night, Ian's team sneak into the InGen camp and learn the captured dinosaurs will be brought to a newly proposed theme park in San Diego. This prompts Nick and Sarah to free the caged dinosaurs, wreaking havoc upon the camp. Nick also frees the infant T. rex and takes it to the trailer to mend its broken leg. After securing Kelly with Eddie, Ian realizes the infant's parents are searching for it and rushes to the trailer. As soon as Ian arrives, the infant's parents emerge on both sides of the trailer.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve Pink Floyd? ?  Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told The Sunday Times: \\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him.\\" In 2013, Waters said he had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the...

This may feel strange at first. Try to adjust your foot position whenever you can remember. Schedule some time at home to walk around barefoot. This can increase foot dexterity and stretch the muscles. Sit with your legs strait and your feet flat against the wall. Place a pillow underneath your buttocks. Lean forward with your back straight.

Context: Detroit's protracted decline has resulted in severe urban decay and thousands of empty buildings around the city. Some parts of Detroit are so sparsely populated that the city has difficulty providing municipal services. The city has considered various solutions, such as demolishing abandoned homes and buildings; removing street lighting from large portions of the city; and encouraging the small population in certain areas to move to more populated locations.

Here's our equation: -55 - 155 = 18*w - 123*w First, let's add the numbers on the left side: -55 - 155 = -210 So now our equation looks like this: -210 = 18*w - 123*w Next, let's combine the \\"w\\" parts on the right side. If you have 18 of something (18*w) and subtract 123 of the same thing (123*w), you're left with -105 of that thing (-105*w): -210 = -105*w Now, we want to find out what \\"w\\" is, so we need to get \\"w\\" all by itself. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -105: -210 / -105 = -105*w / -105 That simplifies to: 2 = w And there you have it! The value of \\"w\\" that makes the equation true is 2.

News article: Officers continue scouring patch of scrubland including concealed shaft, as others use micro-cameras to inspect drains      Detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have opened manholes and begun searching drains in the Portuguese holiday resort where she went missing in 2007.      A team of British and Portuguese police officers lifted off three manhole covers and used a micro-camera on a long stick to search the underground sewerage system in Praia da Luz on Thursday.      The manholes are around s metres (20ft) from a grave-like hole discovered on Wednesday by officers using ground penetrating radar. Around two dozen journalists, holidaymakers and residents looked on as the work was carried out on a road that borders the six-hectare (15-acre) area of scrubland where the search began on Monday.      Officers continued scouring the patch of overgrown land on Thursday, using two springer spaniels that helped in the search for the murdered Welsh schoolgirl April Jones.      More details have emerged about two key search sites that have become the focus of the investigation over the past three days.      Police search land and undergrowth in the Portuguese resort. Photograph: Virgilio Rodrigues/Barcroft Medi      One of the sites is a concealed shaft in the ground discovered by detectives beneath a sheet of corrugated iron. Forensic officers wearing protective clothing and face masks examined the site for several hours on Wednesday, erecting a white tent to shield their work from the media.      Portuguese newspapers reported on Thursday that this site was a disused storage box where children used to play. The shaft, measuring around 150cm x 90cm (5ft x 3ft), was covered by mounds of earth and a corrugated iron sheet, which is thought to have concealed the hole for years.      Another key area of interest for detectives was the grave-like hole, where officers used ground-penetrating radar before erecting a white tent and carrying out digging work.      Under the headline \\"False grave deceives geo-radar\\", the newspaper Correia da Manhã reported that a site \\"with characteristics similar to a grave\\" was discovered but officers later concluded that it was \\"not compatible with that of a body\\".      Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, the Scotland Yard officer leading the operation, spent about an hour at this site with British officers and Faro's Polícia Judiciária director, Mota Carmo, on Wednesday.      Redwood and his team of British investigators arrived at the search site at 9.30am on Thursday, declining to speak to journalists as his accreditation was checked by armed Portuguese police officers guarding the perimeter of the site.      Scotland Yard has formally applied to extend the ground-level searches into next week. The operation was initially expected to end on Friday but progress has been slow in the meticulous search a short distance from where the then three-year-old girl was last seen. The work is being delayed by a need to clear the sites using strimmers and chainsaws.      Madeleine's parents, Kate, 46, and Gerry, 45, are being kept informed of developments in the first ground-level search since those conducted immediately after their daughter's disappearance on a family holiday in May 2007. ||||| Madeleine McCann police focus search on patch of land      Please turn on JavaScript.

Continue reading the main story Related Stories      Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have focused their efforts on a patch of land on the third day of a fresh search in Praia da Luz.      Officers also began using ground-penetrating radar equipment, which looks for signs of disturbed earth.      Met Police said requests to search two other sites had been granted, and has also asked to extend the current search of scrubland by an extra seven days.      Madeleine was three when she went missing in Portugal in 2007.      British and Portuguese officers have continued a search of 15 acres of cordoned-off scrubland at the Algarve resort. All search efforts on Wednesday have now finished.      The day's main search activity took place within two white tents which were erected on the scrubland, and forensic officers wearing blue overalls and face masks were seen walking in and out of them.      The BBC understands that the tents were put up over a hole in the ground - possibly a disused well - and officers were seen filling buckets with earth, which were then placed into a wheelbarrow. No radar equipment was used near these tents.      Earlier in the day, officers in Metropolitan Police uniforms were driven to a separate part of the cordoned-off area, where they were joined by Portuguese police and local forestry workers with strimmers.      The radar equipment is used to search for signs of disturbed earth      The two white tents were put up on the scrubland in Praia da Luz on Wednesday      The tents are believed to have been set up over a hole in the ground and forensic officers have been at the scene      A man in plain clothes wheeled the radar equipment onto a section of ground that had earlier been cleared.      Officers from the Met and South Wales Police were also working with sniffer dogs and using spades to help sift through the undergrowth.      They were being overseen by the Met's Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, the senior officer investigating the case.      At the scene      Forensic officers have been seen filling buckets with earth      By Lauren Turner      The painstaking search of a site in the resort of Praia da Luz has been continuing, with a forensics officer joining the police team on Wednesday.      Work seems to have been concentrated in one particular area, with police going back and forth to a section of land at the perimeter of the site. Two tents have been erected here - it is unclear if that is to prevent the media from seeing what is being done or to provide shade.      While the police can't be seen from the beach, which is packed with holidaymakers enjoying the Algarve sun, everyone here seems all too aware of the investigation.      Christina, a 35-year-old from Bournemouth on holiday with family and friends, said: \\"We walked down here last night and it was quite scary seeing so many police around.      \\"The atmosphere here feels a bit flat because of what's happening. When you're on holiday you don't want to see police around but it's completely understandable.\\"      Her friend Suzi, 34, said: \\"It's a bit of a shame because it's a lovely place and this does seem to have had an effect on the economy and on the people here.      \\"But if that was your child, you would want everything possible to be done.\\"      Several people the BBC spoke to had not known, before arriving at the resort, that it was the place where Madeleine McCann was last seen.      Josie, 29, from Exeter, on holiday with her partner and one-year-old son, said: \\"It brings it home to you, being here - it makes it feel more real.      \\"We didn't realise when we booked that this was the place. It wasn't until I saw my dad I knew because he told me. I don't know if we would have come here otherwise.      \\"But police have to do what they have to do. We all want the best for the family.\\"      Officers have encountered difficult terrain in the search area      Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.      Portuguese police sources told the BBC the search might be extended if there was a significant find. Officers are believed to have been surprised by the difficulty of the terrain, while the police also need to consider the disruption to local residents.      On Wednesday morning, the national Portuguese newspaper, Correio da Manha, reported that there would be a search of the sewage network around the Ocean Club, where the McCann family was staying when Madeleine disappeared.      Officers were expected to use cameras linked to fibre-optic cables, the paper said. It also reported that the bones of cows and pigs had been unearthed by the search on Tuesday.      A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said there would be no running commentary on the operation.      Two sniffer dogs have been provided by South Wales Police for the search.      The Met launched a fresh investigation into Madeleine's disappearance last July, codenamed Operation Grange.      In March, they said they were seeking an intruder who sexually abused five girls in Portugal between 2004 and 2006.      Detectives said the attacks had happened in holiday villas occupied by UK families in the Algarve.      And last month Scotland Yard said a \\"substantial phase of operational activity\\" in Portugal would start soon. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in 2007 have begun searching drains in the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz.

Write a title for this article: GREEN BAY Wis.—It is 2015. The world has all the technology you could ever dream of. Human knowledge is growing faster than ever. And still, no one has any idea what a “catch” in the NFL is. On Sunday, a classic game at Lambeau Field unfolded as the Green Bay Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys 26-21 to reach the NFC Championship. The game had plenty of highlights—Aaron Rodgers hit Richard Rodgers for a 13-yard touchdown with 9:10 left, which turned out to be the decisive score—but when history remembers this game, it will be for the time America collectively watched an amazing football play and came away thinking: What the heck? The Cowboys faced a fourth-and-2 on the Packers’ 32 yard-line with 4:42 remaining in the fourth quarter—trailing by five points. Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo heaved up a bomb for star receiver Dez Bryant, who had favorable one-on-one coverage. Bryant jumped over the defensive back, Sam Shields, and “caught” the ball falling down to the ground at about the 1-yard line. The ball popped up out of Bryant’s hands when he hit the ground, but that was originally seen as an afterthought. Then something crazy happened: After the Packers challenged the play, referee Gene Steratore ruled the pass incomplete after viewing the replay. The call was correct—by NFL rule, it wasn’t a catch. Dean Blandino, the NFL’s vice president of officiating, said that because Bryant was going to the ground, he must hold onto the ball “throughout the entire process of contracting the ground. He didn’t so it is incomplete.” Sunday was the day that America learned what hard-core football fans already know: That the NFL has made understanding what is and is not a catch one of the most complicated endeavors in sports. The rules of a simple catch read like a rental car contract. There are officially too many rules in football. The NFL’s stance on the matter first became clear in 2010, when Detroit Lions receiver Calvin Johnson looked to have caught a crucial touchdown pass in a game against the Chicago Bears. But the ball hit the ground during the “process” and it was ruled incomplete. “Everyone knows the Calvin Johnson rule,” Aaron Rodgers said Sunday. “I remember watching that film [of Johnson] and saying ‘How the heck is that not a catch?’” Many Cowboys said after the defeat that the game wasn’t about the officials. They had their chances, even leading in the fourth quarter. “It looked to me that he had three feet down and what they describe to us all the time, is a move common to the game,” said Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett. “Dez reached out for the goal line like he’s done so many times, it’s a signature play for him. He maintained possession of it throughout in my opinion, but let me make it really clear: This game wasn’t about officiating.” Still, the NFL faces a bit of a crisis now. Yes, they love controversy, it gets eyeballs and Internet clicks. Everyone will be talking about this all week, then tune in to next week’s games. But that is part of the problem. For the second time in two weeks, everyone is talking about the officials. Last week in Dallas, a controversial pass interference call initially called against Dallas was canceled by the referees, helping the Cowboys beat the Lions. There are a few problems here. The first is that the catch rule is simply too complicated. If you were playing pickup football you would be laughed out of the backyard if you tried to pull this rule out. The second, most general problem, is the “All-Star Crew” rule, in which regular-season officiating crews are broken up for the playoffs, meaning many referees aren’t familiar with the ones they are paired with in the postseason. This leads to some wild outcomes—there were some questionable calls outside of the Bryant “catch.” For instance, in the first half, a reception by Cowboys tight end Jason Witten was spotted about 2 yards from where it should have been. The unfortunate part is that the “catch,” overshadows Rodgers’s performance—he looked unable to move in the first half due to a calf injury yet orchestrated a near-perfect second half to propel his team to victory. The Packers will face the Seattle Seahawks next week for a spot in the Super Bowl. Here’s the question the NFL’s referees must ask themselves: What will we be talking about after that one?

On Wednesday night, 53 prisoners escaped from the Barreto Campelo penitentiary after explosives were used to blow a hole in an outer wall. The prison is located on the island of Itamaracá, around 50km north of the state capital, Recife. By Saturday afternoon, the authorities had succeeded in capturing 13 of the prisoners, when a group of 40 inmates broke out of the Frei Damião de Bozzano jail, part of the Curado prison complex in the western suburbs of Recife, using a similar method. Dramatic CCTV footage shows the men escaping following the explosion of a device planted outside the jail walls. Thirty-six of the inmates have now been captured. Two men were killed during the escape following a shootout with police, a third was hospitalised, and another remains on the run. Investigations are currently underway into how the prisoners managed to escape. Following the latest jail break, the public prosecutor of the state of Pernambuco, Marcellus Ugiette, called for the closure of the Curado complex, arguing that the incident shows the authorities had no control either inside or outside of its prison units. The governor of Pernambuco, Paulo Câmera, acknowledged that the complex had “failings” but said that the state has no money to pay for new prisons. “It’s necessary to keep the prison running and to guarantee the security of the people who live around it,” he said. Escape attempts are frequent in Pernambuco, which has most overcrowded prison system in Brazil. Facilities designed for 10,500 inmates hold around 32,000 people, according to a 2015 Human Rights Watch study. 59% of detainees are awaiting trial and are held with convicted prisoners, in violation of Brazilian law.","output":"Explosive Prison Breaks Expose Overcrowding and Security Issues in Pernambuco, Brazil"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The author of the tweet is describing the heat in Savannah as \\"nearly oppressive\\" and mentions a heat index near 110. These expressions indicate that the temperature is uncomfortably high, making it more likely for the tweet to be conveying a negative sentiment. Although the tweet does not contain any overtly negative language, the adjectives and context used can be considered unfavorable. The phrase \\"nearly oppressive heat\\" conjures an image of an uncomfortable and stifling atmosphere, where day-to-day activities become difficult due to the extreme temperature. Additionally, a heat index of 110 suggests that the weather conditions are not only hot, but also humid, which can amplify feelings of discomfort and unease. Furthermore, the use of ellipses (\\"...\\") after stating the high heat index could imply a sense of frustration or exhaustion due to the hot weather, further reinforcing the negative sentiment. In general, people often associate extreme heat with a decrease in overall well-being, as it can lead to various heat-related health risks, such as dehydration, heatstroke, and heat exhaustion. While it is important to acknowledge there may be some subjectivity in sentiment analysis, and some individuals might perceive this tweet differently, the overall sentiment in the context of the given information leans closer to negative.

Most of Bobby's free time is spent hanging out at a local diner during his lunch and dinner breaks to see his waitress girlfriend, Rayette (Karen Black), who has dreams of singing country music. On weekends, Bobby hangs out in the company of Elton, with whom he bowls, gets drunk, and has sex with other women. Bobby has evidently not told anyone that he is a former classical pianist who comes from an eccentric family of musicians.When Rayette becomes pregnant and his friend Elton is arrested and sent to jail for having robbed a gas station a year earlier, Bobby quits his job and leaves for Los Angeles where his older sister, Partita (Lois Smith), also a pianist, is making a recording. Partita informs him that their father, from whom he is estranged, has suffered two strokes and is now an invalid. She urges him to return to the family home in Washington State.As Rayette has threatened to kill herself if Bobby leaves her, he very reluctantly asks her along to his home town. Driving north, they pick up two women headed for Alaska, one of whom is obsessed about \\"filth.\\" The four of them are thrown out of a restaurant when he gets into an argument with a waitress who refuses to accommodate his special order of a chicken salad. After dropping off the two women (who are implied to be a lesbian couple), Bobby and Rayette check into a roadside motel for the night.The next day, nearing his destination, Bobby, clearly embarrassed by the Southern trailer-trash Rayette's lack of polish and crude manners, tells her to remain at the motel before proceeding to his family home on an island in Puget Sound.Upon arrival at his family's country house, Bobby finds Partita giving their father a haircut, but the old man seems completely oblivious to him.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: One of the symptoms of a full bladder (and bowels) is lower abdominal pressure and tightness, which can feel uncomfortable or ticklish if touched, palpated or probed by a doctor during a medical exam. Having to go to the bathroom urgently can also make you very anxious or nervous, which can heighten ticklishness. Therefore, empty your bladder (and bowels) before heading to your scheduled medical exam.  Avoiding caffeine, a diuretic that triggers frequent urination, for a few hours prior to the exam is also beneficial in this regard. Going to the bathroom prior to a gynecological exam is especially important because the bladder and urethra may be pressed upon directly. Being too cold causes shivering, which is your body's method of warming itself up. However, while you're chilly and shivering, your muscles are either contracting or at least under more tension, which can trigger ticklishness when touched, poked or prodded more easily. Thus, dress appropriately for your medical exam and plan for the office being a little too cool.  If the office is exceptionally cool, ask the doctor or nurse if the temperature can be turned up for your exam. If you have to wear an examination gown or robe, ask the doctor what you can leave on to remain warm — such as your socks, underwear, undershirt, etc. While your doctor is palpating various parts of your body to figure out what's wrong with you, distract your brain a little by rubbing or lightly pinching another part of your body, such as your hand. Distracting your brain by giving it different sensations to process is an effective tool to help reduce pain, sensitivities and even ticklishness.  While your brain is focused on processing the rubbing or pinching sensation that you're creating, it will have trouble registering the doctor's touch (palpation) as ticklish. Even just rubbing your fingers together might be helpful, or scratching the side of your leg. Apply enough pressure to your skin that it's not lightly ticklish, but not too much to cause pain.","output":"When your bladder and bowels are full, your tummy feels tight and ticklish. This can make you feel nervous during a check-up with a doctor. To avoid this, go to the bathroom before your appointment and don't drink things like coffee that make you pee a lot. Also, being too cold can make you shiver and feel ticklish when the doctor touches you. So, wear warm clothes and ask if you can keep some on during the check-up. To feel less ticklish, try pinching or rubbing another part of your body while the doctor checks you. This can help your brain focus on something else and not feel so ticklish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The so-called Gemeinsamer Senat der Obersten Gerichtshöfe (Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts) is not a supreme court in itself, but an ad-hoc body that is convened in only when one supreme court intends to diverge from another supreme court's legal opinion or when a certain case exceeds the authority of one court.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I have a new situation: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.  But I can use this background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  What is an answer for this question: Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?","output":"To answer the question, we need to examine how the concentration of reactants would change in Cases A and B by applying Le Châtelier's principle.  Case A: In this case, the forward reaction is favored. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentration of products increases, and the concentration of reactants decreases.  Case B: In this case, the reverse reaction is favored. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentration of products decreases, and the concentration of reactants increases. Now we can compare the reactants' concentration in case A and case B: In case A, the reactants' concentration decreased due to the forward reaction being favored. In case B, the reactants' concentration increased because the reverse reaction was favored. So, the reactants' concentration would be higher in case B than in case A."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pumbaa's protest over this eventually prompts Timon to share his backstory (going way back, to before the beginning of the first movie). Timon is a social outcast in his meerkat colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands due to frequently messing things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his mother Ma, Timon dreams for more in life than his colony's bleak existence hiding from predators. One day, he is assigned as a sentry, but his daydreaming nearly leads to the near-death of his Uncle Max by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. This becomes the last straw for the colony, prompting Timon to leave to find a better life. He meets Rafiki, who teaches him about \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and advises him to \\"look beyond what you see\\". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming","output":"To assess the sentiment of the movie review sentence, \\"like locusts in a horde, these things will keep coming,\\" let's break down the different aspects of the statement and analyze its intended meaning. The phrase \\"like locusts in a horde\\" is a simile comparing the subject (assumed to be an aspect or element of the movie) to locusts in a horde. Locusts are often viewed as harmful insects that swarm in large numbers, causing destruction to crops and other vegetation. When locusts gather in a horde, they can have a significantly negative environmental impact. The comparison emphasizes the overwhelming, unavoidable, and potentially destructive nature of the subject discussed in the review. The second half of the sentence, \\"these things will keep coming,\\" reinforces the idea that the subject of the review is recurrent and persistent. This implies that the reviewer perceives this aspect of the movie as repetitive or tedious. Taking into account the aforementioned analysis, the sentiment of the movie review sentence is primarily negative. By employing a simile using locusts, the reviewer conveys an unfavorable view of a particular element of the movie, emphasizing its overwhelming and destructive nature. Additionally, the indication that \\"these things will keep coming\\" implies dissatisfaction with the movie's repetitiveness, further supporting the negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company. While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk. It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning. And right now, there wasn't even much to talk about during cigarette breaks. Warm did not hide the fact he would have preferred to fuse with a mouse, or a mouse pad. Right now, all he could do was to pretend he totally ignored the fact he was physically stuck to a chair. And he was doing just fine until it was time to go to his second shift at 1-0 Computer Associates, where he had been working on a program for the management of empty space in staff lockers in telecommunications companies.

We ask you to answer the question by classifying the answer as 0 (False) or 1 (True) Passage: Bee sting -- Drone bees, the males, are larger and do not have stingers. The female bees (worker bees and queens) are the only ones that can sting, and their stinger is a modified ovipositor. The queen bee has a barbed but smoother stinger and can, if need be, sting skin-bearing creatures multiple times, but the queen does not leave the hive under normal conditions. Her sting is not for defense of the hive; she only uses it for dispatching rival queens, ideally before they can emerge from their cells. Queen breeders who handle multiple queens and have the queen odor on their hands are sometimes stung by a queen. Question: do all bees lose their stinger when they sting you","output":"Based on the passage, not all bees lose their stinger when they sting. The queen bee has a smoother stinger and can sting multiple times, unlike worker bees whose stinger is barbed and can get stuck.

The ad featured a photo of a cow behind a piece of barbed wire and the headline \\"Humane milk is a myth. Don't buy it.\\" The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it was \\"unlikely to materially mislead readers\\". The national newspaper advert for campaign group Go Vegan World goes on to state: \\"I went vegan the day I visited a dairy. The mothers, still bloody from birth, searched and called frantically for their babies. \\"Their daughters, fresh from their mothers' wombs but separated from them, trembled and cried piteously, drinking milk from rubber teats on the wall instead of their mothers' nurturing bodies. All because humans take their milk.\\" The ASA said seven complainants, some of whom had experience working in the dairy industry, suggested the claims were misleading and questioned whether they could be substantiated. Go Vegan World said the advert did not state or imply that calves were separated from their mothers prior to the 12 to 24 hours recommended by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). But they said they believed the exact timing was irrelevant, and most people would consider separation at 25 hours equally as unjust as separation at 24 hours. Clearing the advert, the ASA said it understood the complainants were concerned the advert implied a significant number of dairy farms did not comply with animal welfare standards in place in the UK, and milk production was therefore \\"inhumane\\" in that sense.

Context: Coming off their home win over the Cowboys, the Giants flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 10 NFC East duel with the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday Night Football.  In the first quarter, New York trailed early as Eagles WR DeSean Jackson got a 9-yard TD run.  The Giants responded with QB Eli Manning completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Plaxico Burress, along with kicker John Carney getting a 27-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Giants increased their lead as Manning completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Kevin Boss.  Philadelphia responded with QB Donovan McNabb completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Jason Avant.  New York answered right back as Carney got a 26-yard field goal.  The Eagles would close out the half as kicker David Akers got a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Philadelphia took the lead as McNabb completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR Hank Baskett.  The Giants replied with RB Brandon Jacobs getting a 3-yard TD run.  New York increased their lead as Carney nailed a 28-yard field goal, along with Jacobs getting another 3-yard TD run (with a failed 2-point conversion).  The Eagles tried to come back as McNabb completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Curtis. Big Blue's defense managed to prevent any possible comeback, preserving the lead. Question: Which player caught a touchdown for the most yards in the first quarter? Answer:","output":"The player who caught a touchdown for the most yards in the first quarter was Plaxico Burress. This came about through a 17-yard TD pass from QB Eli Manning. Even though the Eagles' WR DeSean Jackson also scored a touchdown in the first quarter, his was a 9-yard TD run, which is shorter compared to Burress's 17-yard catch. Consequently, among the players who scored touchdowns in the first quarter - DeSean Jackson for the Eagles and Plaxico Burress for the Giants - Burress had the most yards with his 17-yard touchdown. It's important to note that in football, yards are a critical measure of advancement and a higher number of yards typically indicates a more significant play. So, in this scenario, Burress's 17-yard TD catch stands as the longest touchdown in the first quarter of this Week 10 NFC East duel between the Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In January 2010, Mauboy signed to Universal Music for an exclusive worldwide long-term publishing agreement. In May 2010, Mauboy collaborated with four other international artists representing their continents--Sean Kingston representing America, Jody Williams representing Africa, Tabitha Nauser (Asia), Steve Appleton (Europe), with Mauboy representing Oceania--on the theme song for the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics titled \\"Everyone\\". Mauboy, Williams, Nauser and Appleton performed \\"Everyone\\" at the opening of the Youth Olympics held in Singapore on 14 August 2010. Kingston was unable to attend the performance, due to a passport mix-up. Mauboy released her second studio album Get 'Em Girls on 5 November 2010; it debuted at number six and was certified gold. She had travelled to the United States in February of that year to work on the album in Los Angeles, New York, and Atlanta with American songwriters and producers, most of whom she had not worked with previously. Mauboy co-wrote eight of the album's songs. Get 'Em Girls received mixed reviews from critics. Majhid Heath of ABC Online Indigenous gave the album two-and-a-half out of five stars, writing that it's a \\"non-cohesive mess of similar sounding, auto-tuned ravaged pop/R&B that diminishes the talent of this brilliant young songstress\\".  The album's title track, featuring American rapper Snoop Dogg, peaked at number 19. Mauboy performed \\"Get 'Em Girls\\" at the 2010 Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards, where she co-hosted the award ceremony with Liam Hemsworth and Jerry Trainor, and won the award for Fave Aussie Muso. The following singles, \\"Saturday Night\\" featuring American rapper Ludacris and \\"What Happened to Us\\" featuring English singer Jay Sean, peaked at numbers seven and 14, respectively.

In April 2011, she served as a support act for Chris Brown's Australian leg of his F.A.M.E. Tour.  Get 'Em Girls was re-released as a deluxe edition on 12 August 2011, which included the singles \\"Inescapable\\" and \\"Galaxy\\" featuring Stan Walker. The former single peaked at number four and was certified double platinum, while the latter peaked at number 13 and was certified platinum. \\"Galaxy\\" also reached number 36 on the New Zealand Singles Chart and became Mauboy's first single to chart in that country. On 17 November 2011, Mauboy performed for the Australian troops at RAAF Base Darwin, ahead of US President Barack Obama's visit to the place. In January 2012, Mauboy and Walker embarked on their Galaxy Tour across Australia, which served as her first headlining tour. Mauboy recorded 15 songs for The Sapphires' soundtrack album, which was released on 27 July 2012. The album debuted at number one and was certified platinum.

David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a \\"Daniel Vavinsky,\\" published in 2008 in Actualité Juive in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.The court established that \\"Daniel Vavinsky\\" was a pseudonym for Clément Weill-Raynal, a deputy editor at France 3. In 2011 it ruled that David and Actualité Juive had defamed Jamal. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of Actualité Juive, were fined €5,000 each, and Actualité Juive was ordered to print a retraction. The Israeli government said it would fund David's appeal. The appeal was upheld in 2012; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli's prime minister, telephoned David to congratulate him. Jamal Al-Durrah said he would appeal the court's decision.In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote in Haaretz that he had examined Jamal's 50-page medical file, and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were \\"completely different wounds\\" from the 1994 injuries.

But in September 1984, Maria is shot and killed, and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire. When the police commence their investigations, however, they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls: Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a second mortgage of 100,000 in Maria's name, and is having an affair with a married neighbor, Felice Richmond (Robin Strasser). Maria had known of the affair, and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed. Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance, and he immediately becomes the prime suspect. At first, Rob's friends and sons support him. But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria's death, and Rob's best friend Sal (Joe Spano) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice. Rob is advised by his lawyer not to contact Felice because it could influence his image; this troubles Rob, who is deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, the police have expanded their list of suspects to include Andrew Meyers (Jake Dengel), a Louisiana shop clerk who had contact with Rob concerning his financial problems, and Arnie Eggers, a rumored hitman. As all evidence seems to point to Rob, Felice breaks off their relationship, which leads him to unsuccessfully attempt suicide in a motel. By this point, Chris admits for the first time that he suspects his father might in fact be guilty. Roby and John are both shocked to hear this, strongly believing in their father's innocence.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Which entity is this text about? Louis Burton Lindley Jr. was born in Kingsburg, California, the son of Sally Mosher (nee Turk) and Louis Bert Lindley Sr., a Texas-born dairy farmer. Young Lindley was an excellent horse rider from an early age. Known as \\"Bert\\" to his family and friends, he grew bored with dairy farming and began to make a few dollars by riding broncos and roping steers in his early teens. His father found out and forbade this activity but he took no notice, went to compete in a rodeo, and was told by the doubtful rodeo manager that there would be \\"slim pickin's\\" for him. After nearly 20 years of rodeo work, his distinctive Oklahoma-Texas drawl (though he was a lifelong Californian), his wide eyes, moon face, and strong physical presence gained him a role in the Western film film Rocky Mountain (1950) starring Errol Flynn. He appeared in many more Westerns, playing both villains and comic sidekicks to the likes of Rex Allen.  Hollywood made good use of Pickens' rodeo background. He did not need a stand-in for horseback scenes, and he was able to gallop his own Appaloosa horses across the desert, or drive a stagecoach pulled by a six-horse team. In a large number of films and TV shows, he wore his own hats and boots, and rode his own horses and mules.  Pickens appeared in dozens of films, including Rocky Mountain (1950), Old Oklahoma Plains (1952), Down Laredo Way (1953), Tonka (1959), One-Eyed Jacks (1961) with Marlon Brando, Dr. Strangelove (1964), Major Dundee (1965) with Charlton Heston, the remake of Stagecoach (1966; Pickens played the driver, portrayed in the 1939 film by Andy Devine), Never a Dull Moment (1968), The Cowboys (1972) with John Wayne, Ginger in the Morning (1974) with Fred Ward, Blazing Saddles (1974), Poor Pretty Eddie (1975), Rancho Deluxe (1975), The Getaway with Steve McQueen, Tom Horn (1980), also with McQueen, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979) with Michael Caine and Karl Malden, An Eye for an Eye (1966) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973). He had a small but memorable role in Steven Spielberg's 1941 (1979) in scenes with Toshiro Mifune and Christopher Lee; during one scene, he enumerates the objects on his person, similar to the way he does in the \\"Survival Kit Contents Check\\" scene in Dr. Strangelove. In 1978, Pickens lent his voice to theme park Silver Dollar City as a character named Rube Dugan, for a ride called \\"Rube Dugan's Diving Bell\\". The diving bell was a simulation ride that took passengers on a journey to the bottom of Lake Silver and back. The ride was in operation from 1978 to 1984. He also played werewolf sheriff Sam Newfield in The Howling (1981).  In 1960, he appeared in the NBC Western series, Overland Trail in the episode \\"Sour Annie\\" with fellow guest stars Mercedes McCambridge and Andrew Prine. Pickens appeared five times on NBC's Outlaws (1960-62) Western series as the character \\"Slim\\". The program, starring Barton MacLane, was the story of a U.S. marshal in Oklahoma Territory -- deputies played by Don Collier, Jock Gaynor, and Bruce Yarnell -- and the outlaws that they pursued. In 1967, Pickens had a recurring role as the scout California Joe Milner on the ABC military Western Custer, starring Wayne Maunder in the title role.  In 1975, Pickens was in another Western, playing the evil, limping bank robber in Walt Disney's The Apple Dumpling Gang; that same year, the exploitation classic Poor Pretty Eddie was released, with Pickens portraying twisted Sheriff Orville. He provided the voice of B.O.B. in the 1979 Disney science-fiction thriller The Black Hole. His last film was his least notable, Pink Motel (1982) with Phyllis Diller.

Here are some reviews for a movie: 1. The simple jokes ... work best here, and the screenplay struggles as the pair completely loses focus on their goal. 2. It's a comedy that's chosen to build itself on some pretty heavy issues, issues which it's all for addressing with some pretty horrible ideas about the way relationships work. 3. Haphazardly conceived, phlegmatically paced, lazily filmed and punctuated with gratuitous moments of sexual and scatological slapstick.. 4. An occasionally funny comedy with slow stretches that has directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly returning to their trademark gross-out humor. 5.

The lead actors, Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis, are described as being likable, but this factor doesn't seem to have enhanced the viewers' experience significantly. The Farrelly brothers' direction and choice to return to their trademark gross-out humor is also met with lukewarm responses. Although there are mentions of occasional humor and a few positive aspects, these moments do not seem to redeem the film as a whole, and it is considered relatively disappointing, with some reviewers even suggesting avoiding the movie altogether."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Galician.

Determine the type of cast you have. Know when to see the doctor. Article:","output":"Title: Taking Care of Body Casts – Tips for the Bathroom and Beyond Introduction Body casts are essential in supporting the healing process for individuals who have suffered fractures, dislocations, and other musculoskeletal injuries. They help to immobilize the affected body part, allowing proper alignment and minimizing pain experienced during recovery. However, maintaining personal hygiene and everyday activities, particularly using the bathroom, can be challenging for someone with a body cast. This article aims to guide you through the necessary precautions when it comes to caring for your cast while using the bathroom, along with other essential tips for maintaining the integrity of your body cast. Understanding Your Cast First and foremost, it is crucial to know the type of cast you have applied to your body. There are two primary types of body casts: plaster casts and synthetic casts. Plaster casts are made from a combination of water and plaster powder, whereas synthetic casts often consist of fiberglass material. It is essential to know which type of cast you have, as this will determine the appropriate care measures to take. Using the Bathroom One of the main concerns when using the bathroom with a body cast is ensuring that the cast remains secure and dry. Here are some helpful tips to consider: 1. Preparation is key: Before entering the bathroom, gather all necessary items such as toilet paper, wipes, and any other toiletries you will need. Having everything within reach will prevent you from struggling and potentially damaging your cast. 2. Use additional support: Depending on the location of your cast, you may need to use a shower chair or railings to support your body. This will not only aid in maintaining balance but also help to avoid straining any injured areas. 3. Keep your cast dry: Avoid soaking your cast in water, as doing so may weaken and compromise its structural integrity. Use a waterproof cast cover or plastic bag to protect the cast from getting wet, especially when taking a shower. 4. Maintain a clean and dry cast: After using the bathroom, ensure that your cast is dry and free of any moisture or residue. This will prevent complications like skin irritation and infections. Avoiding Deodorizers and Personal Care Products While it is important to maintain good personal hygiene, some products can be harmful to your body cast. Avoid using deodorizers, powders, and lotions on or near the cast, as these can cause the material to break down and compromise its effectiveness. In addition, refrain from inserting any objects under the cast to scratch or clean your skin. Doing so may cause skin irritation and increase the risk of infection. When to Consult a Doctor Be vigilant about monitoring the condition of your cast and the healing process. If you notice any changes that raise concerns, contact your doctor immediately. Potential issues include: 1. Signs of infection: Swelling, redness, increased pain, or a foul smell coming from the cast area should be reported to your doctor, as these could indicate an underlying infection. 2. Damaged cast: A crack, softening, or general wear in your body cast could indicate it is no longer effectively supporting your injury. Seek medical attention to have your cast replaced or repaired. 3. Persistent discomfort and pain: If you are experiencing persistent pain or discomfort that doesn't improve with time, consult your doctor to adjust your cast or discuss alternative treatment options. Conclusion Taking care of your body cast is a crucial part of your recovery journey. By knowing the type of cast you have, following appropriate bathroom practices, and recognizing when to seek medical assistance, you can ensure the best possible outcome for your healing process. Remember, your health and well-being should be your top priority, so take the necessary precautions and collaborate with your healthcare providers to enable a safe and swift recovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: what is a social security number in the uk?","output":"In the United Kingdom, there isn't an exact equivalent to the United States' Social Security Number (SSN). However, the National Insurance Number (NINo) shares some similarities with the U.S. SSN, serving as a unique personal identifier for various social benefit purposes. The National Insurance Number (NINo) is an alphanumeric code issued by the UK's Department for Work and Pensions to citizens and residents to track their National Insurance (NI) contributions. It plays a crucial role in the administration of various social benefits and welfare schemes, such as state pensions, unemployment benefits, and healthcare services provided through the National Health Service (NHS). A NINo generally consists of two letters, followed by six digits and a final letter, for example, AB123456C. This unique identifier ensures accurate recording of an individual's NI contributions and tax payments, which in turn are used for eligibility assessment in various government programs and services. Here are some of the main features and functions of the UK's National Insurance Number: 1. Tax and National Insurance Contributions: The NINo is used by employers to deduct the correct amount of income tax and NI contributions from employees' wages. It is also used by self-employed individuals when filing their tax returns to calculate their NI liabilities. 2. State Benefits and Pensions: The NINo is essential for claiming various state benefits, such as Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Universal Credit, and Carer's Allowance. Additionally, when an individual reaches the state pension age, their NI contributions are assessed based on their NINo records to determine their eligibility and pension amount. 3. Healthcare Services: Although the NINo is not a mandatory requirement for accessing healthcare services through the National Health Service (NHS), it can be requested by medical providers as a way to verify a person's eligibility for subsidized treatment. 4. Proof of Identity: The NINo is sometimes used as a method of identification in certain situations, such as applying for government programs or dealing with financial institutions. It is important to note that the National Insurance Number is not intended to serve as a general identification number. While there is no equivalent UK system to the U.S. Social Security Number, the NINo fulfills some of the same purposes, primarily in the realms of taxation, social benefits, pensions, and health services."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think of it like stacking toy blocks: (213 - 171 + 397 + 267) * x + 92486 = 0 That simplifies to: 706 * x + 92486 = 0 Now, we need to get the \\"x\\" alone, so let's move the 92486 to the other side by subtracting it: 706 * x = -92486 Now, to find out what \\"x\\" is, we need to divide both sides by 706: x = -92486 / 706 And when you do the math, you'll find out that: x = -131 So, little buddy, we've discovered that \\"x\\" equals -131 in this math puzzle!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory. Question: With whom did the author spend her day of laziness? Answer: Pick your answer from: 1). not enough information; 2). her two children; 3). Her husband; 4). John; Answer:","output":"The author spent her day of laziness with her oldest son, who was about a year old at the time.

He says that \\"the color of leaves on deciduous trees usually changes in the autumn season\\" and \\"mulberry trees are deciduous\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","output":"Given the hints provided by your teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What do mulberry trees do in the autumn?\\" would be (i). Change colors. The teacher's hints emphasized that mulberry trees are deciduous, which means they shed their leaves seasonally. Autumn is the season when deciduous trees undergo significant changes, especially in their foliage. The leaves of deciduous trees change color due to the cessation of chlorophyll production as temperatures decrease and daylight hours shorten. Chlorophyll is responsible for the green color of leaves, and as it breaks down, other pigments such as carotenes and anthocyanins become more visible, giving leaves their characteristic autumn hues such as orange, yellow, and red. As the mulberry tree is a deciduous tree, it follows the same pattern of leaf color change during the autumn season. The process of color change in leaves is called senescence, and it is accompanied by the eventual shedding of leaves as the tree prepares for winter dormancy. The color-changing process is an important aspect of a mulberry tree's life cycle, enabling it to conserve energy during the colder months when photosynthesis is less efficient. It also has ecological benefits, as the fallen leaves decompose and provide nutrients for the tree and its surrounding soil, supporting overall forest health. In conclusion, based on your teacher's hints, the most accurate answer for the quiz question \\"What do mulberry trees do in the autumn?\\" is (i). Change colors, as this aligns with the characteristic behavior of deciduous trees during the autumn season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article with the title: \\"In SoHo, an AprÃ¨s-Studio Apartment\\" Article:","output":"Title: In SoHo, an Après-Studio Apartment Introduction Nestled within the heart of Manhattan lies the bustling neighborhood of SoHo, known for its rich history, architectural beauty, and vibrant art and fashion scenes. Synonymous with luxury, this trendy locale is home to numerous upscale boutiques, art galleries, and posh eateries. Amidst this opulence, one can find a unique living experience— the après-studio apartment. This chic, modern concept is taking the urban living world by storm, as it combines the simplicity of a studio with the sophistication of larger, more extravagant living spaces. Concept and Origins The après-studio apartment encapsulates an innovative approach to urban dwelling, born out of a need to elevate the traditional studio apartment experience. Historically, a studio flat includes a bedroom, living room, and kitchen all combined within a single room. While offering affordability and ease in terms of maintenance, these spaces often limit creativity in design and furnishings due to a lack of available space. The concept of the après-studio reimagines this style of living, maintaining the compact nature of a studio, but with an air of elevated luxury and refinement. Design Elements To facilitate this shift in perspective, après-studio apartments incorporate design elements that maximize space utilization while simultaneously allowing residents to indulge in sophisticated, high-end aesthetics. Key strategies in achieving this balance include: 1. Multi-functional Furniture: Furnishings that feature multiple functions facilitate space-saving while increasing overall efficiency. This includes fold-out beds that transform into sofas, wall-mounted dining tables, and storage solution pieces like built-in wardrobe units, sliding bookcases, or lofted bed platforms with drawer units beneath. 2. Open Floor Layouts: By removing traditional barriers between various living areas, an open floor concept generates an illusion of spaciousness within the compact confines of a studio. This layout not only encourages natural light distribution throughout the apartment but also promotes a unified, cohesive design aesthetic. 3. Strategic Use of Colors and Textures: Selecting light wall colors, such as whites or neutrals, can remarkably expand the perception of spaces. Incorporating reflective surfaces and materials — for example, mirrors, tiles with a glossy finish, and polished metals— can heighten this effect. In contrast, adding precisely curated splashes of color and rich textures can contribute to a distinct ambiance and charm. 4. Smart Storage Solutions: Creative storage techniques can dramatically impact apartment functionality. Simple ideas such as mounting shelves or cabinetry on walls, installing vertical storage racks in closets, or adding hooks for hanging items help effectively organize and declutter living spaces. 5. Luxury Additions: The inclusion of high-end finishes and fixtures, such as stainless steel appliances, marble countertops, and sleek lighting installations, elevates the overall sense of refinement and sophistication in après-studio apartments. The SoHo Influence SoHo's reputation as a cultural and avant-garde epicenter renders it the ideal backdrop for après-studio living. The neighborhood's historic cast-iron buildings and cobblestone streets lend a distinctive character to these spaces, merging seamlessly with contemporary design features. The abundance of nearby galleries, upscale shopping, and eclectic dining establishes an invigorating symbiosis between artistic pursuits and urban dwelling, further enhancing the appeal of the après-studio apartment. Conclusion In a city as dynamic and bustling as New York, the après-studio apartment reflects a compelling alternative to traditional studio living, striking a balance between minimalism, luxury, and space efficiency. Offering a truly unique housing concept, SoHo's après-studios embody the perfect marriage between modern design and historic architecture, resulting in an elevated living experience designed for the discerning urbanite."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Syriana Movie plot: U.S. energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption. Emir storyline[edit] Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer a question about the following article about Antenna (radio): The difference in the above factors for the case of θ=0 is the reason that most broadcasting (transmissions intended for the public) uses vertical polarization. For receivers near the ground, horizontally polarized transmissions suffer cancellation. For best reception the receiving antennas for these signals are likewise vertically polarized. In some applications where the receiving antenna must work in any position, as in mobile phones, the base station antennas use mixed polarization, such as linear polarization at an angle (with both vertical and horizontal components) or circular polarization. What is one use that would require an antenna to receive signals in various ways at once?","output":"One prominent use that requires an antenna to receive signals in various ways at once is in mobile communications, particularly in the case of mobile phones or cellular networks. In normal situations, a specific directional orientation of the antenna is required to receive signals, which are based on the polarization adopted by the broadcasting station. However, mobile devices pose a unique challenge since it's practically impossible to maintain a constant alignment due to their portable nature.  As mobile phones are constantly moving and can be held in any position – upright, sideways, or even upside down – the orientation of their internal antennas is continuously changing in relation to the base station they are connecting to. This non-fixed orientation necessitates the requirement for an antenna capable of receiving signals in all directions, or in other words, in various ways at once.  To address this, base station antennas often use mixed polarization to ensure that they can communicate effectively with mobile devices in any orientation. This may involve linear polarization at an angle (which has both vertical and horizontal components), ensuring the bases can cover both vertical and horizontal planes. Alternatively, they may use circular polarization, which has the capacity to receive signals from any plane of orientation.  Moreover, using mixed polarization can help improve the quality of the signal received and reduce the cancellation effect that could occur due to environmental elements, such as reflections and obstacles. It can greatly enhance the reliability and quality of mobile communication, providing uninterrupted service regardless of how or where the mobile device is positioned relative to the base station."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kathryn promises Mrs. Caldwell that she will look out for the naive Cecile. Kathryn's stepbrother, Sebastian Valmont, enters the room, whereupon Mrs. Caldwell reacts to him coldly and leaves with Cecile.  Kathryn reveals to Sebastian that her real intention is to use Cecile to take revenge on her ex-lover Court Reynolds, who dumped her for Cecile. Kathryn asks Sebastian to seduce Cecile, thereby rendering her a \\"tramp\\" and spoiling her in Court's eyes.  Sebastian refuses as he is planning to seduce Annette Hargrove, the virgin daughter of their prep school's new headmaster who published an essay in support of chastity until marriage. After some negotiation, the two step-siblings agree on a wager: If Sebastian fails to bed Annette, Kathryn gets Sebastian's vintage Jaguar XK140; if he succeeds, Kathryn will have sex with him, as Kathryn is the one girl Sebastian has failed to bed.  Sebastian's first attempt to seduce Annette fails, as she had already been told of his bad reputation.

Jason Kidd announced his retirement Monday after 19 seasons as one of the best passing and rebounding point guards in NBA history.      The thought of retirement first began to creep into the New York Knicks point guard's mind around the All-Star break. But he didn't think seriously about it until recently. Over the weekend at a wedding in Georgia he made the decision.      \\"I think it is the right time,\\" Kidd told ESPNNewYork.com. \\"When you think about 19 years, it has been a heckuva ride. Physically, I want to be able to participate in activities with my kids so it has taken a toll. It is time to move on and think about maybe coaching or doing some broadcasting.      \\"Jeff [Schwartz] and I and my family had been talking this past weekend,\\" Kidd added of his agent. \\"We talked a lot and we felt it was the right time to move on and so we notified the Knicks. They were kind of taken aback. We told them [earlier] that I wanted to come back and play. But this weekend was when we got a chance to relax [and really think about it]. It is the right thing to do.\\"      Kidd, 40, leaves the game as a sure-fire Hall of Fame point guard. The 10-time All-Star led the NBA in assists five times and finished second all-time in assists and steals behind John Stockton.      Kidd, who had two years remaining on his contract at just more than 3 million per year, leaves with a legacy that includes an NBA championship with the Dallas Mavericks and two Olympic gold medals with Team USA.      \\"The two things that are probably tied for first are winning a championship with the Mavericks and also being able to win a gold medal -- two gold medals with Team USA,\\" Kidd said of what he's most proud of in his career. \\"And then underneath that will probably be sharing Rookie of the Year with Grant [Hill].\\"      Hill, also 40, announced his retirement on Saturday.      During his prime, the versatile Kidd was like an instant fast break due to his uncanny court vision, instincts and ability to rebound. The 6-foot-4 Oakland, Calif., native, who was one of the most hyped high school prospects of his generation, had more triple-doubles (107) than anyone outside of Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson.      Kidd averaged 12.6 points, 8.7 assists, 6.3 rebounds and 1.9 steals in 1,391 regular-season games. He took great pride in his ability to make teammates better and his knack for turning teams around.      \\"The biggest thing is winning,\\" Kidd said of what he wants to be remembered for. \\"No matter what percentage, no matter what my numbers say in the sense of points, assists, rebounds and steals, it's always been about winning. And it will always be about winning … making my teammates better.\\"      The second overall pick out of California in the 1994 draft entered the league as part of the \\"Three J's\\" with Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn in Dallas. Kidd sparked the Mavericks to a 36-win season -- a 23-game improvement from the season before -- to earn co-Rookie of the Year honors with Hill.      After being dealt to the Suns two and a half seasons later, Kidd led the team to a 16-game improvement in his first full season in Phoenix in 1997-98.      And then after being traded to New Jersey in 2001, Kidd transformed the Nets into instant contenders. With Kidd playing at an MVP level, the Nets won 52 games -- a 26-game leap from the season before. It was the Nets' first 50-win season in their NBA history. Kidd also lifted the franchise to the first of two consecutive NBA Finals appearances.      \\"What we accomplished in New Jersey with the Nets, from the bottom and being able to get to the Finals, back to back, that was really special,\\" Kidd said.      After losing to Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan in back-to-back NBA Finals, Kidd finally got his coveted championship ring as a Maverick. Teaming up with Dirk Nowitzki, Kidd topped LeBron James and the Heat in six games in 2010-11. In his 19th and final season, Kidd signed with the Knicks and helped them win 54 games, an 18-game improvement from the season before. It was the franchise's first 50-win season since 1999-2000.      The Knicks, though, were eliminated in the second round by Indiana in six games. Kidd struggled in the postseason, failing to make a basket in his last 10 playoff games. ||||| According to the New York Knicks, Jason Kidd will retire after 19 seasons in the NBA.      Grant Hill, who shared the rookie of the year honor with Kidd in 1995, also retired over the weekend.      That leaves just one player left in the league from the 1994 draft class -- Miami Heat veteran Juwan Howard. Howard is a year older than Lakers guard Steve Nash, but shares the same birthday.      Nash, born Feb. 7, 1974, is now the second-oldest player in the league, and with Kidd and Hill retiring (both 40), the oldest player under contract past the current season. Nash still has two more seasons on his deal with the Lakers for a total of 19 million.      In his first year with the Lakers, the veteran point guard struggled to stay healthy -- missing 32 regular season games (broken leg, hip, hamstring, nerve issues). By the postseason he just didn't have the strength to play and the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs.      Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash were drafted in 1996. The 1995 draft class is represented by Kevin Garnett, who still has another two years left on his deal with the Boston Celtics, and Jerry Stackhouse, whose contract with the Brooklyn Nets is expiring. Kurt Thomas was also drafted in 1995 but has yet to formally retire.      Other players drafted in 1996 who haven't retired include Derek Fisher, Marcus Camby and Ray Allen.      Bryant has played through 17 seasons but at 34, he's not among the 20 oldest players in the NBA -- Jason Terry Kenyon Martin and a number of others are older than Bryant.

There are overlapping coverages on your insurance policies.","output":"No, the term \\"coverage\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. Although both instances use the word \\"coverage,\\" they refer to two different concepts. Let's examine the contexts in which the word is being used in each sentence: 1. \\"They accused the paper of biased coverage of race relations.\\" In this sentence, \\"coverage\\" refers to the way a topic or subject is reported, analyzed, or represented by a news medium, such as a newspaper, television station, or digital news platform. Coverage, in this context, often conveys the portrayal, tone, and the depth of the stories that get reported. Here, the accusation implies that the paper is unfairly or disproportionately representing the topic of race relations. This can involve presenting one-sided arguments, omitting certain facts or perspectives, or favoring a particular group or narrative while neglecting or downplaying others. Hence, \\"coverage\\" in this context refers to the overall reporting or presentation of a subject by the news medium.  2. \\"There are overlapping coverages on your insurance policies.\\" In this sentence, \\"coverage\\" refers to the protection or financial security provided by an insurance policy. In the context of insurance, coverage is the extent to which the specific risks or damages are insured by the policy, and the monetary limits or extent of these guarantees. \\"Overlapping coverage\\" occurs when a policyholder has multiple insurance policies that provide coverage for the same risks or damages, which can lead to duplication or redundancy in protection. For instance, having two car insurance policies that both cover collision damage would be an example of overlapping coverage. In such cases, it might be advisable to adjust the policies to avoid unnecessary expenses and potential complications during a claim process. In summary, while both sentences use the term \\"coverage,\\" they refer to different concepts – the first pertains to the reporting of events and issues in the news media, while the second refers to the extent and scope of protection provided by insurance policies.

He is the recipient of several awards, including two Filmfare Awards, and is among the highest-paid actors in the country. After completing a bachelor's degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh returned to India to pursue his career in films. He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat. In 2016, Singh starred in Aditya Chopra's comedy-romance Befikre opposite Vaani Kapoor. He played Dharam Gulati, a stand-up comic whose romantic liaisons with Kapoor's character leads to conflict between them. Set in Paris, Befikre marked the fourth project to be directed by Chopra. Singh performed a nude scene for it--a rare occurrence in an Indian film. Jay Weissberg of Variety found the film to be an \\"overly energetic twist on the old friends with benefits theme\\" and criticised Singh's \\"manic behavior\\". It underperformed at the box office.  After a year-long absence from the screen, Singh portrayed Alauddin Khilji, a ruthless Muslim king, in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period drama Padmaavat (2018), co-starring Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor, which marked his third collaboration with Bhansali and Padukone. Right-wing Hindu groups speculated that the film distorted historical facts, and issued violent threats against the cast and crew. The film's release was deferred and was allowed for exhibition after several modifications were made to it. Ankur Pathak of HuffPost criticised the film's misogynistic and regressive themes, but praised Singh for his \\"astute brilliance\\" in depicting Khilji's bisexuality. Rajeev Masand opined that he \\"plays the part with the sort of grotesque flamboyance that makes it hard to look at anyone or anything else when he's on the screen\\". Padmaavat's production budget of Rs2 billion (US31 million) made it the most expensive Hindi film ever made. With a worldwide gross of Rs5.44 billion (US83 million), it ranks as Singh's highest-grossing release and is among India cinema's biggest grossers.  As of January 2018, Singh will star opposite Alia Bhatt in Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy, a musical based on the life of rappers living in Mumbai's ghettos.

Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings. People liked to be listened to. The illusion of having a voice was almost as good as actually having one. Isn't that why people still bothered to go to the polls on election day and vote? And it worked on most people. This woman was not one of them. Question: Why did Ray hold the phone away from his ear? Options:  A. The woman was going to scream at him.  B. not enough information  C.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century  Question: \\"Why was it hard for Madame White snake to be the ideal wife?\\" Answer: \\"Neologism\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct. Let me explain it to you like I'm talking to a five-year-old. Madame White Snake is a character from an old Chinese legend. She is a snake that turns into a woman and becomes a man's wife. Over time, her character became more like a good wife, but still, she couldn't live happily with her human husband because she had a dangerous side to her. This danger comes from her being a femme fatale, which means a lady who is hard to resist and can cause trouble. So, even though she had some qualities of an ideal wife, her dangerous side made it hard for her to be the perfect wife."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog. There were plenty of people willing to reckon it proved aliens had mighty good taste, but it wasn't the time nor the place to say it out loud. The cops released Jason after two days of questions. He stuck to his story throughout. The desk sergeant said, 'mark my words, there's a lot of hate out there.' Jason headed straight home.

Place the can on a flat surface, like a table. 3. Ask an adult for help: Since the can opener is sharp, it's a good idea to have a grown-up do this part for safety. 4. The adult will put the can opener on the edge of the can's lid, where the circle is, and squeeze the handle. The sharp part will poke the lid. 5. They will then turn the handle on the can opener, moving it around the lid's edge. The wheel helps to cut a circle in the lid. 6. Continue going around the edge until the circle is complete. 7. Carefully lift the lid off the can using the can opener. Be careful, the edge might be sharp. Now you can enjoy your tuna!

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who could not see Ninnis? ?  On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge. Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet (3.4 m) wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet (46 m), too far for their ropes to reach. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations.

Answer the following question: This article: \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater.

If the shortest possible palindrome is length 1 you should return the first character. Input: pbbbpxxxbxbb Output:","output":"The output would be: \\"bbbxbbb\\" To find the longest palindromic substring in the given input \\"pbbbpxxxbxbb\\", we can follow these steps: 1. Start with the first character of the given input, 'p', and check for the palindromes generated by expanding the window centred around this character. Since it does not have a symmetric character on either side, the only palindrome is the single character 'p'. 2. Move on to the second character of the input, 'b'. Notice that we can construct the palindrome \\"bb\\" by checking the symmetric characters on both sides of the current character. Thus, the longest palindrome so far is \\"bb\\". 3. Continuing, consider the third character, 'b'. Here, we can construct the palindromes \\"bbb\\" and \\"bbbxbbb\\". Since \\"bbbxbbb\\" is longer than the previously found palindrome, \\"bb\\", we take \\"bbbxbbb\\" as the new longest palindrome. 4. Keep iterating through the characters of the input string to see if any palindromes are longer than the current longest palindrome. In this case, no longer palindromes are found, so the longest palindromic substring of the input remains \\"bbbxbbb\\". 5.

Given the following context:  Richard Gaddis is a small-time crook with a penchant for con games. To hook marks, he acts like a well-to-do businessman, dressing like one and driving a Mercedes-Benz S500, believing that one must look like a professional in order to be a successful conman. Gaddis is searching for a new partner with whom he can perform more sophisticated cons.  He discovers Rodrigo after he sees the young man playing some minor con games in a casino-bar.  When Rodrigo is caught, Gaddis acts the part of a vice officer to save him from being arrested.  Rodrigo's contribution is a face and naive manner so trustable that he is able to con anyone, while Richard is both completely unprincipled and clever.  After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts.   Richard accepts, and they plan to sell a fraudulent version of a silver certificate currency note to William Hannigan, a rich collector who is in town. Gyllenhaal plays Gaddis' sister Valerie, a concierge at a hotel.  When Hannigan takes a fancy to the uptight but very sexy Valerie, Gaddis is forced to pull her into the scam, the price of which is Richard's admission to their brother Michael that he has cheated him out of his share of their inheritance. The plot twists constantly as each of the characters becomes more deeply invested in the scam, and the ever-deceitful Richard tries to cheat Rodrigo, Valerie and Michael out of their share of the take. In the twist ending, it is revealed that all the major players involved, including Rodrigo and Hannigan, were playing a confidence game against Gaddis from the very beginning, so that Valerie and Michael could rightfully take their share of their inheritance.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person that is interested in the sister of the small-time crook?

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To improve your blood pressure, Pick from: * have some coffee at the end of the day.. * have some broth at the end of the day..","output":"To determine which solution is better for improving blood pressure, I will consider the effects of each option on blood pressure. Step 1: Analyze the effects of coffee on blood pressure Coffee contains caffeine, which is a stimulant. Consuming caffeine can temporarily raise blood pressure, especially in people who are sensitive to it or who are not regular consumers. However, the effect of coffee on blood pressure can vary from person to person. In some cases, moderate coffee consumption may not have a significant effect on blood pressure. Step 2: Analyze the effects of broth on blood pressure Broth, especially if it is made from bones and vegetables, can be a source of beneficial nutrients, such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium. These minerals have been associated with lower blood pressure. However, it is important to consider the sodium content of the broth. High sodium intake can raise blood pressure. Choosing a low-sodium broth or making homemade broth with little added salt can help counteract this potential issue. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, having some low-sodium broth at the end of the day seems to be the better solution for improving blood pressure. While coffee does not necessarily have an adverse effect on blood pressure for everyone, it could lead to a temporary increase for some individuals. On the other hand, broth contains essential nutrients that can positively impact blood pressure, as long as the sodium content is controlled."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, I do want you to know why I seemed in a confused state. You see, I was just at the doctor's office getting the results of the examination I had two weeks ago, and I was wondering how I would tell my husband and children that I had cancer. There were still tears in my eyes, so,quite simply I didn't even see the lights change. Perhaps I should not have been driving, but I didn't want to miss my appointment. I was in the express lane at the supermarket without thinking and moving. Please accept my apology. My mind was on my youngest daughter who ran away from home, and she?'just sixteen. I was so worried then. You see, she somehow got in with the wrong crowd and started using drugs and drinking. I was remembering what a pretty little girl she had been most of her life. I know you were unhappy along with others in line. Please, accept my apology. I remember you from the store last week. I was so mean to you, when you were doing your job to the best of your ability. I acted so childishly. Please accept my apology. You see, I arrived home from work just yesterday and discovered that my wife had left me, but I should never have taken it out on you. Please, accept my apology. The above are imagined incidents, and yet they expressed a very real truth.

Before Hammer's successful music career (with his mainstream popularity lasting approximately between 1988 and 1998) and his \\"rags-to-riches-to-rags-and-back saga\\", Burrell formed a Christian rap music group with CCM's Jon Gibson (or \\"J.G.\\") called Holy Ghost Boys.

Read this: Capacitors, especially ceramic capacitors, and older designs such as paper capacitors, can absorb sound waves resulting in a microphonic effect. Vibration moves the plates, causing the capacitance to vary, in turn inducing AC current. Some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker.

Let's break down the phrase and analyze the tone. 1. Negative aspect: The use of \\"hardly\\" is a strong qualifier that negates the value of whatever comes after it. In this case, it is pointing towards the 'worth' of the particular action or endeavor. By considering the effort \\"hardly\\" worth it, the speaker implies that the result or outcome may not be as significant or satisfactory as expected.  2. Resignation: This phrase may also be interpreted as an expression of resignation or giving up on a task. In this context, the speaker acknowledges that there is a potential outcome or reward, but believes that it's not worth pursuing because the perceived effort outweighs the possible benefit. This may imply a lack of motivation or unwillingness to invest time and resources into something that might not provide the expected result. 3. Devaluation: Another aspect of this phrase is devaluation or diminishing the importance of a task or action. When someone says \\"hardly seems worth the effort,\\" they are trivializing the objective and suggesting that it's not valuable enough to consider pursuing. This devaluation can also be a form of self-defense or protection, not wanting to invest emotionally or physically in an activity that might be deemed as insignificant in the long run. In summary, the sentiment of the sentence \\"hardly seems worth the effort\\" can be perceived as negative due to its underlying tone of resignation, lack of motivation, and devaluation. The speaker is expressing their belief that pursuing a particular task or action may not result in substantial payoff, which influences their decision or opinion on whether or not to engage in it. This perspective could affect the morale and outlook of others involved, potentially leading to a loss of interest or commitment to the task at hand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The villagers are nationalist and exclusionary, taunting Michael (John Mills) (the mute village idiot) and British soldiers stationed at a nearby army base. They are resentful of Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles), the spoilt daughter of the local publican Tom Ryan (Leo McKern), who himself is an informer for the British army hoping to keep the peace in the village. In public, Ryan pretends to be a staunch nationalist; in an early scene, he strongly supports the recently suppressed Easter Rising, referring to the rebels as \\"our boys\\".Rosy is bored with her humdrum village life and fantasizes about the outside world much to the chagrin of the local priest, Father Hugh Collins (Trevor Howard), an old, sharp-witted and highly influential person who knows all that goes on in the village. Rosy is in love with the local schoolmaster, Charles Shaughnessy (Robert Mitchum), a widower older than herself. She imagines that Shaughnessy will be able to add excitement to her life because he is educated and listens to classical music. He tries to convince her they are not a good match and suggests she leave the village and see the world. The two ultimately marry, but Rosy quickly becomes discontented with her marriage. She is looking for passion beyond just love in her relationship.Major Randolph Doryan (Christopher Jones) arrives to take command of the local army base. A veteran of World War I, he has been awarded a Victoria Cross, but has a crippled leg and suffers from shell shock. Rosy is instantly attracted to him. When Michael absent-mindedly bangs his foot on the pub bench, it causes Doryan to have a flashback to the trenches and collapse. When he recovers, he is comforted by Rosy. The two passionately kiss until they are interrupted by the arrival of Ryan and the townspeople.

Born and brought up near Edinburgh,Mollie has devoted her talents to writing primarily for young people. She firmly believes that there is and should always be a wider audience for any good book whatever its main market is. In Mollie's opinion it is necessary to make full use of language and she enjoys telling a story,which is what every writer should be doing. \\"If you aren't telling a story, you're a very dead writer indeed.\\" She says. With the chief function of a writer being to entertain,Mollie is indeed an entertainer. \\"I have this great love of not only the meaning of language but of the music of language,\\" she says. \\"This love goes back to early childhood. I had a school teacher who used to ask us what we would like to be when we grew up and,because my family always had dogs,and I was very good at handling them,I said I wanted to work with dogs,and the teacher always said  'Nonsense,Mollie;dear,you'll be a writer.' So finally I thought that this woman must have something,since she was a good teacher and I decided when I was nine that I would be a writer.\\" This childhood intention is described in her novel,A Sound of Chariots,which although written in the third person is clearly autobiographical   and gives a picture both of Mollie's ambition and her struggle towards its achievement. Thoughts of her childhood inevitably   brought thoughts of the time when her home was still a village with buttercup meadows and strawberry fields--sadly now covered with modern houses. \\"I was once taken back to see it and I felt that somebody had lain dirty hands all over my childhood. I'll never go back,\\"she said \\"Never. When I set one of my books in Scotland\\" she said \\"I can recall my romantic feelings as a child playing in those fields,or watching the village blacksmith at work. And that's important because children now know so much so early that romance can't exist for them, as it did for us.\\" Options: A She didn't expect to become a writer. B She didn't enjoy writing stories. C She didn't have any particular ambitions. D She didn't respect her teacher's views. Answer: A She didn't expect to become a writer. Question: Answer:","output":"Question: According to the article, what was Mollie Hunter's initial belief about her career before becoming a writer? A. She didn't expect to become a writer. B.

The military says at least 12 people were on board the C-130 Hercules, which crashed just minutes after taking off from an air force base outside Medan, where the pilot told the control tower he was suffering engine trouble, reports the AP. The news agency notes that 143 people died in the city a decade ago when a Mandala Airlines Boeing 737 crashed into a residential neighborhood. Article:","output":"Title: Indonesian Military C-130 Hercules Crash Kills At Least 30 in Residential Neighborhood At least 30 people have been confirmed dead after an Indonesian military transport plane crashed into a residential neighborhood in Medan, one of the country's largest cities. Officials have informed Reuters that the death toll may increase as the investigation and recovery mission continues. The number includes both military personnel and local residents affected by the tragic event. The Indonesian military reported that at least 12 people were on board the C-130 Hercules when it crashed just minutes after taking off from an air force base outside Medan. According to the Associated Press (AP), the pilot had informed the control tower that the plane was experiencing engine trouble prior to its crash. The plane, which was carrying both military personnel and equipment, was bound for a routine mission when it encountered difficulties and came crashing down upon the residential neighborhood. This tragic incident marks yet another aviation disaster in the city of Medan, which was also the site of a Mandala Airlines Boeing 737 crash a decade ago. That earlier crash took the lives of 143 people when the airliner plummeted into a residential neighborhood. With this previous incident in mind, today's tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the challenges and risks associated with aviation, particularly in densely populated areas. As the investigation into the cause of the C-130 Hercules crash continues, the Indonesian military and local authorities will work together to assess the damages, provide support to those impacted by the event, and determine if any additional steps are necessary to prevent future accidents of this nature. In the meantime, responders from various agencies have been mobilized to assist with search, rescue, and recovery efforts, as well as to provide medical services and other essential support for those affected by this devastating crash. With the current death toll standing at 30, and the possibility of an increase as more victims are discovered, the people of Medan and the greater Indonesian community are once again grappling with the painful realities of a major aviation disaster. As it unfolds, the investigation into this incident will hopefully shed light on the factors that contributed to this tragedy, and prompt appropriate action to enhance the safety of air travel in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer based on context: Because Bern and Zürich had been preparing the war for a long time, they seized the offensive. Bern opened the first war phase on 26 April, when its first troops crossed the river Aar at Stilli, to support Zürich with the occupation of Thurgau and the assault on the abbatial lands. In mid-May, about 3000 Zürichers, 2000 Bernese, 2000 Toggenburgers and 1800 Protestant Thurgauers marched into the Princely Lands and first hit upon the abbatial city of Wil, that fell on 22 May after a short siege. The allies then pushed forward to St. Gallen and occupied the Abbey of Saint Gall and the Vogtei Rheintal. The abbot fled to Neuravensburg, a lordship north of Lake Constance that the abbey had acquired in 1699. The five Catholic cantons did occupy Rapperswil, but initially left the abbot without any support. In concordance with contemporaneous laws of war, the abbey and its goods were put an under a military governance and the chattel and riches were abducted to Bern and Zürich. How many more Bernese soldiers marched to the Princely Lands than Protestant Thurgauers?","output":"In the context provided, there were 2,000 Bernese soldiers and 1,800 Protestant Thurgauers that marched into the Princely Lands. To determine the difference in the number of soldiers between these two groups, subtract the number of Protestant Thurgauers from the number of Bernese soldiers: 2,000 Bernese soldiers - 1,800 Protestant Thurgauers = 200 Thus, there were 200 more Bernese soldiers who marched to the Princely Lands than Protestant Thurgauers."},{"instruction":"I have a new situation: Two researches studied the Earth's mantle.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

Here is a hypothesis: The racist charge is both quirky and wacky.  Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"It is important to fully analyze the premise and hypothesis to determine if one can conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Firstly, let us break down both the premise and the hypothesis to get a better understanding of their meanings and implications. Premise: \\"But the racism charge isn't quirky or wacky--it's demagogy.\\" This statement seems to argue that accusing someone of racism is not merely an unusual or odd occurrence (\\"quirky\\" or \\"wacky\\"). Instead, it is a demagogic act, which typically means appealing to people's emotions, fears, and prejudices rather than using a more rational or thoughtful argument. Hypothesis: \\"The racist charge is both quirky and wacky.\\" In contrast to the premise, this statement claims that accusing someone of racism is, in fact, quirky and wacky, meaning that it might be unusual or not based on substantial evidence. It suggests that the racism charges might be considered lighthearted or not as serious. Now, let's address the original question: Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis? Given our evaluation of both statements, it appears that the premise and the hypothesis are essentially presenting two opposing ideas. The premise claims that racism charges represent demagogy and are not quirky or wacky. Meanwhile, the hypothesis suggests that racism charges are indeed quirky and wacky. In this context, if we accept the premise as true, it becomes impossible to conclude that the hypothesis is also true. Accepting the premise means that racism charges are demagogic and not quirky or wacky, so we cannot conclude that they are quirky and wacky as the hypothesis suggests. Instead, if the premise is true, one might argue that the hypothesis is false. The statements contradict each other, and if one is true, it inherently means that the other cannot be true simultaneously."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write highlights for this article: Luke Shaw admits his performances since joining Manchester United have not yet justified his price tag but vows: ‘You’ll see my best soon.’ The England Under 21 left back endured a difficult night in the 2-2 draw with West Bromwich Albion, only his third club match following his £31million move from Southampton having picked up a hamstring injury and had questions raised over his fitness. The result leaves United 10 points behind Chelsea, who visit Old Trafford on Sunday and are seen by many as champions-elect. But Shaw insists the title is not a foregone conclusion. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luke Shaw say his focus is solely on impressing Van Gaal. Luke Shaw admits his performances have not lived up to his £31million price tag at Manchester United. Shaw (centre) walks off after West Bromwich Albion's second goal on Monday night at The Hawthorns. ‘No not yet. It’s a long season so we’ll have to see what happens,’ he said. ‘We’re going to work hard this week and be ready for the challenge on Sunday. It’s a massive test. They’re flying at the moment.’ On his own form Shaw provided a commendably honest appraisal, having received some criticism over his defensive credentials. He was partly at fault for Stephane Sessegnon’s opening goal at The Hawthorns by getting drawn too central trying to win the ball. Shaw, 19, said: ‘I know I haven’t been up to my full potential and I think maybe people can see that at the moment. They haven’t seen the best of me yet. ‘I am trying hard and it’s about getting used to everything. When you come to a club like this it’s never easy for a young player like me. But I’ll get myself starting soon and put in good performances. ‘I wouldn’t say I’ve been horrendous but I know I can do much better. And I need to do better. I’ve come to Manchester United and I know what they need. I’ve been working hard and the performances will come.’ Louis van Gaal will need to dip into the transfer market again if he thinks Manchester United can win the title. Shaw, who broke into the Southampton first team two years ago, was told by Louis van Gaal to improve his fitness during pre-season. Roy Hodgson also voiced his concerns. He had to wait for his debut until West Ham visited Old Trafford last month, and was withdrawn in his next match against Everton as a precaution over a knee complaint. But during the international break he played 180 minutes as England Under 21s beat Croatia over two legs to progress to Euro 2015 and that action provided a psychological and physical boost. ‘It always helps and the main thing for me was it was two 90 minutes for fitness,’ he said. ‘I feel fit but like I said I haven’t played my best recently. That’s football. Hopefully I’ll come out of it now. I think I could still get a bit fitter from working hard in training. But I do feel pretty fit in training.’ At The Hawthorns, Van Gaal set up United in a third different formation of the season, having started with a 5-3-2 system before switching to a midfield diamond. Manchester United players look dejected after West Brom's opening goal at the Hawthorns. Against West Brom it looked more 4-1-4-1 with Angel di Maria and Adnan Januzaj hugging the wings. Shaw described the formation as 4-3-3 and insisted it relatively straight-forward to adjust tactics. ‘It’s not too difficult, we had a few days to work on it,’ he said. ‘We did a lot of work based on the 4-3-3 formation with wide wingers. ‘We knew what we had to do against West Brom but unfortunately we didn’t get the result. It’s definitely two points lost, we’re Man United, we come to win every game. ‘It’s two points lost because we were positive ahead of the game. They only had two shots on target (but scored twice) and that’s not good enough for us. We’ll focus hard this week and be ready for the game on Sunday.’ VIDEO Van Gaal not happy after two lost points.","output":"- Luke Shaw admits his performances have not yet justified his £31 million transfer to Manchester United. - Shaw endured a difficult night during 2-2 draw with West Bromwich Albion and faced criticism over his defense. - Despite Manchester United being 10 points behind Chelsea, Shaw insists the title is not a foregone conclusion. - Shaw acknowledges he has not yet shown his full potential but believes his best performances are soon to come. - Shaw played 180 minutes for England Under 21s, which he feels provided a physical and psychological boost."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Identify what Strabismus is. Strabismus is a medical condition wherein the eyes do not properly align with each other when focusing on an object, causing a misalignment of the eyes. Step 2: Recall common terms or synonyms for Strabismus. I know that Strabismus is also known as crossed eyes, lazy eye, or wall eye, but let's see which of these is a one-syllable word.

Back on the trail by Wednesday ||||| CNN is reporting that instead of heading to New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses tonight, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson will be headed home to Florida to -- at least according to his campaign representative -- prepare for the National Prayer Breakfast.      This decision could be strategic, since Carson first rose to national prominence due to his appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast, or it could be the first sign that he will be the next Republican candidate who believes the road to the White House is now too long and arduous for his campaign. ||||| Ben Carson's national finance chairman Dean Parker resigned Thursday morning amid questions about his use of campaign fund and criticism from Carson allies and donors.      Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, appointed Parker, a tech industry entrepreneur from Mobile, Alabama, in May to spearhead the campaign’s fundraising efforts. Parker’s been a relatively little-noticed campaign power, having Carson’s ear despite friction with other leaders. Since he joined, some campaign insiders told POLITICO, his operation has piled up unnecessary expenses and paid hefty consulting fees to an inexperienced staff. Parker recently began earning a 20,000 monthly salary, which veteran campaign operatives say is unusual for what is typically an unpaid, honorary role.      Story Continued Below      The bills for Parker’s shop, the inside sources said, were easy to overlook in the fall as the campaign raked in small donations, Carson soared in the polls and the campaign’s direct-mail operation generated tens of millions of dollars. But Parker’s operation became a sore point as the campaign lost its footing in mid-November and the candidate’s poll numbers slipped, they added. Even as senior leaders questioned Parker in leadership discussions, Carson still backed him on financial and hiring decisions, the campaign sources said.      Campaign finance reports show Parker’s operation, based in Mobile, racked up at least 216,000 in expenses from July through September, the most recent quarter for which reports are publicly available. Many of those expenses were paid through a network of limited liability companies set up for individual consultants on Parker’s finance team. The bottom line is a small fraction of the millions spent on direct mail, phone solicitations and list-building in the same period. But Parker’s detractors say he also frustrated some donors with brusque behavior and infuriated a longtime Carson confidant, Terry Giles, by insinuating that Giles orchestrated a leak of internal documents.      “He drove right over you. He’s kind of bullyish. His arms are spread open so nobody gets by him,” said Nancy Pickard, a Carson fundraiser based in North Carolina whose son was once a patient of Carson’s at Johns Hopkins. Pickard, who hosted a September event for Carson that she said raised about 200,000, said Parker routinely blocked her access to Carson.      In an interview on MSNBC shortly after resigning, Parker said he stepped down to refocus the media's attention. \\"It was time to say, you know what? I'm not going to let him have me be the focus of his campaign during a debate or this season getting so close to Iowa,\\" Parker said. \\"I sat down with him this morning and I said, Dr. Carson, I love you. I know you love me. We've been great friends. We will continue to be great friends. I'm wondering if the best thing I could do is to get rid of this attention because nothing was done wrong, and we don't need the media building this up.\\"      A Carson campaign spokesman said the campaign is still searching for a successor to fill the position in a \\"voluntary role.\\" A source familiar with the campaign's thinking told POLITICO that Mike Murray, a veteran of direct mail fundraising with a long history of campaign work, is under consideration for either a temporary or permanent appointment.      Parker, who recently said he’d take a bullet for Carson, can’t seem to fathom the fury that’s suddenly coming his way.      “Everything I’ve done has been on Dr. Carson’s behalf. Everything I do was with his approval and his blessing,” he said. “It doesn’t mean that everybody in leadership, like any company, would always agree.”      For every donor who might complain, he said, others would vouch for his integrity. One is Bill Millis, another North Carolina fundraiser who helped lead Carson’s campaign until he departed in November over strategic disagreements. Millis called Parker “a good man, who is committed to Dr. Carson.”      “I don’t know all of the in’s and out’s relative to expenses, and would certainly accept that some expenses may have been unnecessary,” he wrote in an email, “but [the] majority was necessary in order to keep Dr. Carson and his message visible.”      Parker also pointed to a story in the Alabama-based news outlet Yellowhammer that he said praised his performance. The article featured a comment from an anonymous source who said Parker had done a “good job” for him and ripped into “professional political consultants” running the campaign. “Unfortunately for the 10 and 20 and 50 donors who believe in Dr. Carson, only a fraction of their money has been put to good use,” the source told Yellowhammer.      Parker claims his Mobile-based team helped Carson, a political novice, raise 1 million a month in the fall, a powerhouse operation built from scratch that’s expanding as the Republican nominating contest nears. Large-donor fundraising, he said, increased 10-fold from May, when he joined the campaign, and the ratio of his expenses to contributions is in the single digits. Parker said he has added state finance chairs around the country in recent weeks. He told POLITICO his team spent funds appropriately and that he began collecting a salary only this month.      Campaign management experts said it is unusual for finance chairmen to receive any salary.      “Usually a chair is not somebody that’s getting paid to do that job,” said Katie Packer Gage, former deputy manager of Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. “It’s somebody that has relationships with lots of donors, and so it’s a more symbolic kind of role that demonstrates that somebody in the donors’ peer group is on board.”      Ray Washburne, national finance chairman of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's campaign, said paying a finance chairman defeats the purpose of the role.      “If they think I’m getting a scrape on the money as a finance chairman, you lose all your credibility,” he said. “When you’re raising money 2,700 a person, someone making 20,000 a month — that’s eight to 10 maxed-out donors.” Washburne said the value of a finance chairman is the ability to make a “peer to peer sale” with fellow donors. He pointed to Marco Rubio’s finance chairman, Wayne Berman, and Jeb Bush’s finance chairman, Woody Johnson. “If there was a financial gain for us on it, it’s harder to look somebody in the eye to raise money.”      But Parker said he’s an exception because, unlike other finance chairmen, he’s working in the role full time, and he said the campaign felt more comfortable compensating him for that time.      “It’s 100 percent what I do. I put all my business holdings on hold,” said Parker, who advised C-Spire, the tech firm that acquired his company, Callis Communications, two years ago. “I started this on May 5. I have been home an average of four days a month.”      In a statement, the campaign confirmed its rationale for providing Parker with a salary. “After volunteering full-time for several months, the campaign asked Dean to establish a contract relationship, so that they could properly reimburse for expenses,” said spokesman Larry Ross.      Parker said he emphasizes frugality and finding good, “cautious” deals to ensure donors’ dollars are wisely spent.      In some ways, the criticism of Parker is classic backbiting from a campaign in turmoil. Many of Carson’s senior staff quit the campaign on New Year’s Eve, citing a dysfunctional organization with tangled chains of command — Carson had tepidly signaled a coming shakeup — but Parker stayed. He said he’s been a “trusted adviser” to Carson for a couple of years, though he added that he had nothing to do with the campaign shake-up.      “The shake-up was all him,” Parker said, referring to Carson. “I was sad to see some of the guys go.”      The criticisms of Parker come as Carson attempts to revive his campaign in Iowa, which will become the first state to weigh in on the Republican presidential nominating contest on Feb. 1. Polls show he’s still tied for third there, and he’s counting on a top-three finish to sustain his campaign through February.      Documents leaked to The Wall Street Journal suggested the campaign has blown through tens of millions of dollars, primarily on cumbersome direct-mail and telephone operations, eliminating the financial cushion that would help Carson carry through the early-voting states. Carson raised a combined 43 million in the last six months of 2015, but, by some accounts, he started the year with less than 10 million on hand. Though Carson led presidential polls heading into November, his campaign tumbled amid questions about Carson’s inspiring personal narrative and his readiness to handle foreign policy issues.            That’s why sources who voiced complaints to POLITICO worried that Parker’s finance operation is no longer sustainable.            In the three months ending on Oct. 1, the most recent quarter for which public filings are available, the campaign paid 145,000 in costs it described as “travel” to Parker's firm, Vita Capital. Parker said those payments actually covered fundraising expenses.      He said the campaign did use his private plane to shuttle around Carson and staff, but he said those billings went through a “third party.” He said his plane’s services were offered at fair market value after a competitive bidding process.                  At the campaign’s recommendation, Parker said, the expenses he and his team incurred were charged on the credit card of Vita Capital, and he received reimbursements. Public filings show the payments went through two companies: Vita Capital and Communication Management Source, which is managed by Parker’s wife, Joanne. An 18,000 rent payment to the firm KP Investment, a limited liability company formed in 2004, traces to Parker, too.      Parker said the rent payment reflected the cost of a six-month lease, furniture and utilities for a property in which he is a partner. He said he may have made “three or four thousand dollars” in fees.      In fact, much of the finance operation Parker built in Mobile is difficult to decipher from campaign filings. Nearly everyone on his staff set up a separate LLC after joining the campaign and received consulting payments in the quarter that ended Oct. 1. LLCs like Interim C, DB Operations, and Synergy Networks were established explicitly for the campaign and trace back to individuals who were paid as finance consultants.      Mary Broughton, who lists her occupation as a substitute teacher and graduated from Liberty University in 2014, collected nearly 15,000, through MC Consulting, established in June. Rachel Howat, who was a Mobile County nutritionist until joining the campaign in June as “finance operations director,” collected more than 15,200 through The Amna Agency. A further 8,000 flowed in September to Interim C, a Michigan-based LLC whose manager, Kevin Demery, used to work with Parker at Callis Communications. Demery lists his title as the campaign’s national vice chairman of finance.            The team also reported a 644 “finance consulting” payment to Haley Ikner, a University of Mobile junior and Miss Alabama aspirant who worked as an intern. “I admire Dr. Carson and what he stands for, as well, so it seemed perfect. I got the internship and did various tasks such as calling sponsors to thank them for their support to letting them know when Dr. Carson would be in an area near him,” she said.            In November, Parker also hired part-timer Halie Biggs, a North Carolina-based model who began pursuing a business administration degree at North Carolina State University this year. A picture on Biggs’ Twitter feed shows her with Parker, Carson’s son Ben Carson Jr., and singer/songwriter will.i.am at a dinner hosted by Segway inventor Dean Kamen.            Parker said the campaign encouraged supplying employees with separate LLCs, allowing them to work under contract rather than as official staff. Parker attributed the “young or inexperienced” nature of his team to the fact that he’s running a “grass-roots” operation.      “We didn’t have a donor list. We couldn’t afford high-dollar fundraisers,” Parker said, adding that when he joined the campaign in May, it was bringing in 100,000 from major donors each month — a number that’s since grown 10-fold. The Carson campaign didn’t respond to questions about Parker’s assertion that it encouraged the use of contract employees, recommended use of personal credit cards and encouraged Parker to accept a salary.      Conflicts with Parker flared into the open last month after a dispute with Terry Giles, who chaired the campaign in the spring but was elbowed out over strategic differences. Late last month, Giles sent a scorching letter to Carson, his wife Candy and a dozen senior campaign officials in which he called Parker a liar. In the letter, obtained by POLITICO, Giles said Parker, while at a gathering of Houston donors, blamed him for a leak to The Wall Street Journal that included damaging revelations about the campaign’s finances. Parker alleged that Giles had tricked Millis into revealing the damaging information over the phone while a Journal reporter was listening in.      Giles denied the charge and wrote that he was incensed Parker would make the accusation in his hometown. “After Bill Millis communicated with the donor/fundraiser and explained that this story was a complete fabrication and that no such thing happened, I was able to calm down the rightfully upset donor,” he wrote. “But that does not take away the fact that the campaign came into my city and told a group of donor/fundraisers (and folks who are Carson supporters because of Kalli and myself, lies about me which made it appear that I was undercutting the campaign.”      Asked about the incident, Giles said he would neither confirm nor deny it, but added, “I’m not a fan of Dean Parker.”      Parker acknowledged the dust-up but said he apologized a day after seeing Giles’ letter and sent a letter of regret to the donors he met with, arguing that his comment had been “taken out of context” and that he shouldn’t have discussed the episode at all.      For the most part, Parker expressed surprise that he has become the target of so much vitriol and described a “great relationship” with Carson’s senior aides — including some who are no longer with the campaign. He added that he hopes to put to bed any questions about his use of campaign funds and his relationship with donors. “If there’s not a story here, let’s not write it,” he urged. But he insisted he was happy to answer questions raised by his critics.      “We just want the truth reported. I’m giving it to you,” he said. “We have nothing to hide.” ||||| Ben Carson will head back to his home in Florida following the Iowa caucuses Monday night and take a break from campaigning for a few days, according to his campaign.

Today, we are going to learn how to back up our hard drive and restore it on our computer. Don't worry! I'm here to help you understand it easily. Let's get started! First, what is a hard drive? A hard drive is like a big toy box inside your computer that holds all your favorite games, pictures, and things you do on the computer. We need to make sure we always have a copy of those things, just in case something goes wrong with our toy box (the hard drive). Now, let's learn how to back up and restore our hard drive in just a few simple steps! Step 1: Back up your hard drive It's always a good idea to keep a copy of the things in our toy box. This is called \\"backing up\\" our hard drive. Ask a grown-up to help you find out which method of backing up (copying) is provided by the company who made your computer. This will keep all your important things safe, and you can get them back if you need to. Step 2: Find the right way to restore Different computers have different ways to restore (fix) the toy box when it gets messy or has trouble. Ask a grown-up to check which method your computer manufacturer recommends. Step 3: Insert the operating system disk You'll need a special shiny circle (called an operating system disk) to help fix your computer. This shiny circle tells your computer how to work and how to fix any problems. Ask a grown-up to put this special shiny circle into the CD/DVD drive (it's a special door just for shiny circles!). Step 4: Wait for the magic to happen Once the shiny circle (operating system disk) is in the CD/DVD drive, your computer will start to work on fixing any problems. You don't need to do anything, just sit back and wait for the magic to happen. Step 5: All done! It might take some time for the computer to finish fixing the toy box (hard drive), but when it's done, everything should be just like it was before. Now you can get back to playing your games and looking at your pictures without any worries! And that's it, little friends! You've learned how to back up and restore your hard drive. Remember, if you ever need help, ask a grown-up, and they'll be sure to lend you a hand. Happy computing!"},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The main argument in favor of the interview is that an employer is concerned not only with a candidate's ability, but with his or her suitable personality for the particular work situation. Many employers, for example, will overlook occasional mistakes from their secretary if she has a pleasant personality. It is perhaps true to say, therefore, that the real purpose of an interview is not to assess the assessable aspects of each candidate but to make a guess at the things that are hard to measure, such as personality, character and social ability. Unfortunately, both for the employers and applicants for jobs, there are many people of great ability who simply do not interview well. There are also, of course, people who interview extremely well, but are later found to be very unsatisfactory employees. Candidates who interview well tend to be quietly confident, but never boastful , direct and straightforward in their questions and answers; cheerful and friendly, but never over-familiar; and sincerely enthusiastic and optimistic. Candidates who interview badly tend to be either very shy or over-confident. They either talk too little or never stop talking. They are either over polite or a bit rude. Question: People argue over the interview mainly because they have  _  .

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: \\"Hey, do you know what?  Today is May Day!\\" my sister announced. \\"Do you remember the May Day baskets we used to make with colored paper and paste?\\" I recalled that my sisters and I would run around our neighborhood delivering the baskets brimming with spring flowers. We would place them on a doorstep, knock on the door, then run away. It was delightful to look around a bush and watch our friends open their doors and pick up the colorful gift,wondering who had left it out for them. I clearly remember the May Day of the year that I was in fifth grade. That year I was faced with a challenge involving one of my dearest friends. She lived right across the road from our family, and we had walked together to school nearly every day since first grade. Her interests were starting to change from the interests that we had shared together. A new family had recently moved into our small town,and Pam was spending more and more time at their house. When my mother asked me if I was going to take a May Day basket to Pam's house, I responded angrily, \\"Absolutely not!\\" My mom told me that I would have many other friends throughout my lifetime. \\"But Pam was my very best friend ever,\\" I cried. Mom wiped away my tears and told me that circumstances change and people change. She explained that one of the greatest things friends can do is to give each other a chance to grow, to change and to develop into what we want to be. And sometimes that would mean that friends would choose to spend time with other people. I could express my forgiveness by giving her a May Day basket. It was a hard decision, but I made an extra special basket of flowers with lots of yellow because that was Pam's favorite color. I asked my two sisters to help me deliver my basket of forgiveness. As we watched from our hiding place, Pam picked up the flowers, and said loudly enough for us to hear, \\"Thank you, Susie, I hoped you wouldn't forget me!\\". Question: Why was Susie angry with Pam? Options: A: Because Pam refused to walk to school. B: Because she felt left out by Pam. C: Because Pam didn't give her a May Day basket. D: Because she challenged Pam for new friends. A:","output":"B: Because she felt left out by Pam. Susie was angry with Pam because her interests were starting to change, and she was spending more time with the new family that had moved into their town. Susie felt left out by her best friend Pam, which caused her to be upset and initially refuse to make a May Day basket for her."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who was responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946? ?  On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when  Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that \\"thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it\\". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as \\"the most important piece of music of the 20th century\\".In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being \\"murdered by that frightful butcher\\". Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening's performance of Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, at Covent...

Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you want to be debt free, you need to freeze all of your inessential spending and avoid buying things that you can't afford. If you can't pay for something in cash, today, you don't need it. Commit to the process and the journey of remaining free of debt and enjoy the freedom that it brings. Being debt free doesn't mean living like a miser. If you want to spend a little on vacation, or splurge a little every now and then, feel free to go for it. Just make sure that these kind of fun expenses come from monthly income that's in excess, not being charged on accounts that are already swollen beyond capacity. Every paycheck, put aside some money for bills, food, and other needed necessities of living, and some money aside to save. Also put aside a little money for non-necessities. It's important to be able to buy things you want without going into debt. Keep saving money, and paying off bills so that you can pay off your debt. For many people, debt happens because we think we deserve a certain quality of life. Why don't we deserve the expensive cars, the fine jewelry, and the fancy vacations that other people can afford? This kind of thinking is how people get sunk into heavy debts they struggle their whole life to pay off. Learn to be happy living within your means, and take pleasure in every dollar you save, in every day that you spend out from under the boot of someone else's money. Be free. Medical debts quickly sink financially secure people into financial trouble. You need to eat well, exercise, and maintain proper dental health to avoid costly and unexpected expenses that come as the result of health scares. A single trip to the hospital can bankrupt people who aren't prepare for it. Don't be one of them. If you're uninsured, make sure you get some kind of affordable health insurance as quickly as possible. Talk to your employer about insurance options, or research national options in the marketplace. It's very important to have health insurance for when you need a little help. . When you've got your debts paid down, the fun can start. Building credit and working your way into a good credit score will have those credit cards and expenses working to your advantage.

Elaborate funeral plans have been set in motion in South Africa following the death of the country’s revered first black president Nelson Mandela. The memorial, expected to last ten days, will be an unparalleled event in South Africa’s history, drawing a plethora of foreign dignitaries of every stripe, royals and a smattering of celebrities. South African President Jacob Zuma ordered the nation's flags to be flown at half-mast beginning today and to remain that way until after Mandela's funeral, which he announced would be held next Sunday. Scroll down for videos. Iconic funeral: Anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela will lie in state for several days next week before a massive funeral service that will draw numerous heads of state and celebrities. The public will have a chance to say goodbye to their beloved father figure during a memorial service at the Johannesburg soccer stadium (above) that hosted the 2010 World Cup. Fitting location: Mandela's body is expected to lie in state in the Union Buildings in Pretoria (above) where he was inaugurated as President. Soldiers guard Mandela's home in Qunu, where he will be laid to rest in accordance with his final wishes at a service on Sunday, December 15. Hours after his death last night, a black SUV-type vehicle containing Mandela's coffin, draped in South Africa's flag, pulled away from Mandela's home after midnight, escorted by military motorcycle outriders, to take the body to a military morgue in Pretoria, the capital. Desmond Tutu, a long-time friend of Mr Mandela and former archbishop of Cape Town is expected to hold the service, which will be attended by all living US presidents, past and present. The White House said last night that President Barack Obama is expected to travel to South Africa to bid farewell to Mandela along with numerous other world leaders including British Prime Minister David Cameron. Counting himself among the millions influenced by Nelson Mandela, President Obama mourned the death of the anti-apartheid hero with whom he shares the distinction of being his nation's first black president. 'He no longer belongs to us. He belongs to the ages,' Obama said in a somber appearance at the White House. Several celebrities who had personal ties to the late great leader, such as Oprah Winfrey and U2 frontman Bono, are also expected to attend the service. Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will be joined on Air Force One next week by former president George Bush. Former President Bill Clinton is also set to attend the state funeral and will be joined by Hilary Clinton. Nelson Mandela's unifying force will be evident in the guest list at his funeral which will include black and white world leaders, TV stars and musicians. U.S. President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle and their daughters will be joined by all past living U.S. presidents, including Bill Clinton, who knew Mr Mandela well. Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Charles are believed to be in line to attend. Several celebrities who had personal ties to the late great leader, such as Oprah Winfrey and U2 frontman Bono, are also expected to attend the service. Desmond Tutu, a long-time friend of Mr Mandela and former archbishop of Cape Town is expected to hold the service. Preparations for funeral are expected to bring the country of 53 million to a virtual standstill. The. sheer number of dignitaries, including numerous heads of state, is sure. to spell a logistical nightmare for the South African government, which. will be tasked with providing air-tight security during the solemn. event. According to several sources involved in planning the state funeral, the 10-day occasion will combine both Western traditions and those of Mandela's native clan, the Thembu. At some stage during days one to four, Thembu elders are expected to gather for a first ceremony called 'the closing of the eyes' either at his home or in the mortuary. After the ceremony, it is believed his body will be embalmed at the mortuary, thought to be a military hospital in Pretoria. No formal public events are expected to take place until day five, December 10, when mourners will have a chance to say goodbye to their beloved father figure during a service at the 94,000-capacity Johannesburg soccer stadium that hosted the 2010 World Cup. It is not clear whether Mandela's casket will be taken there. On days six to eight, December 11 to 13, the anti-apartheid hero's body is earmarked to lie in state in a glass-topped coffin at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where he was inaugurated as president on May 10, 1994. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who met with then-94-year-old Mandela last August, will also journey to South Africa. Representing Britain: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha, seen with Mandela at a photo shoot for his 90th birthday in London, will pay their respects. On day nine, plans have been made for. a military aircraft to fly Mr Mandela to Mthatha, the main town in the. South African province of Eastern Cape. His. casket will then be taken by the military on a gun carriage to Qunu,. his home village, where the former leader spent his childhood years. To. mark the formal passing of responsibility to his family, the South. African flag that is expected to drape his coffin will be replaced by a. traditional Xhosa blanket. Later, ANC leaders, local chiefs and Mandela's family are expected to gather for a private night vigil. On. the final day, Mandela will finally be laid to rest in the grounds of. his family home in Qunu, where thousands of people, including heads of. state will gather for the state funeral. Giving thanks: All living former US leaders, including George W. Bush, pictured meeting Mandela in 2001, have been invited. Royal representation: The British Royal family, including the Queen and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will fly to South Africa to honour Mandela. Mr Mandela often spoke with great love of his first home where his family members, including his children who predeceased him, rest. The family plot is located just a few yards from the home he shared with his mother as a child and the one which he built following his release from Victor Verster Prison. He loved Qunu 'in the unconditional way a child loves his first home' and spent holidays and special occasions here. Star-studded event: The memorial service is expected to draw many celebrities who had a personal relationship with Mandela, including Oprah Winfrey pictured here in 2002. Friends: U2 front man Bono, with Mandela at his Johannesburg home in 2002, is thought to have been invited. The protocol for the funeral. preparations was drawn up more than a year ago, around the time when Mr. Mandela's health took a turn for the worse, and it may be altered in the. coming days. Mourners. will be able to share their thoughts about Mandela’s passing in. condolence books that will be made available in all foreign missions,. the Nelson Mandela Foundation headquarters and other institutions,. according to The Guardian, which has obtained a copy of the protocol. It. has also been reported that the South African Government is in talks. with the BBC team that filmed the Royal Wedding in 2011 to get help with. the world wide broadcast of the funeral of a global icon. Guests at the funeral will include Mr Obama, the first lady and their daughters. Bill and Hillary Clinton, who knew Mr Mandela well, are also expected to make an appearance. The scale and significance of the planned funeral is already being compared to the 2005 service for Pope John Paul II, which was attended by 2million people, among them five kings and 70 presidents. Days one to four (Today to December 9): According to sources involved in planning the state funeral, the 10-day occasion will combine both Western traditions and those of Mandela's native clan, the Thembu. Thembu elders expected to gather for a first ceremony called. 'the closing of the eyes' either at his home or in the mortuary.

I was super happy to catch the silhouette of the ISS over the disc of the moon last night! The CalSky website sends me alerts for potential fly overs for which I’ve been waiting a long time – about 12 months. I got one this week and this was adjusted by 15 seconds by the time of the “occultation”.      If you think that it might be a case of sitting there with your camera and a clock, with one hand on the shutter release, you’d be absolutely correct! The ISS only passed over the moon for 0.33 seconds as it shoots by quite quickly. Knowing the second it would pass I fired a “burst” mode of exposures then crossed my fingers and hoped it would show up in review – and it did!      The setup was my Canon 70D attached to the rear cell of my Celestron 9.25″ telescope (2350mm / f10). The shutter speed was a quick 1/1650th of a second and ISO 800 in order to freeze the ISS in motion.      I took about a second of further exposures on either side of the pass to stack the lunar surface detail using AutoStakkert2, and the increased the saturation in post to create this colour enhanced version of the moon. The colours on the moon relate to the chemical composition of moon geology.      Here is a close up so you can see the modules and the solar arrays captured fairly clearly!

At such speeds the weightless research laboratory was visible for only about a third of a second before returning to the dark skies.      Dylan captured the moment in Byron Bay, New South Wales, the eastern-most point of Australia, where the absence of larger towns offers low levels of light pollution.      The image was taken on 30 June 2015 at 19:54 local time with the Space Station flying 400 km above the Pacific Ocean. A conventional camera was placed behind a 2300 mm / f10 telescope and Dylan took as many pictures as possible during the Station’s brief passage and hoped for the best.      Five images of the Moon taken before and after the Station passed by were processed using freely available astrophotography tools to improve sharpness, a process called stacking. Lastly, the colours were enhanced to bring out the Moon’s colourful surface geology.      This is the first picture of the Station Dylan has published, commenting, “I take many types of pictures but the International Space Station is a wonderful target and one I’ve wanted to capture for a long time.”      Spotting the orbital complex yourself is easier than you might think. It can be seen and photographed without special equipment as it passes overhead. As it moves so fast, the hard part is to know when and where to look. ESA’s tracker shows you where the Station is at any time and you can sign up to receive alerts for your neighbourhood here.      Once you know where the Space Station will be, it is best to wait for dawn or dusk. It looks like a very bright star or aircraft gliding through the sky. For less advanced pictures without using the Moon as a background, use a tripod and set the shutter speed to a long exposure of up to a minute. The Station will always arrive from the west and will appear as a white streak in the photograph. |||||Summary:","output":"Dylan O'Donnell, an amateur photographer in Australia, captured an incredibly rare and stunning photo of the International Space Station (ISS) passing over the moon. He used a Canon 70D camera attached to a Celestron 9.25\\" telescope to snap the photo, which shows the ISS flying past the moon at its immense speed of 28,800 km/h. The image has attracted a lot of attention, being featured on various news and photography websites and shared across social media platforms. By planning his shoot carefully, using the right equipment, and adjusting settings to account for the ISS's speed, O'Donnell managed to catch this beautiful moment in time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They then discussed it with Lt. Kenneth Fuller (John Saxon); a mother, Mrs. Quaife (Martha Gibson), reports that her daughter Janice is missing as well. That evening, Mr. Harrison, Chris, and the sorority sisters join a search party for Janice and Clare. Back at the house, Mrs. Mac looks for the cat and discovers Clare's body before she is hooked into the neck by the killer and dragged up.

The finding came from a Gallup survey of more than three hundred and forty thousand adults in the United States in 2008.At that time,people were between the ages of eighteen and eighty-five. Arthur Stone in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stony Brook University in New York led the study.His team found that levels of stress were the highest among adults between the ages of twenty-two and twenty-five.Stress levels dropped sharply after people reached their fifties. Levels of happiness were the highest among the kids and those in their early seventies. The survey also found that men and women have similar emotional patterns as they grow older.However, women at all ages reported more sadness,stress and worry than men did. So why would happiness increase with age? One theory is that,as people get older, they become more thankful for what they have and have better control of their emotions.They also spend less time thinking about bad experiences.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.  After reading the above, is \\"Chirch\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What did the bombs destroy?\\"?","output":"No, \\"Chirch\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"What did the bombs destroy?\\".

According to the article, two bombs landed inside the compound, destroying two buildings of the Heiban Bible College and igniting grass fires across the area.

Available options: (a). Yes. (b). No. Answer:","output":"Answer: (a). Yes. Deforestation, which involves the large-scale removal of trees and other vegetation, is indeed the right answer to the question, \\"doing what to plants has a negative impact on the ecosystem?.\\" The act of cutting down plants, specifically trees, has a broad range of negative consequences for the ecosystem and the environment as a whole. 1. Habitat loss: Deforestation leads to the destruction and fragmentation of habitats, resulting in the displacement or extinction of numerous plant and animal species. The loss of biodiversity has a cascade effect on other species within the ecosystem and affects their survival chances. 2. Carbon sequestration: Forests are crucial carbon sinks, absorbing and storing large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. Cutting down trees significantly reduces their capacity to sequester carbon, contributing to the greenhouse effect and climate change.  3. Water cycle disruption: Trees play a vital role in maintaining the water cycle, returning water to the atmosphere through transpiration. Deforestation disrupts this process, causing changes in precipitation patterns and an increased likelihood of droughts and floods. 4. Soil erosion: Trees and other plants act as natural anchors for the soil, providing stability and reducing erosion. Deforestation causes the soil to lose structure and can lead to landslides, flooding, and sediment deposition in rivers and streams, adversely affecting aquatic ecosystems.  5. Decreased oxygen production: Through the process of photosynthesis, plants produce oxygen, which is essential for life on Earth. With fewer trees and plants in the ecosystem, less oxygen is produced, impacting both aquatic and terrestrial species. 6. Impact on indigenous communities: Deforestation often leads to the displacement of indigenous communities who rely on forests for their livelihoods, cultural traditions, and spiritual practices. This displacement has a negative impact on the overall well-being and integrity of these communities. In conclusion, deforestation, or cutting down plants on a large scale, has numerous negative impacts on the ecosystem. The consequences of this action can be felt on various levels, from habitat destruction to climate change, and reaffirm the importance of preserving and protecting forests and other natural plant communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a journey worth sharing, as we delve into deeper understanding of what makes these organizations stand out. And so, in this article, we explore the fascinating world of some of the top companies from diverse industries. I would like to share the joy of working with one of these fantastic organizations, giving you a vivid glimpse of their ethos and work culture. Identifying the Best Companies To provide context, it is essential to understand what criteria determine the best companies. Factors such as employee satisfaction, workplace infrastructure, management, opportunities for learning and development, benefits, work-life balance, and a strong organizational culture collectively contribute to an outstanding work environment. Various publications issue an annual list of the best companies to work for based on these criteria. While lists may differ, some companies consistently appear in multiple rankings. Our Inclusive and Diverse Culture One of the most admirable aspects of working at a top company is the inclusive environment and diversity in the workplace. My organization has a strong foundation of respect, empathy, and understanding that resonates from the higher management to the newest recruit. This translates into a workforce that consists of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, ages, gender, and experience levels, which creates a harmonious blend of ideas and innovative thinking.

Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones.

Write an article based on this summary: – Despite continued hand-wringing over fiscal policy, President Obama remains on schedule to push for immigration reform this month, an insider tells the Huffington Post. The effort will likely be led by Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who warns that \\"in the end, immigration reform is going to depend very much on whether Speaker Boehner wants to do it.\\" Still, the fiscal cliff negotiations suggest the House Republican leadership could be open to compromise, say immigration reform advocates. Even without Congress, Obama is taking action on the issue: An executive order by the Homeland Security department yesterday offers illegal immigrants a chance to stay in the US while applying for permanent residence—if they can show that time away from close American citizen relatives would cause \\"extreme hardship,\\" the Los Angeles Times reports. Some 1 million people could be affected by the new rules. Before the change, which takes effect in March, the application process could keep spouses, parents, or children away from family members for up to a decade, the New York Times notes. Article:","output":"Title: The Road to Immigration Reform: President Obama's Unwavering Commitment Amid Fiscal Policy Concerns Despite the economic challenges and fiscal policy concerns faced by the United States government, it is evident that the immigration reform issue remains a top priority on President Obama's agenda. This month, a strong push towards immigration reform is expected to take place, with Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren leading the effort, an insider recently informed the Huffington Post. However, the fate of these reforms may significantly depend on whether or not Speaker Boehner is willing to champion the cause. The United States' fiscal policy debates have been a cause of concern for many, with the 'fiscal cliff' situation raising uncertainties regarding the country's future economic stability. Amidst these concerns, focusing on immigration reform might seem like a tough challenge for the government. However, the progress in the fiscal cliff negotiations has shed light on the possibility of a compromise between the two parties to address this critical issue. Advocates of immigration reform have found hope in the fact that the House Republican leadership has shown signs of openness to compromise during the fiscal cliff negotiations, which might be indicative of a similar stance on immigration reform. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a stalwart supporter of immigrants' rights, has warned that decisive action on this issue will largely depend on the willingness of Speaker Boehner to address the immigration reform. Apart from seeking support from Congress, President Obama has also been proactive in tapping into other avenues to tackle the immigration issue. In a recent executive order by the Department of Homeland Security, provisions have been made for illegal immigrants, enabling them to stay in the United States while applying for permanent residence. To qualify, applicants must be able to prove that their absence from the U.S. would result in \\"extreme hardship\\" for their close American citizen relatives, according to the Los Angeles Times. This new measure could potentially impact around 1 million people who have been living in the country illegally. Before the implementation of this rule, which is slated to take effect in March, the application process would often separate family members for a prolonged period, sometimes up to a decade. These recent developments point towards a steadfast approach by the Obama administration to address the immigration reform issue head-on, ensuring the welfare of millions of people in the United States. By offering illegal immigrants the chance to stay in the U.S. while pursuing permanent residency and working closely with lawmakers to shape a comprehensive reform, President Obama demonstrates his unwavering commitment to providing a more secure and inclusive future for all residents of the country, irrespective of their current legal status. As the United States grapples with the complexities of fiscal policy and seeks to foster economic stability, the progress on immigration reform serves as a testament to the resilience and optimism of a government focused on securing a better life for its people. With the possibility of a bipartisan effort led by Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren and the potential support of Speaker Boehner, the road to immigration reform may finally lead to a promising destination."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"I will answer each question individually and then address whether the answers to both questions are the same. Question 1: Do all Pandora charms fit all Pandora bracelets? Why or why not? Answer 1: Yes, all Pandora charms are designed to fit all Pandora bracelets. This is because Pandora creates their charms and bracelets using a standardized threading system. Each charm has a hole with a threaded interior that can easily screw onto any Pandora bracelet, regardless of its specific design or size. This system allows for versatility and personalization, as customers can mix and match charms to create unique combinations. Question 2: How do you put charms on a Pandora bracelet? Answer 2: To put charms on a Pandora bracelet, follow these steps: Step 1: Open the clasp of the bracelet. Most Pandora bracelets have a barrel clasp that opens by applying pressure to the groove on one half of the clasp, then twisting it counterclockwise. Step 2: Slide the first charm onto the bracelet by threading the bracelet through the charm's hole. Rotate the charm so that its hole aligns with the bracelet's threaded end, and then screw the charm onto the bracelet. Step 3: Continue to add charms by repeating Step 2, making sure to secure each charm by screwing it onto the bracelet. Alternate between different sizes, styles, and colors to create an appealing pattern. Step 4: Once you've added all the desired charms, close the bracelet by aligning both halves of the barrel clasp and twisting them clockwise until they snap together. To answer your final question, the answers to both questions are not the same because they address different aspects of the Pandora charm and bracelet system.

A childhood accident leaves Leo mute and his devout Amish mother refuses surgery. As an adult in 2035, he works as a bartender at a Berlin strip club owned by Maksim and dates cocktail waitress Naadirah. She confides in her friend Luba that she has not told Leo about her past or her desperate need for money. After Stuart, a rowdy customer, sexually harasses Naadirah, Leo assaults him. Naadirah talks Leo down by telling him that she needs to keep her job. Naadirah shows up at Leo's apartment and attempts to tell him about something important. Leo shows her an elaborate bed he has been carving as a present for her. Naadirah is overcome with emotion and they have sex. Elsewhere, Maksim's mobsters meet two American surgeons, Cactus Bill and Duck, who run a black-market clinic. Bill desperately wants to leave Berlin and has pressed Maksim to provide forged documents for him and his young daughter, Josie. Duck, however, enjoys living in Berlin and runs a side business where he installs implants and performs cybernetic surgery. Stuart returns to the strip club and taunts Leo, leading to a fight and Maksim firing Leo. When he's unable to contact Naadirah, Leo asks Luba for help, but Luba refuses. An anonymous text message leads Leo to a black-market bazaar run by Stuart. Bill and Josie are there, and Bill takes Josie away as Stuart confronts Leo. Suddenly remembering that Naadirah wrote an address on his notepad a while back, Leo leaves the bazaar after using charcoal to read the imprint.  Naadirah's address leads Leo to Oswald. When Leo expresses interest in a picture of Naadirah, Oswald assumes Leo works for Maksim's underling Nicky Simsek, who is skimming money from Maksim's prostitutes.

The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - Rolling Stones Records was the record label formed by the Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman in 1970, after their recording contract with Decca Records expired. It was first distributed in the United States by Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco Records. Beginning in 1973 it signed a distribution deal with Atlantic Records. In 1986 Columbia Records started distributing it. In the UK, it was distributed by EMI. The label was initially headed by Marshall Chess, the son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess. It was discontinued in 1992 when the band signed to Virgin Records, but the tongue-and-lips logo remains on all post-1970 Rolling Stones releases.  - \`\` Some Girls '' is the title track of English rock and roll band the Rolling Stone 's 1978 album Some Girls . It marked the third time a song on one of the band 's albums also served as the album 's title and is noted for its risque lyrics concerning the title 's \`\` some girls '' . Alongside previous Stones releases that courted controversy ( \`\` Under My Thumb '' , \`\` Brown Sugar '' , \`\` Star Star '' ) due to their apparently degrading lyrics towards women , \`\` Some Girls '' caused a ruckus among both feminists and civil rights activists over such lyrics as \`\` black girls just want to get fucked all night '' and \`\` Chinese girls are so gentle / They 're really such a tease '' . Mick Jagger and the band defended the song , saying the lyrics mocked actual stereotypical feelings towards women . Saturday Night Live cast member Garrett Morris commented on the controversy with a mock - editorial on the show 's Weekend Update segment : After giving the impression that he was going to openly criticize the Stones , he quoted a sanitized version of the \`\` Black girls just ... '' line , then stated \`\` I have one thing to say to you , Mr. Mick Jagger ... where are these women ? ! ? '' The song is demonstrative of the unconventional uses of steel guitars heard throughout the Some Girls album , with an unusual , droning , phased two - chord groove that 's among the Stones ' most unusual arrangements . The original cut of the song ran some 23 minutes and featured verses Jagger came up with as they went along . Harmonica player Sugar Blue provides some virtuosic blues - style solos on the track . The song was featured heavily on the Stones ' 1999 North American No Security Tour which concentrated on lesser - known songs from the band 's catalogue . A performance during the band 's 2006 leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour was captured for the 2008 live album Shine a Light .  - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.  - The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The original line-up consisted of Brian Jones (rhythm guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (lead guitar, backing vocals), Ian Stewart (piano), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Other touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (196782), Billy Preston (through the mid 1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982-present). The band was first led by Jones, but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership while Jones dealt with legal and personal troubles.  - Some Girls is the 14th British and 16th American studio album by the Rolling Stones, released in 1978 on Rolling Stones Records. It reached number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200 album chart, and became the band's top selling album in the United States, certified by the RIAA as having six million copies sold as of 2000. It was a major critical success, becoming the only Rolling Stones album to be nominated for a Grammy in the Album of the Year category. Many reviewers called it a classic return to form and their best album since 1972's \\"Exile on Main St.\\"  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \\"folk\\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.  - Exile on Main St. is a double album by English rock band the Rolling Stones. It was released on 12 May 1972 by Rolling Stones Records and was the band's tenth studio album released in the United Kingdom. The record's music incorporates rock and roll, blues, soul, country, and gospel genres. Although it originally received mixed reviews, \\"Exile on Main St.\\" has since been considered to be the Rolling Stones' best work while being ranked on various lists as one of the greatest albums of all time.  - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.    What is the relationship between 'some girls ' and 'the rolling stones'? The answer is:","output":"\\"Some Girls\\" is the title track of English rock and roll band the Rolling Stones' 1978 album Some Girls. The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962, and \\"Some Girls\\" is one of their popular songs and albums."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - gas station - power engines - burn hot - fuel tank - car  Explain why a human would choose \\"car\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"car\\" as the answer to the question \\"What do you use petrol to power?\\" because it represents the most direct and relatable example of a device that typically uses petrol as a source of energy. First, let's explore the other options given: - Gas station: A gas station is a place where petrol is stored and sold to consumers rather than an object that is powered by petrol. While gas stations may use small amounts of petrol for maintenance tasks or generators, their primary function is to distribute petrol to vehicles. - Power engines: While this option is not incorrect, it is a more general term that encompasses various types of engines that may use petrol for power generation. An engine is a device that converts the chemical energy from fuel (such as petrol) into mechanical energy. However, this option does not specify a particular type of powered device, as engines can be found in a variety of applications. - Burn hot: Petrol does indeed burn hot when ignited, but this phrase doesn't describe a specific object or application of petrol. Rather, it highlights one of the characteristics of petrol. - Fuel tank: A fuel tank is a container that stores petrol for later use, but it does not use or consume petrol. It merely holds the fuel until it's required by an engine or another device. On the other hand, a car is an object that typically relies on petrol as a primary energy source to power its internal combustion engine (ICE). The petrol stored in the fuel tank is pumped into the engine, where it is combined with air, compressed, and then ignited, generating mechanical energy that drives the pistons and, ultimately, propels the car forward. A car is a widely recognized and commonly used mode of transportation for billions of people around the world. The vast majority of cars on the roads today are petrol-powered, making them a primary consumer of this fuel. Therefore, the human would likely choose \\"car\\" as the most relevant and easily understood example of an object powered by petrol. This answer also highlights the broader applications of petrol-powered vehicles, which are not limited to cars alone. Petrol is used to power various other forms of transportation, such as motorcycles, boats, and some small aircraft. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"car\\" to answer the question \\"What do you use petrol to power?\\" because it represents a specific, widely recognized, and commonly experienced application of petrol as an energy source for transportation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who had ten more children with his third wife? is inside the article: Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Question: What is the nutitional value to humans of poultry and poultry products? Is \\"Poultry meat and eggs provide nutritionally beneficial food containing protein of high quality.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, \\"Poultry meat and eggs provide nutritionally beneficial food containing protein of high quality.\\" is a correct answer, but it can be elaborated further to provide more details. Here are the steps I would follow to explain the nutritional value of poultry and poultry products to humans: Step 1: Define poultry and poultry products Poultry includes chicken, turkey, duck, and other farmed birds used for their meat and eggs. Poultry products include the meat itself, as well as eggs and other by-products like liver and giblets. Step 2: Identify key nutrients in poultry and poultry products Poultry meat and poultry products are rich sources of nutrients essential for human health, including: 1. High-quality protein: Necessary for the growth, maintenance, and repair of body tissues. Poultry provides complete protein, containing all the essential amino acids needed by our body. 2. B vitamins: Poultry meat and eggs contain various B vitamins, including B2, B3, B6, and B12, which help support energy metabolism, brain function, and the formation of red blood cells. 3. Minerals: Poultry meat and eggs contain minerals such as iron (heme-iron, which is more easily absorbed by the body), zinc, selenium, and phosphorus, which are essential for various biological functions, including immune system support, antioxidant activity, and bone health. 4. Unsaturated fats: Although poultry contains saturated fats, it also contains unsaturated fats such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, which may support heart health when consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet. Step 3: Mention the nutritional differences of various poultry types Different types of poultry may provide slightly different nutrient profiles. For example, duck and goose meat are higher in fat compared to chicken and turkey. Also, dark meat (legs and thighs) of poultry contains more fat and calories than white meat (breast). Step 4: Summarize the benefits of poultry consumption in a human diet In summary, poultry meat and eggs provide nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein, various vitamins and minerals, and unsaturated fats.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\",  answer the following question.

When faced with the choice between supporting a cause that has a direct impact on the lives of community members and one that offers an enjoyable and perhaps memorable experience for a few individuals, the decision to prioritize the former reflects the group's solidarity, understanding, and ethical values. The collective response of the community to stand up against a potentially life-affecting issue can serve as an example to others, emphasizing the importance of choosing to support and invest in efforts that can have a lasting, life-changing impact. Moreover, the community's choice to focus on the disease demonstrates a long-term vision and a deeper understanding of the potential ripple effects of a widespread health crisis. Recognizing that diseases can have far-reaching economic and social impacts, the community members chose to put their efforts and resources into ensuring a healthier future for all who may be affected.

Help as much as you can. I read this background article the other day: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  I am facing a new situation today: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.

This means that it can endure the application of herbicides to control weeds without being harmed, allowing for improved weed management, potentially reduced use of chemicals, and increased crop yield due to decreased harm to the crops.

The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications - Portugal's then current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes. In the grounds of avoiding a potentially serious financial crisis in the Portuguese economy, the Portuguese government decided to give them a bailout, eventually at a future loss to taxpayers and to the Portuguese people in general.

For this sentence, we split it into three parts: The primary event, the prior event, and the failure.  1. \\"Moreover, the Syrian uprising has come on the heels of\\" is translated as \\"Ayrıca, Suriye ayaklanması hemen ardından gelmiştir\\". In English, \\"on the heels of\\" is an idiom that means 'right after'. In Turkish, we express this as \\"hemen ardından gelmek\\" which directly translates to 'to come right after'. 2. \\"Iran's own brutal suppression of protestors following the 2009 presidential elections\\" corresponds to \\"2009 başkanlık seçimlerinin ardından İran'ın kendi protestocularına karşı acımasız baskısı\\". The phrase structure in Turkish differs from English. So, the timeframe \\"following the 2009 presidential elections\\" is moved to the beginning of the clause. 3. \\"and the failure of its economic model.\\" is translated as \\"ve ekonomik modelinin başarısızlığı\\". In Turkish, the possessive form is used differently. Thus \\"its economic model's failure\\" translates to \\"ekonomik modelinin başarısızlığı\\".

Scientists have discovered a classified document from an ancient archive, revealing the existence of Earth-Prime – a term that refers to Earth's initial version before it underwent numerous temporal alterations by time-travelers. Dr. Evelyn Harris, a renowned physicist and expert on time-travel, leads an international team of scientists to uncover the dark past of Earth-Prime. They develop a prototype time machine called the \\"ChronoSphere,\\" capable of traveling back to Earth-Prime's era as they seek to uncover the hidden history of Earth and perhaps save it from the imminent catastrophe. Upon their first temporal jump, they find themselves in an alternate version of the year 1900. Earth-Prime is a pristine, sustainable world with an advanced civilization that has managed to strike a balance between technology and nature. The team learns that the time-travelers who came before them were actually villainous agents hunting for an ancient artifact known as the \\"Genesis Paradox,\\" a mysterious device with the power to reshape reality itself. The agents intend to return to their own time and use the Genesis Paradox to establish a tyrannical regime over Earth's alternate timelines, erasing all resistance and creating an eternal dystopia. Dr. Harris and her team must race against time to locate the Genesis Paradox before the agents can get their hands on it and protect Earth-Prime from suffering the same fate as their own dying world. As the thrilling adventure unfolds, Dr. Harris and her team face numerous challenges in Earth-Prime, discovering forgotten technological wonders, engaging in epic battles, and forging alliances with Earth-Prime's inhabitants, who possess extraordinary abilities. In the process, they learn valuable lessons about what went wrong in their own timeline and how they can correct their mistakes to save Earth. In the climactic battle, Dr. Harris and her team confront the evil agents, who have managed to locate the Genesis Paradox. With the help of their newfound allies, they defeat the agents and secure the device – but not without great sacrifice. With a heavy heart, Dr. Harris uses the Genesis Paradox to repair the damage done to the timelines, giving Earth another chance and restoring Earth-Prime as its original state in history. The team returns to their own time, finding Earth revitalized and on the path to environmental recovery. Inspired by their adventure and the lessons learned in Earth-Prime, humanity unites to preserve their world and its future. The Earth-Prime legacy lives on as a reminder that a sustainable future is possible when we learn from our past mistakes and work together for a better tomorrow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. turn opposite right thrice after jump twice A:","output":"Part #1: \\"after\\" Usage: [scope A] after [scope B] This means that scope B will be executed first, followed by scope A. In the given command \\"jump twice after turn opposite right thrice\\", scope A is \\"turn opposite right thrice\\" and scope B is \\"jump twice\\". Part #2: \\"twice\\" and \\"thrice\\" Usage: [command] twice, [command] thrice This means the command will be executed two times (twice) or three times (thrice). In the given command, \\"jump twice\\" will execute the action I_JUMP two times, and \\"turn opposite right thrice\\" will execute the sequence of actions related to \\"turn opposite right\\" three times. Part #3: \\"turn opposite\\" Usage: turn opposite [direction] This means the agent will turn backward in a specified direction (left or right). In the given command, \\"turn opposite right\\" means the agent will turn 180 degrees to face the opposite direction, but with a right turn. The action will be a combination of two I_TURN_RIGHT actions since each I_TURN_RIGHT is a 90-degree turn. Based on the analysis above, the sequence of actions for the command \\"turn opposite right thrice after jump twice\\" would be: I_JUMP, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Moreover, it highlights specific positive aspects such as the catchy melodies that could get stuck in your head and emphasizes the excellence of songs like \\"Safety in Numbers\\" and \\"TV Zombie.\\" On the other hand, the review does point out some downsides to the product. It states that the compilation of songs is more lo-fi than their previous album, which might not appeal to everyone. Additionally, while also discussing the quality of the other songs, the reviewer specifically mentions that \\"Fort Surrounded\\" is a horrible track, which can negatively influence one's decision to buy the product. Overall, the chances of buying the product would depend on the weight given to these positive and negative aspects by the potential buyer. If one values the catchy and melodic nature of the songs and the distinctiveness of Juliet Swango's voice, the review might increase the chances of buying the product. However, if the lower sound quality and potential presence of a poor track in the compilation would significantly impact the overall satisfaction with the product, this review might decrease the chances of making a purchase. In the end, it would depend on the preferences and priorities of the individual considering the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

First, get all the terms with f on one side of the equation. To do this, you can add f to both sides of the equation. Doing this will help you eliminate the -f on the right side of the equation.    -5f + f = -f + f + 16 Which simplifies to:    -4f = 16 2. Now, to get the value of f, you need to isolate f by dividing both sides of the equation by -4.    -4f / -4 = 16 / -4 3. When you simplify the equation, you will find the value of f:    f = -4 So, the solution for the equation -5f = -f + 16 is f = -4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And if you are experiencing that right now, I’m so sorry for you, but it gets better. Hear me out. I was once dating this girl from college who showed genuine interest in me and for that and many other reasons, I really liked her. Well, you could say I loved her. We had been together for a week. One day, we went on a trip. It was all fun and games and laughing. I had the best time of my life. We were walking on the beach of a lake during sunset. We were talking and suddenly, I felt her tone getting more and more depressed. At some point, she concluded that “we need to take a break.” Trying to understand her arguments for that, the break turned into a breakup. Now, one-week-into-a-relationship-with-awesome-girl me couldn’t handle this sudden change of affairs. I spent weeks reliving this day, especially the conversation on the beach, and trying to figure out where it went wrong. I even got into an episode of mania. Having to see her every day in college was torture. It was probably the worst breakup in my life. I seriously considered transferring to another university. Several weeks into the breakup, I decided, with the aid of my friends, that I have to move on. To be honest, I relapsed a lot. One time, I actually sat down with her and said I still have feelings for her. What really helped me to get out of this was the thing I hated the most at that time: taking a break. I avoided her, in real life and on social media, and eventually, I forgot that she even existed. I developed new hobbies and made new friends. Now, I healed properly and we’re back to being friends (Yes, it’s possible to stay friends with your ex).

Act II: Dr. Zhivago learns that Lara's ill mother lives in a remote part of the village. Driven by guilt and the desire to help, he goes to the mother's home, expecting to find Lara attending to her sick mother. When he arrives, he discovers Lara's deep, dark secret - Lara's husband, a ruthless and powerful military officer (played by an imposing actor), had been abusing both her and her mother.

Engaging with readers (and an expert) in a comment thread It's always great to see readers weigh in on our stories in the comments section posted beside each of our pieces. But when I wrote a front-page take-out about race and school discipline in late December, the comments arrived in an online torrent. By 9 a.m., with more than 2,000 posted, an editor asked me to jump in. The idea was that I could pose questions, build on ideas — basically engage thoughtful remarks and help facilitate a discussion that our readers seemed to want to have. In a sense, it was like an online chat. I introduced myself and asked readers about the merits of kicking kids out of school. A commenting badge appeared with my comments, identifying me a Washington Post staffer. I mentioned the trends in our local area. I added some material about the latest research, which had been cut from the final version of my story because the piece was too long for the allotted space. It was a heated and fast-moving debate. I decided pretty quickly that it might help to bring in one of the experts I had quoted in my story. After all, I'd spent a couple of weeks on my piece. But Dan Losen, of UCLA, had recently authored a report on racial disparities for the National Education Policy Center, at University of Colorado, and spent much of his career studying the issue. As it turned out, Losen had time that day, agreed to participate and offered comments on and off for a few hours. I think he posted half a dozen lengthy replies and observations. He pointed to research evidence from Harvard about racial bias, for example. He cited data from discipline studies in Texas and Indiana. He responded in detail to concerns and doubts about the implications of racial disparities. Afterward, our online engagement team thought this set-up might be a model for future stories: Why not bring some of the people behind our journalism into the reader discussion that typically follows publication? That way, our readers gain access to people with whom they don't ordinarily get to exchange ideas. It might deepen the experience of reading and commenting; it might enrich the back-and-forth. For my story, I'd say it clearly did. Discipline Policies, Successful Schools, and Racial Justice Daniel J. Losen, 2011) Suspended Education: Urban Middle Schools in Crisis (Daniel J.

Question: How long has Dean been working at the Shenaneganz Title: Waiting... Movie plot: The film focuses on several characters. One of the main protagonists, Dean (Justin Long), has been a waiter at a restaurant called Shenaniganz for four years since graduating from high school, and has not earned a degree during his four years at a community college. When Dean learns from his mother that a former high school classmate, Chett (Travis Resor), now has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, he begins to rethink his direction-less life. Dean's friend and co-worker, Monty (Ryan Reynolds), is in exactly the same situation, but has accepted that his future lies with the restaurant. Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a newly hired waiter who is constantly interrupted throughout most of the film before he can speak, usually by Monty. Also working with Dean is Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict), a hopeless romantic who cannot urinate in public, and Dan (David Koechner), the uptight manager who is grooming Dean as his protÃ©gÃ©. Rounding out the staff are 17-year-old hostess Natasha (Vanessa Lengies), abrasive waitress Naomi (Alanna Ubach), waitress (and Monty's ex-girlfriend) Serena (Anna Faris), Dean's girlfriend and fellow waitress Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday), stoner busboys T-Dog and Nick (Max Kasch and Andy Milonakis), head chef Raddamus (Luis Guzman), the insane, unsanitary chef Floyd (Dane Cook), lesbian bartender Tyla (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and the pensive and philosophical dishwasher Bishop (Chi McBride). The waiters preoccupy themselves with endless gossip, complaining about the customers, seeking covert revenge on particularly rude or annoying patrons, and playing a special kind of game which involves flashing genitalia at a fellow worker (the \\"Penis Showing Game\\"). Each employee has his or her own problems and stories, which are interwoven with the ebb and flow of business. A common phrase used throughout the film, which is referred to in the Shenaniganz training video is \\"The only thing different between extraordinary and ordinary, is that little bit of extra!\\"...

Information:  - Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin.  - In chemistry, pH (potential of hydrogen) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions. More precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Pure water is neutral, at pH 7, being neither an acid nor a base. Contrary to popular belief, the pH value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively.  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then:  - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation.  - Sunset Yellow FCF ( also known as Orange Yellow S , or C.I. 15985 ) is a petroleum - derived orange azo dye with a pH dependent maximum absorption at about 480 nm at pH 1 and 443 nm at pH 13 with a shoulder at 500 nm . When added to foods sold in the US it is known as FD&C Yellow 6 ; when sold in Europe , it is denoted by E Number E110 .  - Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions, separating chemical compounds by their boiling point by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the compound will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used.  - A hydrogen ion is created when a hydrogen atom loses or gains an electron. A lone positively charged hydrogen ion (or proton) can readily combine with other particles and therefore is only seen isolated when it is in a gaseous state or a nearly particle free space. Due to its extremely high charge density of approximately 2×10 times that of a sodium ion, the bare hydrogen ion cannot exist freely in solution as it readily hydrates, i.e., bonds quickly. The hydrogen ion is recommended by IUPAC as a general term for all ions of hydrogen and its isotopes.  Depending on the charge of the ion, two different classes can be distinguished: positively charged ions and negatively charged ions.  - Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction.  - A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena.  - A mordant or dye fixative is a substance used to set dyes on fabrics or tissue sections by forming a coordination complex with the dye which then attaches to the fabric or tissue. It may be used for dyeing fabrics, or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. The term mordant comes from the present participle of French \\"mordre\\", \\"to bite\\". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion. The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline.  - Molar concentration, also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration, is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, or of any chemical species, in terms of amount of substance in a given volume. A commonly used unit for molar concentration used in chemistry is mol/L. A solution of concentration 1 mol/L is also denoted as 1 molar (1 ).  - A dye is a colored substance that has an affinity to the substrate to which it is being applied. The dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution, and may require a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber.  - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene.  - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Oleum (Latin \\"oleum\\" = \\"oil\\"), or fuming sulfuric acid, is a solution of various compositions of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid, or sometimes more specifically to disulfuric acid (also known as pyrosulfuric acid). Oleum is idenfied by the CAS number 8014-95-7.  - In computer science, ACID (\\"Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability\\") is a set of properties of database transactions. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.  - E numbers are codes for substances that are permitted to be used as food additives for use within the European Union and Switzerland. The \\"E\\" stands for \\"Europe\\". Commonly found on food labels, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority.  - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).  - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the agency of the European Union (EU) that provides independent scientific advice and communicates on existing and emerging risks associated with the food chain.

This article: The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan. Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga. The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day Maharashtra. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at Ellora ascribed to his period. The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at Ellora is their creation of the monolithic Kailasanath Temple, a splendid achievement confirming the \\"Balhara\\" status as \\"one among the four principal Kings of the world\\". The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including Ravana, Shiva and Parvathi while the ceilings have paintings. The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is Karnata Dravida according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the Shikharas common to the Nagara style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka. According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world. According to art historian Percy Brown, as an accomplishment of art, the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture, a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers.While some... contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the art historian who stated that  the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture?, what is it ?","output":"The last name of the art historian who stated that the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture is Brown.

The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state.

Article:It was Tuesday - a day considered holy by many Hindus - and we approached a popular temple in blistering heat. We headed towards a huge cow shelter in the basement of the temple. Dildar Hussain Beg told me he visited the temple every Tuesday after offering prayers in the nearby mosque to look after more than two dozen cows. \\"I have been coming here for more than 10 years and these cows are my family. I also visit several other cow shelters regularly,\\" he said. But Mr Beg does not just visit cows, he also protects them. Along with a few of his neighbours, Mr Beg has formed a small organisation called Muslim Gauraksha Dal (Muslim Cow Protectors) and is trying to \\"educate\\" members of his community to stop eating beef. \\"Cow protectors\\" in India have been in the news for a series of assaults on people transporting cows. Many of the attacks have been against Muslims, while the cow protection squads are overwhelmingly Hindu. The cow is considered sacred by Hindus and killing the animal is illegal in several states. But beef is eaten in other communities, including by Muslims, in India. Mr Beg is among a small group of Muslims who run shelters to look after cows. Generations of some Muslim families have also looked after cows in shelters owned by Hindus. \\"My community has been constantly accused of indulging in cow slaughter in India. If Muslims don't come forward and renounce cow-slaughter, who else will?\\" he says. Besides working regularly in this cow shelter, he says he travels extensively to other parts of the country to \\"sensitise his community against cow slaughter and abolish the practice of eating cow meat\\". He says he has held camps in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh to spread awareness and, like many other Hindu cow vigilantes, he claims to have informed local police about the illegal transportation of cows in and around Delhi. He denies that he is doing this for \\"publicity\\". \\"I don't believe in any political party and even fought the last parliamentary election as an independent candidate. People from my own community did mock me initially when I urged them to abstain from cow meat but we don't care,\\" he says. His family supports his cause. Mr Beg's wife, Shaheen Begum, says initially his idea of becoming a cow protector came as a surprise. \\"I probably took the least time to agree with his cause because I never liked eating beef and always preferred chicken or fish,\\" she said. But reactions from other relatives have been mixed. \\"Most of the people in our circle don't eat cow meat. A few people initially asked why he attends cow-protection workshops. But nobody asks about it anymore,\\" she said. \\"Some feel he is trying to grab attention but then step back when they hear that he promotes buffalo meat or lamb as a form of nutrition instead of cow.\\" India has seen an alarming rise in incidents related to cow vigilantism, more so after the Hindu nationalist BJP came to power in 2014. In 2015 a Muslim man was lynched for allegedly storing and consuming beef. At least half a dozen attacks on people transporting cows have been reported across the country. Opposition parties have been scathing in their criticism, prompting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to criticise such vigilantes, saying they made him \\"angry\\". But this appears to have had very little impact on the ground. Most recently, a group of Muslim dairy farmers were beaten on a national highway, allegedly by cow vigilantes, for transporting cows from a cattle fair. One of the victims, a 55-year-old man,  later died in hospital. In a recent report Human Rights Watch urged action against those responsible for such attacks. \\"Self-appointed cow protestors driven by irresponsible populism are killing people and terrorising minority communities,\\" the organisation's South Asia Director Meenakshi Ganguly said. But Mr Beg believes that Muslims too can prevent the situation from escalating. \\"It's very simple. If the majority community in my country is uncomfortable with us eating cow, why do it?\\" \\"I have no problems at all with Muslims eating buffalo meat and encourage them to do so. But we are a minority community and have to be considerate towards Hindus who are in the majority. \\"If they consider cows holy, why kill it? That too when buffalo meat is legally available,\\" he explains. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Dildar Hussain Beg, a Muslim man in India, has been visiting and protecting cows in shelters for over a decade.

Languages comprise a collection of words, symbols, and grammatical rules that enable individuals to interact with one another and share information. Today, there are approximately 7,000 spoken languages worldwide, varying greatly in terms of syntax, grammar, and lexicon. 3. English Language: Originating from the Anglo-Frisian dialects spoken in England, English has now evolved into a major global language. With approximately 1.5 billion speakers, it ranks third in terms of native speakers and second as a commonly learned second language. English is an official language in many countries and serves as the primary medium for international business, diplomacy, academe, and technological communication. The global significance of the English language is partly due to the historical expansion of the British Empire and the rapid economic growth and cultural dominance of the United States in the 20th century. 4. Angola: Angola, situated in Southern Africa, is a vast nation spanning over 1.2 million square kilometers (481,400 square miles). Its population is estimated at around 32 million, representing various ethnic groups, such as the Ovimbundu, Kimbundu, and Bakongo. The official language spoken here is Portuguese, a remnant of the European colonizers' influence. Angola has a rich cultural history and abundant natural resources, including oil, gold, diamonds, and arable land. The country has faced numerous challenges in its modern history, including a prolonged armed struggle for independence (from Portugal) and a lengthy civil war. 5. Indiana: A Midwestern state in the United States, Indiana is recognized for its diversified economy, including manufacturing, agriculture, and technology sectors. Some nicknames for Indiana are the \\"Hoosier State\\" and \\"Crossroads of America\\" due to the many interstate highways passing through it, connecting eastern and western regions. 6. Angola, Indiana: Angola is a small city in northeastern Indiana, located in Steuben County, with a population of around 8,600 people. It serves as the county seat and is in close proximity to numerous lakes, making it a popular destination for recreational activities. While Angola, Indiana, shares its name with the African nation of Angola, they are unrelated in terms of history and culture. In conclusion, the given data presents a snapshot of diverse information that encompasses different aspects of the world, from language and nations to towns in the United States. These connections show the multi-dimensional and interconnected nature of global knowledge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the final step of the following process: -  Cells obtain glucose and oxygen - The glucose and oxygen create carbon dioxide - The cells release energy - The cells don't have enough oxygen to repeat this - The cells obtain more oxygen from the air A:","output":"The final step of the aforementioned process is the efficient utilization of the newly obtained oxygen to continue with cellular respiration and energy production. I will outline this process in more detail below. 1. Cells obtain glucose and oxygen: Cells obtain glucose primarily through the food consumed by an organism. The glucose is then transported via the bloodstream to the cells. Oxygen is inhaled through the respiratory system and is transported via the blood, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, eventually reaching the cells. 2. The glucose and oxygen create carbon dioxide: Within the cells, glucose and oxygen are utilized in a series of biochemical reactions known as cellular respiration. This process takes place in the mitochondria and has several steps: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain. These reactions ultimately lead to the production of carbon dioxide, water, and a high-energy molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 3. The cells release energy: The primary purpose of cellular respiration is to generate ATP, which serves as the cell's energy currency. ATP provides the energy required for various cellular processes, such as growth, repair, and maintenance. 4. The cells don't have enough oxygen to repeat this: If oxygen levels are insufficient for the continuation of cellular respiration, cells must resort to alternative methods of producing ATP. One such method, anaerobic respiration or fermentation, does not require oxygen and is less efficient than aerobic respiration. In muscle cells, for example, this process results in the production of lactic acid, which can lead to muscle fatigue and soreness. 5. The cells obtain more oxygen from the air: To resume the more efficient, oxygen-dependent cellular respiration, cells require a continuous supply of oxygen. In response to decreased oxygen levels, the respiratory rate may increase to provide more oxygen to the cells. This is possible due to the intricate coordination between the respiratory and circulatory systems, which work to deliver oxygen to every cell in the body. In summary, the final step of the process involves the cells efficiently using the freshly obtained oxygen to continue with cellular respiration and ATP production. This is essential for maintaining cellular function, growth, and repair within the organism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the exact title of the diploma piece without which Etty could not become a Royal Academician? is inside the article: In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable..., can you guess it ?

Should I be talkative or stay cool when meeting girls?","output":"Although the two questions have some similarities in terms of expressing uncertainty about how to behave during a meeting, their meanings are distinct and pertain to different scenarios. Let's examine them one by one. 1. \\"Should he stay in a hotel when we meet?\\" This question seeks advice on the suitability of someone staying in a hotel when they come for a meeting. The context could involve a business gathering or a personal rendezvous, where the person asking the question wants to make sure that the hotel stay is appropriate for the situation. They could be considering alternative lodging options, e.g., staying with a local or at a rental property, but they are not sure whether those alternatives offer the desired balance between comfort, convenience, and propriety. 2. \\"Should I be talkative or stay cool when meeting girls?\\" This question focuses on social interactions, particularly when meeting girls, and seeks guidance on exhibiting the right balance of talkativeness and relaxed demeanor. The question assumes that being too talkative might seem overbearing or annoying, while staying too \\"cool\\" could come across as aloof or unapproachable. The person asking the question wonders whether they should actively engage in conversation with the girls, expressing their thoughts and opinions, or maintain a more restrained, potentially mysterious presence. In summary, while both questions share some similarities in expressing uncertainty and seeking advice about how to act in a meeting scenario, they are not the same. The first question concerns the choice of accommodation for someone visiting for a meeting, whereas the second question addresses the dilemma of choosing an appropriate level of talkativeness during social interactions with girls."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Rammstein (German pronunciation: ['RamStaIn]) is a German Neue Deutsche Harte band, formed in 1994 in Berlin. Throughout its existence, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged--lead guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe, bassist Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Riedel, drummer Christoph \\"Doom\\" Schneider, lead vocalist Till Lindemann, rhythm guitarist Paul H. Landers, and keyboardist Christian \\"Flake\\" Lorenz. The band helped to found a subgenre within German hard rock and metal that became known as Neue Deutsche Harte. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages including English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Rammstein started recording Sehnsucht in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta. The album was again produced by Jacob Hellner. \\"Engel\\", the first single from the album, was released on 1 April 1997 and reached gold status in Germany on 23 May. This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, named Engel - Fan Edition. This contained two previously unreleased songs, \\"Feuerrader\\" and \\"Wilder Wein\\". Release of the second single from the album Sehnsucht was \\"Du hast\\", which hit the German single charts August 1997 at number 5. Rammstein then continued touring in the summer while Sehnsucht was released on 22 August 1997. The album reached number 1 in Germany after two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, Herzeleid and both Sehnsucht singles (\\"Du hast\\" and \\"Engel\\") were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold-out shows throughout Europe in September and October. On 5 December 1997, they embarked on their first tour of the United States as the opening act for KMFDM. In August 1998, the band released a cover of the song Stripped, originally released by Depeche Mode in early 1986; it was included on the tribute album For the Masses, the Rammstein version obtained moderate success in Germany and Austria.  On 22-23 August 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin; the biggest show the band had played there up to that date. Supporting acts were Danzig, Nina Hagen, Joachim Witt and Alaska. The show was professionally filmed, intended to be released on their upcoming live DVD, Live aus Berlin.  Rammstein embarked on a live tour with Korn, Ice Cube, Orgy and Limp Bizkit called the Family Values Tour in September through to late October 1998. Continuing their success in the US, Sehnsucht received Gold record status there on November 2.  The band was nominated at the MTV European Music Awards for Best Rock Act and performed \\"Du hast\\" live on 12 November that year.  Rammstein had further success in 1999, starting off the year in February with a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 41st-annual Grammy Awards. A year after it was filmed, the Live aus Berlin concert was released on CD on 30 August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, Live aus Berlin went to number one in the German Album Charts. On 13 September and 26 November 1999 the video and DVD versions of the concert were released respectively. Further popularity ensued with the inclusion of \\"Du hast\\" in The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture.

While both of them faced similar situations in their lives, their way of responding to these challenges greatly differed. Kenneth had a tendency to look at the downside of every situation, diminishing the prospect of success, and focusing on the potential for failure and disappointment. This negative outlook often discouraged those around him, making it harder for Kenneth to maintain meaningful connections and relationships. On the other hand, Matthew was known for his positive attitude and ability to see the silver lining in every cloud. He wholeheartedly believed that with determination and hard work, individuals could overcome any obstacle and achieve their goals. Matthew's optimism was contagious, and it inspired and encouraged those around him to strive for success, resulting in a harmonious and supportive network of friends and colleagues. Despite their contrasting perspectives, Kenneth and Matthew remained close friends, each learning valuable lessons from the other. Kenneth's pessimism sometimes helped to keep the overly optimistic Matthew grounded in reality while recognizing the pitfalls that lay ahead. Conversely, Matthew's optimism shone a light on the possibilities that Kenneth's pessimism obscured, allowing for a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the world around them for both individuals. As time went on, their relationship continued to grow, and they began to appreciate the diverse viewpoints they each brought to the table. They learned that neither of them was entirely right nor entirely wrong; instead, it was their unique outlooks that provided a comprehensive lens through which to view and navigate life's challenges. In the end, while Kenneth was considered a negative individual compared to Matthew because of his pessimistic nature, their friendship forged a balanced and enriching partnership that nurtured personal growth and understanding.

Can you tell me what it is?","output":"To travel from the Zipingpu Hydropower Plant to the Tulong reservoir, one would presumably follow a route along the river connecting the two locations. Since the Tulong reservoir is upstream from the Hydropower Plant, it would indicate that you're going in the right direction. It is important to note that due to the damages sustained by both the Hydropower Plant and the reservoir during the earthquake, potential hazards and challenges might be encountered. Considering the possibility of infrastructure damage, there are a few travel options: 1. Road Transportation: If road infrastructure is still intact and safe to use, you could travel by car, truck, or any other land-based vehicle suitable for the local terrain. You may need to check for available routes and their safety, possibly consulting local authorities about the status of the roads. 2. River Transportation: If the river conditions allow and water transportation is available, you could use a boat or barge to travel from the Hydropower Plant to the Tulong reservoir. This option might be advantageous for transporting equipment or heavy loads that are needed for the repair works or relief efforts. 3. Air Transportation: If both road and river transportation are not feasible, and the distance justifies it, helicopter transportation could be a viable option to reach the Tulong reservoir. Additionally, helicopters might prove beneficial for aerial inspections of the damaged infrastructure and could help deploy emergency personnel, if needed. Additionally, considering that 2,000 troops had been allocated to the Zipingpu Hydropower Plant to release pressure through the spillway, it is suggested to coordinate with them for guidance on the safest and most efficient travel route from the plant to the Tulong reservoir. Whichever method you choose, the priority should always be safety due to the unstable and damaged infrastructure as a result of the earthquake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  A fuel is heated in an oven - Above the oven is a tank of water that is sealed - The tank of water begins to boil above the oven - A the water boils steam is created - The steam is denser than air so it needs a place to go - The steam is forced out of the tank and into a piston - The piston moves up - The valve of the piston closes - The valve on the next piston opens A:","output":"A: The final step of the described process is when the energy derived from the steam is efficiently utilized to perform mechanical work or electrical generation. Here's a detailed description of the whole process:  1. A fuel, typically coal, gas, or biomass, is heated in an oven or furnace, which produces a high amount of thermal energy. 2. Above the oven is a closed/sealed tank containing water, which is heated by the thermal energy coming from the furnace. 3. As the water in the tank continues to be heated, it reaches its boiling point and begins to evaporate, transforming into high-pressure steam. 4. Steam, being denser than air, needs a space to escape, and therefore it is forced out of the tank. 5. The escaping steam enters a piston that is part of a steam engine or turbine system. The high pressure of the steam will force the piston to move upwards. 6. As the first piston reaches its highest point, the valve closes, trapping the steam inside the piston chamber. 7. At this moment, the valve on the next piston opens, allowing the steam to flow from the first piston chamber into the second piston chamber. 8. The high-pressure steam now causes the second piston to move, transferring the force and mechanical energy. The final step in this process is to harness the mechanical energy generated by the movement of the pistons (steam engine or turbine) in the most effective way possible. This can be achieved by: a. Direct mechanical work: Connecting the steam engine or turbine to an array of mechanical devices or machines, such as rotating shafts, gears, or flywheels. This can enable various types of industrial or transport equipment to perform tasks, such as milling, cutting, pumping, or driving vehicles like locomotives or ships. b. Electrical power generation: Converting the mechanical energy into electrical energy by coupling the steam engine or turbine to an electrical generator. When the pistons or turbine blades move, they rotate the generator's shaft, which then transforms the mechanical movement into electrical energy via electromagnetic induction. This electricity can then be transmitted and distributed to power residential, commercial, and industrial applications, or even used for charging electric vehicles. In conclusion, the final step in this process is to efficiently utilize the energy derived from the steam either for direct mechanical work or electrical power generation, essentially transforming a heat source into something that performs useful work or supplies energy to various applications in a sustainable and efficient manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a \\"b).\\" movie review (pick from the following.  a). negative  b). positive).","output":"Title: The Little Things (2021) Director: John Lee Hancock Genre: Crime, Drama, Thriller Rating: ★★★★★ b) Positive Review: \\"The Little Things\\" is a brilliantly crafted crime drama that transports viewers to the unsettling landscape of a thrill-driven, late 1990s Los Angeles. Director John Lee Hancock has ingeniously weaved a tale of mystery, guilt, and self-reflection, all underscored by the relentless pursuit of justice. Denzel Washington leads a stellar cast with absolute finesse as Joe \\"Deke\\" Deacon, a shrewd, introverted Kern County Deputy who is drawn, almost serendipitously, into a series of murders bearing an uncanny resemblance to an unresolved case from his past. Washington's portrayal of Deke is mesmerizing, with his masterful ability to convey the character's inner turmoil through the subtlest of expressions - a furrowed brow, a lingering gaze - alluding to a man tormented by past mistakes. Rami Malek's performance as the ambitious LA detective, Jim Baxter, is equally compelling, offering a stark contrast to his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" Malek delivers a complex character, bringing together the conflicting aspects of Baxter's personality - his ambitious drive, fragile arrogance, and thirst for redemption - as he wrestles with a case that seems perpetually out of grasp. The undeniable show-stealer, however, is the chilling performance of Jared Leto as the elusive, eccentric prime suspect, Albert Sparma. Leto's reinvention as this slim and enigmatic loner is nothing short of captivating, balancing the character's eerie intelligence and veiled menace with moments of dark humor and unexpected empathy. The film's pacing is calculated and deliberate, adding to the overall sense of unease as the case unfolds. A remarkable feat of filmmaking, \\"The Little Things\\" does not rely on gimmicky jump scares or graphic violence to unnerve its viewers. Instead, it ventures deep into the psychology of human nature, steering the audience to confront the unsettling truths lurking in our collective human id. The cinematography, with its dark shadows draped over sprawling cityscapes, echoes the style of a classic neo-noir, further enshrouding us in a cloak of moral ambiguity. Moreover, the score composed by Thomas Newman perfectly complements the visual narrative, combining earthy dissonance with haunting melodies that gradually build tension and enhance the atmosphere. In spite of the dark thematic elements, \\"The Little Things\\" does not fail to provide moments of catharsis and redemption, as the multi-layered characters wrestle with their pasts and face the full spectrum of their humanity - sometimes flawed, but always deeply resonating. \\"The Little Things\\" offers an intense viewing experience, thoughtfully capturing the fragility of the human condition and our perpetual struggle between good and evil. Joined by the exceptional talents of Washington, Malek, and Leto, this film is a testament to the power of great storytelling, and it is sure to leave audiences questioning their own moral compass long after the credits roll. A must-watch for fans of crime drama and psychological thrillers alike."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

When Stucky goes to the nearby restroom, two masked thugs break into the gas station/museum, who for some reason thought it was a good idea to rob a store obviously run by psychopaths. As the two men hold Stucky and Spaulding at gunpoint, the tough-talking lead thug, named Killer Karl, demands that Spaulding hand over the cash register, while the other thug, whom is clearly mentally retarded, holds Stucky back.

Step 1: More miners would not directly affect the act of putting aluminum cans into a recycle bin. However, indirectly, increasing the number of miners could potentially lead to more aluminum being extracted from the earth, making it more readily available and possibly reducing the incentive to recycle. Step 2: The transportation of cans to a facility would also not be directly affected by the number of miners. Indirectly, if the availability of aluminum increases, the demand for recycled aluminum might decline, consequently reducing the number of cans transported to recycling facilities. Step 3: The process of shredding the cans by a machine remains unaffected directly by the increase in miners. Indirectly, the possible decrease in demand for recycled aluminum might reduce the amount of cans being shredded. Step 4: Similarly, heating the cans to melt them would not be directly affected by more miners. However, if less aluminum cans end up being recycled due to changes in demand and supply, fewer cans would be heated to 1400 degrees. Step 5: Pouring the molten metal into molds is also not directly affected by the increase in miners. The indirect effect depends on the changes in the demand for recycled aluminum, which may lead to less molten metal produced and poured into molds. Step 6: Finally, the flattening and rolling of molds into sheets to reuse would not be directly affected by the increase in miners. Indirectly, if the previous steps are affected due to changes in aluminum supply and demand, the number of molds flattened and rolled into sheets would also be reduced. Conclusion: The supposed perturbation (increase in the number of miners) does not directly affect the aluminum can recycling process. However, it could have indirect effects on the process by potentially increasing the supply of aluminum and reducing the incentives to recycle, which in turn may lead to fewer aluminum cans being recycled."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia. The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa). The term is sometimes used for the purposes of grouping countries in statistics.  - Stepanavan, is a town in the Lori Province of Armenia. It is located 139 km north of the capital Yerevan and 24 km north of the provincial centre Vanadzor, in the centre of Yerevan-Tbilisi highway. As of the 2011 census, the population of the town is 13,086. Due to its location on the shores of Dzoraget River among the forest of Lori plateau and Bazum mountains, Stepanavan is considered a resort town in northern Armenia.  - Akhtala; also known as Pghindzavank (meaning \\"Coppermine Monastery\\") is a 10th-century fortified Armenian Apostolic Church monastery located in the town of Akhtala in the marz of Lori, north of Yerevan. The monastery is currently inactive. The fortress played a major role in protecting the north-western regions of Armenia (Gugark) and is among the most well preserved of all in modern Armenia. The main church at the compound is famous for its highly artistic frescoes, which cover the inside walls, the partitions, and the bearings of the building. The modern name of Akhtala was first recorded in a royal decree of 1438. The etymology of the name \\"Akhtala\\" is believed to be of Turkic origin, meaning \\"white glade\\". The original Armenian name of the settlement where the monastery is built is Pghindzahank, which means \\"copper mine\\".  - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south.

It is the site of the medieval fortress \`\` Lori Berd '' located on a peninsula along the deep gorge cut by the Dzoraget and Tashir rivers . Lori Berd is situated at an altitude of 1379 m.  - Yerevan (classical spelling:  ) is the capital and largest city of Armenia, as well as one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities. Situated along the Hrazdan River, Yerevan is the administrative, cultural, and industrial center of the country. It has been the capital since 1918, the thirteenth in the history of Armenia, and the seventh located in or around the Ararat plain.  - Haghpat is a village in the Lori Province of Armenia, located near the city of Alaverdi and the state border with Georgia.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Spitak, is a town in the northern Lori Province of Armenia. It is north of the capital, Yerevan, and west of the provincial centre, Vanadzor. Spitak was entirely destroyed during the devastating 1988 earthquake, and it was subsequently rebuilt in a slightly different location. As of the 2011 census, the population of the town is 12,881.  - The Dzoraget is a river in the Debeda hydrological region in the Lori region in Northern Armenia. It originates in the Bazum Mountains and flows west to east through spectacular gorges around Stepanavan. It finally feeds into the Debed river near Dzoragyugh, which ultimately drains to the Kura river.  - Akhtala, is a town in the Lori Province of Armenia, located along the Shamlugh river, on the slopes of Lalvar mountain, at a distance of 186 km north of the capital Yerevan and 62 km north of provincial centre Vanadzor. Akhtala was a village until 1939 when it was granted the status of an urban community, with its 400 inhabitants. In 1995, the government of independent Armenia reaffirmed the status of Akhtala as a town. According to the 2009 official estimate, Akhtala has around 2,400 inhabitants. However, the town used to have around 4,500 inhabitants during the 1970s.  - Sanahin is a village in the northern province of Lori in Armenia, now considered part of the city of Alaverdi (the cable car that connects it with the Alaverdi centre is supposed to have the steepest climb in the whole former USSR). The village is notable for its Sanahin Monastery complex, founded in the 10th century and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the monastery in nearby Haghpat.  - Alaverdi, is a town in the Lori Province at the northeastern part of Armenia, near the border with Georgia. It is located at the only direct rail link between Armenia and Georgia. Situated at the bottom of the Debed river gorge, Alaverdi is an important commercial and industrial centre in northern Armenia.  - The Armenian Highlands (also known as the Armenian Upland, Armenian plateau, Armenian tableland, or simply Armenia) is the central-most and highest of three land-locked plateaus. To its west is the Anatolian plateau which rises slowly from the lowland coast of the Aegean Sea and converges with the Armenian Highlands to the east of Cappadocia. To its southeast is the Iranian plateau, where the elevation drops rapidly by about to above sea level. The Caucasus extends to the northeast of the Armenian Highlands. To the southwest of the Armenian Highlands is Upper Mesopotamia.  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.

Article: Many famous painters worked in Antwerp during the city's period of greatest power but Peter Paul Rubens is undoubtedly the most famous one of them. Known as Rubens House, the palace-like residence  and studio where Rubens worked and lived from 1616 until his death in 1640 is now one of Antwerp's most visited museums. Almost all of the works Rubens and his students created in the Rubens House have been dispersed   over major museums across the whole world, but there is still an impressive collection well worth the visit. Besides paintings form the master himself you will find other works of art and furniture of the 17th century as well as paintings from his students, including works by Jacob Jordaens and Anthony Van Dyck. The Rubens House was not only a studio but also a meeting place for the rich and famous. His clients  included wealthy merchants, diplomats, and there were also many noblemen who often visited his studio to see how work progressed. The Rubens House even had a special viewing area which allowed visitors to see the artists at work. Ruben bought the house at the beginning of the 17th century after his eight-year-long stay in Italy. Influenced by Italian architecture, he rebuilt the building into an Italian-styled palace with a beautiful garden and moved in the house in1616. After his death the building was sold. New owners modified the building greatly and by 1937, when the building was purchased by the city of Antwerp, it hardly resembled the original structure. The impressive entrance hall, which connected the studio and the residence, is one of the few parts that survived. Other parts have been carefully restored and reconstructed after original plans and paintings of the house. Question: What can be inferred from the text? Answer: OPTIONS: (I). Thanks to its great painters, Antwerp became a rich city.. (II). Ruben possibly showed strong interest in Italian buildings.. (III). Antwerp must be a historical city in Italy.. (IV). The Rubens House was completely rebuilt before 1937.. The answer is:","output":"(II).

Answer the following question: Information:  - David Harbater (born December 19, 1952) is an American mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania, well known for his work in Galois theory, algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry.  - \\"Not to be confused with his wife Michèle Raynaud, who is also a French mathematician working in algebraic geometry.\\"   - The term proposition has a broad use in contemporary philosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the primary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other \\"propositional attitudes\\" (i.e., what is believed, doubted, etc.), the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of declarative sentences. Propositions are the sharable objects of attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This stipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including thought- and utterance-tokens which are not sharable, and concrete events or facts, which cannot be false.  - In abstract algebra , Abhyankar 's conjecture is a 1957 conjecture of Shreeram Abhyankar , on the Galois groups of algebraic function fields of characteristic p. The soluble case was solved by Serre in 1990 and the full conjecture was proved in 1994 by work of Michel Raynaud and David Harbater . The problem involves a finite group G , a prime number p , and the function field of nonsingular integral algebraic curve C defined over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic p. The question addresses the existence of Galois extensions L of K ( C ) , with G as Galois group , and with restricted ramification . From a geometric point of view L corresponds to another curve C  , and a morphism  : C   C. Ramification geometrically , and by analogy with the case of Riemann surfaces , consists of a finite set S of points x on C , such that  restricted to the complement of S in C is an étale morphism . In Abhyankar 's conjecture , S is fixed , and the question is what G can be . This is therefore a special type of inverse Galois problem . The subgroup p ( G ) is defined to be the subgroup generated by all the Sylow subgroups of G for the prime number p. This is a normal subgroup , and the parameter n is defined as the minimum number of generators of G / p ( G ) . Then for the case of C the projective line over K , the conjecture states that G can be realised as a Galois group of L , unramified outside S containing s + 1 points , if and only if n  s. This was proved by Raynaud . For the general case , proved by Harbater , let g be the genus of C. Then G can be realised if and only if n  s + 2 g.  - Algebra (from Arabic \\"\\"al-jabr\\"\\" meaning \\"reunion of broken parts\\") is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians.  - In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, an algebraic structure is a set (called carrier set or underlying set) with one or more finitary operations defined on it that satisfies a list of axioms.  - In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate is . An example in three variables is .  - In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers , , and satisfy the equation for any integer value of greater than 2. The cases and have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity.  - In abstract algebra, field extensions are the main object of study in field theory. The general idea is to start with a base field and construct in some manner a larger field that contains the base field and satisfies additional properties. For instance, the set Q(2) = {\\"a\\" + \\"b\\"2 | \\"a\\", \\"b\\"  Q} is the smallest extension of Q that includes every real solution to the equation \\"x\\" = 2.  - In mathematics, more specifically in the area of modern algebra known as Galois theory, the Galois group of a certain type of field extension is a specific group associated with the field extension. The study of field extensions and their relationship to the polynomials that give rise to them via Galois groups is called Galois theory, so named in honor of Évariste Galois who first discovered them.  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - In mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, Galois theory, named after Évariste Galois, provides a connection between field theory and group theory. Using Galois theory, certain problems in field theory can be reduced to group theory, which is, in some sense, simpler and better understood.  - The University of Pennsylvania (commonly known as Penn or UPenn) is a private, Ivy League university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Incorporated as \\"The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\\", Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and one of the nine original colonial colleges.  - Évariste Galois (25 October 1811  31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel.  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words \\"hypothesis\\" and \\"theory\\" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research.  - In algebra, which is a broad division of mathematics, abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras. The term \\"abstract algebra\\" was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from the other parts of algebra.  - In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof has been found. Conjectures such as the Riemann hypothesis (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.  - Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros.  - In mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part . It was proposed by , after whom it is named. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.

There's a number \\"l\\" that we want to find. We have this equation: -21*l - 107*l = 2958 + 6642 First, let's combine the \\"l\\"s: -21*l and -107*l together would be like taking away 21 apples and then taking away 107 more apples. That would give us -128 apples, so we have: -128*l = 2958 + 6642 Now, let's add 2958 and 6642: 2958 is like having 2958 candies, and 6642 is like having 6642 candies. If we put them all together, we will have 9600 candies. So, our equation becomes: -128*l = 9600 The last step is to find \\"l\\": Since we have -128 \\"l\\"s, it means we're taking away 128 lollipops 128 times. To find out how many lollipops there are, we need to do the opposite of taking away (that's called \\"dividing\\"). So, we will divide 9600 candies by -128: l = 9600 / -128 Calculate that, and we get: l = -75 So the number \\"l\\" we were looking for is -75, like having 75 balloons, but they're going in the opposite direction (like moving down instead of up)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In biology, a hermaphrodite (/hɜːrˈmæfrədaɪt/) is an organism that has complete or partial reproductive organs and produces gametes normally associated with both male and female sexes. Many taxonomic groups of animals (mostly invertebrates) do not have separate sexes. In these groups, hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of sexual reproduction in which either partner can act as the \`\`female'' or \`\`male''. For example, the great majority of tunicates, pulmonate snails, opisthobranch snails, earthworms and slugs are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates. Most plants are also hermaphrodites.

One of the names they picked was Anne Frank, a young girl who wrote a diary while hiding from bad people during a very difficult time called World War II.

In fact, Anne sadly died in one of those places. These people believe that putting her name on a train would bring back painful memories for the ones who lived through those difficult times and their families.

North region was flat and located at sea level.  and a hint : Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra.

Context: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Question: Why did Meade lose his civil rights? Options:  A. politicians stripped him of his civil rights.  B. he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier.  C. not enough information  D. he became a convicted felon. Answer:","output":"B. he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Two friends had unprotected sex with their respective dates on the same night. Everything went fine for both of them. They later found out the bad news. Mike had been infected with HIV. Luckily enough Pete was healthy, he didn't get any diseases.  Which friend had a virus that is transmitted by contact with infected blood?  Hint: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ . The answer is:","output":"Mike had the virus that is transmitted by contact with infected blood. The virus in question here is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which ultimately causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact and exposure to infected bodily fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. In Mike's case, he contracted HIV through unprotected sexual contact with his date. Pete, on the other hand, was fortunate not to contract any diseases during his unprotected sexual encounter. Although he was also at risk, given the nature of the activity, he did not end up getting infected in this instance. HIV is a global issue that has affected millions of people around the world. As of 2008, it is estimated that 38.6 million individuals are living with HIV, and since its initial recognition in 1981, AIDS has led to the deaths of over 25 million people. The pandemic first originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and today it remains a significant public health concern. Prevention efforts, including practicing safe sex and regular testing, are crucial in reducing the spread of the virus.

When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown. Until the moose stepped out onto the road just ahead of them. Question: what I responded to mrs D Options:  A. I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill  B. I owe my early entry into the world to South Hill  C. I owe my early entry into the world to Pontiac Hill  D. not enough information  === The correct answer is","output":"A. I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. In response to Ms. D's teasing about the questionable timeline of my birth, I explain that I have it on good authority that my early arrival into the world is due to Tabusintac Hill. This hill, located in New Brunswick, has a notorious reputation for its steep incline and sharp curve at the bottom, creating a challenging driving experience. In December of 1956, my parents were driving to the Miramichi in a borrowed Pontiac, with my mother being pregnant with me. As my father rounded the corner at the top of Tabusintac Hill, the road appeared to be clear of snow and ice; however, a moose suddenly stepped out onto the road just ahead of their car. The combination of the difficult terrain of Tabusintac Hill and the unexpected appearance of the moose contributed to the early arrival of myself, thus providing an explanation other than premarital relations. By stating that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill, I am emphasizing the role this challenging terrain played in the circumstances surrounding my birth.

In this sentence, the speaker is commenting on the challenges they face regarding cultural barriers. A cultural barrier can be any obstacle that individuals or groups from different cultural backgrounds encounter while communicating or interacting with one another. These barriers arise due to differences in language, traditions, customs, beliefs, and attitudes. Overcoming cultural barriers is an essential skill in a globalized world where people and businesses need to collaborate and communicate with those from different cultures. To do so, one must understand and respect other cultures, their values, and their customs. This might involve learning the language or understanding non-verbal cues specific to those cultures, as well as having an open mind and empathy for other cultural perspectives. Working harder, as mentioned in the sentence, implies that one must put extra effort into navigating such barriers effectively by educating oneself on the cultural differences and developing strategies to communicate respectfully and effectively with people of diverse backgrounds. Through increased cultural awareness, one can foster more inclusive relationships and create a more unified global community.

When we look at unemployment, the minister is boasting of fantastic surpluses in the unemployment insurance fund, which he is putting toward reduction of the deficit, when we look at the restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment insurance fund surplus, the restrictions to the new employment insurance program, we see that this is no joke. Can we infer the following? The restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment insurance fund surplus are no joke.","output":"Yes, we can infer that the restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment insurance fund surplus are no joke. This statement suggests that the minister is taking credit for the impressive surpluses in the unemployment insurance fund. In turn, this surplus is being utilized to reduce the deficit, displaying the effectiveness of implemented restrictions. The reference to \\"no joke\\" emphasizes the seriousness of these actions and their significant impact on the fund surplus, further emphasizing the significance of the restrictions. To provide a more comprehensive explanation, the unemployment insurance fund is a government program that provides temporary financial assistance to unemployed workers who have lost their jobs due to no fault of their own and meet certain eligibility criteria. The fund collects premiums from both employers and employees to create a pool of resources to be distributed to eligible workers. When there is an increase in contributions or a decrease in benefits paid out, a surplus occurs. It is implied that the surplus is attributed to the restrictions on the new employment insurance program. These restrictions might include tightened eligibility criteria, reduced benefit amounts, or limited duration of benefits. Such restrictions aim to ensure that only deserving individuals receive the benefits and prevent misuse of the funds. Moreover, the surplus creates an opportunity for the minister to allocate the excess funds toward reducing the deficit, which usually refers to the difference between government revenue and its expenditure. This reduction in the deficit can be regarded as a positive outcome since it might translate to a lower debt burden for the government and can pave the way for future investments in social programs and public infrastructure. However, it is important to consider the potential implications of these restrictions on individuals seeking unemployment benefits. While the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund indicates fiscal responsibility, it could also mean that genuine cases of unemployment may not receive the assistance they need. This could be due to tightened eligibility criteria, which may exclude some workers from receiving benefits or discourage them from applying. Individuals who are already financially distressed might be further burdened due to the limitations of the insurance program. This could ultimately impact their ability to find new employment and reintegrate into the workforce. In conclusion, while we can infer that the restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment insurance fund surplus are no joke, it is also crucial to examine the potential consequences or drawbacks associated with these measures. Carefully analyzing the ramifications of the restrictions on all stakeholders, including both the government and the unemployed population, will help in achieving a balanced and sustainable approach to managing the unemployment insurance fund and addressing unemployment issues."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What kind of feelings did Steve have for Miss Tennessee? Options:  A. Very positive feelings.  B. Ambivalent feelings.  C. Very negative feelings.  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"A.

LONDON, England -- Graffiti artist Banksy, famed for infiltrating museum collections without their knowledge and spray-painting public buildings around the world, is holding his first major exhibition in years. A Banksy painting of the British House of Commons at England's Bristol museum. This time, however, the anonymous artist worked in tandem with the director of Bristol museum in the UK. CNN's Max Foster got a preview of his largest project to date. The artist's anonymity gained him notoriety and he became one of the art world's biggest names with his works selling at auction for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The exhibition's range, while very varied, remained true to Banksy form with his usual unconventional take on art. See pictures from Banksy's exhibition » \\"I think we might have dragged them down to our level rather than being elevated to theirs\\" Banksy, who is thought to be from Bristol, said about the museum. He filled three stories of the building with his art in 36 hours under tight security, as only a few museum staff were aware of the shows' imminent arrival. His work is hidden among the museum's usual exhibits and is split into different rooms, including installations, paintings and sculptures.

Unfortunately, the spell goes awry and becomes a family curse: any man that falls for an Owens woman will die. And that's exactly what happens to Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian (Nicole Kidman) Owens' father, causing their mother to die of a broken heart. The young girls then live with their two aunts (Stockard Channing, Diane Wiest), who teach them the ways of being a witch and how to deal with the ridicule that comes with the family profession. But one night when they witness their aunts casting a love spell for a neighbor, Sally decides she will never fall in love and dreams up a man that will never exist...Until one day she goes to town with her aunts and she meets the man she falls for. The next thing you know, Sally is happily married to Michael (Mark Feuerstein) with two daughters of her very own. Her sister, in the mean time, has been living in Florida where life is constant parties.But when the 'death watch beetle' sounds, Sally know it is only a matter of time before she loses Michael like her mother lost her father...and like all the Owens women have lost the men they love.

This design allows the client to access the directory without requiring it to support the cumbersome Open Systems Interconnection protocol stack., In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law., The United States Census Bureau (USCB; officially the Bureau of the Census, as defined in Title ) is a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System, responsible for producing data about the American people and economy., The Southern United States, commonly referred to as the American South, Dixie, or simply the South, is a region of the United States of America. The South does not exactly match the geographic south, but is predominantly located in the southeastern corner; Arizona and New Mexico, which are geographically in the southern part of the country, are rarely considered part of the Southern United States, while West Virginia, which separated from Virginia in 1863, commonly is. Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with the Union. Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, they became more culturally, economically, and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states, and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeast by many residents, businesses, public institutions, and private organizations. However, the United States Census Bureau puts them in the South., Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor., Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City., Chicken Express is a regional chain of fast food restaurants concentrated in the Southern United States ., New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States., A fast food restaurant, also known as a quick service restaurant (QSR) within the industry, is a specific type of restaurant characterized both by its fast food cuisine and by minimal table service. Food served in fast food restaurants typically caters to a \\"meat-sweet diet\\" and is offered from a limited menu; is cooked in bulk in advance and kept hot; is finished and packaged to order; and is usually available ready to take away, though seating may be provided. Fast food restaurants are typically part of a restaurant chain or franchise operation, which provisions standardized ingredients and/or partially prepared foods and supplies to each restaurant through controlled supply channels. The term \\"fast food\\" was recognized in a dictionary by MerriamWebster in 1951., Fast food is a type of mass-produced food that is prepared and served very quickly. It began with the first fish and chip shops in Britain in the 1860s. Drive-through restaurants were first popularized in the 1950s in the United States. The food is typically less nutritionally valuable compared to other foods and dishes. While any meal with low preparation time can be considered fast food, typically the term refers to food sold in a restaurant or store with preheated or precooked ingredients, and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away. Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by their ability to serve food via a drive-through.

A: Choose your answer from: *coral selection. *characteristic selection. *intelligent selection. *natural selection. The answer is:","output":"**natural selection.** Genetic diversity serves as a crucial raw material for natural selection. Over many generations, the resulting genetic diversity within a population provides an essential reservoir of variation that can be acted upon by natural selection. Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution that is based on the principle that individuals with certain inherited traits or characteristics are more likely to survive and reproduce than those without those traits. Genetic diversity is important because it provides the raw material from which new advantageous traits can emerge through genetic variation. When these advantageous traits become more prevalent in the population, it gives rise to changes in the species over time, resulting in evolution. Within a diverse genetic population, there is a higher likelihood of individuals carrying traits that can be advantageous or beneficial under different environmental conditions, pressures, or challenges. When the environment changes or a new stressor is introduced, individuals with specific traits that allow them to better cope with these changes have a higher probability of survival and reproduction. Their offspring will inherit these traits at a higher frequency, leading to a gradual change in the population over generations. It is essential to maintain a high level of genetic diversity, even in stable environments, because it will grant a population greater resilience against unforeseen changes, such as the appearance of diseases or alterations in climate. High genetic diversity also facilitates adaptation to new environments, as it increases the chances of individuals possessing the necessary traits for survival and reproduction in those new conditions. In conclusion, the genetic diversity generated over many generations serves as vital raw material for natural selection, which drives the evolution of species. This diversity aids in the adaptation of populations to changing environments and ensures the long-term survival and resilience of a species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With a sigh, he realizes that the tire has finally met its mileage and will need to be replaced to avoid-dangerous blowouts in the future. Determined to not let these unexpected repairs ruin his day, he takes a moment to appreciate the beauty of the old lime-green bicycle, remembering all the exhilarating rides, challenging uphill climbs, and breezy descents they've shared together. Just like any faithful companion, it has been with him through thick and thin, and this tire replacement is just another chapter in their long-shared history. The man rummages through the group of boxes, searching for a replacement tire he'd bought a few months back, anticipating this very moment. After rummaging for a few minutes, he finally finds the brand-new tire tucked away in a dusty box filled with various bicycle maintenance tools. Dusting off the cobwebs and filth, he unfurls the tire and takes a moment to admire its pristine condition, excited that the bike will soon have a new lease on life. With practiced hands, he disassembles the bike's wheel, removing the damaged tire and worn-out inner tube. Carefully, he prepares the new tire and inner tube for installation, ensuring that they are free from any sharp objects that could damage them. He spends several minutes meticulously aligning the new tire on the wheel's rim and inflating the tube to the proper pressure. As he works, he recalls the advice his father had given him years ago when he was first learning about bicycle maintenance: \\"Take care of your bike, and it will take care of you.\\" He feels a strong connection not only to the bike but also to the shared wisdom passed down through generations. Once the new tire is securely in place, the man systematically reassembles the wheel and affixes it back onto the bike, ensuring that the brakes and gears are properly aligned. With the tire replacement process complete, he pumps a few more bursts of air just to get that perfect tire pressure he prefers for his rides. Finally, he takes a step back to admire his freshly rejuvenated bicycle, gleaming under the sun as the vibrant green paint seems to almost radiate with newfound energy. The man feels an intense wave of satisfaction and pride in caring for his trusty steed. Despite the seemingly mundane task, these moments of maintenance are some of the most cherished memories he's made in his love affair with cycling. As he finishes cleaning up the scattered tools and boxes, the man eagerly begins to mentally plan out his next adventure on his now fully-equipped bike, eager to hit the open road and explore new terrain like never before. And as he hops on his bicycle and rides off into the distance, he can't help but smile as he imagines all the thrilling experiences that lie ahead for him and his renewed companion, the lime-green bike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"The Kangxi Emperor sponsored the Peiwen Yunfu, a rhyme dictionary published in 1711, and the Kangxi Dictionary published in 1716, which remains to this day an authoritative reference.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, the statement is correct. The Kangxi Dictionary was published in 1716, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. The Kangxi Dictionary is a comprehensive Chinese dictionary that remains an authoritative reference for the study of the Chinese language even today.  The Kangxi Emperor, who reigned from 1661 to 1722, was a great patron of literature and learning. Apart from sponsoring the creation of the Kangxi Dictionary, he also commissioned other literary works, such as the Peiwen Yunfu, a rhyme dictionary that was published in 1711.  The compilation of the Kangxi Dictionary was a significant undertaking and involved a large team of scholars led by Zhang Yushu and Chen Tingjing. The dictionary consists of 47,035 characters, with detailed explanations, examples of usage, and graphical variants. This vast compendium draws upon a wide range of earlier dictionaries, lexical works, and commentaries, making it an invaluable resource for understanding classical Chinese texts. One notable feature of the Kangxi Dictionary is its use of the 214 \\"radicals\\" or \\"Kangxi radicals\\" as the primary ordering principle. By arranging characters under their radicals, which are basic graphical components shared by a group of characters, the dictionary made it easier for users to locate specific characters and understand their meanings. This system of classification is still widely employed in many modern Chinese dictionaries. In summary, the Kangxi Dictionary was published in 1716 and stands as an enduring testament to the linguistic accomplishments of the Kangxi era. Along with the Peiwen Yunfu published in 1711, these works highlight the Kangxi Emperor's commitment to promoting literature and learning during his reign."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Coming off their bye week, the Lions were at home and wearing their alternate uniforms for a Week 7 duel with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  In the first quarter, Detroit attacked first with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 34-yard field goal, along with RB Kevin Jones getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Buccaneers got on the board with QB Jeff Garcia completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Ike Hilliard.  Afterwards, the Lions ended the half with Hanson kicking a 42-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Detroit increased its lead with Hanson nailing a 32-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Lions increased its lead with WR Calvin Johnson getting a 32-yard TD run.  Afterwards, Tampa Bay worked on a comeback as Garcia completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Maurice Stovall. Later, the Buccaneers would recover their onside kick and eventually turn it into kicker Matt Bryant's 48-yard field goal.  Fortunately, Detroit erased the Buccaneers' hopes of recovering another onside kick. With the win, the Lions improved to 4-2, and also surpassed their 2006 win total.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that building more wind turbines would affect the acidity of rain. In this case, the perturbation could have an indirect effect on the process.  Wind turbines are a renewable energy source that generates electricity without releasing harmful emissions, as opposed to burning coal, which emits sulfur oxides that contribute to acid rain. By building more wind turbines, the reliance on coal as an energy source might be reduced, leading to less coal being burned. Consequently, this would lower the amount of sulfur oxides released into the atmosphere and reduce the formation of sulfuric acid, resulting in less acidic rain. In summary, the perturbation of building more wind turbines could lead to less acidic rain by indirectly reducing the sulfur oxide emissions from burning coal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fill out a Fee Waiver if you cannot afford to pay the filing fee. Fill out any required local forms. File your forms with the court and have them served on the other party.\\"","output":"Title: Navigating the Process of Responding to Family Court Documents Introduction: Receiving court documents, particularly those involving child custody or other family matters, can be a daunting experience. However, understanding the process and your options when responding to such documents is essential to preserving your rights and ensuring the best outcome possible. This article will outline the steps involved in preparing and filing the appropriate forms to respond to family court documents, as well as the process of serving the other party with these forms. Step 1: Understand the Respondent's Options Before you can begin preparing your response, it's important to understand your options as the respondent in a family court case. You may be faced with various scenarios, such as custody disputes, spousal support requests, or property division matters. In each case, your response should be tailored to address the specific issue at hand. It's essential to consult an attorney for legal advice pertaining to your unique situation. Step 2: Fill Out a Response Once you have a clear understanding of your options and the issues at hand, you will need to fill out a response form. This form is designed to let the court know your perspective on the matter and to provide any information relevant to your case that might not be included in the petitioner's documents. Be sure to read the instructions carefully, and fill out the form completely and accurately to avoid any delays or misunderstandings. Step 3: Fill Out a Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) if Applicable If you have minor children with the petitioner, it's crucial to complete a Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) form along with your response. The UCCJEA is a set of uniform rules governing child custody determinations across state lines to prevent conflicting custody orders. Filling out this form ensures the court is aware of any existing custody orders and provides information on the child's residence and any other relevant details. Step 4: Fill Out a Fee Waiver if Necessary Filing fees for family court cases can be expensive, but if you cannot afford to pay the fee, you may be eligible for a fee waiver. This involves completing a form that collects information about your income, expenses, and the size of your family in order to assess your financial eligibility. If approved, a fee waiver enables you to file your response without paying the standard filing fee. Step 5: Fill Out Any Required Local Forms In some jurisdictions, there may be additional local forms required for your specific case type. Be sure to check with your local court clerk or consult your attorney to ensure you have completed all necessary forms. Step 6: File Your Forms with the Court Once all the necessary forms are completed and signed, you will need to submit them to the appropriate court in your jurisdiction. It's a good idea to make multiple copies of your documents, as you may need to provide copies to the other party, your attorney, and for your own records. Step 7: Serve the Other Party After the court has received your forms, you must ensure the other party is notified of your response. This typically involves having a neutral third party, such as a process server or a county sheriff, physically deliver a copy of the documents to the petitioner. Legal service of process ensures that the other party is aware of your response and has the opportunity to respond if they choose to do so. Conclusion: While the process of responding to family court documents can be overwhelming, following these steps and seeking legal guidance when necessary can help ensure you protect your rights and achieve the best possible outcome for your case. Remember that proper organization, attention to detail, and a thorough understanding of the process will significantly contribute to a successful resolution."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Do you like listening to music? Does all of the music bring happiness to you? Do you know some music is noise? What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit  of measure  called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs  when you are working in a noisy environment. Ear muffs for human can protect against noise pollution. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? - A decibel is a unit that measures sound. - In fact, a decibel is also a kind of noise. - A person who hates sound belongs to decibels. - Machines that make loud noise are called decibels.

To reiterate, a decibel is not a type of noise itself, it is a measurement unit. A person's feelings towards sound have no relevance to being \\"part of decibels.\\" And finally, machines that make loud noises are not called decibels, they are quantified by decibels in terms of how loud they are."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Analyze the remaining options Now we are left with three possible options: \\"suitcase,\\" \\"closet,\\" and \\"drawer.\\" Step 3: Assess practicality and accessibility A \\"suitcase\\" is generally used for packing clothes and other items when traveling, so it is not an ideal everyday storage place for a t-shirt. While a t-shirt could be kept in a suitcase, it would likely be temporary and not the primary storage location. A \\"closet\\" is a common place for storing clothes, and it could be a valid place to keep a t-shirt.

Write some highlights for the following article: A 5-year-old boy was sent home on his first day of kindergarten after school officials said his hair was too long. Malachi Wilson, who is half Native American and a member of the Navajo Nation, was dismissed from F. J. Young Elementary in Seminole, Texas for violating school policy that states boys can't have hair that is longer than the collar of their shirt, or wear ponytails. Many Native Americans believe that hair is scared, and cutting it is a manifestation of loss. Scroll down for video. Kicked out: 5-year-old Malachi Wilson was sent home from F. J. Young Elementary in Seminole, Texas on his first day of school because of his long hair, and told he needed to cut it to return. Heartbreaking: 'How do you explain to a 5-year-old that he’s being turned away because of what he believes in?' asked April Wilson, Malachi's mother. 'After we had enrolled him he was excited. He was ready to go. Everyday it was the question, \\"Mom, [am I] going to school?\\"' his mother, April Wilson, told KOSA. No sooner had he arrived however, than Malachi was sent home, with an order from the school's principal, Sherrie Warren, to cut his hair if he wanted to return. Adding insult to injury, when his mother protested his dismissal, noting her son's Native American religious beliefs, Miss Wilson demanded she show proof of his heritage. Once she had provided formal proof Malachi was indeed Native American, he was allowed to return to school, but the young boy still seems hurt. 'It was a sad day,' he said of being sent home. 'It’s kind of heartbreaking because how do you explain to a 5-year-old that he’s being turned away because of what he believes in? Because of his religion, because of what’s part of him,' his mother added. 'Our hair is sacred to us.' Proof: Malachi's mother April was asked to obtain formal paperwork of her son's Navajo heritage, and bring it to the school. School policy: The Seminole Independent School District does not allow boys to have hair that goes past their collars, or wear ponytails. She said she has not ruled out filing a discrimination lawsuit against the district. School district officials say they followed procedure, and pointed out the rule in their handbook that says, 'certain recognized religious or spiritual beliefs may qualify for an exception from provisions of the dress code.' Interestingly enough, the school's mascot is a Seminole, with long hair. Similar case: Adriel Arocha, a member of the Lipan Apache, tribe was was also sent home from school for having long hair in 2008. His family took their case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and won. Malachi's story is very similar to that of another Texas kindergartner, Adriel Arocha, who is also Native American and was also sent home for having hair that was deemed too long by officials in his school district back in 2008. Adriel, a member of the Lipan Apache tribe, and his family were told by the Needville Independent School District that he must either cut or conceal his hair. The family eventually took their case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after the district refused to give Adriel an exemption for religious beliefs, and in 2010 a judge ruled in the family's favor.","output":"A 5-year-old boy named Malachi Wilson, who is half Native American, was sent home on his first day of kindergarten because his hair was too long.

Answer:","output":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of me purchasing the product. The review expresses a few concerns which can be significant deciding factors. Let's examine these concerns one by one: 1. **Uncertainty about the product quality**: The phrase \\"you may get a good or bad battery\\" suggests an inconsistency in the product quality. This could indicate inconsistent manufacturing or quality control processes. As a potential buyer, this introduces a significant risk, especially for a product such as a battery, where safety and reliability are of paramount importance. 2. **The product didn't work**: The reviewer's most significant point is that the battery did not work after being charged, despite being purchased new. This represents a direct failure of the product to perform its primary function and is a major red flag. 3. **The urgency of the situation**: The reviewer bought this battery as an extra for use during a vacation. This indicates that the buyer had a time-sensitive need for the product, increasing the importance of its failure to function. As a potential buyer, this situation would make me question the product's reliability, particularly in moments when I might need it most. 4. **Buyer Beware!**: This last remark can be seen as a warning to potential buyers about the product. It should be taken seriously as it signifies the buyer's regret for purchasing the product and their decision to advise others against it. In conclusion, while this is only one review, it raises several substantial concerns about the product. It indicates that there may be potential quality control issues, reliability problems, and a chance for the product to fail when most needed. Therefore, it would likely decrease the chances of purchasing the product. Naturally, it is also important to consider other available reviews and product information before making a final decision."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Says Small Tax Increase Now May Prevent Large Hike Later Political observers are growing slightly more optimistic about the prospects of a super-committee breakthrough – fueled by an openness by leading Republicans to at least entertain the prospect of new revenues as part of a broad deficit deal. Such a deal could prove problematic to Republicans, the vast majority of whom have signed the Americans for Tax Reform pledge vowing not to raise taxes. But on ABC’s “Top Line” today, a leading Republican lawmaker who has signed the pledge said he and other signers need to consider any deal not just in terms of current taxes, but also for what it could mean for taxes down the road. “Each member of Congress has to look at this in terms of their relationship with their constituents, and any plan that’s put on the table has to be given careful consideration, not just in terms of what it does right now but what it will do in the long term,” said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. “We are facing major increases in taxes in January of 2013 [with the expiration of a series of tax cuts], just a little over a year from now, and this is an opportunity to alter that path in a significant way. So you can look at it as a tax increase, but you can also view it as an agreement that avoids major tax increases in the future and instead defines a different pathway that involves lower taxes than you’d have in 2013.” Asked whether that means he could support something that violates Grover Norquist’s famous pledge, Goodlatte added: “Well, I think all members of Congress ought to give all of these a careful look, and then they have to decide for themselves — does that really mean tax increases or does it mean a different pathway that avoids tax increases in the future?” There is no deal in place from the super-committee, at least not yet. In any event, Goodlatte’s push this week is for a Balanced Budget Amendment – the passage of which, while it’s a longshot in the House and the Senate – would lessen the impact of budget cuts that might otherwise be enacted. Goodlatte’s amendment will come up for a vote in the House this week – the first time since a similar measure passed the House in 1995 that it’s even come up for a final vote. “This is an opportunity for real bipartisanship and to really connect directly with your constituents, and all the other forces that are in play here — including the wishes of members whipping and their leadership — can be ignored, because constituents understand this issue better than any other,” he said. “They have to live with it themselves. Their state legislatures have a balanced-budget requirement, and that’s why we think a lot of Democrats will join us on this vote.” And Goodlatte talked up the prospect of his home-state governor, Gov. Bob McDonnell, joining a national ticket next year as a vice-presidential candidate. “Bob McDonnell would be a great participant in a Republican ticket going into the elections in 2012,” Goodlatte said. “I also think that we have a great opportunity to win back Virginia. Last time was the first time in 40 years that Virginia did not go for the Republican candidate. I think the views of the electorate in Virginia about the president and his performance are very different than the expectations they had when he carried the state. And so with other candidates on the ballot we are likely to carry Virginia as well, but Bob McDonnell would definitely seal the deal.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"GOP Rep. Bob Goodlatte says a small tax increase now may prevent a larger tax hike in the future, and encourages members of Congress to carefully consider this possibility.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? naturally dramatic","output":"Based on the given review with the phrase \\"naturally dramatic,\\" it is not clear whether the opinion of the movie is positive or negative without additional context. The review is too short and lacks information to make a clear determination. However, let's provide an analysis of the phrase itself and how it could potentially be interpreted: 1. Positive interpretation: If the phrase 'naturally dramatic' is interpreted as a compliment to the movie, it could mean that the reviewer appreciates the organic and genuine drama presented in the movie without resorting to artificial or forced storytelling. In this case, the reviewer might be praising the movie's ability to create strong emotional responses and conflicts without being overly manipulative or unnatural with the plot or the character development. This interpretation signifies the reviewer's positive experience with the movie and their recommendation for others to watch and enjoy the the film's dramatic attributes. 2. Negative interpretation: Alternatively, the reviewer might use 'naturally dramatic' as a critique of the movie. This interpretation could suggest that the reviewer found the movie to be overly dramatic, with soap opera-like tropes or clichéd, emotionally heavy-handed scenes. In this context, the reviewer may find that the drama within the plot is either excessive or distracting from the movie's core themes and storytelling. As a result, they may express their dissatisfaction with the movie, potentially indicating that it may not suit the tastes of those who prefer subtlety or moderation in their film's dramatic content.

Please answer this question: who is considered to be the founder of noh?","output":"Kan'ami Kiyotsugu (1333-1384) and his son Zeami Motokiyo (1363-1443) are considered the founders of Noh, a classical Japanese musical drama that has been performed since the 14th century. Noh, which means 'skill' or 'talent' in Japanese, integrates elements of music, dance, and drama, and is known for its artistic depth and refinement. Kan'ami was a renowned actor and playwright in his time. He started as a sarugaku performer, which was a form of popular drama during the Muromachi period, characterized by acrobatics, dance, and music. Over time, Kan'ami integrated more serious and classical elements into his performances, drawing inspiration from religious themes, aristocratic culture, and the influence of Chinese literature. He managed to introduce innovative features and elevated the art form to new aesthetic heights. Zeami Motokiyo, Kan'ami's son and pupil, also played a significant role in the evolution of Noh. He was not only a talented playwright and noh actor but also a theoretician who wrote numerous treatises on the art of noh, such as \\"Fūshi kaden\\" (The Transmission of the Flower of Acting Style) and \\"Kakyo\\" (The Mirror Held to the Flower). These treatises offered insights into the philosophy, aesthetics, and principles underlying noh, as well as practical advice and guidance for actors and playwrights. Under Zeami's influence, Noh absorbed aspects of Zen Buddhism and the refined court culture, which transformed it from an entertainment form to a profound artistic expression. Zeami's contributions greatly impacted various aspects of Noh, including performance style, symbolism, the use of masks, and the thematic depth of the plays. Throughout history, noh developed and underwent further refinements under the patronage of powerful figures, such as shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and Tokugawa Ieyasu. However, it was Kan'ami and Zeami who are widely recognized as the founders and pioneers of Noh, leaving a lasting legacy on this deeply rooted Japanese theatrical tradition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her family often made travel plans with Castro that they then had to cancel because of her father's obsession with his own four walls. Gregg said that she never saw signs of the 6-year-old at her father's house and that she never saw her with him. But about two months ago, he showed her a picture in his cell phone. Gregg asked who it was. Her father told her that the girl was his girlfriend's child by somebody else. \\"I figured at the most he had an illegitimate child out there, you know, and I would find out eventually,\\" Gregg said.

He took her for rides on his motorcycle. And he never abused her, she said, or her sisters, as far as she knows. But he beat their mother, Grimilda Figueroa, whom he accused of fooling around with neighbors. He was very jealous, Gregg said. \\"When Mom and Dad were fighting, it's like I just wanted to melt into the ground,\\" she said. \\"I've seen him basically stomp on her like she was a man,\\" Gregg remembered. Then after a bludgeoning, her mother had enough, and the family split up. The other children left with her mother, but Gregg stuck by Castro, believing the excuses he made for the violence. She finished growing up under his roof, she said. How this case differed from the 'House of Horrors' A daughter divorced.

Which country's indigenours animals would most likely survive and stay put?  Both Nicaragua and Costa Rica had large tract of pristine forests. They had one of the largest concentration of tropical species. In the 1980s Nicaragua started clearing up some of these forests. Instead, they have now vast tract of sugarcane production in that land. One can still visit Costa Rica where they kept those pristine forests intact.  Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be inferred that the indigenous animals of Costa Rica would most likely survive and stay put. The main factors contributing to this conclusion are the differences in land use and conservation efforts between Nicaragua and Costa Rica. In the 1980s, Nicaragua cleared a significant portion of its pristine forests and replaced them with vast tracts of sugarcane fields. In contrast, Costa Rica maintained its pristine forests intact, preserving the natural habitat for its indigenous animals. The paragraph also highlights the importance of biodiversity in helping ecosystems adapt to disasters and providing a varied food supply for animals. When land is used for monoculture agriculture (e.g., sugarcane in Nicaragua), its biodiversity declines, making the ecosystem less adaptable and leading to a decrease in available food sources for animals. As a result, animal populations may die out or, more likely, relocate to more favorable habitats. In the case of the Tibetan Plateau, the consequences of degraded land and loss of biodiversity have been significant. This includes the endangerment of 15-20% of its species, poor soil quality, and severe erosion, in addition to economic losses. Considering these factors, it is evident that Costa Rica's preservation of its pristine forests makes it more likely that the country's indigenous animals would survive and stay put. The intact forests provide a stable and diverse habitat for the animals, with all the necessary resources and adaptability to withstand potential disasters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An elderly transient discovers, within the sphere, a massive slime mold-like substance (the Blob) that attaches itself to his hand. Three high school students, Brian, Meg and Paul, take him to a hospital. After Brian leaves, Paul witnesses the lower half of the transient melting from exposure to the Blob. As he calls for help, the Blob drops on top of him. Meg arrives to see Paul being devoured by the growing Blob. While she tries to free him, his arm dissolves off, Meg is thrown against a wall and knocked unconscious, and the Blob oozes out of the hospital as Paul attempts to scream in pain while dissolving inside the Blob one last time. After Brian and Meg have unsatisfactory encounters with the police, they meet at a diner where Meg tells Brian about the Blob. Brian is incredibly skeptical of Meg's story. Brian's disbelief is shattered when the diner's handyman, George, is pulled head first through the sink drain by the Blob. It pursues them to the diner's walk-in freezer, but the Blob suddenly retreats after entering the freezer. After consuming the diner's owner, Fran Hewitt, who was trapped in a phone booth, the Blob reenters the sewers.

Solve 3636*l = 49006 + 41571 + 36683 for l.","output":"To find the value of 'l', you need to first simplify the equation on the right-hand side, then isolate 'l' by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'l', which is 3636 in this case. Let's follow these steps: 1. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation:     The equation is: 3636*l = 49006 + 41571 + 36683     Add these numbers together: 49006 + 41571 + 36683 = 127260     So the equation now becomes: 3636*l = 127260 2. Next, you isolate 'l' in the equation:     You do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3636.     The equation is: l = 127260 / 3636     Use a calculator to divide 127260 by 3636, the answer is approximately 34.995881. So, l is approximately 34.995881.  Remember this is rounded to nine decimal places, your needs might require a different level of rounding. Also note, if you were asked to solve the equation for an integer value of 'l', you would need to round this result to the nearest whole number, in this case, l would then be approximately 35."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: El Cid: The Legend Movie plot: The Arab tyrant Ben Yusuf invades the muslim taifa of Zaragoza, as the beginning of his campaign to conquer the entire Iberian peninsula. As a result, prince Al-Mu'tamin flees to Castile to warn king Ferdinand of Yusufs invasion. In Castile, Rodrigo de Vivar is living a life of privilege as the son of a nobleman. He is best friends with prince Sancho and is secretly in a romantic relationship with Jimena, the daughter of count Gormaz. Unfortunately, Gormaz disapproves, and suggests that Jimena should marry the arrogant and self-centered count OrdoÃ±ez. As the royal court receives word that the Almoravids of Zaragoza had crossed the Castilian border, Rodrigo gets the opportunity to accompany Sancho, OrdoÃ±es and Gormaz on a scouting mission. Once they set up camp, Gormaz is ambushed by Al-Mu'tamin and his warriors, but Rodrigo intervenes. Once Al-Mu'tamin gets the chance to speak, he is allowed by Sancho to accompany them back to the palace. Some time later, king Ferdinand dies, and the devious and power-hungry princess Urraca plots to have Sancho killed so that the weak-minded prince Alfonso can be crowned. Gormaz meets with Rodrigo on a balcony, on Jimenas request, where Rodrigo asks for her hand in marriage. Gormaz refuses, and instead challenges Rodrigo to a swordfight. Rodrigo is hesitant to fight, but when Gormaz insists, he draws his sword. As the two fight, Urraca sends out her lover and servant to assassinate Sancho by stabbing him in the back with a dagger. At the same time, Rodrigo accidentally kills Gormaz. When Jimena witnesses, she vows to never speak to Rodrigo ever again, and he is forced to flee the scene.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. At all airports the use of a traffic pattern (often called a traffic circuit outside the U.S.) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ILS equipment, things are very differently though. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is it like for aircraft landing at small airfields as fast as possible while following the glidepath?","output":"At small airfields without Instrument Landing System (ILS) equipment, aircraft typically rely on visual flight rules (VFR) to land safely and quickly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what it's like for aircraft landing at small airfields as fast as possible while following the glidepath: 1. Approach: As the aircraft approaches the small airfield, the pilot will visually identify the runway and its surroundings. They will also monitor the aircraft's altitude, airspeed, and positioning relative to the airfield. 2. Descent: Once the aircraft is aligned with the runway and is within the appropriate distance from the airfield, the pilot will initiate a descent along the glidepath. The glidepath is a predetermined angle, usually around 3 degrees, that guides the aircraft towards the runway. 3. Checklist completion: During the descent, the pilot will complete necessary checklists to ensure the aircraft is configured correctly for landing. This may include setting the flaps, adjusting the aircraft's trim, and verifying the landing gear is down and locked. 4. Airspeed management: The pilot will manage the aircraft's speed during the approach to ensure a safe and effective landing. They may need to adjust the power setting and make other minor corrections to maintain the desired airspeed throughout the descent. 5. Visual cues: The pilot will continuously monitor visual cues such as the runway's aiming point markers, threshold markings, and the PAPI or VASI visual glidepath indicators (if available) to ensure the aircraft remains on the correct glidepath during the final descent. 6. Roundout and touchdown: As the aircraft reaches the runway, the pilot will round out the descent by gradually raising the aircraft's nose to reduce the descent rate and control the touchdown point. Once the appropriate speed and attitude are achieved, the aircraft will touch down on the runway. In summary, landing at small airfields as fast as possible while following the glidepath involves a combination of visual navigation, precise aircraft control, and adherence to the predetermined glidepath. The lack of ILS equipment demands heightened situational awareness and focus from the pilot when performing this maneuver."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sentence 1: well well what seems to be the answer is to concentrate on uh you know the children Sentence 2: The answer is to not concentrate on the children. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. An entailment is when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence. In your case, the two sentences present contrasting statements about the focus on children. Let's break down each sentence to better understand the context and meaning: Sentence 1: \\"Well, well, what seems to be the answer is to concentrate on, uh, you know, the children.\\" This sentence suggests that the correct or preferred course of action is to focus on the children. The hesitations (uh, you know) in the sentence indicate that the speaker may be unsure or looking for the right word, but ultimately, the sentence clearly presents a directive to concentrate on the children. Sentence 2: \\"The answer is to not concentrate on the children.\\" This sentence contradicts the first sentence by proposing that the correct action is to not focus on the children. This is a clear, direct statement with no hesitations, intending to communicate an opposing viewpoint to the first sentence. Since the first sentence suggests concentrating on the children, and the second sentence suggests not concentrating on them, the two sentences do not entail one another. Rather, they express different opinions on the subject matter. In fact, the second sentence seems to negate, or contradict, the claim made in the first sentence, making the relationship between the two sentences adversative rather than entailment-based."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Cyprus: Intercommunal violence erupted on December 21, 1963, when two Turkish Cypriots were killed at an incident involving the Greek Cypriot police. The violence resulted in the death of 364 Turkish and 174 Greek Cypriots, destruction of 109 Turkish Cypriot or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000-30,000 Turkish Cypriots. The crisis resulted in the end of the Turkish Cypriot involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy; the nature of this event is still controversial. In some areas, Greek Cypriots prevented Turkish Cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings, while some Turkish Cypriots willingly withdrew due to the calls of the Turkish Cypriot administration. Turkish Cypriots started living in enclaves; the republic's structure was changed unilaterally by Makarios and Nicosia was divided by the Green Line, with the deployment of UNFICYP troops.

He observed that the larger the body size, the surface area to volume ration Increased or Decreased?    Text:  Size restriction: The final body size is limited because as the body size increases, the surface area to volume ratio decreases. Answer:","output":"Based on the given text, as the body size increases, the surface area to volume ratio decreases. Therefore, when John was watching the car being built and observed that the larger the body size, the surface area to volume ratio actually decreased. To further explain the concept, let's consider the mathematical relationship between surface area and volume. Surface area refers to the total area covered by the outer surface of an object, whereas volume refers to the amount of space occupied by an object. For a simplified car model, let us assume it has a rectangular cuboidal shape. The formulae for the surface area (SA) and volume (V) of a rectangular cuboid are as follows: SA = 2(height*width) + 2(height*length) + 2(width*length) V = height * width * length Now consider the surface area to volume (SA/V) ratio, which is a dimensionless quantity. A higher SA/V ratio means that the surface area is larger relative to the volume, while a lower SA/V ratio means that the volume is comparatively larger than the surface area. As the body size increases, the height, width, and length of the car will all increase, causing a significant increase in volume. Although the surface area may also increase with the increasing dimensions, the increase in volume is comparatively more rapid than the increase in surface area. This results in the SA/V ratio decreasing as the body size increases. Thus, for the car being built observed by John, the surface area to volume ratio decreased as the body size increased, which is consistent with the statement in the text. This also highlights the size restriction mentioned in the text, suggesting that an optimal balance between surface area and volume is important for designing vehicles, as several practical factors depend on it, such as heat exchange, structural support, material availability, and energy efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: When did Operation Desert Storm occur? Passage 1:Page was born on 14 January 1900 in Lambeth, London. He went to school at Dulwich College, where he was captain of shooting, before attending Jesus College, Oxford, where he was captain of the boat club. He was a master at St Paul's School from 1926 to 1963, where he was a rowing coach. He maintained links with Oxford, successfully coaching Oriel College from their position in 21st place in 1928 to become Head of the River between 1933 and 1936. He also coached Oxford and Cambridge Boat Clubs at various times. He was captain of Thames Rowing Club in 1934 and in 1947–48. In 1952, he became honorary secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association (secretary from 1963 onwards), retiring in 1972. He was elected as Master of the Broderers' Company in 1960, a steward of the Henley Royal Regatta in 1962, and Master of the Fletchers' Company in 1971.  Passage 2:Born in Mataró, Barcelona, Catalonia, Vilà joined local RCD Espanyol's youth system at the age of 10, making his senior debuts in 2008–09 and helping the reserves promote from the fourth division, as champions. He was promoted to the first team by manager Mauricio Pochettino, making his La Liga debut on 30 January 2010 in a 1–0 home win against Athletic Bilbao (which, in his own words, came as a \\"surprise\\") and ending his first professional season with 11 league games, starting and playing all the minutes in every match as the Pericos finished in mid-table; previously, he appeared with the main squad in the 2008 final of the Copa Catalunya, lost 1–2 to UE Sant Andreu, and signed a five-year contract with the club shortly after.  Passage 3:In the 1970s and early 1980s the battalion furnished Combat Engineer Support to the Battalion Landing Teams (BLT) in the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, 29 Palms, Norway, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. From August 1982 to February 1984 Marines from 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion were part of the multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut, Lebanon. Late in October 1983, Combat Engineers landed and occupied the island of Grenada with the 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit. The battalion continued to provide Combat Engineer Platoons to the BLT's of the 22nd and 26th Marine Expeditionary Units and support elements of the division throughout the world. During April 1990, elements of the Battalion supported division units attached to Marine Forces Panama and participated in Operation Just Cause. In August 1990, Company D, while deployed aboard the off the coast of West Africa participated in Operation Sharp Edge assisting in the evacuation of civilians from Liberia. During Operation Desert Storm the Battalion deployed in support of the 4th MEB and the 2nd Marine Division leading the division through the myriad of obstacle belts into Kuwait.

The baby loved stars and circles. He loved the  OPTIONS: i. stars the best because it was pointless. ii. circles the best because it was pointless.","output":"The baby loved stars and circles. He loved the circles the best because it was pointless. One day, the baby gazed outside the window, his bright blue eyes following the crescent moon high up in the sky. His tiny hands reached out for it, giggling and cooing in joy as he tried to grab the luminous, night-time orb. This fascination with celestial bodies led his parents to adorn the nursery with countless images and shapes of stars and circles. Step 1: Set the scene. The nursery was a cozy, warm space filled with soft pastel colors and calming melodies from the mobile gently serenading the baby to sleep. The walls were decorated with a hand-painted mural of the sky, complete with fluffy clouds, twinkling stars, and perfect, round circles. Step 2: Introduce characters. His parents, Sarah and James, were overjoyed with their little boy's unique interests and did everything they could to nurture his wonderment. They would often lie down beside him on the floor, looking up at the mural, pointing at the various shapes while teaching him the difference between the stars and circles. Step 3: Create action and conflict. As the days passed, they noticed that their baby was more drawn to the circles as compared to the stars. Whenever he saw circles, be it the moon, the wheels on his toy car, or even his mother's button earrings, he would gurgle with enthusiasm, reaching out to touch them with his tiny fingers. The stars, while still fascinating, didn't give him the same thrill. Step 4: Introduce a dilemma. Sarah and James began to worry about their son's fixation with circles and pondered over the reasons. Was there an underlying meaning to the baby's preference? Was he trying to express something through this inclination? Confronted with these questions, they decided to consult a child psychologist to better understand their child's behavior. Step 5: Explore the resolution. During the consultation with the child psychologist, they discovered that it was completely normal for babies to be fascinated with shapes, and in this case, circles. In fact, the psychologist explained that the baby found the circle's attribute of being pointless to be what made them special. With no sharp edges or corners, circles symbolized simplicity, comfort, and unity. Step 6: Reflect on the outcome. Sarah and James felt relieved that their son's affection for circles wasn't a cause for concern, but rather, a testimony to his unique perspective. They continued to support his interests, filling his world with an array of shapes, fostering his love for them. And thus, the baby continued to cherish the circles in his life, marveling at the seemingly ordinary, yet profound attributes of a shape that was truly pointless, yet endlessly special."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That' s why I haven' t written for such a long time. Since the beginning of this year we' ve been doing a project called ' World Class'. Have you heard of it.'? Not everyone in the class could take part, but luckily I could. The school chooses a 'twin school'   in a different area of the world. Our head teacher chose a school in Uganda. They gave us someone to write to from that school. For three months, I've written to a girl called Louisa, who is the same age as me. It' s been more interesting to hear about her life. She' s told me all about her school and described her daily   life. I can' t believe that her School doesn' t. have any electricity. She goes to 'school from eight o' clock in the morning until six. O'clock. in the evening. I can' t believe how lucky we are here! She' s also told me that she often can' t go to school because she has to look after her baby brother and sister. She's tried to teach me some of her language and it' s really difficult. I love it because it' s the first time I' ve thought about what life must be like somewhere else. I can' t believe people miss classes here when everything is so easy for us. I think more people should help out with projects like this. At the weekend we' re going to have a sports day to help raise money to send to the school. Perhaps one day I'll be able to go to Uganda and meet Louisa myself--who knows?
