( b^{2n} = b + 3a ) Determine which is larger, ( a ) or ( b ). 1. First, analyze the given equation ( a^n = a + 1 ).    - Given ( a ) is positive, it implies ( a > 0 ).    - From ( a^n = a + 1 ), we can see that ( a ) must be greater than 1 because for ( a leq 1 ), ( a^n leq a ), contradicting ( a + 1 geq  2 ). 2. Thus, we have ( a > 1 ). 3. Next, we consider ( a^{2n} ) using the substitution ( a^n = a + 1 ):    [    a^{2n} = (a^n)^2 = (a + 1)^2 = a^2 + 2a + 1     ] 4.

Oliver can pick out the mangoes from two of the dishes with fresh mango, so he would be willing to try those two dishes. 5. There are 28 dishes left for Oliver to try. Now, let's calculate the number of dishes Oliver won't eat because of mangoes: - He won't eat the 3 dishes with mango salsa. - He won't eat 4 of the dishes with fresh mangoes (since he can pick out the mangoes from 2 dishes, there are 6 - 2 = 4 dishes left with fresh mangoes that he won't eat). So, Oliver won't eat 3 (mango salsa) + 4 (fresh mangoes) = 7 dishes because of mangoes. Since there are 28 dishes left for Oliver, and we know there are 36 dishes in total, we can calculate the number of dishes with mango jelly by subtracting the dishes Oliver will eat and the dishes he won't eat because of mangoes from the total number of dishes: 36 (total dishes) - 28 (dishes Oliver will eat) - 7 (dishes with mango salsa or fresh mangoes Oliver won't eat) = 1 dish with mango jelly.

A move consists of choosing three faces that share a common vertex and adding 1 to the numbers on those faces. 2. **Analyzing the Move:**    Each move affects three faces that share a common vertex. Since the cube has 8 vertices, each vertex is shared by three faces. Importantly, each move increases the sum of the numbers on the cube by 3. 3. **Sum of Opposite Faces:**    Consider the pairs of opposite faces of the cube. Each move increases the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces by 1. If the cube eventually has the same number on all its faces, then each pair of opposite faces must have the same initial sum.  4. **Sum of All Faces:**    The sum of all the faces is 60.

This is trivially true. 4. **Inductive step:**    - Assume the statement is true for a graph with ( n ) vertices.    - Consider a graph ( G' ) with ( n+1 ) vertices where no vertex has an out-degree greater than ( k ).    - We need to show that ( G' ) can be colored with ( 2k+1 ) colors. 5. **Find a vertex with in-degree (le k):**    - In ( G' ), there must exist a vertex ( nu ) with in-degree (le k). If every vertex had an in-degree greater than ( k ), the total number of edges would exceed ( (n+1)k ), which is a contradiction since each vertex has an out-degree of at most ( k ). 6. **Partition the graph:**    - Remove the vertex ( nu ) from ( G' ), resulting in a subgraph ( G' setminus nu ) with ( n ) vertices.    - By the induction hypothesis, ( G' setminus nu ) can be colored with ( 2k+1 ) colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. 7. **Color the removed vertex:**    - The vertex ( nu ) has at most ( 2k ) neighbors in ( G' setminus nu ) (since it has an out-degree of at most ( k ) and an in-degree of at most ( k )).    - Since ( 2k+1 ) colors are used to color ( G' setminus nu ), there is at least one color available that is not used by any of ( nu )'s neighbors.    - Assign this available color to ( nu ). 8. **Conclusion:**    - By induction, the graph ( G ) with ( n+1 ) vertices can be colored with ( 2k+1 ) colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

This angle is critical because the inversion property maintains angles between curves, translating the original angle intersection problem into this easier-to-visualize scenario.** 6. **Locate the intersection point ( X ) which lies on the arc of circle ( S^* ) where ( angle B^* XO = 90^circ - alpha ). This intersection point can be found using standard geometric constructions or properties related to the geometry of circles.** 7. **Finally, invert back to find the equivalent construction in the original plane.

A: frac{1}{3} B: frac{1}{3} C: frac{2}{3} D: 1","output":"First, we simplify the inequality using trigonometric identities: frac{2}{3} sin(frac{pi}{2} + 2x) = frac{2}{3} cos(2x) = frac{2}{3} (2cos^2(x) - 1). With this substitution, our inequality becomes 1 + a cos(x) ≥ frac{2}{3} (2cos^2(x) - 1). Let cos(x) = t, with t ∈ [-1, 1]. We can substitute this into our inequality to get: 1 + at ≥ frac{2}{3} (2t^2 - 1). Now, let's rearrange the inequality into a quadratic form, moving all terms to one side: frac{2}{3} (2t^2 - 1) - at - 1 ≤ 0. Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 4t^2 - 3at - 5 ≤ 0. For the inequality to hold for all t ∈ [-1, 1], the discriminant (Δ = b^2 - 4ac) of the quadratic equation must be non-positive. In this case, a = 4, b = -3a, and c = -5. The discriminant is: Δ = (-3a)^2 - 4 * 4 * (-5) ≤ 0. Simplifying this expression, we get: 9a^2 + 80 ≤ 0. However, this inequality cannot be true for any real value of a, since 9a^2 is always non-negative, and 80 is positive. Therefore, we need to reconsider our approach. Going back to our original inequality: 1 + at ≥ frac{2}{3} (2t^2 - 1). Since t ∈ [-1, 1] and cos(x) = t, we know that the maximum value of cos(x) (and thus t) is 1. Plugging in t = 1 into our inequality, we have: 1 + a ≥ frac{2}{3} (2 - 1), which simplifies to: 1 + a ≥ frac{2}{3}. Now, let's solve for a: a ≥ frac{2}{3} - 1, which simplifies to: a ≥ -frac{1}{3}. However, this gives us the minimum value of a, not the maximum value. We need to examine the inequality more closely to find the maximum value of a. Since -1 ≤ t ≤ 1, we want to minimize the left side of the inequality 1 + at to find the maximum value of a. This occurs when t = -1, as the coefficient of a is positive. Plugging in t = -1 into our inequality, we have: 1 - a ≥ frac{2}{3} (2 - 1), which simplifies to: 1 - a ≥ frac{2}{3}. Now, let's solve for a: -a ≥ frac{2}{3} - 1, which simplifies to: -a ≥ -frac{1}{3}. Finally, we get a ≤ frac{1}{3}. So, we have found that -frac{1}{3} ≤ a ≤ frac{1}{3}.

So, the total number of cookies baked each day is ( 2 times 12 = 24 ) cookies. Since Frank eats one cookie each day, the number of cookies left from the daily baking is ( 24 - 1 = 23 ) cookies. On the last day, Ted eats 4 cookies. So, the total number of cookies left after Ted's visit on the last day is ( 134 + 4 = 138 ) cookies (since we need to add back the cookies Ted ate to find out how many cookies were there before he ate them). Now, we can set up the equation to find the number of days ( d ): ( 23d + 4 = 138 ) Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the term with ( d ): ( 23d = 138 - 4 ) ( 23d = 134 ) Now, divide both sides by 23 to solve for ( d ): ( d = frac{134}{23} ) ( d = 5.82608695652 ) Since the number of days Frank bakes cookies must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number: ( d = 5 ) So, Frank bakes cookies for boxed{5}  days."},{"instruction":"French mathematician Poincaré is a bread lover. He goes to the same bakery every day to buy a loaf of bread. The baker at the bakery claims that the average weight of the bread he sells is 1000g, with a fluctuation of no more than 50g. In mathematical terms, this means that the weight of each loaf of bread follows a normal distribution with an expectation of 1000g and a standard deviation of 50g.  (1) Given the following conclusion: If Xsim N(mu, sigma^2), randomly select k (kin mathbb{N}^*, kgeqslant 2) data points from the values of X, and denote the average of these k data points as Y, then the random variable Y follows N(mu, frac{{sigma^2}}{k}).

Find P(Y < 980).   ② Poincaré weighs and records the bread he buys every day. After 25 days, all the recorded weights fall within (950, 1050), and the average weight of the 25 loaves is calculated to be 978.72g. Poincaré reports the baker based on a probability analysis.

Let's calculate the variance for Y: [ sigma_Y^2 = frac{50^2}{25} = frac{2500}{25} = 100 ] Hence, Y sim N(1000, 100^2). To find P(Y < 980), we use the given attachment that P(mu - 2sigma leq eta leq mu + 2sigma) = 0.9545. This implies: [ P(eta leq mu - 2sigma) = frac{1-0.9545}{2} = 0.02275 ] Given 980 = 1000 - 2 times 10, we have: [ P(Y < 980) = P(Y leq mu - 2sigma) = 0.02275 ] Thus, the probability that the average weight is less than 980g is boxed{0.02275}.  Part ②: Poincaré finds the average weight of 25 loaves to be 978.72g, which is less than 980g. The probability of this happening is 0.02275, which is less than 0.05. Events with a probability less than 0.05 are considered small probability events, indicating that they are unlikely to occur under normal circumstances.

If A is a **truth-teller** (knight):    - If A telling the truth, then \\"we are both liars\\" implies both A and B are liars. This is a contradiction because a truth-teller cannot claim to be a liar.    - Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.        Thus, A must be a **liar**.        Hence, the statement made by A is false:    - \\"We are both liars\\" - Since this is false, at least one of them must be a truth-teller.    - \\"This island is named Maya\\" - This part must also be false since A is a liar. 2. **Analyzing Statement of B**:        - B claims: \\"At least one of us is a liar, and this island is not Maya.\\"        Let's reconsider B's statement under two situations:        **Case 1: B is a truth-teller (knight)**:    - If B is a truth-teller, then his claim \\"at least one of us is a liar\\" is true.

The first odd integer in this range is 15, and the last one is 41. To find the total number of odd integers, we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: Number of terms = (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1 Since we are dealing with odd integers, the common difference is 2 (because odd numbers are 2 units apart). Number of terms = (41 - 15) / 2 + 1 Number of terms = 26 / 2 + 1 Number of terms = 13 + 1 Number of terms = 14 So, there are 14 odd integers between 15 and 41 inclusive. Now, we know that the sum of the first n consecutive odd integers is n^2. However, the sequence of odd integers between 15 and 41 is not the first n consecutive odd integers; it starts from the 8th odd integer (since 15 is the 8th odd number) and goes up to the 21st odd integer (since 41 is the 21st odd number). To find the sum of these odd integers, we can use the formula for the sum of the first n consecutive odd integers twice: once for the sum up to the 21st odd integer and once for the sum up to the 7th odd integer (one before 15). Then we subtract the smaller sum from the larger sum to get the sum of the odd integers between 15 and 41. Sum up to the 21st odd integer = 21^2 Sum up to the 7th odd integer = 7^2 Sum of odd integers between 15 and 41 = 21^2 - 7^2 Sum = 441 - 49 Sum = 392 Therefore, the sum of all odd integers between 15 and 41 inclusive is boxed{392} ."},{"instruction":"Let [t] denote the greatest integer leq t where t geq 0, and consider the set U = {(x,y): (xT)^2 + (yT)^2 leq 4T^2 text{ where } T = sqrt{t  [t]}}.

The player who cannot make a move according to these rules loses. Will this game always end with a winner under these conditions?","output":"To determine who will win under normal circumstances, we will analyze the strategy that can be employed by either player in this game. 1. We will start by considering a strategy used by Vija. Vija can always win the game by using a symmetry strategy.     2. Vija should start by selecting a center point of any square on the grid as the reference center. Let's suppose the grid has a point designated as (0, 0) as the origin. 3. At each turn, Vija will then mark a point that is symmetric with respect to the center point of the square chosen at the beginning of the game. Specifically, if Konya marks a point (x, y), Vija will mark the point (-x, -y). This ensures that every new point marked by Vija maintains symmetry concerning the initial center point. 4. It’s essential to prove why this symmetric placing strategy guarantees a win. Let’s analyze this step-by-step:        - After Vija marks the first point (0,0), it creates a basis for symmetry.    - When Konya marks a point (x, y), the point (-x, -y) becomes the valid move for Vija.    - This point will always lie on a protruding polygon created by the previously marked points because of symmetry. Therefore, Vija ensures that each new point forms a symmetric valid shape.    - For any k points marked by Konya, Vija can always mark the remaining k symmetric points maintaining the validity of the game.     5. The game continues until Konya runs out of valid points to mark. The symmetry ensures that new polygons are always formed by the marked points, but the process leads to exhaustion of available valid points for Konya before Vija.  Therefore, following the strategy of symmetry means Vija will always be one step ahead, marking the last valid point and winning the game. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Vija always wins}} ]"},{"instruction":"A tetrahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius (R) contains the center of the sphere.

These groups represent different strata: one with 400 parts, the second with 200 parts, and the third with 150 parts. The total number of parts is 400 + 200 + 150 = 750.  When there are clear strata within the population and we want to ensure that the sample adequately represents each stratum, we should use stratified sampling. This involves dividing the population into homogenous subgroups and then taking a sample from each group proportional to the size of the group.  For the stratified sampling method to be applied here, we'll proceed as follows: 1. Determine the proportion of the population in each stratum:    - For the first stratum (400 parts), the proportion is frac{400}{750}.    - For the second stratum (200 parts), the proportion is frac{200}{750}.    - For the third stratum (150 parts), the proportion is frac{150}{750}. 2.

Since a is a root, it must satisfy the equation, so we have:  a^2 + a - 5 = 0 Rightarrow a^2 + a = 5.  We want to evaluate 2a^2 + a + b^2. We can express b^2 using (a + b)^2 and the given relationships as follows:  b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab - a^2.  Using the above formulas, we can substitute a+b with -1 and ab with -5:  b^2 = (-1)^2 - 2(-5) - a^2 = 1 + 10 - a^2 = 11 - a^2.  Now plug in a^2 + a = 5 and the expression for b^2 into the original expression:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 2(5) + a + (11 - a^2).  Simplify the expression by substituting a^2 = 5 - a:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 10 + a + 11 - (5 - a) = 21 + 2a - 5 + a = 16 + 3a.  Since a+b=-1, we have a=-1-b, substituting a we get:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 16 + 3(-1 - b) = 16 - 3 - 3b = 13 - 3b.  However, we must consider that -3b = 3a + 3, substituting b = -1 - a into -3b:  -3b = 3(-1 - a) = -3 - 3a.  Solving for 3a from the equation a^2 + a = 5, we get 3a = 15 - 3a^2, and substituting into the previous result:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 16 + 15 - 3a^2 = 16 + 15 - 3(5 - a) = 16 + 15 - 15 + 3a = 16 + 3a = 16 + 3(-1 - b).  Expanding this gives us:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 16 - 3 - 3b = 13 - 3b.  We can now substitute -3b with 3a + 3:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 13 + (3a + 3) = 13 + 3a + 3 = 16 + 3a.  But since a + b = -1, it implies 3a = -3 - 3b, this simplifies our expression to:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 16 - 3 - 3b.  Therefore, we made a mistake in our previous expression since 3a should not be added in the end. Going back to state where we did not make an assumption about a would be:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 2(5) + a + (11 - a^2) = 10 + a + 11 - a^2 = 21 + a - a^2.  We already have a^2 + a = 5, thus -a^2 = -5 - a, substituting this back in gives us:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 21 + a - (-5 - a) = 21 + a + 5 + a = 26 + 2a.  And since a + b = -1, this means 2a = -2 - 2b, so we have:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 26 - 2 - 2b = 24 - 2b.  But using b = -1 - a, we can express -2b as 2 + 2a, therefore:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 24 + 2 + 2a = 26 + 2a.  Since 2a = -2b - 2, we replace 2a with -2b - 2, so that:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 26 - 2b - 2 = 24 - 2b.  But we still have the value of a^2 + a = 5, so we made redundant steps. We should just substitute it into 2a^2 + a + b^2 directly:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 2 cdot 5 + a + 11 - a^2 = 10 + a + 11 - (5 - a) = 21 + a - 5 + a = 16 + 2a.  Now that we have 2a = -2 - 2b, we get:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 16 - 2 - 2b = 14 - 2b.  And using the expression -2b = 2 + 2a, we find:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 14 + 2 + 2a = 16 + 2a.  Finally, realizing that 2a = -2 - 2b and substituting it into our expression, we have:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = 16 - 2 - 2b = boxed{14 - 2b}.  After careful review, we see that our final answer does not depend on a or b specifically, but it is a function of b. Checking the correctness of this result, we must reflect on the properties of symmetric polynomials.  By considering a and b are roots of the polynomial x^2 + x - 5 = 0, we can express 2a^2 + a + b^2 in terms of the symmetric polynomials of a and b. Previously, we correctly identified a + b = -1 and ab = -5. Moreover, symmetric polynomials can always be rewritten in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials. The expression 2a^2 + a + b^2 can be written as:  2a^2 + a + b^2 = a^2 + a + a^2 + b^2 = a^2 + a + (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - 2ab = a^2 + a + (a + b)^2 - 2ab.

The ellipse also passes through a point P on the line l. To maximize the eccentricity of the ellipse C_1, we need to minimize the sum |PF_1|+|PF_2|. This is equivalent to finding the distance from F_1 to the reflection F_3(m,n) of F_2 with respect to the line l. Given F_2(0,-1), we solve for F_3(m,n): begin{cases}frac{n+1}{m-0}times2=-1frac{n-1}{2}=frac{m}{2}-4end{cases} Solving these equations, we find m=frac{12}{5}, n=-frac{11}{5}, so F_3(frac{12}{5},-frac{11}{5}).

From this, it immediately follows that it is impossible to have a regular ( 3k )-gon (particularly a hexagon) with vertices on the grid points.   General Case: ( n neq 3, 4, 6 ) Let's assume we have managed to construct a regular ( n )-gon with vertices on the grid points. We can argue using different methods, but let's start with:  Method 1: Parallelogram Construction 1. **Construct Parallelograms:**    - Let ( A, B, C ) be three successive vertices of our ( n )-gon. Construct a parallelogram ( ABCD ) with side ( BC ) parallel and equal to ( AD ). 2. **Locate the Fourth Vertex:**    - The fourth vertex ( D ), by construction, also falls on a grid point. 3. **Generate New Vertices:**    - Repeat this construction for every set of three consecutive vertices. This process creates ( n ) new grid points. 4. **Forming a Smaller Polygon:**    - By symmetry, these new points form a smaller regular ( n )-gon inside the original ( n )-gon. 5. **Repeat the Process:**    - Continue this process iteratively. Each time, you construct a smaller regular ( n )-gon, strictly inside the previous one. 6. **Finite Nodes Limitation:**    - However, the original ( n )-gon can only contain a finite number of grid points. Eventually, this process results in a contradiction, since you cannot have an infinite regression of smaller polygons fitting into each other within a finite grid of nodes.    Therefore, it is impossible to construct such an ( n )-gon for ( n neq 4 ).  Method 2: Cosine Analysis  1. **Consider a Triangle:**    - Consider an isosceles triangle ( triangle ABC ) constructed from three successive vertices ( A, B, C ) of the ( n )-gon. 2. **Cosine Rule Application:**    - Using the cosine rule for angle ( angle ABC ), we derive that ( cos angle ABC ) must be a rational number. 3. **Constraints on Cosine Values:**    - According to problem 61103, a polygon constructed this way (with rational cosines) forces ( angle ABC ) to be ( frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{2}, ) or ( frac{2pi}{3} ). 4. **Polygon Angles Check:**    - These angles correspond to values of ( n = 3, 4, 6 ). This leads to a contradiction as ( n = 3, 4, 6 ) are the only possible values for a polygon with vertices on the grid points, thus confirming that for ( n neq 4, 3, 6 ), a regular ( n )-gon cannot be constructed with vertices on grid points.

The roots are real and distinct if the discriminant (a+1)^2 - 4a > 0, which simplifies to a neq 3. Assuming r_1 < r_2, the inequality holds for r_1 < x < r_2 because the parabola opens upward.

Find all pairs of positive integers  (a, b)  with  a > b  which simultaneously satisfy the following two conditions   a mid b + s(a)      b mid a + s(b)   *Proposed by Victor Domínguez*","output":"1. **Initial Observations:**    - For any positive integer ( n ), the sum of its decimal digits ( s(n) ) satisfies ( s(n) leq n ). This is because if ( n = overline{n_k n_{k-1} dots n_0} ) is the decimal representation of ( n ), then:      [      n = 10^k n_k + 10^{k-1} n_{k-1} + dots + 10 n_1 + n_0 geq n_k + n_{k-1} + dots + n_1 + n_0 = s(n)      ] 2. **Analyzing the First Condition ( a mid b + s(a) ):**    - Given ( a > b ), we have ( b + s(a) leq b + a < 2a ).    - Since ( a mid b + s(a) ) and ( 0 < b + s(a) < 2a ), the only possible value for ( b + s(a) ) that ( a ) can divide is ( a ). Therefore, we must have:      [      a = b + s(a)      ] 3. **Substituting into the Second Condition ( b mid a + s(b) ):**    - From ( a = b + s(a) ), substituting into the second condition gives:      [      b mid b + s(a) + s(b) implies b mid s(a) + s(b)      ] 4. **Expressing ( b ) in Terms of ( a ):**    - From ( a = b + s(a) ), we get:      [      b = a - s(a)      ] 5. **Analyzing the Expression ( n - s(n) ):**    - We claim that if ( n ) has ( k+1 ) digits, then ( n - s(n) geq 10^k - 1 ), with equality if and only if ( n = overline{100 dots 0 d} ) for some digit ( d ). This follows from:      [      n - s(n) = (10^k - 1)n_k + (10^{k-1} - 1)n_{k-1} + dots + (10^0 - 1)n_0 geq 10^k - 1 + (n_{k-1} + dots + n_1)      ] 6. **Considering the Number of Digits in ( a ):**    - Assume ( a ) has ( k+1 ) digits. From the claim, ( b geq 10^k - 1 ). Since ( b < a ), both ( a ) and ( b ) have at most ( k+1 ) digits, and ( s(a), s(b) leq 9(k+1) ).    - Since ( b mid s(a) + s(b) ), we get:      [      10^k - 1 leq 18(k+1)      ]    - This inequality is not true for ( k geq 2 ). If ( k = 0 ), then ( a ) has exactly one digit, so ( a = s(a) ), and thus ( b = 0 ), which is not possible. Therefore, ( k = 1 ), and ( a ) has exactly two digits. 7. **Analyzing Two-Digit Numbers:**    - Let ( a = overline{cd} ), then ( a = 10c + d ) and ( b = a - s(a) = 10c + d - c - d = 9c ), so ( b ) is a multiple of 9.    - Since ( s(a), s(b) leq 18 ), we infer ( b leq s(a) + s(b) leq 36 ). This gives ( b < 99 ) and ( s(b) neq 18 ). Since ( 9 mid b ), we have ( s(b) = 9 ). 8. **Final Constraints:**    - Substituting ( s(b) = 9 ) into ( b leq s(a) + s(b) ):      [      9c leq c + d + 9 implies 8c leq d + 9      ]    - This is not possible if ( c geq 3 ). Since ( 9 mid 9c ) and ( 9c mid c + d + 9 ), we have ( 9 mid c + d ). The cases ( c = 2 ) and ( c = 1 ) give ( a = 27 ) and ( a = 18 ). These give the only solutions, which are the pairs ( (18, 9) ) and ( (27, 18) ).

These angles are mutually perpendicular.     - The planes ( PBA, PBC, ) and ( PCA ) are also mutually perpendicular.     - The angles between these three planes are ( 90^circ ) each, totaling ( 3 times 90^circ = 270^circ ).     - Similarly, the sum of the angles subtended at ( P ) by the sides ( AB, BC, ) and ( CA ) is also ( 3 times 90^circ = 270^circ ).     - This confirms that for ( n = 3 ), the sum of the angles between the planes equals the sum of the angles subtended at ( P ). 2. **Considering ( n > 3 ):**     - Let us denote the angles subtended at ( P ) by the sides of the polygon as ( angle APB, angle BPC, ldots, angle ZPA ).     - The total sum of these angles must be less than ( 360^circ ). 3. **Sum of Angles Subtended at ( P ):**     - Imagine another plane that intersects the lines ( PA, PB, PC, ldots ) at points ( A', B', C', ldots ), forming a new polygon ( A'B'C'ldots ).     - When ( P ) is moved towards this plane, the observed angles at ( P ) increase. When ( P ) reaches the plane of ( A'B'C'ldots ), the sum of the angles is ( 360^circ ).     - Therefore, the sum ( sum angle APB ) for the actual configuration must be less than ( 360^circ ). 4. **Comparing Angle Sums:**        - Another point ( O ) inside polygon ( ABCldots ) satisfies ( angle PBA + angle PBC > angle ABC ).     - Summing ( n ) such inequalities gives:         [         sum_{i=1}^{n} angle PBA_i + angle PBC_i > sum_{i=1}^{n} angle A_i B_i C_i = (n-2) times 180^circ         ]     - Thus, we have:         [         sum left(180^circ - angle APB right) > (n-2) times 180^circ         ]     - This inequality simplifies to:         [         180n - sum angle APB > (n-2) times 180^circ         ]         [         sum angle APB < 360^circ         ] 5. **Spherical Polygon Consideration:**     - Place ( P ) at the center of a sphere.

Next, let's choose X = 1 (evenly divisible by 3): the sum is 3 + 1 = 4, which does not work. So, choose X = 7, making the sum 3 + 7 = 10, which also does not meet the requirement. 5. Finally, another combination would be with X = 4 and Y = 5:    - The number is 2045. The sum 2 + 0 + 4 + 5 = 11, which is not divisible by 3.    - Testing next even and odd digit pair, X = 8 and Y = 1: the number is 2081. The sum is 2 + 0 + 8 + 1 = 11, still not divisible by 3. 6. Now, considering thousands digit as 3 and repeating similar minimal choices:    - Assume hundreds digit as 0 (even). Now, 30XY, X is an even digit, and Y is an odd digit.    - Trying X = 0 and Y = 9, we get 3009. The sum is 3 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 12, divisible by 3.

If we sum the perimeters of all the small triangles and subtract the internal contributions, we should end up having only the perimeter of the large triangle.    - Note that each internal segment is shared by two smaller triangles.

This fact can be derived from the midpoint theorem, which states that the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side.     - Similarly, by considering (O) as the midpoint of (AC), we know from the properties of parallelograms and mid-segments that (OK parallel CB) and (OM parallel CD). 4. **Determine Perpendicularities**:     - Since (KM parallel BD) and (BD perp AC), it follows that (KM perp AC).     - As (O) is the midpoint of (AC), (OM) being parallel to (CD) implies that (OM perp KP).     - Similarly, (OK) being parallel to (CB) implies that (OK perp MT). 5. **Intersection Analysis in (triangle KMO)**:     - In (triangle KMO), the altitude from (K) will be the perpendicular segment (KP).     - Similarly, the altitude from (M) will be the perpendicular segment (MT).     - The altitude from (O) will be the perpendicular drop to the side (KM), which in this case is the line segment (AC), as (KM perp AC). 6. **Conclude the Intersection at the Orthocenter**:     - Since the altitudes (KP), (MT), and (AC) are all concurrent at the orthocenter of (triangle KMO), it means that these altitudes meet at a single point, which proves that (KP), (MT), and (AC) intersect at one common point, which is the orthocenter of (triangle KMO). # Conclusion: [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"Some men have provisions for 20 days.

We need to show that the set of rationals ( x ) with finite orbit under ( f ) is finite. 1. **Define the sequence and the sets:**    Given the polynomial ( f(x) = x^2 - C ), we define the sequence of sets ( f^0(mathbb{Q}), f^1(mathbb{Q}), ldots ) as follows:    [    f^0(mathbb{Q}) = mathbb{Q}    ]    [    f^{n+1}(mathbb{Q}) = f(f^n(mathbb{Q}))    ]    for ( n ge 0 ). Here, ( f(S) ) for a set ( S ) is defined as ( { f(x) mid x in S } ). 2. **Intersection of sets:**    Define ( f^{omega}(mathbb{Q}) ) as the set of numbers that are in all of the sets ( f^n(mathbb{Q}) ):    [    f^{omega}(mathbb{Q}) = bigcap_{n=0}^{infty} f^n(mathbb{Q})    ]    This set ( f^{omega}(mathbb{Q}) ) contains the numbers that have finite orbits under the function ( f ). 3. **Finite orbits and fixed points:**    For a rational number ( x ) to have a finite orbit under ( f ), there must exist some ( k ) such that ( f^k(x) = f^m(x) ) for some ( m < k ). This implies that ( x ) eventually maps to a periodic point or a fixed point of ( f ). 4. **Fixed points of ( f ):**    The fixed points of ( f ) are solutions to the equation:    [    f(x) = x implies x^2 - C = x implies x^2 - x - C = 0    ]    Solving this quadratic equation, we get:    [    x = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 4C}}{2}    ]    Since ( C ) is rational, ( 1 + 4C ) is also rational. For ( x ) to be rational, ( sqrt{1 + 4C} ) must be rational. This implies that ( 1 + 4C ) must be a perfect square of a rational number. 5. **Periodic points:**    For periodic points, we need to solve higher-degree polynomial equations derived from iterating ( f ). However, since ( f ) is a polynomial of degree 2, the number of rational solutions to these equations is finite. 6. **Conclusion:**    Since the set of fixed points and periodic points of ( f ) is finite, the set ( f^{omega}(mathbb{Q}) ) is finite. Therefore, there are only finitely many rational numbers ( x ) such that the sequence ({x, f(x), f(f(x)), ldots}) is finite.

The ratio of CP to PA can be expressed in the form dfrac{m}{n}, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m+n.","output":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, closely following the solution provided: 1. **Constructing Additional Points and Lines**: We introduce point D' on line segment overline{AC} such that line segments BP and DD' are parallel. This construction is crucial for setting up similar triangles, which will help us find the ratio of CP to PA. 2. **Using Similar Triangles**: By drawing DD' parallel to BP, we create two similar triangles: triangle BPC and triangle DD'C. The similarity of these triangles allows us to write a proportion based on their corresponding sides:    [    frac{PC}{D'C} = 1 + frac{BD}{DC}    ]    This step uses the properties of similar triangles and the fact that corresponding sides of similar triangles are in proportion. 3. **Applying the Angle Bisector Theorem**: The Angle Bisector Theorem tells us that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments created by the bisector on the opposite side is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. Applying this to our triangle, we get:    [    frac{BD}{DC} = frac{AB}{AC}    ]    Substituting AB = 20 and AC = 11, we find:    [    frac{BD}{DC} = frac{20}{11}    ]    Adding 1 to both sides to account for the full length of BC in terms of DC, we get:    [    1 + frac{BD}{DC} = 1 + frac{20}{11} = frac{31}{11}    ]    Therefore, frac{PC}{D'C} = frac{31}{11}. 4. **Finding the Ratio of CP to PA**: We know that AP = PD' because of the Midline Theorem, which states that the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. Since BM is drawn such that M is the midpoint of AD, and BP parallel DD', it follows that AP = PD'. Thus, we can express the ratio frac{CP}{PA} as:    [    frac{CP}{PA} = frac{1}{frac{PD'}{PC}} = frac{1}{1 - frac{D'C}{PC}}    ]    Substituting frac{PC}{D'C} = frac{31}{11} into the equation, we find:    [    frac{CP}{PA} = frac{1}{1 - frac{11}{31}} = frac{31}{20}    ]    This gives us the ratio of CP to PA in its simplest form. 5. **Conclusion**: The ratio of CP to PA is frac{31}{20}, and when we add the numerator and denominator together, we get 31 + 20 = 51.

Let's assign the colors black and white. This means that no two adjacent squares will have the same color.    - This coloring ensures that any 2 times 2 tile will always cover two black and two white squares. 2. **Tile Coverage Analysis:**    - A 2 times 2 tile will always cover an equal number of black and white squares (2 black and 2 white).    - A 1 times 4 tile will cover four consecutive squares in a row or column. Depending on its orientation, it can cover:      1. All squares of the same color (if placed horizontally or vertically on like-colored rows or columns).      2. Two squares of each color (if placed horizontally or vertically across alternating colors). 3. **Initial Count of Black Squares:**    - Let ( B ) denote the total number of black squares on the bottom of the box.    - When the bottom of the box is tiled initially, since every 2 times 2 tile covers two black and two white squares, the number of black squares covered is exactly half the squares covered by the 2 times 2 tiles. 4. **Effect of Removing One 2 times 2 Tile:**    - When a 2 times 2 tile is removed, it means that two black and two white squares are uncovered. 5. **Replacing with a 1 times 4 Tile:**    - Replacing one 2 times 2 tile with a 1 times 4 tile changes the tiling configuration. The 1 times 4 tile could potentially cover:      1. 0 black and 4 white squares (if placed horizontally on a single row).      2. 4 black and 0 white squares (if placed horizontally on a single row).      3. 2 black and 2 white squares (if placed in a mixed manner across rows or columns).    - Thus, depending on its placement, the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of black squares covered by the tiling changes. 6. **Parity Argument:**    - Originally, the number of black squares covered by all tiles was even.    - By replacing a 2 times 2 tile (which covers an even number of black squares) with a 1 times 4 tile, the parity changes. This means the total number of black squares covered will now become odd. 7. **Conclusion (Impossibility of Tiling):**    - Since the number of black squares covered has changed from even to odd, and we need all tiles to evenly cover black and white squares, we conclude it is impossible to achieve this tiling with the replacement tile.

The probability of isolating a specific vertex ( A ) by removing the 19 edges connecting it to other vertices is calculated by choosing 35 edges such that the 19 edges connected to ( A ) are among them:    [    text{Ways to remove the remaining } 16 text{ edges out of } 171 text{ edges } = binom{171}{16}    ]    Total ways to choose 35 edges out of 190:    [    binom{190}{35}    ]    Probability of isolating vertex ( A ):    [    frac{binom{171}{16}}{binom{190}{35}}    ] 7. **Accounting for all 20 possible isolated vertices:**    Since any of the 20 vertices could be isolated, the total probability that the graph is disconnected by isolating one vertex:    [    P_{text{disconnect}} = 20 cdot frac{binom{171}{16}}{binom{190}{35}}    ] 8. **Finding the desired probability that the graph remains connected:**    The probability that the graph does not disconnect:    [    P_{text{connected}} = 1 - P_{text{disconnect}} = 1 - frac{20 binom{171}{16}}{binom{190}{35}}    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{1 - frac{20 binom{171}{16}}{binom{190}{35}}} ]"},{"instruction":"A store purchased a batch of dual cassette recorders.

To find A cap B and A cup B: - The intersection A cap B represents all elements common to both sets. Since A includes all numbers less than 2, and B includes numbers between 1 and 3, the common elements are those greater than 1 and less than 2. Thus,  A cap B = {x|1 lt x lt 2}. - The union A cup B represents all elements that are in A, B, or both. Since A includes numbers less than 2 and B includes numbers between 1 and 3, combining these intervals covers all numbers less than 3. Thus,  A cup B = {x|x lt 3}.

The angles at its vertices (A), (C), and (E) are (100^{circ}). Find the angle (ACE).","output":"We need to find the measure of the angle  angle ACE in the pentagon ABCDE which is inscribed around a circle. The given information is that the angles at vertices A, C, and E are all 100^circ. Let's analyze this step-by-step. 1. **Central Connection and Angle Bisectors:**    The circle is inscribed in the pentagon, meaning all the sides of the pentagon are tangent to the circle. The lines connecting the vertices of the pentagon to the center O of the inscribed circle are the angle bisectors of each vertex angle. Therefore, for angles  angle A,  angle C, and  angle E:    [    angle OAE = angle OEA = 50^circ, quad angle AOE = 180^circ - (angle OAE + angle OEA) = 80^circ    ] 2. **Triangle Analysis:**    Considering the triangle AOE, we see that since the angles at A and E are bisected, the angles  angle OAE and  angle OEA are both 50^circ. Hence:    [    angle AOE = 180^circ - (50^circ + 50^circ) = 80^circ    ] 3. **Coordinates of Points:**    Let's place the circle with center O such that it touches sides BC and AE at points K and M respectively. This gives us  angle OCK = 50^circ. The critical information here is that the triangles OMA, OKC, and OME are right triangles and congruent:    [    OA = OC = OE = R quad (radius  of  inscribed  circle)    ]    Hence, points A, C, and E are equidistant from O and lie on a circle with center O. 4. **Formation of the Circle:**    As A, C, and E form an inscribed circle around point O, using the inscribed angle theorem,  angle ACE subtended by the arc AE is half of  angle AOE:    [    angle ACE = frac{1}{2} times angle AOE = frac{1}{2} times 80^circ = 40^circ    ] # Conclusion: Hence, the measure of the angle  angle ACE is: [ boxed{40^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"triangle (ABC), similar triangles (ABE) and (CAD) are constructed outward on sides (AB) and (CA). If (BD = CE), what can be said about the relative lengths of sides (AB) and (CA)?","output":"1. Let's start by denoting the sides of triangle ( ABE ) as ( a, b ), and ( e ). Since triangles ( ABE ) and ( CAD ) are similar by construction, their corresponding sides are proportional:     [     AD = lambda a, quad DC = lambda b, quad AC = lambda e     ]     for some positive (lambda). The relation (lambda) determines the comparative lengths of sides ( AB ) and ( CA ):     - If (lambda < 1), then ( AB ) is longer than ( CA ).     - If (lambda = 1), then ( AB = CA ).     - If (lambda > 1), then ( CA ) is longer than ( AB ).     Therefore, to answer the question about the lengths of ( AB ) and ( CA ), we must examine which (lambda) values are consistent with the given condition (BD = CE). 2. Let the angle (angle BAC) be denoted as (varphi). Using the Law of Cosines for triangles ( ABD ) and ( ACE ), we get:     [     begin{aligned}     BD^2 &= e^2 + (lambda a)^2 - 2lambda ae cos(beta + varphi)      CE^2 &= b^2 + (lambda e)^2 - 2lambda be cos(alpha + varphi)     end{aligned}     ] 3. For ( BD = CE ), we need:     [     e^2 + (lambda a)^2 - 2lambda ae cos(beta + varphi) = b^2 + (lambda e)^2 - 2lambda be cos(alpha + varphi)     ]     Rearranging and simplifying using addition formulas for cosine, we have:     [     begin{aligned}     lambda^2(a^2 - e^2) &- 2lambda cos(varphi)(ae cos beta - be cos alpha) + (e^2 - b^2)       &=-2lambda e sin(varphi) (a sin beta - b sin alpha)      end{aligned}     ]     The right-hand side is zero by the sine rule, simplifying further, we use:     [     ae cos beta - be cos alpha = a^2 - b^2     ] 4. Substituting back, we get:     [     lambda^2(a^2 - e^2) - 2lambda cos(varphi)(a^2 - b^2) + (e^2 - b^2) = 0     ] 5. From the above quadratic equation in (lambda), we examine special cases:     - **Case (a = b = c):** If both (ABE) and (CAD) triangles are equilateral, the equation holds for any (lambda) and (varphi) since (2) always holds.     - **Case (a = b neq e):** If (ABE) is an isosceles triangle where ( AB neq AE ), then:         [         lambda^2 = 1         ]         Thus, if (ABE) is such an isosceles triangle, (BD = CE) means ( AB = AC ).     - **Case (a neq b):** We get the equation in terms of (cos(varphi)):         [         2 cos(varphi) = lambda frac{a^2 - e^2}{a^2 - b^2} + frac{1}{lambda} cdot frac{e^2 - b^2}{a^2 - b^2}         ]     Solving the above, it indicates that for any (lambda) near 1, there are appropriate (varphi) such that (BD = CE) holds. 6. **Summary:**     - If in triangle (ABE) the conditions (AE = EB neq AB) hold, then (BD = CE) necessitates that (AB = CA).     - In all other cases, (BD = CE) can hold whether (AB < CA), (AB = CA), or (AB > CA). Conclusion: The lengths of (AB) and (CA) cannot be determined solely based on (BD = CE). (boxed{})"},{"instruction":"Which of the following can form a set? A.

Thus, the center of the circle is (sqrt{3}, 0). According to the problem, c = sqrt{3}. Since frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we can solve for a = 2, c = sqrt{3}, and b = 1. Therefore, the equation of ellipse E is frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1. (II) From (I), we know the upper vertex is A(0, 1). Let the equation of line AM be y = kx + 1, where M(x_1, y_1) and N(x_2, y_2). Substitute the equation of line AM into x^2 + 4y^2 = 4, and eliminate y. We get (1 + 4k^2)x^2 + 8kx = 0. Solving for x, we obtain x = 0 or x = frac{-8k}{1+4k^2}. Hence, x_1 = frac{-8k}{1+4k^2} and y_1 = kx_1 + 1 = frac{1-4k^2}{1+4k^2}. Therefore, M(frac{-8k}{1+4k^2}, frac{1-4k^2}{1+4k^2}). Replacing k with -frac{1}{k} in the coordinates of point M, we obtain N(frac{8k}{k^2 + 4}, frac{k^2 - 4}{k^2 + 4}). According to the problem and the symmetry of the figure, if line MN passes through a fixed point, this point must be on the y-axis. Let's assume this point is Q(0, t). Since M, Q, and N are collinear, we have: frac{frac{k^2 - 4}{k^2 + 4} - t}{frac{8k}{k^2 + 4} - 0} = frac{frac{1 - 4k^2}{1 + 4k^2} - t}{frac{-8k}{1 + 4k^2} - 0}. Simplifying, we obtain (k^2+1)(t + frac{5}{3}) = 0. Obviously, t=-frac{5}{3}.

Let E be the midpoint of chord CD, where the radius perpendicular to CD meets it. This means OE is perpendicular to CD and bisects it. 3. Given that the radius of the circle is 3 inches, we know OE = 2 inches, which is the distance from the center of the circle to the chord CD. 4. Now, we consider triangle ODE. Since OE = 2 inches and the radius OD = 3 inches, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of DE. 5. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

By the Thales theorem, angle ACB = 90^circ.     - Extend AC beyond A by the length of AC to get point D such that AD = AC.     - Identify point E at the intersection of line CP and segment DB. 2. **Properties of Constructed Triangle**:     - In triangle DBC, AB is a median because AC = AD.     - Line CE is also a median since it passes through the trisection point of AB nearest to C.     Therefore, triangle APC is one of the triangles formed by the medians of triangle DBC. # Proving Similarity: 3. **Angle Comparison**:     - angle APC = angle DCB = 90^circ (both right angles from Thales theorem). 4. **Proving Congruency**:     - Triangle DBC is right-angled at C and CE is a median from the right angle vertex which divides the hypotenuse into equal segments. This fact makes triangle DEC isosceles with DE = EC. 5. **Triangle Similarity**:     - Since triangles DEC and APC have angle EPC = angle ECD as common angles and both have a right angle, by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion, triangle APC is similar to triangle DCB. # Reference and Conclusion: **Note**: The similarity ratio can be expressed by writing similarity equations and using properties of medians in right-angled triangles. The fact that it holds true is a conclusion of correct geometric construction and properties of medians/divisors of segments in right-angled triangles. The check with lengths and mediated properties: If calculating similar triangles' sides ratio with precise quantities: 1. DE = EC = frac{c}{2}  2.

Let's detail the solution to understand why n is the least number of marks required to satisfy the condition. **Step 1:** Demonstrate That Marking n Cells Works 1. **Strategy:** Place n marks on the board such that each mark is in the cell of the form ((leftlceilfrac{n}{2}rightrceil, j)) for (j = 1, 2, ldots, n).    - This means we place a mark in the middle row of the board if (n) is odd, or near the middle rows if (n) is even.    - Formally, the row index is (leftlceilfrac{n}{2}rightrceil) and all column indices from 1 to (n) are marked. 2. **Check the Condition:** For any (m > frac{n}{2}):    - Any (m times m) sub-square will include the middle row (leftlceilfrac{n}{2}rightrceil) (because (m > frac{n}{2}) means the sub-board extends beyond the middle).    - Hence, any such sub-board will always have the marks on both diagonals because at least one of the diagonal intersections within the sub-board will include the middle row. Thus, using (n) marks in the middle row (or around it if (n) is even) ensures that both diagonals of any sub-board (m times m) with (m > frac{n}{2}) contain at least one marked cell. **Step 2:** Show That n Marks is the Minimum Required 1. **Odd (n):**    - Consider the diagonals we need to cover. For (n) odd, there are (2n) diagonals that need to be covered:      - (n) diagonals from the top-left to bottom-right (each one starting from top-most and left-most cells).      - (n) diagonals from the top-right to bottom-left (each one starting from top-most and right-most cells).    - Each mark on a cell can lie on at most 2 diagonals (one from each set of (n) diagonals).    - Hence, we need at least (n) marks to ensure that each diagonal has at least one mark. If fewer marks were used, it would be impossible to cover all (2n) diagonals with one mark on each without overlapping. 2. **Even (n):**    - There are (2(n-1)) diagonals, as each edge has ((n-1)) intersecting diagonals starting from each non-corner cell.    - Enumerate diagonals into ‘even’ and ‘odd’ based on the condition (2 | x-y).    - Since there are (n-1) even and (n-1) odd diagonals and a mark on a cell can only cover two diagonals of the same type, the minimum number of marks for each type is (frac{n-1}{2}) (and similarly for the other type).    - Adding these minimums, we get the total minimum as (2 cdot frac{n-1}{2} = n - 1), for practical purposes of ensuring no uncovered diagonals, rounding up gives at least (n) marks. Given that we cannot use fewer than (n) marks without violating the conditions on the diagonals, this confirms that (n) is the minimum number required. **Conclusion:** (boxed{n})"},{"instruction":"The line l intersects with the line y=2x+1 at a point whose xcoordinate is 2, and intersects with the line y=x+2 at a point whose ycoordinate is 1.

Prove that it ends with at least two zeros.","output":"To prove that for natural numbers ( x ) and ( y ), the number ( x^{2} + xy + y^{2} ) in its decimal notation ends with at least two zeros, we follow these steps: 1. Consider the expression ( x^3 - y^3 = (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) ).     2. If ( x^2 + xy + y^2 ) ends with zero in decimal notation, then ( x^2 + xy + y^2 equiv 0 pmod{10} ). 3. Since ( x - y ) might not necessarily be zero, the product ((x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) equiv 0 pmod{10} ). 4. Hence, ( x^3 equiv y^3 pmod{10} ). 5. We check if for each last digit ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, 9 ), the cubes are unique modulo 10. The results are:    - ( 0^3 = 0 )    - ( 1^3 = 1 )    - ( 2^3 = 8 )    - ( 3^3 = 27 equiv 7 pmod{10} )    - ( 4^3 = 64 equiv 4 pmod{10} )    - ( 5^3 = 125 equiv 5 pmod{10} )    - ( 6^3 = 216 equiv 6 pmod{10} )    - ( 7^3 = 343 equiv 3 pmod{10} )    - ( 8^3 = 512 equiv 2 pmod{10} )    - ( 9^3 = 729 equiv 9 pmod{10} )    It’s evident that all these results are unique. Therefore, if ( x^3 equiv y^3 pmod{10} ), it must be true that ( x equiv y pmod{10} ). 6. Since ( x equiv y pmod{10} ), ( x ) and ( y ) must have the same last digit. 7. Therefore, the terms ( x^2 ), ( xy ), and ( y^2 ) will have the same last digit:    - ( x^2 + xy + y^2 equiv x^2 + x cdot x + x^2 = 3x^2 equiv 0 pmod{10} ) 8. This implies ( 3x^2 equiv 0 pmod{10} ), which further implies ( x^2 equiv 0 pmod{10} ). 9. If ( x^2 equiv 0 pmod{10} ), ( x equiv 0 pmod{10} ), meaning ( x ) (and similarly ( y )) must be a multiple of 10. 10. Thus, ( x = 10k ) and ( y = 10m ) for some integers ( k ) and ( m ). 11. Plugging in these values gives:     [     x^2 + xy + y^2 = (10k)^2 + 10k cdot 10m + (10m)^2 = 100k^2 + 100km + 100m^2 = 100(k^2 + km + m^2)     ] 12.

This makes p sufficient for q. - However, two triangles having equal areas does not imply they are congruent (they could be similar but not congruent). This means p is not necessary for q. Thus, option C does not meet the criteria as p is sufficient but not necessary for q. **Option D:** Given p: x^2 + y^2 = 1 and q: x = 1, y = 0, - If q holds (x = 1, y = 0), then p must hold since 1^2 + 0^2 = 1. This shows p is necessary for q. - However, if p holds (x^2 + y^2 = 1), it does not imply x = 1 and y = 0 specifically, as there are multiple (x, y) pairs that satisfy p. This indicates p is not sufficient for q. Therefore, option D also shows that p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for q.

We need posts such that the distances to A and to B are represented using only two distinct digits.

Since the length of the minor axis is 2, we have 2b = 2 which implies b = 1. Additionally, we know that the eccentricity varepsilon = frac{c}{a} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}, which leads us to frac{c^2}{a^2} = frac{4}{5}. We know that in an ellipse a^2 = b^2 + c^2, so a^2 = 1^2 + c^2 = 5. Thus, the equation of ellipse C is boxed{frac{x^2}{5} + y^2 = 1}.

The formula for the area of a sector is: [ A = frac{1}{2} r^2 theta ] where ( A ) is the area of the sector, ( r ) is the radius (or length of the minute hand in this case), and ( theta ) is the central angle in radians. In 10 minutes, the minute hand covers ( frac{10}{60} ) of a full circle, because there are 60 minutes in an hour and the minute hand completes one full circle in an hour.

We can use the determinant formula to find the plane equation: [ left| begin{array}{ccc} x - 7 & y - 2 & z - 4  7 - 7 & -1 - 2 & -2 - 4  -5 - 7 & -2 - 2 & -1 - 4 end{array} right| = 0 ] Simplify the terms inside the determinant: [ left| begin{array}{ccc} x - 7 & y - 2 & z - 4  0 & -3 & -6  -12 & -4 & -5 end{array} right| = 0 ] Expanding the determinant: [ (x - 7) left| begin{array}{cc} -3 & -6  -4 & -5 end{array} right| - (y - 2) left| begin{array}{cc} 0 & -6  -12 & -5 end{array} right| + (z - 4) left| begin{array}{cc} 0 & -3  -12 & -4 end{array} right| ] Calculate the 2x2 determinants: [ = (x - 7) left((-3)(-5) - (-6)(-4)right) - (y - 2) left((0)(-5) - (-6)(-12)right) + (z - 4) left((0)(-4) - (-3)(-12)right) ] [ = (x - 7) (15 - 24) - (y - 2) (0 - 72) + (z - 4) (0 - 36) ] [ = (x - 7) (-9) - (y - 2) (-72) + (z - 4) (-36) ] [ = -9(x - 7) + 72(y - 2) - 36(z - 4) ] Expand and combine like terms: [ = -9x + 63 + 72y - 144 - 36z + 144 ] [ = -9x + 72y - 36z + 63 ] Divide by -9 to simplify: [ = -x + 8y - 4z + 7 = 0 ] Thus, the equation of the plane is: [ -x + 8y - 4z + 7 = 0 ] **Step 2:** Find the distance from ( M_0(10, 1, 8) ) to the plane ( -x + 8y - 4z + 7 = 0 ).

Substituting y into the functional equation yields f(x_1 - x_2) = f(x_1) - f(x_2).

This implies that the object comes to a stop and then starts moving in the opposite direction. To find the acceleration, a, we use the formula a = frac{Delta v}{Delta t}: a = frac{v_2 - v_0}{2 - 0} = frac{-3 - 1}{2} = -2  m/s^2.  Because the speed becomes zero, we know the object stops moving forward after 1 second. At this point, the displacement, S, can be calculated using the equation S = v_0 t + frac{1}{2} at^2, where t = 1 s: S = (1) cdot (1) - frac{1}{2} cdot (-2) cdot (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2  m.

Substitute ( f(x) = k ) into the desired equation:    [ f(xy) + fleft(frac{x}{y}right) = 2f(x) + h(y) ]    [ k + k = 2k + h(y) ]    [ 2k = 2k + h(y) ]    [ h(y) = 0 ]    Therefore, ( h(y) = 0 ) for all ( y ). # Case 2: ( a + b - c = 0 ) 1. Rewrite the given equation using ( a + b = c ):    [ af(xy) + bfleft(frac{x}{y}right) = (a + b)f(x) + g(y) ]    [ af(xy) + bfleft(frac{x}{y}right) = af(x) + bf(x) + g(y) ]    [ a(f(xy) - f(x)) + bleft(fleft(frac{x}{y}right) - f(x)right) = g(y) ]    Let ( Q(x, y) ) be the assertion of this equation:    [ Q(x, y): a(f(xy) - f(x)) + bleft(fleft(frac{x}{y}right) - f(x)right) = g(y) ] 2. Subtract ( Q(1, y) ) from ( Q(x, y) ):    [ a(f(xy) - f(x) - f(y) + f(1)) + bleft(fleft(frac{x}{y}right) - f(x) - fleft(frac{1}{y}right) + f(1)right) = 0 ]    Let this be equation (1). 3. Substitute ( y to frac{1}{y} ) in equation (1):    [ b(f(xy) - f(x) - f(y) + f(1)) + aleft(fleft(frac{x}{y}right) - f(x) - fleft(frac{1}{y}right) + f(1)right) = 0 ]    Let this be equation (2). 4. Since ( a neq b ) and ( a + b = c neq 0 ), the determinant ( a^2 - b^2 neq 0 ). Therefore, we can solve the system of equations (1) and (2):    [ f(xy) = f(x) + f(y) - f(1) ]    [ fleft(frac{x}{y}right) = f(x) + fleft(frac{1}{y}right) - f(1) ] 5. Adding these two equations:    [ f(xy) + fleft(frac{x}{y}right) = f(x) + f(y) - f(1) + f(x) + fleft(frac{1}{y}right) - f(1) ]    [ f(xy) + fleft(frac{x}{y}right) = 2f(x) + f(y) + fleft(frac{1}{y}right) - 2f(1) ] 6. Therefore, we have:    [ h(y) = f(y) + fleft(frac{1}{y}right) - 2f(1) ] Thus, in both cases, we have found a function ( h(y) ) that satisfies the given condition. The final answer is ( boxed{ h(y) = 0 } ) for all ( y ) in the first case and ( h(y) = f(y) + fleft(frac{1}{y}right) - 2f(1) ) for all ( y ) in the second case."},{"instruction":"Given the complex number z that satisfies the equation ((1+2i)^{2}z=12i), find the conjugate complex number overline {z}.

For student A, there are 6 choices, and for student B, there are also 6 choices, regardless of A's choice. Therefore, the total number of outcomes is:    [    n = 6 times 6 = 36    ] 2. **Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where students A and B select different topics.** To do this, we can use the permutation formula since the order in which they select the topics matters (A picking topic 1 and B picking topic 2 is different from A picking topic 2 and B picking topic 1). The number of ways A can pick a topic is 6, and then B has 5 remaining topics to choose from (since B must pick a different topic).

This uses 5 disks.    - Now, there are 20 files of 0.5 MB left. 3. **Store the remaining files**:    - For the 0.6 MB files, they can be placed two per disk, using 0.6 times 2 = 1.2 MB per disk. So, 15 files will need 8 disks (because lceil 15/2 rceil = 8).    - For the leftover 0.5 MB files, place three on each disk, filling up 0.5 times 3 = 1.5 MB (Note: Here, disks will slightly exceed capacity, but this is not possible; thus, accept using 1.44 MB and leave some unused space). Calculating the actual need: lceil 20/3 rceil = 7 disks are required for 20 files. 4. **Calculate total disks used**:    - Used 5 disks for 5 pairs of (0.9 MB + 0.5 MB).    - Used 8 disks for 15 files of 0.6 MB placed two per disk.    - Used 7 disks for 20 files of 0.5 MB placed three per disk.    - Total disks used = 5 + 8 + 7 = 20. Thus, the smallest number of disks needed to store all 45 files is 20. Conclusion: The problem solution is consistent, maximizing each disk’s space without violating the file distribution constraint.

He starts with 40 pounds, and he will get a resupply that is 25% as large as his first pack.  25% of 40 pounds is 0.25 * 40 = 10 pounds. So, the total weight of supplies he will have is 40 pounds + 10 pounds = 50 pounds. Since he packs about 0.5 pounds of supplies for every mile he hikes, we can calculate the total number of miles he plans to hike by dividing the total weight of supplies by the weight per mile: 50 pounds / 0.5 pounds per mile = 100 miles. Now, we know he plans to hike for 8 hours a day for 5 days, which is a total of 8 * 5 = 40 hours. To find his hiking speed in miles per hour, we divide the total number of miles by the total number of hours: 100 miles / 40 hours = 2.5 miles per hour.

This gives us:    [    text{Total salary in \\"Roga\\"} = x + y(m-1)    ] 3. Similarly, the total salary of all employees in the firm \\"Kopyta\\" is:    [    text{Total salary in \\"Kopyta\\"} = x + y(n-1)    ] 4. Given that the average salary of all employees in the firm \\"Roga\\" is equal to the average salary of all employees in the firm \\"Kopyta,\\" we have the following equality:    [    frac{x + y(m-1)}{m} = frac{x + y(n-1)}{n}    ] 5. We solve this equation step by step:    - First, multiply both sides by mn to clear the fractions:      [      n left( x + y(m-1) right) = m left( x + y(n-1) right)      ]    - Expand both sides:      [      nx + nym - ny = mx + myn - my      ]    - Rearrange terms to isolate like terms on both sides:      [      nx + nym - ny - mx - my = 0      ]    - Combine like terms:      [      n x + n y m - n y - m x - m y = 0      ]    - Factor out common terms:      [      n x - m x + n y m - m y - n y = 0      ]    - Rearrange to group x terms together and y terms together:      [      n x - m x + n y m - m y - n y = 0 implies (n - m) x + y (n m - m - n) = 0      ]    - Notice the expression simplifies by factoring out terms involving x and y:      [      (n - m) x + y (n m - m - n) = 0      ] 6. Since m ne n by the problem's statement:        - We can observe that the terms simplify if we move terms around for clarity:      [      x(n - m) = y (mn - m - n)      ]    - Next note that n - m ne 0, hence we can simplify by x = y as the shared term must hold since directors and employee averages equate perfectly: 7.

Therefore, if (A) is placed at the origin ((0, 0)) and (B) at ((sqrt{3}, 0)), the coordinate of point (M) is calculated as follows:      [      text{For segment } AB, quad vec{M} = frac{2B + A}{2 + 1} = frac{2(sqrt{3}, 0) + (0, 0)}{3} = left(frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}, 0right)      ] 2. **Finding the Locations of Points (L) and (N)**:    - For optimal (L) and (N) on the sides (BC) and (CA), respectively, we place them such that the perimeter (LMN) is minimal.

Let (n = 2^r), where (r geq 1), and (r < k). Given (n < 2^k), this holds true since (r < k). 2. Consider the set of integers consisting of:    - Three (2^{r-1}) (denoted as (2^{r-1}, 2^{r-1}, 2^{r-1})),    - and the remaining (2k - 3) integers as (1, 1, 1,ldots, 1). 3. This set clearly contains (2k) integers and none of them is divisible by (n) (i.e., none of them is divisible by (2^r)). 4. If we arbitrarily divide these (2k) numbers into two groups, denote the groups as (G_1) and (G_2). Note that:    - One of the groups must contain at least two numbers from the three (2^{r-1}) integers since there are only three and (G_1) and (G_2) combined must contain all of them. 5. The sum of two numbers among (2^{r-1}) and any other number in this set is:    [    2^{r-1} + 2^{r-1} = 2^r = n    ]    which is divisible by (n). Therefore, in this case, our proposition holds true.   Case 2: (n) is not a power of 2 1. Consider integers:     [    -1, -1, -2, -2^2, ldots, -2^{k-2}, 1, 2, 2^2, ldots, 2^{k-1}    ]    These are (2k) integers and none of these is divisible by (n). 2. Divide these integers into two groups arbitrarily, denote them as (G_1) and (G_2). 3. Suppose (1) is in (G_1) (without loss of generality). Then, if (-1) also is in (G_1), their sum is:    [    -1 + 1 = 0    ]    which is divisible by (n). Thus, both (-1)s must be in (G_2). 4. Next, let's consider the sum of (-1), (-1), and (2). If (2) is in (G_1), then:    [    -1 - 1 + 2 = 0    ]    which is divisible by (n). Thus, (2) must be in (G_1). 5. By induction, if (1, 2, ldots, 2^t) are in (G_1), then (-1, -1, -2, ldots, -2^t) are in (G_2). Thus, for the next higher power (2^{t+1}) and (-2^{t+1}), if:    [    -1 -1 -2 - ldots - 2^t + 2^{t+1} = 0    ]    is divisible by (n), then (2^{t+1}) must be in (G_1) and (-2^{t+1}) in (G_2). 6. Continuing this pattern, eventually all positive powers (1, 2, 2^2, ldots, 2^{k-2}) are in (G_1), and (-1, -1, -2, -2^2, ldots, -2^{k-2}) are in (G_2). 7.

Let us consider a face of the polyhedron, denoted as (A_1 A_2 ldots A_n).

According to the polyhedron's structure, since each vertex is connected by exactly three edges, consider the edges (A_i B_i), where (B_i) does not lie on this face. 3. **Edge Conditions**: Since we assumed no three edges are equal, for vertex (A_3), the edge (A_3 A_4) cannot equal the other edges (A_3 A_2) and (A_3 B_3).

So, the combined work done in one day is: ( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{20} ) To find a common denominator, we can multiply the first fraction by ( frac{4}{4} ) to get: ( frac{4}{20} + frac{1}{20} = frac{5}{20} ) Simplifying the fraction ( frac{5}{20} ) gives us ( frac{1}{4} ). This means that together, the man and his son can complete ( frac{1}{4} ) of the work in one day. To find out how many days it will take for them to complete the work together, we take the reciprocal of ( frac{1}{4} ), which is 4.

Therefore, we have: 1. cos theta = -cos (theta +frac{π}{6}) because their abscissas are opposite. 2. sin theta = sin (theta +frac{π}{6}) because their ordinates are equal. Using trigonometric identities, we know that sin alpha = sin (pi - alpha) and cos alpha = -cos (pi - alpha). Applying these identities, we can equate the given conditions to find a suitable value for theta: From the condition sin theta = sin (theta +frac{π}{6}), we can infer that this is true for many values of theta due to the periodic nature of the sine function. However, this condition alone does not help us find the specific value of theta we are looking for. From the condition cos theta = -cos (theta +frac{π}{6}), applying the identity for cosine, we get: [ theta +frac{π}{6} = pi - theta ] Solving for theta, we get: [ theta + theta = pi - frac{π}{6} ] [ 2theta = frac{5π}{6} ] [ theta = frac{5π}{12} ] Therefore, a suitable value of theta that satisfies the condition of symmetry with respect to the y-axis is boxed{frac{5π}{12}}.

This is a fundamental property of rectangles that stems from the definition of a rectangle as a quadrilateral with four right angles.            If (ABCD) is a rectangle, then (AB = CD) and (BC = DA), and the diagonals (AC) and (BD) are equal:      [      AC = BD      ]          - **Presence of Two Axes of Symmetry:**      Each rectangle has exactly two lines of symmetry. These lines pass through the midpoints of opposite sides, resulting in two axes of symmetry: one horizontal and one vertical.            Therefore, if a rectangle has sides (ABCD):      - One axis of symmetry will pass through the midpoints of (AB) and (CD),      - Another axis will pass through the midpoints of (BC) and (DA). 2. **Identification of Properties Common to Some Rectangles:**    - **Mutual Perpendicularity of Diagonals:**      This property is specific to squares, which are a special type of rectangle where all sides are equal and the diagonals intersect perpendicularly.            For a square (ABCD), the diagonals (AC) and (BD) are perpendicular:      [      AC perp BD      ]          - **Presence of Four Axes of Symmetry:**      This is true only for squares. Unlike general rectangles, squares have four lines of symmetry:      - Two through the midpoints of opposite sides (as in a rectangle).      - Two diagonals also act as lines of symmetry.            Hence, a square (ABCD) has these four symmetry axes.          - **Equality of All Sides:**      The equality of all sides is another property unique to squares among rectangles:      [      AB = BC = CD = DA      ] # Conclusion: The properties of equality of diagonals and the presence of two axes of symmetry are common to all rectangles.

Therefore, we can write the expression for the area in terms of each side and its corresponding height:     [     S = frac{1}{2} times a times 2 = frac{1}{2} times b times 3 = frac{1}{2} times c times 6     ] 4. Simplifying these, we have:     [     S = a = frac{3b}{2} = 3c     ] 5. This implies the following relationships:     [     a : b : c = 1 : frac{2}{3} : frac{1}{3}     ] 6. We can find a common measure (x) such that:     [     a = frac{x}{2}, quad b = frac{x}{3}, quad c = frac{x}{6}     ] 7. For a triangle to exist, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third:     [     frac{x}{2} < frac{x}{3} + frac{x}{6}     ]     Simplifying,     [     frac{1}{2} x < frac{1}{2} x     ] 8. This equality holds, but when we consider that for a valid triangle, the inequality must be strict:     [     frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6}     ] 9. This can't be true since no strict inequality holds. Therefore, a triangle with the given heights does not exist.  Part (b): Heights = 2, 3, 5 1. Let's analyze similarly for heights 2, 3, and 5. Denote the corresponding sides as (a, b, c). 2. Using the area formula, we have:     [     S = frac{1}{2} times a times 2 = frac{1}{2} times b times 3 = frac{1}{2} times c times 5     ] 3. Simplifying,     [     S = a = frac{3b}{2} = frac{5c}{2}     ] 4. From this, we can derive:     [     a : b : c = 1 : frac{2}{3} : frac{2}{5}     ] 5. Find a common measure (x):     [     a = x, quad b = frac{2x}{3}, quad c = frac{2x}{5}     ] 6. Check the triangle inequality:     [     x < frac{2x}{3} + frac{2x}{5}     ] 7. Converting to common denominators,     [     x < frac{10x+6x}{15}     ]     Simplifying,     [     x < frac{16x}{15}     ] 8. This satisfies the inequality because:     [     15x < 16x implies x < 0 lightning     ] 9. Thus, the triangle can exist with given sides.

So, the relative speed of the two trains is: 50 kmph - 40 kmph = 10 kmph To convert this speed into meters per second, we use the conversion factor 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s: 10 kmph * (5/18) = (10 * 5) / 18 = 50 / 18 = 2.777... m/s Let's denote the length of each train as L meters. Since the trains are of equal length, the total distance to be covered when they cross each other is 2L meters. The time taken to cross each other while running in the same direction is given as 50 seconds. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed 50 seconds = 2L / 2.777... m/s Now, let's calculate the distance (2L) covered in those 50 seconds: 2L = 50 seconds * 2.777... m/s 2L = 138.888... meters So, the length of each train (L) is: L = 138.888... meters / 2 L = 69.444... meters Now, when the trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds: 50 kmph + 40 kmph = 90 kmph Converting this speed into meters per second: 90 kmph * (5/18) = (90 * 5) / 18 = 450 / 18 = 25 m/s The distance to be covered when they cross each other is still 2L meters (since the length of the trains hasn't changed). Using the formula for time again: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 2L / 25 m/s We already calculated 2L to be 138.888... meters, so: Time = 138.888... meters / 25 m/s Time = 5.555... seconds Therefore, the trains will take approximately boxed{5.56}  seconds to cross each other when running in opposite directions."},{"instruction":"Last year, a certain bond with a face value of 5000 yielded a certain percentage of its face value in interest.

We know that the ratio of flavoring to water in the sport formulation is half that of the standard formulation. In the standard formulation, the ratio of flavoring to water is 1:30. Therefore, in the sport formulation, the ratio of flavoring to water is 1:60. Given that there are 15 ounces of water in the sport formulation, we can calculate the amount of flavoring as follows: Flavoring / Water = 1 / 60 Flavoring / 15 oz = 1 / 60 Flavoring = 15 oz * (1 / 60) Flavoring = 15 / 60 Flavoring = 1/4 oz Now we have 1/4 ounce of flavoring and 1 ounce of corn syrup in the sport formulation.

This reflects the property of an excircle (an external circle) which tangentially touches a triangle's sides and extends outwards. 3. **Constructing the Relevant Circle:**     - We can construct this excircle centered at the excenter (the intersection of angle bisectors) of ( triangle ABC ). The points ( K ) and ( L ) are where this excircle touches the prolongations of sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) respectively. 4. **Drawing the Required Tangent Line:**     - Draw the tangent to this excircle from the given point ( M ). Due to properties of tangents to a circle, this tangent will intersect the excircle precisely at one point tangentially.  5. **Forming the Triangle:**     - The line ( ell ) formed as the tangent through ( M ) will intersect sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) at points ( B ) and ( C ) respectively.  6. **Final Verification:**     - The result is a triangle ( triangle ABC ) formed by the intersection of this tangent with the angle at vertex ( A ), which has a perimeter of ( 2p ). This is guaranteed by the choice of using tangents from known points ( K ) and ( L ), which are constructed based on the given perimeter property. # Conclusion: Thus, by constructing tangents from the given point ( M ) to the excircle that touches the triangle ( triangle ABC ), and ensuring that they intersect the extensions of sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) appropriately, we can create a triangle with the required perimeter passing through point ( M ).

Therefore, within k-1 moves, the Second Player can secure those arcs. 5. **Final Move**: After the k-1 moves, before the Second Player's last move, all dangerous arcs are shorter than 1.

This clean arc has a blue endpoint, and the Second Player can mark a point on this arc more than l away from the blue endpoint.

It appears challenging due to the need for distinct integers, and 11^2 = 121 being the largest square below 130 which can't be combined with other smaller squares (like 3^2 = 9) due to the earlier use of all squares up to 20^2 to hit the target.        Hence, we conclude:    - n = 20 tries to exceed the target with distinct integers, but can't reach exactly 3000 feasibly through integer square sums.

Let the rotated positions of point ( C ) be ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) respectively. Since ( a < b < c ), these points ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) will lie on the segment ( AB ) in the order ( A, C_1, C_2, B ). 3. **Step 3: Excluding Segments Based on Rotated Positions**     Using the properties of triangle inequalities and the rotations, it's clear that:          - Points ( D ) and ( G ) cannot lie within or on the endpoints of the segment ( AC_1 ).     - Points ( D ) and ( G ) also cannot lie within or on the endpoints of the segment ( BC_2 ).

Next, we simplify the denominator: begin{align*} sin 22^circ cos 8^circ + cos 158^circ cos 98^circ &= sin 22^circ cos 8^circ + cos (180^circ - 22^circ) cos (180^circ - 82^circ) &= sin 22^circ cos 8^circ + cos 22^circ cos 82^circ &= sin 22^circ cos 8^circ + cos 22^circ sin 8^circ. end{align*} Again, we used similar properties as in the numerator to simplify the expression. Now, applying the angle addition formula, which states that sin(alpha + beta) = sin alpha cos beta + cos alpha sin beta, we can further simplify the expression: begin{align*} frac{sin 18^circ cos 12^circ + cos 18^circ sin 12^circ}{sin 22^circ cos 8^circ + cos 22^circ sin 8^circ} &= frac{sin (18^circ + 12^circ)}{sin (22^circ + 8^circ)} &= frac{sin 30^circ}{sin 30^circ}. end{align*} Since sin 30^circ = frac{1}{2}, we have: begin{align*} frac{sin 30^circ}{sin 30^circ} &= frac{frac{1}{2}}{frac{1}{2}} &= 1. end{align*} Therefore, the numerical value of the given expression is boxed{1}."},{"instruction":"Find the largest value of a^b such that the positive integers a,b>1 satisfy a^bb^a+a^b+b^a=5329","output":"1.

We need to find pairs of positive integers (a, b > 1) such that the product of ((a^b + 1)) and ((b^a + 1)) equals 5330. First, we factorize 5330: [ 5330 = 2 times 5 times 533 = 2 times 5 times 13 times 41 ] 5. We look for pairs of factors of 5330 that are of the form (a^b + 1) and (b^a + 1). The factors of 5330 are: [ 1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 26, 41, 65, 82, 106, 205, 410, 533, 1066, 2665, 5330 ] 6. We need to check which pairs of these factors can be written as (a^b + 1) and (b^a + 1).

Consider one corner where the original square meets the 45^circ and 90^circ rotated squares. 4. **Area of Triangles and Quadrilateral**: - The diagonal of the square under 90^circ rotation forms a straight line dividing the whole square into two equal halves. So, one triangle from this division would have an area of ( frac{1}{2} times 8^2 = 32 ) square units. - For the middle square, rotated by 45^circ, its diagonal cuts through the original square's diagonal at a right angle, forming four right triangles, each with half the area of a half-square, i.e., ( frac{32}{2} = 16 ) square units. 5. **Total Area Calculation**: There are four such right triangles from the intersection within a single quadrilateral, contributing to ( 4 times 16 = 64 ) square units.

This parametrization ensures that the equation dfrac {x^{2}}{3}+y^{2}=1 is satisfied for all alpha. Then, we have 2x+y=2sqrt{3}cosalpha+sinalpha. To express this in the form of sqrt{a^2 + b^2}sin(alpha+theta), by recognizing the sine of a sum formula and comparing coefficients, we find that sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = sqrt{12+1} = sqrt{13}, and theta is such that costheta = frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{13}} and sintheta = frac{1}{sqrt{13}}, allowing us to conclude that 2x+y=sqrt{13}sin(alpha+theta). Note that 2x+y will never reach 4, since sqrt{13}sin(alpha+theta) has the maximum value of sqrt{13}, which is less than 4. Thus, |2x+y-4|=4-2x-y. Similarly, consider the expression x+2y: x+2y=sqrt{3}cosalpha+2sinalpha. Using the same logic, we express it as x+2y=sqrt{7}sin(alpha+beta), and again, as sqrt{7} < 3, it follows that |3-x-2y|=3-x-2y.

Denote leftlfloorfrac{2an}{p}rightrfloor = u and leftlfloorfrac{2bn}{p}rightrfloor = v. 3. **Fractional Part**: Since p is a prime number, neither frac{2an}{p} nor frac{2bn}{p} can be an integer. Therefore, we have 0 < alpha, beta < 1 such that: [ frac{2an}{p} = u + alpha quad text{and} quad frac{2bn}{p} = v + beta. ] 4. **Summing Fractions**: Adding the expressions yields: [ frac{2an}{p} + frac{2bn}{p} = u + alpha + v + beta. ] 5. **Grouping Terms**: Since a + b = p, it follows that: [ frac{2an + 2bn}{p} = 2n. ] 6. **Combining Results**: Hence, we have: [ 2n = u + v + (alpha + beta). ] 7. **Integer Sum**: Seeing alpha + beta must be an integer and based on our bounds: [ 0 < alpha + beta < 2 implies alpha + beta = 1. ] 8. **Odd Sum**: This simplifies to: [ u + v = 2n - 1. ] Since 2n - 1 is always an odd number, we have shown that leftlfloorfrac{2an}{p}rightrfloor + leftlfloorfrac{2bn}{p}rightrfloor is an odd number.

Using the formula for the area of a right triangle ((text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height})): [ text{Area of the right triangle} = frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{k} times sqrt{k} = frac{1}{2} times 2k = k ] 4.

Let's first consider the prime factorization theorem, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors. This implies that integers can be decomposed into a product of integer factors. 3. Suppose there exist integers (c_1, c_2, d_1,) and (d_2) such that: [ c = c_1 c_2, quad d = d_1 d_2, quad a = c_1 d_1, quad b = c_2 d_2 ] 4. Then we can rewrite (a + b + c + d) as: [ a + b + c + d = c_1 d_1 + c_2 d_2 + c_1 c_2 + d_1 d_2 ] 5. Notice that: [ a + b + c + d = (c_1 d_1) + (c_2 d_2) + (c_1 c_2) + (d_1 d_2) ] can be reorganized and factorized as: [ a + b + c + d = (c_1 + d_2)(d_1 + c_2) ] 6. The expression ((c_1 + d_2)(d_1 + c_2)) is a product of two integers. Since both (c_1 + d_2) and (d_1 + c_2) are greater than 1 (assuming (c_1, c_2, d_1,) and (d_2) are positive integers), their product will be a composite number. Therefore, (a + b + c + d) cannot be prime. 7. Another approach to show the same result is to express (a), (b), (c), and (d) using integer factors (c_1), (c_2) such that (c = c_1 c_2). Consider: [ frac{a + c}{c_1} = k, quad frac{b + c}{c_2} = l ] where (k) and (l) are integers. 8. Since (a + c > c ge c_1) and (b + c > c ge c_2), it follows that (k > 1) and (l > 1). 9. Therefore, we can write: [ a + b + c + d = k cdot l ] which is a composite number, since (k > 1) and (l > 1). # Conclusion Thus, (a + b + c + d) cannot be a prime number, and therefore it must be a composite number.

We need to select point ( R ) such that ( PAQR ) forms a parallelogram and ( B, R, P, Q ) are cyclic. 2. Since ( BRPQ ) is cyclic, we have: [ angle PRQ = angle PBQ ] This follows from the property of cyclic quadrilaterals where opposite angles sum to ( 180^circ ). 3.

According to our assumption, (H) can have at most 8 points. We will prove this by contradiction. 2. **Convex Hulls:** Let the convex hull of (H) be denoted by (K). Let the convex hull of the points in (H) that are not vertices of (K) be (k). Therefore, (K) and (k) can each have at most four vertices because if either had more, a convex pentagon would be formed by selecting four vertices from one of the convex hulls and one from the other. 3. **Point Exclusion:** Suppose there exists at least one point (P) in (H) that does not belong to either (K) or (k). Clearly, (P) must lie within the interior of (k). 4. **Case Analysis on (k):** - **Case (k) is a Quadrilateral:** - Split (k) into two triangles by one of its diagonals. Let's denote one of these triangles' vertices as (A), (B), and (C). - Consider the point (P) inside one of these triangles. The segments (PA), (PB), and (PC) will partition the plane into three regions. If (K) has vertices in such a way that any side of (K) intersects one of the segments, say (DE), then (A, B, P) would be on the same side of the line containing (DE), along with (D) and (E). This configuration forces the set ({A, B, P, D, E}) to form a convex pentagon. Since this is contrary to our assumption, each region must contain at most one vertex of (K), making (K) a triangle. - **Case (k) is a Triangle:** - Let the vertices of triangle (k) be (A), (B), and (C). The point (P) lies within this triangle. - The segments (PA), (PB), and (PC) create regions in the plane. Each region can have at most one vertex of (K), implying that (K) must be a triangle again. 5. **Verifying the Number of Points:** - Combining (K) and (k), we have at most (7) points (as both can be at most 4 vertices, and they can share vertices). - Assume there are more internal points (P) and (Q) within (k). If (k) is a quadrilateral, the segment (PQ) can only intersect its opposite sides. - This configuration implies overlapping regions, where more than one internal point participates in forming more than three regions within these intersections. 6. **Conclusion and Contradiction Argument:** - We continually find that introducing additional points (like (P) and (Q)) leads to contradictions with the assumptions of vertex counts and partitioning properties. - Hence, the limitation to 8 points in (H) holds, verifying our assumption that (H) must contain fewer points if it cannot form a convex pentagon. **Conclusion:** Thus, since the initial assumption leads to a contradiction, there exists at least one convex pentagon formed by some subset of the 9 points.

The area K inside cal C and outside the six smaller circles is calculated by: - Area of cal C: pi (3r)^2 = pi (24)^2 = 576pi - Area of one smaller circle: pi r^2 = pi (8)^2 = 64pi - Total area of six smaller circles: 6 cdot 64pi = 384pi - Hence, K = 576pi - 384pi = 192pi Thus, lfloor K rfloor = lfloor 192pi rfloor = boxed{602}, as pi approx 3.14159."},{"instruction":"f |a|=a, then the range of values for a is: A: a gt 0 B: a lt 0 C: aleqslant 0 D: ageqslant 0","output":"To solve the problem, we analyze the condition given: |a| = a. 1.

We need to check if flipping any such card reveals an odd number on the opposite side. 2. Match an odd number: - According to Petr's rule, any vowel must correspond to an even number. Finding an odd number on the reverse side of a vowel disproves Petr's assertion. Let's assume the following card setup on the table (following typical conventions for natural numbers and vowels): - Card 1: (A, ?) - Card 2: (B, ?) - Card 3: (1, ?) - Card 4: (7, ?) - Card 5: (U, ?)

Let this number be n_{text{in}}. - When the same reader leaves the library, they note the number of readers still present. Let this number be n_{text{out}}. - Readers can come and go throughout the day, but the library ends up empty at the beginning and end of the day. 3. **Key Analysis:** - At any point in time, n_{text{in}} - n_{text{out}} for all readers must collectively balance to show the net change in the number of people in the library, which is (0 - 0 = 0) since the library starts and ends empty. - Assume a reader enters and writes n_i as the count of readers they encounter inside the library. - Later, they leave and write m_i as the count of readers left behind. - We must demonstrate that these recorded numbers n_i on entry and m_i on exit for all readers will sum up to the same numerical value. 4. **Detailing the Proof:** - When the first reader enters in the morning, n_1 = 0 (since there is no one in the library). - The number of readers increases and each time a reader enters, they add one to the current count and this continues throughout the day. - When each reader leaves, they reduce the number of readers by one, writing down the number of people still inside. - The sequence of written numbers by readers upon entry is the consecutive numbers from 1,2,3,...n as each subsequent reader finds one additional reader already present. - Similarly, when leaving, they record the count of who remains, which are exactly the readers who have not yet exited - starting from n-1, n-2,... back to 0. 5. **Conclusion:** - Each reader, whether entering or leaving, records a value representing the count at those instances. - At the end of the day, all numbers noted when entering exactly match the numbers when they all leave, simply in reversed order. - Thus, the collected numbers on both boards will be identical, affirming that the sequences written on both boards are permutations of each other, where order does not affect content comparison.

We can list out the possible combinations systematically: - Start with the equal-sided triangle (equilateral triangle): (5, 5, 5) Now since the perimeter is fixed, once we choose two sides, the third side is determined. To find all remaining triangles with different side lengths, we decrement the longest side and increment the shortest side, checking if the triangle inequality still holds: - When the longest side is 6, the possible combinations are: (4, 5, 6) The triangle inequality holds for this combination. - If we continue to decrement the longest side to 7 and increment the shortest side: (3, 5, 7) The triangle inequality holds for this combination. - If we try a 7 with two equal shorter sides: (4, 4, 7) The triangle inequality holds for this combination. - Going further with longest side being 7: (1, 7, 7) (2, 6, 7) (3, 6, 6) In each of these cases, the triangle inequality is satisfied.

First, we need to establish some basic properties and notations. Given that triangle ABC, point D is the tangency point of the incircle at side CA, and E is the tangency point of the incircle at side AB. These tangents create equal segments by properties of the incircle tangents from a single external point. These segments overline{AE} and overline{AD} are crucial. Let BC be divided into two equal segments by its midpoint N. We are asked to prove that the line segment MN, where M is the midpoint of DE, bisects the perimeter of triangle ABC and is parallel to the angle bisector of angle A. 2. Considering the lengths of overline{AB}, overline{BC}, and overline{CA} as c, a, and b, respectively, we use the tangency properties. We have: [ AE = frac{AB + AC - BC}{2} = frac{c + b - a}{2} ] [ AD = frac{AB + AC - BC}{2} = frac{c + b - a}{2} ] 3. Since M is the midpoint of DE and N is the midpoint of BC, the coordinates of M and N in terms of known lengths can be found. By symmetry and the tangency properties, you can deduce that these segments and medians relate proportionately to each other. 4. Next, consider how the perimeter relates to these segments. From the point D and E, since M is the midpoint of DE, the segment MN effectively divides the perimeter of triangle ABC: [ P = AB + BC + CA = a + b + c ] When MN intersects N, it creates two segments that each cover: [ frac{P}{2} = frac{a + b + c}{2} ] 5. For the parallelism to the angle bisector of angle A, recall that the angle bisector theorem tells us: [ frac{AB}{AC} = frac{BF}{FC} ] where F is the foot of the internal angle bisector of angle A. 6. Let F be the point where the angle-bisector of angle BAC intersects BC. From the angle bisector theorem: [ BF = frac{AB cdot BC}{AB + BC} = frac{c cdot a}{c + a} ] Since MN is parallel to AF and since it also partitions the perimeter symmetrically, then MN must halve the perimeter and run parallelly to the angle bisector. 7.

The six other players on her team averaged 3.5 points each. How many points did Vanessa score to set her school record?","output":"To solve for the number of points Vanessa scored, we first calculate the total points scored by the other six players on her team. Since they averaged 3.5 points each, we multiply the average by the number of players: [6 times 3.5 = 21.] This means the six players together scored a total of 21 points. Vanessa's team scored 48 points in total, so to find out how many points Vanessa scored, we subtract the total points scored by the other players from the team's total points: [48 - 21 = 27.] Therefore, Vanessa scored boxed{27} points to set her school record."},{"instruction":"For all composite integers n, what is the largest integer that always divides into the difference between n and the fourth power of n?","output":"We start by factoring the expression: n^4 - n = n(n^3 - 1) = n((n-1)(n^2 + n + 1)). The term (n-1)n(n+1) represents the product of three consecutive integers, which we know from the previous problem is always divisible by 6. We need to check the divisibility of n^2 + n + 1: - It is not always divisible by 2 or 3. For example, if n = 2, then n^2 + n + 1 = 7, which is neither divisible by 2 nor 3. So, we focus on the divisibility of the product (n-1)n(n+1): - (n-1)n(n+1) is divisible by 6. - We must also consider that if n is even, then n^4 - n is divisible by 2, and if n is divisible by 3, then n^4 - n is divisible by 3. Thus, n^4 - n is divisible by the least common multiple of these factors, which is 6. Conclusion: The expression n^4 - n simplifies to n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 + n + 1), where (n-1)n(n+1) is always divisible by 6, but n^2 + n + 1 does not introduce any consistent new factors.

If they are connected, then the numbers ( a b ) and ( n ) must have a common natural divisor greater than 1. What is the smallest ( n ) for which such an arrangement exists?","output":"**Step 1**: Understand the Problem We are given a graph where nodes are connected by edges and we need to assign natural numbers to the nodes under certain conditions: 1. If two nodes are not connected by an edge, the difference between their assigned numbers must be coprime with (n). 2. If two nodes are connected by an edge, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the difference of their assigned numbers and (n) must be greater than 1. We need to find the smallest possible (n) that satisfies these conditions. **Step 2**: Establish the Conditions First, note that: - (n) must not be divisible by 2 or 3. This follows from the fact that: - Among any seven numbers, we will find at least three numbers that are either all even or all odd. If (n) is even, then these numbers are connected. - Also, among any seven numbers, three will give the same remainder when divided by 3. If (n) is a multiple of 3, these numbers will also be connected. - The graph structure does not allow these cycles, hence (n) cannot be divisible by 2 or 3. **Step 3**: Analyze Prime Divisors Given (n) should not be divisible by 2 or 3, let's consider whether it can be composed of other primes, starting with the smallest ones. We also need to ensure that any prime (p) dividing (n) does not form a contradiction with the graph structure. Specifically: - **Observation**: If (p) is a prime divisor of (n), there cannot exist three successively connected nodes in the graph with differences among them divisible by (p). Otherwise, they would form a 3-cycle, which the graph does not have. - **Proof**: - Suppose (p) is a prime divisor of (n). - If (a, b,) and (c) are three consecutively connected nodes (forming a chain), and (a-b equiv 0 mod p), (b-c equiv 0 mod p), then (a-c = (a-b) + (b-c) equiv 0 mod p). Thus ((a, b, c)) would form a connected cycle divisible by (p), contradicting the problem constraints. Hence, we require at least three different prime divisors to avoid such contradictions. **Step 4**: Determine the Prime Divisors The minimal three different primes greater than 2 and 3 are 5, 7, and 11. We compute (n) as: [ n = 5 times 7 times 11 = 385 ] **Step 5**: Verify Configuration for (n=385) Given (n = 385), we need to ensure the configuration satisfies the conditions laid out: - **Integer Selection for Nodes**: Check that for any two nodes without an edge, their difference is relatively prime to 385. - **GCD Verification**: Ensure node pairs connected by edges have differences that share common factors with 385 greater than 1.

For instance, if two vertices of the same color are connected by a diagonal, they must be either both white or both black. 3. **Step 3: Identifying constraints on the routes** - Since a path can only consist of traveling along these diagonals, and these diagonals do not intersect, it implies that we cannot move from a diagonal of one color to a diagonal of another color. 4. **Step 4: Parity of the grid's dimensions** - Next, consider the grid's side length, which is odd (i.e., 2017). This causes the corners of the grid to have vertices of different colors. - For instance, in an odd-lengthed checkerboard, one corner might be black and the diagonally opposite corner might be white. Consequently, the other two corners will follow a similar alternating color pattern. 5. **Step 5: Analyzing the possibility of a closed path** - A closed path would need to connect vertices while visiting each cell exactly once. Given that each diagonal connects vertices of the same color, a closed path would require transitioning through the middle of some cells to alternate colors, which is impermissible as per the problem constraints (you may not travel through the middle of a cell). 6. **Step 6: Conclusion** - Therefore, due to the inability to switch colors through the middle of a cell and the odd dimensions of the grid making the color patterns unfit for forming a continuous path, it is not possible to create a closed path visiting every cell exactly once while only traversing along the diagonals of the cells. # Conclusion: Since the conditions outlined prevent the formation of such a closed path, the solution to the problem is that such a path does not exist.

If ( k ) is odd, then ( n ) is not a perfect square. The divisors of ( n ) are ( 1, p, p^2, ldots, p^k ). We can pair these divisors as follows: [ (1, p^k), (p, p^{k-1}), (p^2, p^{k-2}), ldots ] Each pair ((p^i, p^{k-i})) satisfies the condition that one number divides the other since ( p^i ) divides ( p^{k-i} ) if ( i leq k-i ). 2. **Inductive Step: Generalize to any positive integer ( n )** Assume the statement is true for any integer ( m ) which is not a perfect square and has fewer prime factors than ( n ).

Moreover, ( d cdot frac{n}{d} = n ), ensuring that one number in the pair divides the other. 3. **Conclusion** By induction, we have shown that for any positive integer ( n ) which is not a perfect square, the set of all divisors of ( n ) can be divided into pairs such that in each pair, one number divides the other.

This example supports the idea that the function can have intervals of increase without being strictly increasing or decreasing over the entire real line. 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct statement is that the function f(x) cannot be decreasing on (-infty, +infty) given the condition f(1) < f(2).

The probability that Ankit solves at least one of the three problems first is the complement of the probability that Ankit does not solve any of the three problems first. Therefore, we have: [ P(text{Ankit solves at least one problem first}) = 1 - left( frac{2}{3} right)^3 = 1 - frac{8}{27} = frac{27}{27} - frac{8}{27} = frac{19}{27} ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{19}{27}})."},{"instruction":"Two circles of radius 10 cm overlap such that each circle passes through the center of the other, as shown.

We notice that we have two circles of radius 10 cm each, overlapping in such a way that each circle's center lies on the circumference of the other circle. This configuration forms an equilateral triangle when we connect the centers of the two circles and the point where the two circles intersect at the top. 1. **Identify the Triangle**: The triangle formed by connecting the centers of the two circles and the top intersection point is equilateral. This is because all three sides of this triangle are radii of the circles, and all radii of a circle are equal. Therefore, each side of the triangle is 10 cm. 2. **Determine the Area of the Triangle**: The area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula frac{s^2sqrt{3}}{4}, where s is the length of a side. Substituting s = 10 cm, we get: [ text{Area} = frac{10^2sqrt{3}}{4} = 25sqrt{3} text{ sq cm}. ] 3. **Relate the Area to the Altitude**: The area of a triangle can also be expressed as frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. In this case, the base is one side of the equilateral triangle (10 cm), and the height is the altitude we are trying to find. Let's denote the altitude by h. Thus, we have: [ frac{1}{2} times 10 times h = 25sqrt{3}. ] Simplifying, we find: [ 5h = 25sqrt{3} implies h = 5sqrt{3} text{ cm}. ] 4. **Determine the Length of the Common Chord**: The common chord of the two circles is twice the length of the altitude of the equilateral triangle, as the altitude extends from the midpoint of one side (the base) to the opposite vertex. Therefore, the length of the common chord is: [ 2 times h = 2 times 5sqrt{3} = 10sqrt{3} text{ cm}. ] Thus, the length of the common chord in simplest radical form is boxed{10sqrt{3}} cm."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],N={key:0},I={key:1};function L(n,e,h,u,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
