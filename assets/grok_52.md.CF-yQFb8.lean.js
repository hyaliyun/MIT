It fits perfectly and emily takes lil out onto the pitch to show her the basics of the game - but mainly to give her a chance to get absolutely covered on gooey sticky mud! Emily teases lil, pretending she will be scared to get different parts of her body (eg knees, hands, hair, bum, etc) dirty.","output":"A few days after the muddy match, Emily decided it was time to introduce her younger sister, Lily, to the exhilarating world of rugby—a decision that sparked excitement and a twinge of nervousness in the younger girl. Emily presented Lily with an early birthday gift, a neatly folded rugby kit that matched the ones worn by Emily and her teammates. Lily's eyes lit up as she unfolded the emerald-green jersey, the shorts, and the long socks. \\"For me?\\" she gasped, inspecting the material and the crest of the team stitched onto the chest. Emily nodded, her smile broad and encouraging. \\"Try it on; I bet it's a perfect fit!\\" Emily urged. Moments later, Lily emerged, the kit fitting her as if it had been tailored just for her. The two sisters stood side by side, the elder ruffling the younger's hair playfully. \\"You look like a natural, Lil,\\" Emily beamed. \\"Thanks, Em! But I don't know the first thing about playing,\\" Lily admitted, self-conscious yet eager in her new attire. \\"Not to worry! Let's head to the pitch, and I’ll show you some basics. Just a heads up—you're going to get muddy,\\" Emily said with a knowing wink. Out on the field, the soft, pliable earth was still recovering from the weekend's match. Emily began to demonstrate a passing drill, then showed Lily how to properly pick up the ball from the ground. \\"Now, your knees might get a bit dirty doing this. You're not afraid of a bit of mud on your knees, are you?\\" Emily teased. Lily, emboldened by her sister's playful tone, shook her head and lunged for the ball, her knees sinking into the mud with a satisfying squelch. \\"Good job! Now let's try a tackle. You have to be okay with getting your hands all mucky,\\" Emily continued, showing her how to wrap her arms around the padded practice dummy. Each contact with the earth added a new layer of mud to Lily's hands, but rather than being deterred, she seemed more delighted with every attempt. After several more drills, Emily suggested a game of tag rugby to put their practice into motion. \\"Of course, if you fall, your hair might just become a muddy mess—\\" she joked, darting away with the ball. Lily sprinted after her, laughing, not even caring when a misstep sent her slipping onto her backside, a fresh coat of mud painting her shorts. \\"Oh no, my bum!\\" she exclaimed dramatically, rolling to her feet and giving chase once more as Emily laughed. They played until the setting sun cast long shadows across the field and the sisters were as muddied and bedraggled as anyone had ever been on that pitch. Lily's initial apprehension had vanished completely, replaced by unrestrained joy and newfound confidence. Looking at her younger sister, now proudly sporting a muddy kit of her own, Emily felt a rush of pride. Lily, with mud in her hair, on her hands, and smeared across her kit, beamed back at her, a rugby player in the making—mud, laughter, and all."},{"instruction":"What do you know about white fibrous clots","output":"White fibrous clots, which are also known as \\"white thrombi,\\" arise primarily in the context of arterial or cardiac thrombosis. They are generally formed under conditions of high shear stress, such as those found in the arterial system, where blood moves rapidly. Unlike red clots, which form mostly in the venous system under low shear conditions and are rich in red blood cells, white clots are composed mainly of platelets and fibrin. White thrombi are characteristic of a response to vessel injury, often caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture or endothelial damage. Platelets adhere to the vessel wall and to each other, and they become activated. These activated platelets release substances that trigger the coagulation cascade, leading to the formation of fibrin. The fibrin forms a meshwork that stabilizes the accumulating mass of platelets, forming a white clot that can occlude the vessel lumen. Clinically, white fibrous clots are significant because they can lead to ischemic events. For example, in the coronary arteries, they can cause myocardial infarction (heart attack), while in the cerebral arteries, they can lead to stroke. A key aspect of preventing and treating such thrombotic events often involves the use of antiplatelet drugs (like aspirin or clopidogrel) and anticoagulants (like warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants) to prevent clot formation or to treat an existing clot. Diagnosis of white fibrous clots usually involves imaging techniques such as angiography, ultrasound, or other advanced imaging techniques that can visualize the clot within the affected vessel. In addition, laboratory tests that assess platelet function and coagulation may be used to diagnose and monitor treatment of thrombotic conditions."},{"instruction":"Anything related to covid vaccines","output":"As of my knowledge cutoff date in 2023, there have been discussions and some reports of rare clotting events occurring after administration of certain COVID-19 vaccines. It's important to note that the vast majority of people who received COVID-19 vaccines did so without serious side effects, and the vaccines have proven to be highly effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here are some points regarding this issue: 1. **AstraZeneca/Oxford Vaccine (Vaxzevria) and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Vaccine:** - These vaccines, which are viral vector-based, were associated with an extremely rare clotting disorder called Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT), also referred to as Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS). - This syndrome is characterized by the formation of unusual clots accompanied by a low platelet count, which can lead to serious health issues, and in rare cases, be fatal. - The clots associated with VITT/TTS have occurred in unusual locations, such as the cerebral veins (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, CVST) or the splanchnic veins in the abdomen. - The mechanism behind VITT resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), where the immune system forms antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), leading to a pro-thrombotic state. 2. **mRNA Vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech's Comirnaty and Moderna's Spikevax):** - There have been some reports of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) following mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations, particularly in younger male adults and adolescents. - However, the incidence of these side effects is very rare when compared to the number of vaccine doses administered. 3. **Vaccine Surveillance and Safety:** - Health authorities like the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) continue to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. - The benefits of vaccination in preventing COVID-19, with its associated risks of severe disease, hospitalization, and death, are considered to outweigh the risks of these rare clotting events. 4. **Guidance for Vaccination:** - Based on the available data, health agencies have provided guidance on the use of different vaccines, taking into account the risk of these rare clotting events versus the benefits of vaccination. - Some countries have recommended age restrictions or preferred use of certain vaccines for specific age groups. 5. **Ongoing Research:** - Researchers are continuing to study these rare clotting events to better understand their incidence, mechanisms, and ways to treat and prevent them. Public health recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccination, including considerations around rare clotting events, may have been updated since my last update. It is always advisable to consult the latest guidelines from health authorities or seek medical advice when making decisions about vaccinations."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

That is: ∫(from 0 to 1) x^2 dx To solve this integral, we will use the power rule of integration. Here's how it's done: The antiderivative of x^n, where n ≠ -1, is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration. Applying the power rule, we get: ∫ x^2 dx = (x^(2+1))/(2+1) + C = (x^3)/3 + C We can now apply the limits of our definite integral: ∫(from 0 to 1) x^2 dx = [(x^3)/3]_0^1 = [(1^3)/3] - [(0^3)/3] = (1/3) - 0 = 1/3 So the area under the curve of f(x) = x^2 from 0 to 1 is 1/3."},{"instruction":"By simulation in statistics","output":"Simulation in statistics is a powerful tool used to estimate complicated probability distributions, model complex systems, or to obtain numerical results for problems where analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to derive. To illustrate a simple statistical simulation, we can use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of π. Here's the step-by-step explanation of how to estimate π using a Monte Carlo simulation: 1. Imagine a square with side length 2 and a circle inside it with radius 1, centered at the origin. 2. The area of the square is 4 (2x2), and the area of the circle is π (πr² and r is 1). 3. The ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square is π/4. To simulate this scenario: 1. Randomly generate points with x and y coordinates ranging from -1 to 1, which represents our square of side length 2. 2. Count how many of these points fall inside the circle (x² + y² ≤ 1). 3. The ratio of the points inside the circle to the total number of points generated should be approximately π/4. Let's write down a simple Python code to simulate this: \`\`\`python import random def estimate_pi(num_samples): points_inside_circle = 0 for _ in range(num_samples): x, y = random.uniform(-1, 1), random.uniform(-1, 1) if x**2 + y**2 <= 1: points_inside_circle += 1 return (points_inside_circle / num_samples) * 4 # Let's estimate Pi using 1,000,000 samples pi_estimate = estimate_pi(1000000) print(f\\"Estimated value of π: {pi_estimate}\\") \`\`\` Run this code to simulate the generation of a million points and use their distribution to estimate the value of π. The more samples you use, the closer the estimation will be to the actual value of π. Keep in mind that since this is a random process, you will see slight variations in the estimated value every time you run the simulation."},{"instruction":"Solve a double integral mathematically, numerically and using simulation techniques and comment on this statement","output":"Solving a double integral can be approached in various ways - mathematically (analytically), numerically (using computational methods), and by simulation. Let's consider a straightforward example of a double integral over a rectangular region. # Example Problem: Let's find the volume under the surface defined by f(x, y) = x + y over the rectangle defined by 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1. Mathematical (Analytical) Solution: The double integral we want to solve is: ∬ f(x, y) dA = ∫(from 0 to 1) ∫(from 0 to 1) (x + y) dy dx First, we integrate with respect to \`y\`, treating \`x\` as a constant: ∫(from 0 to 1) (x + y) dy = [xy + (y^2)/2] from 0 to 1 = x + 1/2 Now, we integrate the result with respect to \`x\`: ∫(from 0 to 1) (x + 1/2) dx = [(x^2)/2 + x/2] from 0 to 1 = (1/2) + (1/2) = 1. Numerical Solution: A common numerical method to solve double integrals is Simpson's rule or Trapezoidal rule. Here, we'll use a simple Python function to apply the trapezoidal rule: \`\`\`python import numpy as np def double_integral_trapezoidal(func, x_bounds, y_bounds, num_points): x_lower, x_upper = x_bounds y_lower, y_upper = y_bounds # Define the ranges for x and y with num_points number of points x_range = np.linspace(x_lower, x_upper, num_points) y_range = np.linspace(y_lower, y_upper, num_points) # Apply trapezoidal rule integral_value = 0 dx = (x_upper - x_lower) / (num_points - 1) dy = (y_upper - y_lower) / (num_points - 1) for x in x_range: for y in y_range: integral_value += func(x, y) integral_value *= dx * dy return integral_value # Define the function to integrate def f(x, y): return x + y # Apply the numerical method result_numerical = double_integral_trapezoidal(f, (0, 1), (0, 1), 100) print(f\\"Numerical integration result: {result_numerical}\\") \`\`\` Simulation (Monte Carlo Method): For the simulation, we'll randomly select points within our rectangle and compute the average value of the function over those points. Here's how we can implement a Monte Carlo simulation in Python: \`\`\`python import random def monte_carlo_double_integral(func, x_bounds, y_bounds, num_samples): x_lower, x_upper = x_bounds y_lower, y_upper = y_bounds total_value = 0 # Generate random points and sum the function's value at these points for _ in range(num_samples): x = random.uniform(x_lower, x_upper) y = random.uniform(y_lower, y_upper) total_value += func(x, y) # Calculate average value and scale by the area of the rectangle average_value = total_value / num_samples area = (x_upper - x_lower) * (y_upper - y_lower) return average_value * area # Use the same function f(x,y) defined above # Apply the Monte Carlo method result_simulation = monte_carlo_double_integral(f, (0, 1), (0, 1), 1000000) print(f\\"Monte Carlo simulation result: {result_simulation}\\") \`\`\` # Comments on the statement: All three approaches have their own pros and cons: - The analytical solution provides an exact answer but is not always available for more complex integrands or regions of integration. - The numerical solution can handle more complex cases but introduces computational error. Its accuracy depends on the method and the number of points or intervals used. - The simulation technique (e.g., Monte Carlo) is very versatile and can be applied even to high-dimensional integrals but is a statistical method that provides an estimate with a confidence interval rather than an exact answer. Its accuracy also depends on the number of samples and can be computationally expensive. Comparing the results from all three methods can validate the accuracy of the numerical and simulation techniques. For complex problems, particularly in higher dimensions or with complicated domains, numerical and simulation methods are often the only feasible way to estimate integrals."},{"instruction":"How to solve random walk problems","output":"Random walk problems involve a process in which a point or an agent moves step by step randomly. The randomness of each step makes it a stochastic process. Random walks have applications in various fields, such as physics, ecology, economics, and computer science. The basic setup is that at each time step, the walker takes a step either in one direction or another, with a defined set of probabilities. This could be a simple one-dimensional walk or could have multiple dimensions. # One-Dimensional Random Walk To solve a one-dimensional random walk, let’s consider a basic example where the walker can take a step either to the left or to the right with equal probability (1/2 each) at each time step. This is the simplest case and is often referred to as a symmetric random walk. Analytical Approach for a Simple Symmetric Random Walk We can obtain the probability distribution after a given number of steps or derive an expected value for the position of the walker after those steps. For example, to find the expected position after n steps, notice that each left step is -1 and each right step is +1. If X is the number of steps taken to the right, then the position after n steps is 2X - n (because we count the left steps as negative). Since each step is independent, the expected value of X is n/2. Therefore, the expected final position is: E(position after n steps) = E(2X - n) = 2E(X) - n = 2(n/2) - n = 0. This result shows that the expected position for such a symmetric walk is where the walker started, despite having taken many steps. Monte Carlo Simulation for Random Walk In a simulation, you create many \\"walkers\\" and let them walk randomly. Then, you analyze the final positions of all the walkers to draw conclusions about the behavior of a random walk. Here's a simple Python program to simulate a one-dimensional random walk: \`\`\`python import random def random_walk(steps): position = 0 for _ in range(steps): step = -1 if random.random() < 0.5 else 1 position += step return position # Simulate many random walks num_walks = 10000 steps = 100 final_positions = [random_walk(steps) for _ in range(num_walks)] # Analyze the results mean_position = sum(final_positions) / num_walks print(f\\"Mean final position: {mean_position}\\") \`\`\` The simulation will show that the mean final position is around 0. # Higher-Dimensional Random Walk For walks in two or more dimensions, the principle is similar, but the walker now has more directions in which to step. The walk can still be simulated easily or analyzed mathematically but is more complex. Markov chains and diffusion equations are examples of more advanced mathematical frameworks used to deal with random walks in higher dimensions. # Special Cases and Constraints In some random walk problems, there might be additional rules like barriers, absorbing or reflecting boundaries, or the walker might have different probabilities for stepping in each direction, which makes the walk a biased random walk. These require modifications to the basic analytical and simulation approaches, often involving system-specific reasoning or computational techniques to approach the problem. Keep in mind that the random walk is a broad topic area, and solving specific problems can involve more specialized mathematical tools and techniques."},{"instruction":"Помилки: Вивчаючи творчість братів Григоровичів-Барських, у дослідників з’явилися неспростовні докази того, що Києво-Могилянська академія навчала не тільки спеціальностей архітекторів і художників.","output":"У вашому реченні є кілька неточностей: 1.

Next: Numbers, Previous: Screen Size, Up: Controlling GDB [Contents][Index] 22.5 Output Styling GDB can style its output on a capable terminal. This is enabled by default on most systems, but disabled by default when in batch mode (see Mode Options). Various style settings are available; and styles can also be disabled entirely. set style enabled ‘on|off’ Enable or disable all styling. The default is host-dependent, with most hosts defaulting to ‘on’. If the NO_COLOR environment variable is set to a non-empty value, then GDB will change this to ‘off’ at startup. show style enabled Show the current state of styling. set style sources ‘on|off’ Enable or disable source code styling. This affects whether source code, such as the output of the list command, is styled. The default is ‘on’. Note that source styling only works if styling in general is enabled, and if a source highlighting library is available to GDB. There are two ways that highlighting can be done. First, if GDB was linked with the GNU Source Highlight library, then it is used. Otherwise, if GDB was configured with Python scripting support, and if the Python Pygments package is available, then it will be used. show style sources Show the current state of source code styling. set style tui-current-position ‘on|off’ Enable or disable styling of the source and assembly code highlighted by the TUI’s current position indicator. The default is ‘off’. See GDB Text User Interface. show style tui-current-position Show whether the source and assembly code highlighted by the TUI’s current position indicator is styled. set style disassembler enabled ‘on|off’ Enable or disable disassembler styling. This affects whether disassembler output, such as the output of the disassemble command, is styled. Disassembler styling only works if styling in general is enabled (with set style enabled on), and if a source highlighting library is available to GDB. The two source highlighting libraries that GDB could use to style disassembler output are; GDB’s builtin disassembler, or the Python Pygments package. GDB’s first choice will be to use the builtin disassembler for styling, this usually provides better results, being able to style different types of instruction operands differently. However, the builtin disassembler is not able to style all architectures. For architectures that the builtin disassembler is unable to style, GDB will fall back to use the Python Pygments package where possible. In order to use the Python Pygments package, GDB must be built with Python support, and the Pygments package must be installed. If neither of these options are available then GDB will produce unstyled disassembler output, even when this setting is ‘on’. To discover if the current architecture supports styling using the builtin disassembler library see maint show libopcodes-styling enabled. show style disassembler enabled Show the current state of disassembler styling. Subcommands of set style control specific forms of styling. These subcommands all follow the same pattern: each style-able object can be styled with a foreground color, a background color, and an intensity. For example, the style of file names can be controlled using the set style filename group of commands: set style filename background color Set the background to color. Valid colors are ‘none’ (meaning the terminal’s default color), ‘black’, ‘red’, ‘green’, ‘yellow’, ‘blue’, ‘magenta’, ‘cyan’, and‘white’. set style filename foreground color Set the foreground to color. Valid colors are ‘none’ (meaning the terminal’s default color), ‘black’, ‘red’, ‘green’, ‘yellow’, ‘blue’, ‘magenta’, ‘cyan’, and‘white’. set style filename intensity value Set the intensity to value. Valid intensities are ‘normal’ (the default), ‘bold’, and ‘dim’. The show style command and its subcommands are styling a style name in their output using its own style. So, use show style to see the complete list of styles, their characteristics and the visual aspect of each style. The style-able objects are: filename Control the styling of file names and URLs. By default, this style’s foreground color is green. function Control the styling of function names. These are managed with the set style function family of commands. By default, this style’s foreground color is yellow. This style is also used for symbol names in styled disassembler output if GDB is using its builtin disassembler library for styling (see set style disassembler enabled). variable Control the styling of variable names. These are managed with the set style variable family of commands. By default, this style’s foreground color is cyan. address Control the styling of addresses. These are managed with the set style address family of commands. By default, this style’s foreground color is blue. This style is also used for addresses in styled disassembler output if GDB is using its builtin disassembler library for styling (see set style disassembler enabled). version Control the styling of GDB’s version number text. By default, this style’s foreground color is magenta and it has bold intensity. The version number is displayed in two places, the output of show version, and when GDB starts up. In order to control how GDB styles the version number at startup, add the set style version family of commands to the early initialization command file (see Initialization Files). title Control the styling of titles. These are managed with the set style title family of commands. By default, this style’s intensity is bold. Commands are using the title style to improve the readability of large output. For example, the commands apropos and help are using the title style for the command names. highlight Control the styling of highlightings. These are managed with the set style highlight family of commands. By default, this style’s foreground color is red. Commands are using the highlight style to draw the user attention to some specific parts of their output. For example, the command apropos -v REGEXP uses the highlight style to mark the documentation parts matching regexp. metadata Control the styling of data annotations added by GDB to data it displays. By default, this style’s intensity is dim. Metadata annotations include the ‘repeats n times’ annotation for suppressed display of repeated array elements (see Print Settings), ‘<unavailable>’ and ‘<error descr>’ annotations for errors and ‘<optimized-out>’ annotations for optimized-out values in displaying stack frame information in backtraces (see Backtrace), etc. tui-border Control the styling of the TUI border. Note that, unlike other styling options, only the color of the border can be controlled via set style. This was done for compatibility reasons, as TUI controls to set the border’s intensity predated the addition of general styling to GDB. See TUI Configuration. tui-active-border Control the styling of the active TUI border; that is, the TUI window that has the focus. disassembler comment Control the styling of comments in the disassembler output. These are managed with the set style disassembler comment family of commands. This style is only used when GDB is styling using its builtin disassembler library (see set style disassembler enabled). By default, this style’s intensity is dim, and its foreground color is white. disassembler immediate Control the styling of numeric operands in the disassembler output. These are managed with the set style disassembler immediate family of commands. This style is not used for instruction operands that represent addresses, in that case the ‘disassembler address’ style is used. This style is only used when GDB is styling using its builtin disassembler library. By default, this style’s foreground color is blue. disassembler address Control the styling of address operands in the disassembler output. This is an alias for the ‘address’ style. disassembler symbol Control the styling of symbol names in the disassembler output. This is an alias for the ‘function’ style. disassembler mnemonic Control the styling of instruction mnemonics in the disassembler output. These are managed with the set style disassembler mnemonic family of commands. This style is also used for assembler directives, e.g. .byte, .word, etc. This style is only used when GDB is styling using its builtin disassembler library. By default, this style’s foreground color is green. disassembler register Control the styling of register operands in the disassembler output. These are managed with the set style disassembler register family of commands. This style is only used when GDB is styling using its builtin disassembler library. By default, this style’s foreground color is red.

GDB가 디스어셈블러 출력을 스타일링 할 수 있는 두가지 소스 하이라이팅 라이브러리는; GDB의 내장 디스어셈블러나 파이썬 Pygments 패키지입니다. GDB의 첫 선택은 내장 디스어셈블러를 사용하여 스타일링 하는 것이며, 이는 통상적으로 더 좋은 결과를 제공하며, 각기 다른 유형의 명령어 피연산자를 다르게 스타일링 할 수 있습니다. 그러나, 내장 디스어셈블러는 모든 아키텍처를 스타일링 할 수 있는 것은 아닙니다. 내장 디스어셈블러가 스타일링 할 수 없는 아키텍처의 경우, GDB는 가능한 경우 파이썬 Pygments 패키지를 대체하여 사용할 것입니다. 파이썬 Pygments 패키지를 사용하려면, GDB가 파이썬 지원으로 빌드되어 있어야 하며, Pygments 패키지가 설치되어 있어야 합니다. 만약 이 옵션들 중 어느것도 사용가능하지 않다면, GDB는 이 설정이 'on' 일지라도 스타일이 없는 디스어셈블러 출력을 생성할 것입니다. 현재 아키텍처가 내장 디스어셈블러 라이브러리를 사용하여 스타일링이 가능한지 알아보려면 maint show libopcodes-styling enabled을 확인하십시오. show style disassembler enabled 현재 디스어셈블러 스타일링 상태를 보여줍니다. set style의 하위 명령어들은 특정 스타일 형태를 제어합니다. 이러한 하위 명령어들은 모두 같은 패턴을 따릅니다: 각 스타일링 가능한 객체는 전경색, 배경색, 그리고 강도로 스타일링 될 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 파일 이름의 스타일은 set style filename 명령어 그룹을 사용하여 조정할 수 있습니다: set style filename background color 배경을 color로 설정합니다. 유효한 색상은 'none'(터미널의 기본 색상을 의미), 'black', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'magenta', 'cyan', and 'white'입니다. set style filename foreground color 전경을 color로 설정합니다. 유효한 색상은 'none'(터미널의 기본 색상을 의미), 'black', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'magenta', 'cyan', and 'white'입니다. set style filename intensity value 강도를 value로 설정합니다. 유효한 강도는 'normal'(기본값), 'bold', 그리고 'dim'입니다. show style 명령어와 그 하위 명령어들은 그들 자신의 스타일을 사용하여 출력에서 스타일 이름을 스타일링합니다. 따라서, show style을 사용하여 모든 스타일, 그들의 특성과 각 스타일의 시각적 측면의 완전한 목록을 확인하세요. 스타일링 가능한 객체는 다음과 같습니다: filename 파일 이름과 URL의 스타일링을 제어합니다. 기본적으로 이 스타일의 전경색은 녹색입니다. function 함수 이름의 스타일링을 제어합니다. 이들은 set style function 명령어 가족으로 관리됩니다. 기본적으로 이 스타일의 전경색은 노란색입니다. 이 스타일은 또한 GDB가 내장 디스어셈블러 라이브러리를 사용하여 스타일링 할 때 스타일링된 디스어셈블러 출력에서 기호 이름에도 사용됩니다(set style disassembler enabled 참조). variable 변수 이름의 스타일링을 제어합니다. 이들은 set style variable 명령어 가족으로 관리됩니다. 기본적으로 이 스타일의 전경색은 청록색(cyan)입니다. address 주소의 스타일링을 제어합니다. 이들은 set style address 명령어 가족으로 관리됩니다. 기본적으로 이 스타일의 전경색은 파란색입니다. 이 스타일은 또한 GDB가 내장 디스어셈블러 라이브러리를 사용하여 스타일링 할 때 스타일링된 디스어셈블러 출력에서 주소에도 사용됩니다(set style disassembler enabled 참조). version GDB 버전 번호 텍스트의 스타일링을 제어합니다. 기본적으로 이 스타일의 전경색은 마젠타이고, 볼드 강도를 가지고 있습니다. 버전 번호는 두 곳에서 표시됩니다, show version의 출력과 GDB가 시작될 때. GDB가 시작될 때 버전 번호의 스타일을 제어하려면 초기화 명령 파일에 set style version 명령어 가족을 추가하십시오(초기화 파일 참조). title 제목의 스타일링을 제어합니다. 이들은 set style title 명령어 가족으로 관리됩니다. 기본적으로 이 스타일의 강도는 볼드입니다. 명령어들은 대량의 출력의 가독성을 개선하기 위해 제목 스타일을 사용합니다. 예를 들어, apropos와 help 명령어들은 명령어 이름에 제목 스타일을 사용합니다. highlight 하이라이팅의 스타일링을 제어합니다. 이들은 set style highlight 명령어 가족으로 관리됩니다. 기본적으로 이 스타일의 전경색은 빨간색입니다. 명령어들은 그들의 출력의 특정 부분에 사용자의 주의를 끌기 위해 하이라이트 스타일을 사용합니다. 예를 들어, apropos -v REGEXP 명령어는 regexp에 일치하는 문서 부분을 하이라이트 스타일로 표시합니다. metadata GDB가 표시하는 데이터에 추가된 데이터 주석의 스타일을 제어합니다. 기본적으로 이 스타일의 강도는 희미(dim)입니다. 메타데이터 주석에는 반복되는 배열 요소의 억제된 표시에 대한 'n번 반복' 주석, 오류에 대한 '<사용 불가>' 및 '<오류 설명>' 주석, 백트레이스에서 최적화된 값을 보여주는 스택 프레임 정보에서의 '<최적화됨>' 주석 등이 포함됩니다(출력 설정 참조). tui-border TUI 테두리의 스타일을 제어합니다. 다른 스타일링 옵션들과 다르게, 테두리의 색상만 set style을 통해 제어 가능합니다. 이는 호환성을 위해 그렇게 됐으며, GDB가 일반적인 스타일링을 추가하기 전에 TUI가 테두리 강도를 설정하는 컨트롤을 먼저 도입했기 때문입니다. TUI 설정을 참조하세요. tui-active-border 활성화된 TUI 테두리의 스타일을 제어합니다; 즉, 포커스를 가진 TUI 창. disassembler comment 디스어셈블러 출력에서 주석의 스타일을 제어합니다. 이들은 set style disassembler comment 명령어 가족으로 관리됩니다. 이 스타일은 GDB가 내장 디스어셈블러 라이브러리를 사용하여 스타일링할 때만 사용됩니다(set style disassembler enabled 참조). 기본적으로 이 스타일의 강도는 희미하고, 전경색은 흰색입니다. disassembler immediate 디스어셈블러 출력에서 숫자형 연산자의 스타일을 제어합니다. 이들은 set style disassembler immediate 명령어 가족으로 관리됩니다. 주소를 나타내는 명령어 피연산자의 경우는 'disassembler address' 스타일이 사용됩니다. 이 스타일은 GDB가 내장 디스어셈블러 라이브러리를 사용하여 스타일링 할 때만 사용됩니다. 기본적으로 이 스타일의 전경색은 파란색입니다. disassembler address 디스어셈블러 출력에서 주소 연산자의 스타일을 제어합니다. 이것은 'address' 스타일의 별명입니다. disassembler symbol 디스어셈블러 출력에서 기호 이름의 스타일을 제어합니다. 이것은 'function' 스타일의 별명입니다. disassembler mnemonic 디스어셈블러 출력에서 명령어 기호어의 스타일을 제어합니다. 이들은 set style disassembler mnemonic 명령어 가족으로 관리됩니다. 이 스타일은 또한 어셈블라 지시문, 예를 들어 .byte, .word 등에도 사용됩니다. 이 스타일은 GDB가 내장 디스어셈블러 라이브러리를 사용하여 스타일링 할 때만 사용됩니다. 기본적으로 이 스타일의 전경색은 녹색입니다. disassembler register 디스어셈블러 출력에서 레지스터 연산자의 스타일을 제어합니다. 이들은 set style disassembler register 명령어 가족으로 관리됩니다. 이 스타일은 GDB가 내장 디스어셈블러 라이브러리를 사용하여 스타일링 할 때만 사용됩니다. 기본적으로 이 스타일의 전경색은 빨간색입니다. 다음: 숫자, 이전: 화면 크기, 위로: GDB 제어하기 [목차][색인]"},{"instruction":"Do a sample of a dialogue-filled, action-packed, interesting, and exposition-filled, clockpunk, steampunk, dieselpunk, high fantasy, dark fantasy, urban fantasy, slice-of-life, Victorian-era, harem, school life crossover fanfic between the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Seirei Gensōki [Spirit Chronicles |Seirei Gensōki|] light novel, manga and anime franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

The native American equivalent peoples of Musume Hyakka Jiten’s world in Musume Hyakka Jiten’s North, South and Central American equivalents and the Indonesian, Cantonese, Yunnanese, Malay, Pinoy, Hawaiian and Maori equivalent peoples of Musume Hyakka Jiten’s world are also mostly water-benders [Avatar: The Last Airbender], known collectively as the Water Tribe [Avatar: the Last Airbender] although there are some fire-benders [Avatar: The Last Airbender] and earthbenders [Avatar: The Last Airbender] among them. Lautreamont Knight Country [Seikoku no Doragunā] is the informal name of the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal parliamentary monarchial theocratic crusader state of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] within this story with the Kingdom of Lescatie also being [what the Kingdom of Lescatie also is] known as the Tristain Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima], the Gallia Kingdom [the Zero no Tsukaima] or the Albion Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima] and the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] being its [the Kingdom of Lescatie’s in this story’s] official name [the Ordesian Empire] in this story as well. The Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] is also known as the Beltrum Kingdom [Seirei Gensōki] in this fic due to its [the Ordesian Empire’s in this fic] control of both the land and seas. The Kingdom of Lescatie’s territories in this world are the British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, and the West Occitania equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the European Russia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the Bulgaria including Greek Thrace and Macedonia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and the reigning monarchs of Kingdom of Lescatie in this story have the combined title of King/Queen of the England/British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and that of the Bulgarian/Russian Tsar equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. Its [The Kingdom of Lescatie’s in this fic] history is basically if the House of Plantagenet-equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima-ruled Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continued to exist past 1216 and the subsequent the Hundred Years War of 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 being won by the English equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, with the marriage of the Queen Elizabeth I of England equivalent to the Peter the Great equivalent of the Russian Empire equivalent in this world essentially creating this world’s version of a Anglo-Russian Empire, transforming Albion-Gallia-Tristian into the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and allowing the Tudor equivalent in in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continuing to rule the Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima until the German-equivalent House of Hanover equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima take power after the death of the last Tudor-equivalent Queen on 1 August 1714. An equivalent of the American Revolution does occur with the USA equivalent quickly becoming a protectorate of the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Hapsburg-equivalent-ruled Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. The Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima allows its non-Austrian German territories independence as a Royal House of Hohenzollern-equivalent-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-equivalent ruled German Empire in response to Germanic nationalism and the ideas promoted by a failed French Revolution equivalent, quickly seizing the Italian peninsula during the Italian-equivalent wars of Independence and reabsorbing the Italian states equivalent into itself, becoming truly Holy, Roman and an Empire, quickly transitioning into a Austria-Hungary Equivalent. The Crimean War equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima ends with a draw although the Third Bulgarian Empire is created in the 19th century equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima instead of 1908. The Catholic branch of the real-life British royal family, the House of Saxe-Gotha-equivalent ruling over the Third Bulgarian Empire-equivalent as its imperial family reunites with the Protestant British branch-equivalent, becoming the imperial family of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] as well after the passing of the Queen Victoria-equivalent. The Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] then styles itself as the restoration, continuation and reformation of the Eastern Roman Empire-equivalent since the current imperial family rules over the major territories controlled by the Eastern Roman equivalent as well as the France equivalent and British Isles-equivalent. The plot should focus on the short, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom, collected, proud, and powerful but also very generous, selfless, thoughtful and supportive as well as impatient, temperamental, shy, and reckless Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière [Zero no Tsukaima], the heiress [Louise] of the Ducal House of La Vallière [Zero no Tsukaima], a French-equivalent side-branch of The Ordesian Empire’s imperial family in this fic, who [Louise] is [who else Louise is in this story]the true identity [Louise in this story] of [Louise’s true identity in this story] the pink-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom young dragoness girl in a human form Eco Aurora-Christa Pendragon Lena Anherusu-Ilya Roransu Liliane-Muriel-Octavia-Robertine de la Rosa Resuperansu van de Compostela Avalon [Seikoku no Doragunā], [Eco Aurora-Christa Pendragon Lena Anherusu-Ilya Roransu Liliane-Muriel-Octavia-Robertine de la Rosa Resuperansu van de Compostela Avalon] better known by her [Eco’s Aurora’s-Christa’s Pendragon’s Lena Anherusu’s-Ilya’s Roransu’s Liliane’s-Muriel’s-Octavia’s-Robertine’s de la Rosa’s Resuperansu’s van de Compostela’s Avalon’s] first name [Eco], who [Eco] is [who Eco is] the imperial crown princess [Eco] of the entirely dragon-populated Avalon Empire [Seikoku no Doragunā], which [the Avalon Empire in this story] is [the Avalon Empire in this story] the true mother-state [the Avalon Empire in this story] of the House of Plantagenet-equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima-ruled Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, with real life Britain’s mythological Welsh originating King Arthur Pendragon being a real person in this story and [King Arthur in this story] being the first, founding monarch [King Arthur in this story] of the Avalon Empire in this story, although he [King Arthur in this story] was actually a young teenage girl [King Arthur’s true identity in this story] known as Artoria [Fate/Stay Night franchise], which [King Arthur being a girl in this story] is of course hidden from the global public. Louise in this story also takes the place of Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu’s main girl, the short, petite and slender but also secretly buxom and curvy, bright-red haired and purplish-red eyed young noble girl Claire Elstein [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] who [Claire] has the public alias of [what Claire’s public alias is] “Claire Rouge” [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] due to her [Claire’s] sister, the red-haired, purplish-red eyed, tall, curvy and buxom Rubia Elstein seizing the Fire Elemental Lord [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], and [Rubia] escaping with said spirit [the Fire Elemental Lord] for unknown reasons four years before the start of the series [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and [Claire] is [what Claire is] the crown princess [Claire] of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], [Louise in this story] having Claire’s Ortlinde [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], a powerful fire contracted spirit [Ortlinde] that [Ortlinde] can assume a red-haired, amber-eyed, short, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom human form, but [Ortlinde] mostly takes the form of a small red cat or a flaming whip in her [Ortlinde’s] weapon form. Claire is [Claire] unaware of Ortlinde’s true identity and [Claire] calls affectionately her [Ortlinde] “Scarlet” [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and [Louise in this story] having Claire’s public alias [Claire Rouge] as her [Louise’s in this story’s] own as well as [Louise in this story] having her [Claire’s] hair and [Louise’s in this story’s] eyes change to Claire’s own when she [Louise in this story] is [Louise in this story] highly emotional. Louise in her [Louise’s in this story’s] true self [Eco] is a Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā], her [Eco’s in this story] partner [Seikoku no Doragunā] being [who Eco’s in this story’s partner is] the Japanese-equivalent black-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender and muscular, skilled swordsman and magic using teenage boy Karasuki Ryū [Seirei Gensōki] who [Ryū] is [Ryū] the reincarnation [Ryū] of [who Ryū’s past life was] the tall, slender and muscular, kind and loyal swordsman-in-training and Japanese noble heir Amakawa Haruto [Seirei Gensōki] who [Haruto] was [Haruto] killed [Haruto] in a bus accident in Japan on Earth while [Haruto] going home from college and [Haruto] was [Haruto] subsequently reincarnated [Haruto] as Ryū [Seirei Gensōki] in the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā and Seirei Gensōki when the latter [ Ryū] was [Ryū] only five years old, or rather Ryū absorbed Haruto’s soul into himself [Ryū]. Haruto, before, upon and after his [Haruto’s] reincarnation as Ryū replaces Zero no Tsukaima’s protagonist, the black-haired, blue-eyed, short and slender but also muscular teenage Japanese Hiraga Saito [Zero no Tsukaima], Saito being his [Haruto’s] middle name in this fic as well as having Saito’s status of Gandálfr [Zero no Tsukaima], which essentially means he [Saito] gains absolute mastery of any item meant for combat when he [Saito] touches and [Saito] subsequently weilds it, even artillery cannons and fighter aircraft, [Saito] also gaining heightened strength, agility, endurance, and reflexes as well as mastery over scientific application of technology to be included in using any weapon due to his [Saito’s] status as Gandálfr. Ryū in this story also replaces the short, slender and lean, purple-haired, blue eyed, naive and somewhat delusional but also intellectually gifted and kind young boy training to be a Hero [Monmusume Kuesto! & Musume Hyakka Jiten] with a dream of coexistence between humans and monmosu [Musume Hyakka Jiten & Monmusume Kuesto!] who is unknowingly a Nephilim [fallen angel-human hybrid |Nephilim|] Luka Hein [Monmusume Kuesto!], “Luka Hein” [in this story] being Anglo-equivalent-Germanic-equivalent corruption of Karasuki Ryū [Seirei Gensōki] Ryū in general replaces Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu’s protagonist, the tall and slender but also muscular Japanese-equivalent, black-haired, laid-back and reserved but also cunning and intelligent blue-eyed ex-assassin Kazehaya Kamito [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], [Ryū in this story] having Kamito’s canon status as being one of the few males [Kamito in canon] to be able to form a contract with a contracted spirit [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and [Ryū in this story] having Kamito’s contracted spirits of the legendary contracted spirit, the calm cool and collected and highly intellectual Restia Ashdoll [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], who [Resita] takes the form of a short and slender but also curvy and buxom, black-haired, purple-eyed Eurasian teenage girl and a a one-handed longsword with the bevels colored red in her [Restia’s] sword form and Kamito’s second contracted spirit, the white-haired, blue-eyed, short, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom, soft-spoken, reclusive and robot-like young girl Terminus Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], who [Est] takes the form of a Western-style holy sword in her [Est’s] sword form, although he [Ryū in this story] of course hides this [Ryū being able to have not just one, but multiple contracted spirits] from the people around him. Ryū is [Ryū in this story] also a firebender with the ability to bend earth [Ryū in this story] due to his [Ryū’s] mother, the now-deceased crown princess of the feudal Japan equivalent in the world of Seirei Gensōki, the black-haired, purple-eyed, tall and slender but also curvy and buxom, kind and loving Karasuki Ayame [Seirei Gensōki], [Ayame in this story] being [Ayame in this story] being [what Ayame was in this story before her |Ayame’s| passing] a firebender [Avatar: the Last Airbender] and his [Ryū’s] father, the now-deceased ex-villager turned imperial bodyguard turned adventurer after he [Ryū’s father] and his [Ryū’s father’s] charge, [Ayame], [Ryū’s father and Ayame] both [Ryū’s father and Ayame] escaped from Seirei Gensōki’s equivalent of Japan for their [Ryū’s father and Ayame’s] safety, the black-haired, gray-eyed, tall and slender, kind and determined Zen [Seirei Gensōki] being [Zen in this story] a earthbender [Avatar: the Last Airbender] due to his [Zen’s] origins as [where Zen came from] a rural villager [what Zen started off as] in feudal Japan equivalent in the world of Seirei Gensōki with a very minor firebending ability. Ryū in this story of course hides the fact that he [Ryū in this story] is [Ryū in this story] a bender [Ryū in this story] from the people around him [Ryū in this story]. After rescuing a princess of the Ordesian Imperial family from kidnappers sometime after the event [Haruto’s soul being |Haruto’s soul| absorbed into him |Ryū|], Ryū was [Ryū] adopted into the Ordesian imperial family as an imperial prince and [Ryū] given the Ordesian name Lelouch vii Brittania [Code Geass] by the Ordesian Emperor, but most people in the [Ordesian Empire’s] imperial household just call him [Ryū as Lelouch] Rio [Seirei Gensōki]. Ryū, as Lelouch later takes the identity of the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender Ash Blake [Seikoku no Doragunā] when he [Ryū as Lelouch] starts attending school as an alias [Ash Blake] to try and live a normal life, although this backfires on him [Ryū as Lelouch] as Louise in this story, [Louise in this story] having deep feelings for him [Ryū as Lelouch] and [Louise in this story] wanting to be his [Ryū’s as Lelouch’s] wife and [Louise in this story] subsequently having his [Ryū’s as Lelouch’s] love children, which he [Ryū as Lelouch] is [Ryū as Lelouch] of course clueless about and [Louise in this story] subsequently manages to infiltrate the educational institute established to teach aristocratic students the art of magic, Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima] despite [Louise in this story] being [Louise in this story] four years younger than him [Ryū as Lelouch], [Louise in this story] taking the name of Linda Blake [Seikoku no Doragunā] while [Louise in this story] at Tristain Academy of Magic and [Louise in this story] managing to gain control of her [Louise’s] control over void magic [Zero no Tsukaima] and [Louise in this story] manipulate her [Louise’s in this story’s] void magic into other elemental matters, [Louise in this story] using it [Louise’s void magic] to [Louise in this story] pass as a half-decent water mage [Linda Blake] while [Louise in this story] at Tristain Academy of Magic, although she [Louise as Linda] ends up [Louise as Linda] being put in the Ordesian Empire’s prestigious all-female boarding school Areishia Spirit Academy [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] which [Areishia Spirit Academy] teaches young Ordesian noble ladies how to use their contracted spirits and [Areishia Spirit Academy in this fanfic] is [Areishia Spirit Academy in this fanfic] a division [Areishia Spirit Academy in this fanfic] of Tristain Academy of Magic after [Louise as Linda] unconciously summoning Scarlet to [Louise as Linda] beat down a male student who insulted Ash for [Ash] not having a Pal despite him [Ash] having the mark of a contractor. The excerpt should focus on Louise in this story in her disguise as Linda, who [Linda] has [Linda’s] brown hair and [Linda’s] amber eyes, [ Louise in this story as Linda] being selected from the line of students at Tristain Academy of Magic’s P.E session to try summoning a familiar. Even though Linda’s true self [Louise in this story] doesn’t see the need for such a thing [having a familiar] as most of the students [at Tristain Academy of Magic] have Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] and the female students, in addition to having Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] also have contracted spirits [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] in addition to having regular magical skills but [Louise in this story] wisely keeps her [Linda’s] mouth shut, [Linda] not wanting Tristain Academy of Magic’s elderly, wise but also incredibly perverted and still-sharp and intelligent headmaster Osmond [Zero no Tsukaima] to discover any of her [Linda’s] secrets if she [Linda] should [Linda] slip up. When Linda steps up to do the familiar summoning she [Linda] secretly moulds the void magic she [Linda] is using for the ritual into the exact type of magic needed for the summoning ritual and [Linda] then proceeds to do the ritual, even managing to form the proper runic circles for the ritual to cover her use of void magic. The ritual succeeds but the weight of Linda’s secretly generous bosom strains against her [Linda’s] tight school blouse, causing her [Linda] to lose concentration as she [Linda] ends it [the ritual], creating a small explosion at the end. When the smoke clears, and everyone gathers to get a closer look: people start bursting out in laughter at whom Linda’s familiar is: It’s Ash, who [Lelouch] was summoned from the secondary school division of Tristain Academy of Magic in this story, more specifically its [the secondary school division of Tristain Academy of Magic’s] dragon riding subsection, Ansarivan Dragon Riding Academy [Seikoku no Doragunā] to the sports field of Tristain Academy of Magic’s middle school division, which [Tristain Academy of Magic’s middle school division] Linda is [Linda] currently a student [Linda] of. When Linda sees this [Ash being her |Linda’s| familiar] she [Linda] is [Linda] secretly filled with happiness, as that means that her [Linda’s] true self [Louise in this story] is [Louise in this story] closer to her [Louise’s in this story’s] goal of [Louise in this story] marrying his [Ash’s] true self [Lelouch]. As the bond between a familiar and master requires salival contact, Linda passionately kisses him [Ash] before he [Ash] can say anything, with some of Linda’s older classmates noting that the Starbrand [Seikoku no Doragunā], the mark [a Starbrand] that [a Starbrand] indicates that a human has made a contract with a Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā], on his [Ash’s] left-hand starts to glow when she [Linda] is [Linda] kissing him [Ash] and that Linda’s eyes glow red when she [Linda] is [Linda] kissing him [Ash] as well, indicating that Linda is [Linda] somehow his [Ash’s] Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā] despite both of them [Ash and Linda] being human. When Linda finally stops kissing Ash and pulls back, her [Linda’s] cheeks red and her [Linda’s] face flushed due to her [Linda’s] combined embarrassment, [Linda’s] happiness, and [Linda’s] lustful love, some of the older students of the middle school division burst out in mocking cheers, calling him [Ash] truly a ladies’ man and mockingly stating that Linda could be the bridge between human and dragon, not realizing how true their statements about Linda are. Oswald, sensing the usage of void magic around Linda for a brief moment as well as Ash fully becoming Gandálfr [Zero no Tsukaima] and the formation of a Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā]-Master contract after Linda kissed him [Ash], Oswald isn’t as mocking as the students, [Oswald] seeing the love in Linda’s eyes as she [Linda] stares at him [Ash] and noting that the glow in her [Linda’s] eyes isn’t that of a human as he [Oswald] prefers to [Oswald] stay silent.

[Haruto] meet up with her [Ayase] again and [Haruto] seeing her [Ayase] at his [Haruto’s] high school entrance ceremony, [Haruto] planning to talk to her [Ayase] before she [Ayase] disappered the day after, her [Ayase’s] disapperance being treated as a suspected kidnapping and subsequent assasination by Cantonese nationalist elements of the PRC’s ruling CCP with the help of anti-Japanese elements in the Russian and American intellgence community by the Japanese domestic intelligence services in later years. Her [Ayase’s] disappearance devastated him [Haruto] and he [Haruto] threw himself [Haruto] into his [Haruto’s] studies, becoming a star student [Haruto at high school] and having a small gang of lackeys, as well as a large harem of female admirers of all ages, which persisted even when he [Haruto] entered Tokyo University and [Haruto], was rising academically through the ranks up until his [Haruto’s] death and his [Haruto’s] soul crossing worlds and [Haruto’s soul] being [Haruto’s soul] absorbed into the then young Ryū, who [the young Ryū after |the young Ryū| absorbing Haruto’s soul] was [the young Ryū after |the young Ryū| absorbing Haruto’s soul] then adopted into the Ordesian imperial family, becoming Lelouch. As Ash finishes thinking about his [Ash’s] past life [Haruto] and the events that made him [Haruto] into the man he [Haruto] was before his [Haruto’s] death and his [Haruto’s] subsequent transmigration and [Haruto’s] strange reincarnation, [Ash] idly wondering if his [Haruto’s] one true love [Ayase] was [Ayase] reincarnated in this world with him [Haruto] and how exactly she [Ayase] was [Ayase] reincarnated if this [Ayase being reincarnated] was true, a bold schoolmate of Linda, whose [Linda’s] deep feelings for a [Linda’s] beloved older brother, whom [Linda’s older brother] Ash quickly realizes is him [Ash/Lelouch] are well known to the entire school by now despite her [Linda] trying to hide it, [the schoolmate] in an effort to mock and humilate the both of them [Ash and Linda]. [the schoolmate] asks if he [Ash] is [Ash] in fact her [Linda’s] older brother. Before Ash can explain himself [Ash] and [Ash] clear things up, Linda kisses him [Ash] again and [Linda] loudly declares that he [Ash] is indeed her [Linda’s] beloved older brother [Ash] and her [Linda’s] future husband [Ash] as well and anybody having a problem with that can taste the knuckles of her [Linda’s] fists as she [Linda] begins to grow flaming cat ears and a flaming cat tail, a result of Scarlet’s [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] influence as Scarlet’s [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] whip form appears in her [Linda’s] right hand. Ash sweatdrops as he [Ash] realizes that he [Ash] inherited more than just Haruto’s sword skills, academic knowledge, intellectual genius and vast knowledge in addition to martial arts techniques, he [Ash] also inherited his [Haruto’s] incredible luck with the opposite sex, [Ash] reluctantly accepting that he [Ash] will most likely be a husband to multiple wives and [Ash] have multiple consorts, [Ash] having children with all of them before he [Ash] is thirty, although he [Ash] wonders if he [Ash] can get to Earth, more specifically Japan, and find out what has been happening in the Land of the Rising Sun [Japan] after his [Ash’s] previous life [Haruto] before that as Restia bursts out cackling in his [Ash’s] head. Ash manages to sneak away from the commotion on the sports field and [Ash] return to the high school section of Tristain Academy of Magic, [Ash] thanking the Shinto Gods for his [Ash’s] previous life [Haruto] also [Haruto] learning Onmyōdō [The Way of Yin and Yang |Onmyōdō|, a traditional Nihon-jin |Japanese (Nihon-jin)| esoteric cosmology |Onmyōdō|which |Onmyōdō| is |Onmyōdō| a mixture |Onmyōdō| of |what Onmyōdō combines| natural science, exorcist style services |Onmyōdō|, |Onmyōdō| and East Asian occultism |Onmyōdō|] from his [Haruto’s] grandfather before he [Haruto] returned to Tokyo to start high school and [Haruto] find Ayase as it [Haruto’s Onmyōdō skills] allowed him [Ash] to escape from the sports field without [Ash] being noticed. He [Ash] does lay out a troublesome high-class noble in the fifth-form [the British equivalent of the Japanese third grade in high school] of the high school section of Tristain Academy who [the noble] seems to have discovered what happened between him [Ash] and Linda [Linda taking Ash as her |Linda’s| Gandálfr and the activation of the contract between Linda and Ash that makes Linda Ash’s Pal] and [the noble] decides to insult him [Ash] about it, [Ash knocking out the disrespectful noble] with a well-concealed punch to the stomach [of the noble], [Ash] quickly moving on to classes without incident as everyone thinks the noble has simply fainted. At class, Ash briefly wonders if his [Ash’s] classmate at the Academy and his [Ash’s] adoptive younger sister due to his [Ash’s] current true self’s [Ryū’s] adoption by the Ordesian imperial family as Lelouch, the tall, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, black-haired and purple-eyed second princess of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], the soft-spoken, shy and reserved but also teasing and playful Fianna Ray Ordesia [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] who [Fianna in this story] partially replaces whom [Fianna partially replaces in this story] the purple-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite, but also buxom and somewhat curvy, shy, reserved and soft-spoken, sickly fourth princess of the Kingdom of Lescarte [Musume Hyakka Jiten], Francisca Mistel [Musume Hyakka Jiten], [Fianna in this story] having her [Francisca’s] first name as her [Fianna’s in this story’s] first name but not her [Francisca’s] sickness, [Fianna in this story also replacing] the short, slender and petite, curvy and buxom, soft-spoken and reserved but also kind and caring Crown Princess of Tristian, Henrietta de Tristain [Zero no Tsukaima], [Fianna in this story] having her [ Henrietta’s] first name as her [Fianna’s in this story’s] middle name and [Fianna in this story] having her [Henrietta’s] hair color when she [Fianna in this story] gets angry or [Fianna in this story] has any other dark emotion as well as [Fianna in this story] replacing [the other character whom Fianna in this story replaces] the violet-haired, purple-haired, short, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, weak-willed, shy and reserved but also incredibly smart, strong and obstinate second princess of the canon Beltrum Kingdom in canon Seirei Gensōki, Flora Beltrum [Seirei Gensōki], [Fianna in this story] having some of her [Flora’s] weak-willed and [Flora’s] shy and reserved nature but [Fianna in this story] also having her [Flora’s] immense intellect along with her [Flora’s] strong and obstinate nature, who [Fianna in this story] is [Fianna in this story] also attending Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima] under an alias, her [Fianna’s in this story’s] alias while [Fianna in this story] a student [Fianna in this story] at Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima] being Nina Einstein [Code Geass], which Ash finds somewhat amusing and somewhat sad due to Einstein’s role in his [Ash’s] previous life’s [Haruto’s] world [Earth], [Ash wondering if Fianna] knew about her [Fianna’s] younger cousin [Louise in this story] all along and if she [Fianna in this story] also has feelings for him [both as Ash and as Lelouch] as well. The next day, Ash wakes up not in his [Ash’s] familiar drab ordinary bedroom of his military-barracks-like dorm room in the section of Tristain Academy of Magic’s [Zero no Tsukaima] dorm reserved for lower-class and middle-class noble heirs attending Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima], but what could be described in Earth terms as a medieval to 1950s era small miniature luxury apartment disguised as a bedroom, [Ash] realizing that either Louise in this story found out about his [Ash’s] location from the Master-Pal contract they [Lelouch and Louise in this story] now share or [Louise in this story] learned it from Fianna in this story and either one or both of the girls [Louise in this story and Fianna in this story] decided to take him [Ash] to their dorm. He [Ash] thanks the Shinto gods and goddesses that they [Louise in this story and Fianna in this story] haven’t discovered his [Ash’s] secret diary which [Ash’s secret diary] is entirely written in Japanese, [Ash’s secret diary] describing his [Ash’s] life and his [Ash’s] observations. Ash feels something heavy on his stomach and [Ash] quickly removes the bedsheet, only to see Terminus Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] in her [Est’s] human form sleeping soundly on top of him [Ash] without a care in the world. Realizing that this could be misinterpreted by Louise in this story and/or Fianna in this story or even any other of his [Ash’s] adopted female relatives when they inevietablely walk in the room to check on him [Ash], Ash gently pushes her [Est] off him to his [Ash’s] side and [Ash] quickly puts the bedsheet back over them [Ash and Est]. Which turns out to be the right decision as the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, short, slender and petite, shy, reserved and soft-spoken but publicly strong, stern and also being very competitive princess Silvia Lautreamont [Seikoku no Doragunā], who [Silvia in this fanfic] replaces [the person whom Silvia replaces in this fanfic] the short, slender and petite but also curvy and very buxom, proud and haughty but also kind and caring blonde-haired, green-eyed noble heiress, Rinslet Laurenfrost [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], [Silvia in this fanfic] having Rinslet’s contracted spirit [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] Fenrir [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] a normal sized wolf [Fenrir] with water manipulating and ice manipulating abilities and [Fenrir] taking the form of an ice bow in its [Fenrir’s] weapon form as well as her [Rinslet’s] green eyes when she [Silvia in this fanfic] is [Silvia in this fanfic] highly emotional along with her [Rinslet’s] proud and haughty but secretly kind and loving personality, [Silvia in this fanfic] using her [Rinslet’s] name as an alias while [Silvia in this fanfic] attending Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima], who [Silvia in this fanfic] is [Silvia in this fanfic] Fianna’s biological older-half sister [Silvia in this fanfic] and Louise’s in this story’s older cousins [Silvia in this fanfic] along with [Silvia in this fanfic] being [Silvia in this fanfic] one of Lelouch’s adoptive younger sisters [Silvia in this fanfic], [Silvia in this fanfic] and her [Silvia’s in this fanfic’s] de jure maid and de-facto bodyguard, the tall, slender and buxom, black-haired, gray-eyed, kind and soft-hearted but also very competent and skilled in both housework, the culinary arts and combat arts and espionage, Carol Nastassha [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], [Silvia and Carol] both [Silvia and Carol] walk in. Ash then realises he [Ash] is in Silvia’s bedroom. Ash is able to successfully hide Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] being [Est] with him [Ash] on the bed, allowing Carol to explain away the movements Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] makes as she [Est] snuggles up to him [Ash] to a suspicious Siliva in this story as something men have in the mornings, which makes Silvia even more determined to perform her [Silvia’s] “wively duties”, causing him [Ash] to realize that she [Silvia] also loves him [Ash] as more than a brother [Lelouch, both as himself |Lelouch| and as Ash as well] too. After Silvia and Carol both [Silvia and Carol] leave after the former [Silvia] reminds him [Ash] to bathe and come down for breakfast, Ash removes the bedsheet and [Ash] successfully convinces Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] to [Est] wake up before both girls [Silvia and Carol] return and [Silvia and Carol] see him [Ash] with her [Est]. After [Ash] bathing with Est and [Ash] finding one of Silvia’s old uniforms for her [Est] to wear, [Ash] comes down for breakfast, [Ash] passing her [Est] off as a weak familiar spirit with the ability to take a human form, although Carol’s sharp eyes note how tightly she [Est] clings to his [Ash’s] arm and the way how she [Est] refers to him [Ash] as her [Est’s] older brother as she [Est] stares at him [Ash] with a wistful, blushing look on her [Est’s] face. Silvia then clears her throat and [Silvia in this fanfic] reveals that she [Silvia in this fanfic] knows what happened the previous day [Louise as Linda summoning Lelouch as Ash as her |Louise’s| familiar and |Louise as Linda| subsequently making him |Lelouch| into her |Louise’s| Gandálfr and Louise becoming his |Lelouch’s| Pal] and that she [Silvia] would also like to be his [Lelouch’s] wife as well, since a human making a dragon of the Albion Imperial Family a Pal makes them [the human and the dragon] spouses.

Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","output":"I'm sorry, but creating such an extensive, highly detailed, and specific crossover fanfiction excerpt as per your request is beyond the scope of this platform and would likely result in a text that is far too long to manage as a single response within the limitations of this assistant. However, I can provide guidance and suggestions on how to approach this type of writing endeavor: 1. **Chose Your Central Characters Wisely**: With a cast as extensive as the one you outlined, it's essential to focus on a limited number of central characters for clear storytelling—Louise, Ryū, and a few key supporting players. 2. **Define the Setting**: Establish the amalgam world of \\"Seikoku no Doragunā\\" and \\"Seirei Gensōki\\" with steampunk and clockpunk elements. Keep it vivid but concise. 3. **Create a Compelling Conflict**: Perhaps the monotheistic Lescatie/Tristain/Ordesian Empire, with its anti-monster girl stance, is on the brink of war with a coalition of nations sympathetic to monmosu rights and bent on the Empire's reformation. 4. **Integrate Magic and Technology**: Weave together the use of spirits, bending arts, and technology like dragons and airships to add dynamic layers to your combat and action scenes. 5. **Develop Relationships Carefully**: With a harem aspect in mind, focus on the emotional and romantic entanglements of your characters, especially between Louise and Ryū. This should be done while being respectful to both characters' developments and the overall plot. 6. **Maintain Internal Logic**: Despite the complex makeup of your world, ensure that the rules of magic, politics, and relationships are consistent and explained enough for the reader to suspend disbelief. 7. **Plan Your Story Arcs**: Structure your story into clear arcs that can be explored in different chapters or segments of the narrative. An arc might involve Louise's secret identity, Ryū's struggle with his destiny, or the unfolding political intrigue of the empire. 8. **Edit and Refine**: Given the complexity of your crossover, meticulous editing and refining are required to maintain clarity, pacing, and coherence. Though we can't craft the entire fanfic excerpt you've requested, these tips should help you outline and begin writing this ambitious crossover event. Remember to enjoy the creative process, as fanfiction is a celebration of the worlds and characters you love.

EDM, 일렉트로니카 DJ들 버는 거 보면 상상을 초월한다면서. 1억 모으기가 목표 중 하나인 우담으로선 거절할 이유가 없었다. 궁금한 것만 많았다. “근데 행사가 낮이네요?” 페스티벌은 보통 늦은 오후에서 밤에 하니까. “다른 페스티벌은 건전하지 않다고 하는 말은 아닌데, 카와이 페스티벌은 아무튼 굉장히 건전한가 봐요.” “아하. 행사 마치고 바로 귀국하는 코스라면 저는 좋습니다.” “그렇죠. 신주놀 촬영이 일요일이니까.” 작곡가들에게 곡을 완성해오란 미션은 이미 받았고, 그날 스튜디오에서 맛보기로 조금 들려주고 페어를 짠다. ‘우담 씨의 방송 인지도가 올라갈 기회.’ 물론, 가요제도 어쨌든 경연이다. 이규성은 작곡가들이 그런 자리에 모이면 눈에 안 보이는 신경전이 펼쳐진단 것을 알아도, 정우담이라면 무던하게 잘 견디리란 믿음이 있었다. 비행시간을 계산한 이규성이 대답했다. “한국 와서 곧장 녹화하러 가면 지각도 안 할 겁니다. 대신, 가요제 곡이 그 전에 나와 있어야겠네요.” “오늘 집에 가서 완성하겠습니다.” 이젠 그의 작업 속도에 면역이 생길 법한데, 이게 면역이 되는 종류의 재능은 아닌지라 헛웃음만 났다. “역시 대단하십니다. 리우 씨 콜라보 작업은 잠시 미뤄야겠죠?” “그것도.” “···일본 가기 전에 나올 것 같습니까?” “과장님이 작업실 오시기 전에 거의 다 끝난 상태였어서, 오늘 집에 가거든 가요제 곡이랑 같이 마무리하려고요.” 협동 작업으로 해야 할 건 다 했으니, 남은 건 열매와 아이템을 이용해 최종본으로 완성하는 것뿐이다. 거기까지 대화한 뒤, 연습실에 입장했다. 그러자 여자 연습생들 십수 명이 큰소리로 외친다. 연습생은 더 있지만, 댄스 퍼포먼스 걸그룹과 솔로 지망에 의지가 확고한 사람들은 빠졌다. “안녕하십니까!” “안녕하세요. 최근에 단체로 연습한 노래 뭐 있어요?” 연습생들이 손가락을 접어가며 대답했다. 아델, 앤 마리, 아리아나 그란데, 서지안 노래들이었다. 그중 자신 있는 걸 한 명씩 부르게 하려는데. 왜인지 최봄이의 컨디션이 60%로 올라 있었고, 그제야 정우담도 솔루션 뒤로 가기가 뭔지 이해를 했다. 말 그대로 뒤로 가란 뜻이었다. ‘그런 거였어?’ 연습생들에게 강조되는 것 또 한 가지. 바로 이성과의 거리감이다. 모든 팬이 그렇다고 볼 수는 없지만, 연예인의 과거 열애가 알려졌을 때 덕질을 관두는 팬도 있다. 팬덤형 마케팅을 하는 기획사들은 특히나 학창 시절 관리가 엄격하다. 연습생들도 남녀면 서로 못 마주치게 한다. ‘최봄이는 누구보다 회사의 지시를 잘 따르는 거야.’ 정우담과 나이 차가 10살이나 나는데도, 최봄이만큼 컨디션이 왕창 오르내리는 연습생은 없었다. 학교 친구들이건, 선배님이건 직원이건 할 것 없이 거리감을 지키려는 것이다. ‘데뷔를 향한 열망.’ 멤버들보다 한참 어려 데뷔조에 넣길 보류했었는데, 정우담은 오로지 실력으로만 평가하기로 했다. 최봄이로 확정됐다는 것도 아니다. 다른 연습생들도 세세하게 볼 것이다. 게다가 사기적인 귀를 갖게 된 우담이니 저번처럼 1분씩 시간을 주고 끝내기보단, 피드백을 해줘 다른 기회를 잡을 수 있도록. 자신이 도움이 된다면 돕고자 했다. 우담은 이규성에게 질문했다. “옥상 써도 돼요?” “원래도 임직원들이 하늘 정원으로 이용하고 있어서 상관없지만, 설마 거기서 평가하시게요?” “실내에서 소리는 부딪치고 반사되잖아요. 제일 넓은 댄스룸이긴 해도, 음방 무대에 비할 수준도 아니니. 확 트인 장소에서 듣고 싶습니다.” “알겠습니다. 가시죠.” 이규성의 눈이 휘었다. 어느 기획사도 소극장에서 연습생 쇼케이스를 하지만, 단언컨대 1~2곳 빼면 모든 기획사 평가가 실내를 벗어나지 않을 것이다. ‘우담 씨는 역시 일반적이지 않아.’ 그의 셀프 프로듀싱 능력을 맹신해도 그룹 프로듀서는 별개. 그래서 걱정하는 직원들도 간혹 있지만, 이규성은 전혀 문제없겠다고 판단했다. 보컬 그룹이 더욱 기대되기도 했다. ‘과연 어떤 팀이 탄생할지.’ 하지만 둘이 무슨 대화를 나누는지 모르는 연습생들은 고개만 갸웃거렸고, 우담이 연습실 문을 열고 나가자 화들짝 놀라고 말았다. “아무도 안 뽑으시려고?” “···보여드린 게 없는데 왜?” “우리 뭐 실수했어?” 놀라게 한 것 같아 우담은 황급히 설명했다. “옥상으로 갑니다. 외투 챙겨 오세요.” * 휘이잉. 4월 중반이어도 쌀쌀한 날씨. 그러나 불평불만을 하는 사람은 없다. 데뷔하면 비 맞으면서도 무대를 하고, 칼바람에 덜덜 떨기도, 무더위에 녹아내릴 것 같아도 노래를 해야 한다. 예행연습으로 여길 따름이었다. 나름 재밌기도 했다. “아래쪽 갈비뼈가 괴로울 만큼! 압박을 줘서 불러봐요!” 옥상 저 끝에서, 이쪽 끝까지 또렷하게 들리는 정우담의 발성. 지적받은 연습생은 하마터면 웃을 뻔했지만. “다시 불러보겠습니다!” 팝을 이렇게 쥐어짜듯이 불러본 적이 없었다. 코인 노래방에서도, 월말평가에서도 말이다. 항상 어딘가 답답함이 있었는데, 가슴 속에서 불을 지핀 폭탄을 저 멀리 던지는 것처럼 홀가분하기까지 했다. “I met him on Sunday morning.” “좋아요! 기교 신경 쓰면 발성이 눌리니까 소리를 내는 데만 집중해요!” 한 명 한 명 필요한 코칭을 해주고 있다. 파일철을 들고 따라온 신인개발팀도 혀를 내두르며 이규성에게 물었다. “다빈이한테 레슨 잘해주신단 얘기 듣긴 했지만, 저희도 뭘 놓치고 있었는지 이제야 알아차릴 만큼 정확해요.” 정우담이 싱어송라이터가 안 됐어도, 언젠간 레슨만으로 아카데미 차릴 수도 있겠단 생각마저 든다. 그런데도 한 명씩 빠르게 지나간다. 연습생들 감기 걸리지 않게 1시간 안엔 끝내겠다는 듯이. 쌀쌀해도 얼어 죽을 정도는 아니고, 롱패딩에 핫팩까지 챙겨 걱정 안 해도 되는데. 정작 정우담이 제일 추워 보였다. 마침 순서가 된 최봄이는 정우담이 빨리 실내로 들어갈 수 있게, 어드바이스해주는 시간조차 아끼게끔 최선을 다했다. 더구나 정우담과 거리가 멀어 컨디션도 90%로 회복됐다. “준비되면 불러요!” 휘이잉. 바람에 일자로 자른 앞머리가 이마를 간지럽혀도, 최봄이는 흔들림 없는 자세로. 어떻게 저 뻣뻣한 자세에서 소리를 끌어올리는지 의문이 들 만큼, 쩌렁쩌렁 울려 퍼지게 불렀다. “I'd say winter is gone.” “아직 주저하고 있어요!” “Rather than.” “더!” “Spring has come!” 서지안의 <Winter is gone>이 선곡이었고, 곡 중 서지안이 내는 하이노트와 동일한 3옥타브 파#이 최봄이에게서 터져 나왔다. 여자들이 기본적으로 음역대가 높다고 해도 쉽지 않은 고음이다. 덕분에 옥상 아래. 사옥 주변을 지나가던 행인들이 고개를 든다. “서지안?” “목소리가 약간 다른데?” 더불어 신인개발팀도. “걸그룹 리드보컬 후보였던 봄이인데.” “메인보컬 시켜줄 테니까 우담 씨 보컬 그룹에 지원하지 말라고 할 걸 그랬나?” 실시간으로 득음을 지켜봤다. 보컬 그룹의 추가 멤버를 뽑는 평가였지만, 모두 배워가는 게 있었으니 아쉬워도 진심으로 호명된 연습생을 축하해주기로 했다. 이미 실내로 들어온 후였다. “최봄이 씨, 내일부터 채윤 씨 다빈 씨와 트레이닝 시작할 수 있겠어요?” 정우담이 다가가면 10%씩 떨어지던 컨디션이 5%씩 떨어지는 걸로 바뀌었다. 최봄이는 눈물, 콧물을 손등으로 훔쳤다. “하, 할 수 이쭘다.” * 리우와 마저 작업하고, 사옥을 떠나려는 정우담에게 이규성이 작은 상자를 내밀었다. 검수가 끝났다던 팬레터였다. “양이 많지는 않습니다. 50통 정도예요. 대체로 팬카페에 쓰니까요. 우담 씨도 팬카페 보시죠?” “저 근데 정회원 등업이 안 돼서.” “···닉네임 정우담 아니세요? 해드렸는데?” “누가 먼저 하셨는지, 중복 닉네임이라고 해서 전 정우담3이에요. 2도 있어서.” “이런. 그분한테 닉네임 변경해달라고 연락해보겠습니다.” 우담은 팬레터 상자를 들고 숙소로 왔다. ‘과장님이 소통 어플도 생각해보라고 하셨지?’ 워낙 할 게 많아 팬들에게 자주 답장을 보낼 수 있을진 모르겠다. “형 왔다.” 오자마자 곰돌이들에게 인사하기. 나무 가방 반대편엔 아이템이 1개 전송돼 있었고, 곰돌이들은 드럼통을 잘라 만든 미끄럼틀을 타던 중이었다. -우웅! 미끄럼틀 각도가 90도까진 아니어도 70도는 돼 보인다. ‘이건 타는 게 아니라 떨어지는 거 아냐?’ 밑에 마른 볏짚을 잔뜩 깔아뒀지만, 내려올 때마다 퍽! 퍽! 소리가 난다. 그런데도 재밌다고 내려오자마자 바로 줄을 선다. 한쪽엔 구름사다리까지 만들어놨다. “이러다 나중엔 테마파크 되겠다.” 하지만 당분간은 힘들 듯하다. 철근을 다 썼다. 그때. -핫두핫두. 3웅이가 복귀하며 아이템을 하나 더 제단에 올렸다. 오늘 2개나 구해왔단 것이다. “겨울에도 멈추지 않는 탐색. 쉬엄쉬엄해.” 눈이 제법 녹아 스키는 타지 않지만, 탐색 스틱은 하나만 들고 다니는 3웅이었다. 한 손엔 횃불을 들어야 했기 때문이다. 오늘도 곰돌이들에게 감사를 전하며, 우담은 아이템들을 살폈다. [청취 선호도 조사의 귀미테 / 고급] -부착 시 고등학생 남성의 평균 귀를 갖게 된다 -4매 / 부착한 시점부터 2시간 지속 -유효 기한 1달 예전에 나온 것과 성별만 다른 귀미테였다. ‘여고생 귀미테에 이어 남고생?’ 군인과 여고생 귀미테는 진즉에 다 썼다. 현재 초통령 귀미테만 한 장 남아 있다. 그런데 남고생들이 선호할 음악은 어떤 건지. ‘난 그때 밴드를 했었으니까.’ 모던락, 하드락, 브릿팝에 빠져 있었다. 그리고 우담의 음원 중 <Go>가 남학생들에게 반응이 좋다고 MNS 엔터에서 들었는데, 역시 고음을 터뜨려주는 노래가 좋을지 모른다. 또 다른 아이템은. [0.4mL 인공 눈물 / 레어] -저글링 나무의 등급이 한 단계 상승한다 -일회용 30분 / 유효기한 2주 인공 눈물로 프로듀싱을 일시적으로 S등급으로 만들어 효과를 톡톡히 봤었는데. ‘저글링이라니.’ 나무가 심어져 있는 것도 아니고, 펭귄들이 주고 간 아이템만 있을 뿐이다. 그것도 한 단계 등급 업 아이템인데 인공 눈물까지 쓰면 공 4개를 돌리는 건 무리도 아니겠다. “근데 이걸 어디에.” 쓰냐고. 그래도 3웅이 횃불까지 들고 구해온 아이템이니 불평을 늘어놔선 안 된다. 오늘은 수고비도 줄 수 있었다. ‘회사에선 내년 5월 종합소득세 얘길 했었지만.’ 아마 세금이 장난 아닐 테니 항상 일정량은 세이브해두라고 들었다. 하지만 종합소득세는 할부 납부가 가능한 데다가 내년 새해부터 모아도 충분할 거라 판단하며, 오늘 입금된 <하모하모> 라이센스비 2천만 원을 전부 나무 가방에 넣었다. -샘플링(B) 나무에 영양제를 공급하겠습니까? -리듬&소울(B) 나무에 영양제를 공급하겠습니까? “응.” 금화 2닢이다. 다음 방문 상단이 올 때도 곰돌이들은 식량과 철근을 살 수 있을 것이다. 쑤우욱. 카우보이 6웅이와 공대생 5웅이가 앰플을 꽂자, 울창해지는 두 나무에 다른 곰돌이들도 노는 걸 멈추고 지켜본다. -오. 산소는 풍부하겠다. 그리고 이제 우담도 리우의 콜라보 곡과 가요제 곡을 완성할 수 있겠다. 그래서 열매를 먹으려다가. 팬레터가 눈에 들어왔다. “읽고 작업 시작할까? 얘들아, 형 팬레터 받았어.” 곰돌이들에게 자랑하고 알록달록한 색상의 편지봉투에서 한 장, 두 장씩 꺼내 읽었다.","output":"< Fan > 'Real-life Woo-daming, the impact is tremendous...' Choi Bom-i was not a child who acted recklessly even when her mind was noisy. She just stood still, taking in Jeong Woo-dam with her eyes. However, Jeong Woo-dam was wondering if Choi Bom-i's condition was falling because she was unwell. -Condition: 60% -Solution: Go back 'Go back?' It couldn't mean the backspace button on the keyboard. Choi Bom-i had to enter the practice room soon, but Jeong Woo-dam was closer to the practice room door, so she pressed her back against the corridor wall. She sidestepped along the wall, moving sideways. Jeong Woo-dam couldn't take his eyes off her, wondering what she was doing, and when the distance between them narrowed to about 1 meter. -Condition: 50% He doubted his eyes. 'It's worse than when I saw her last time?' When they first met in the practice room to select the debut group of a vocal group, her condition was at least 60%. Back then, the distance was farther than now. On the contrary, Choi Bom-i managed to pass by Jeong Woo-dam and lifted one corner of her mouth. Smirk. '...What's with her?' As Choi Bom-i was about to dash into the practice room, Lee Gyu-sung spoke to her. \\"Miss Choi Bom-i, what does MNS Entertainment stand for?\\" \\"Yes, manners. Hello, senior Jeong Woo-dam, Manager Lee Gyu-sung.\\" \\"Hello, Miss Choi Bom-i.\\" Jeong Woo-dam greeted her belatedly. 'Woah, Woo-daming knows my name.' MNS Entertainment emphasizes that trainees should be bright and polite. It makes things easier after debut. Not all trainees will succeed in debuting, but it should become a habit. It's not only important in the entertainment industry but also essential when entering society. Thanks to that, Choi Bom-i's face turned red and she disappeared into the practice room. \\"She must think she got scolded.\\" \\"Still, it can't be helped. If she debuts, she'll have to become even more of a greeting machine.\\" Jeong Woo-dam knew it too. During a week of music broadcasts, exactly six days, he would greet everyone in the broadcast station corridors with a single step. Fellow singers, broadcast staff, and even people he didn't recognize, he bowed his upper body whenever he made eye contact. Even if it was the second time seeing someone that day. Even if he thought he didn't have to do it because he already greeted them, he reflexively greeted back when they greeted him first. 'I shouldn't let my guard down just because it's the company building.' Children are said to be the mirror of adults. Even though Woo-dam is just a management agent, he decided to try to be a role model for the trainees. His self-awareness as a singer grows day by day. And before entering the practice room, he heard the details about his first event. \\"We invited Woo-dam urgently, so the event is right around the corner. It might be a burdensome schedule. But.\\" Lee Gyu-sung spoke in a lowered voice, even though there was no one in the corridor to hear, because it was about money. \\"The pay is good. It's this Saturday and Sunday from 10 AM to 2 PM, and you'll get 8 million won for performing three songs. They'll cover the flight and hotel too.\\" \\"Wow, and they still pay 800 for just two days?\\" Jeong Woo-dam was surprised that he could earn this much from an event with just free music releases. Free music releases are not charity. Mrsquid agreed to deposit the video income quarterly if there's any. However, YouTube earnings are lower if the video length is short. Still, Woo-dam's Kawaii Bass videos are getting a decent number of views, and he didn't expect to generate additional income from something he made just for a change of pace. Lee Gyu-sung shook his head. \\"It's 800 per day. Event fees soar when you take a flight.\\" \\"...Per day?\\" \\"It's considered major in the subculture scene, but it's not a popular event like an EDM festival.\\" It's not set high. He says it's beyond imagination how much EDM and electronic DJs earn. For Woo-dam, who has a goal of saving up 100 million won, there was no reason to refuse. He was just curious. \\"But the event is during the day?\\" Festivals are usually in the late afternoon or at night. \\"It's not that other festivals are unhealthy, but the Kawaii Festival is apparently very wholesome.\\" \\"Ah, if it's a course where I return home right after the event, that's fine with me.\\" \\"Right. You have a shoot for Shinju-nol on Sunday.\\" He had already received a mission to complete a song from the composers, and he would give a sneak peek in the studio that day and pair up. 'It's an opportunity for Woo-dam's broadcast recognition to rise.' Of course, the song festival is still a competition. Lee Gyu-sung knew that invisible tension unfolds when composers gather, but he believed that Jeong Woo-dam would endure it calmly. Calculating the flight time, Lee Gyu-sung answered. \\"If you come to Korea and go straight to recording, you won't be late. But, the song festival piece should be out before that.\\" \\"I'll finish it when I get home today.\\" He should have developed immunity to his work speed by now, but it's not the kind of talent that builds immunity, so he could only chuckle. \\"As expected, you're amazing. Will you have to postpone the collaboration with Rio?\\" \\"That too.\\" \\"...Do you think it will be out before you go to Japan?\\" \\"It was almost finished before you came to the studio, so I'm going to finish it along with the song festival piece when I get home.\\" He had done all the collaborative work, so what was left was to use the fruits and items to complete the final version. After that conversation, they entered the practice room. Then, a dozen female trainees shouted loudly. There were more trainees, but those who were determined to be solo or part of a dance performance girl group were absent. \\"Good morning!\\" \\"Hello. What's the latest group song you've practiced?\\" The trainees counted on their fingers and answered. Songs by Adele, Anne-Marie, Ariana Grande, and Seo Ji-an. He was about to have each of them sing what they were confident in. For some reason, Choi Bom-i's condition had risen to 60%, and only then did Jeong Woo-dam understand what the solution \\"Go back\\" meant. It literally meant to go back. 'Is that what it was?' Another thing emphasized to trainees. It's about maintaining a distance from the opposite sex. Not all fans are like this, but some fans stop being fans when they learn about a celebrity's past romance. Agencies that do fandom marketing are especially strict about management during school days. They even prevent male and female trainees from meeting each other. 'Choi Bom-i follows the company's instructions better than anyone.' Despite being 10 years younger than Jeong Woo-dam, no other trainee's condition fluctuates as much as Choi Bom-i's. Whether it's school friends, seniors, or employees, she tries to maintain a distance. 'The desire for debut.' She was held back from joining the debut group because she was much younger than the other members, but Jeong Woo-dam decided to judge solely based on talent. It's not confirmed to be Choi Bom-i. He will look closely at other trainees as well. Moreover, now that Woo-dam has acquired a deceptive ear, instead of giving them 1 minute each like last time, he planned to give feedback so they could have another chance. He wanted to help if he could. Woo-dam asked Lee Gyu-sung. \\"Can I use the rooftop?\\" \\"It's already being used by employees as a sky garden, so it's fine, but are you planning to evaluate there?\\" \\"The sound bounces and reflects indoors. Even though it's the largest dance room, it's not comparable to a music show stage. I want to listen in an open space.\\" \\"Understood. Let's go.\\" Lee Gyu-sung's eyes widened. While all agencies hold trainee showcases in small theaters, he was certain that except for one or two, all agency evaluations do not go outside. 'Woo-dam is certainly not typical.' He had complete faith in his self-producing ability, but being a group producer was different. That's why some employees were worried, but Lee Gyu-sung judged there would be no problem. He was also looking forward to the vocal group. 'I wonder what kind of team will be born.' But the trainees, unaware of the conversation between the two, just tilted their heads, and when Woo-dam left the practice room, they were startled. \\"Is he not choosing anyone?\\" \\"...Why? We didn't show anything.\\" \\"Did we make a mistake?\\" Feeling like he had startled them, Woo-dam quickly explained. \\"We're going to the rooftop. Bring your coats.\\" * Whooosh. Mid-April, but the weather was chilly. However, no one complained. If they debut, they'll have to perform on stage even in the rain, shiver in the cold wind, and sing even if they feel like melting in the heat. They considered it a rehearsal. It was somewhat fun. \\"Sing as if your lower ribs are in agony! Put pressure on it!\\" From one end of the rooftop to the other, Jeong Woo-dam's clear vocalization. The trainee who was pointed out almost laughed but... \\"I'll sing again!\\" She had never sung pop music like this, squeezing it out. Not in a coin karaoke room, not in a monthly evaluation. There was always a sense of suffocation, but now it felt liberating, like throwing a lit bomb far away from her chest. \\"I met him on Sunday morning.\\" \\"Good! If you focus on techniques, your vocalization will be suppressed, so just concentrate on producing the sound!\\" He was giving each person the coaching they needed. The rookie development team, following with a binder, was impressed and asked Lee Gyu-sung. \\"I heard that he taught Dabin well, but now I realize what we've been missing. It's so precise.\\" Even if Jeong Woo-dam hadn't become a singer-songwriter, he might have been able to open an academy just for lessons someday. Yet, he quickly moved on from one person to the next. As if to finish within an hour so the trainees wouldn't catch a cold. It wasn't cold enough to freeze to death, and they were prepared with long padding and hot packs, so there was no need to worry. But Jeong Woo-dam looked the coldest. Choi Bom-i, whose turn had come, did her best to save time on advice from Jeong Woo-dam so he could go inside quickly. Moreover, her condition recovered to 90% as the distance from Jeong Woo-dam increased. \\"Sing when you're ready!\\" Whooosh. Even if the wind tickled her forehead with her straight-cut bangs, Choi Bom-i stood firm without wavering. She sang with a voice that resonated loudly, as if it was questionable how she could produce sound from such a stiff posture. \\"I'd say winter is gone.\\" \\"You're still hesitating!\\" \\"Rather than.\\" \\"More!\\" \\"Spring has come!\\" Seo Ji-an's <Winter is gone> was the chosen song, and the high note of F# in the third octave that Seo Ji-an hits in the song burst out from Choi Bom-i. It's a high note that's not easy to hit, even though women generally have a higher vocal range. Thanks to that, below the rooftop. Pedestrians passing by the company building looked up. \\"Seo Ji-an?\\" \\"The voice is slightly different?\\" And the rookie development team as well. \\"Bom-i was a candidate for the lead vocal of the girl group.\\" \\"Should I have told her not to apply for Woo-dam's vocal group and promised her the main vocal?\\" They witnessed the real-time vocal breakthrough. Although it was an evaluation to select additional members for the vocal group, everyone learned something, so they sincerely decided to congratulate the trainee who was called. It was after they had already gone inside. \\"Miss Choi Bom-i, can you start training with Miss Chae-yoon and Dabin from tomorrow?\\" Jeong Woo-dam's condition, which used to drop by 10% when he approached, now changed to dropping by 5%. Choi Bom-i wiped her tears and runny nose with the back of her hand. \\"I, I can do it.\\" * After finishing the work with Rio and about to leave the company, Lee Gyu-sung handed Jeong Woo-dam a small box. It was the fan letters that had been checked. \\"There aren't many. About 50 letters. Mostly, they write on the fan cafe. You check the fan cafe too, right?\\" \\"I actually haven't been promoted to a regular member.\\" \\"...Isn't your nickname Jeong Woo-dam? I did it for you.\\" \\"Someone did it before me, so it said the nickname was duplicated. I'm Jeong Woo-dam3. There's also a 2.\\" \\"Oh, my. I'll contact that person to change their nickname.\\" Woo-dam took the box of fan letters and went to his dorm. 'The manager mentioned considering a communication app, right?' With so much to do, he wasn't sure if he could frequently reply to fans. \\"Hyung is back.\\" Greeting the teddy bears as soon as he arrived. On the other side of the wooden bag, an item had been transferred, and the teddy bears were sliding down a slide made from a cut drum barrel. -Woong! The angle of the slide wasn't 90 degrees, but it looked about 70 degrees. 'Isn't this falling, not sliding?' There was plenty of dry straw at the bottom, but every time they came down, there was a thud! thud! sound. Yet, they lined up right after coming down, saying it was fun. On one side, they even made a cloud ladder. \\"This will become a theme park at this rate.\\" But it seemed difficult for the time being. They had used up all the rebar. Then. -Hotduhotdu. 3woong returned and placed another item on the altar. He had found two items today. \\"Exploration doesn't stop even in winter. Take it easy.\\" 3woong didn't ski much since the snow had melted, but he carried only one exploration stick. He had to hold a torch in one hand. Today, too, Woo-dam thanked the teddy bears and examined the items. [Ear Sticker of Teenage Male Preference Survey / High Quality] -When attached, you gain the average ears of a high school boy -4 pieces / Lasts for 2 hours from the moment of attachment -Expires in 1 month It was an ear sticker, just like the previous one, but for a different gender. 'After the high school girl's ear sticker, now a high school boy's?' The soldier and high school girl ear stickers were used up long ago. Currently, only one \\"Child President\\" ear sticker remains. But what kind of music would high school boys prefer? 'I was in a band back then.' He was into modern rock, hard rock, and Britpop. And among Woo-dam's music, <Go> was well-received by male students, according to MNS Entertainment. Perhaps a song that hits high notes might be good. The other item was. [0.4mL Artificial Tears / Rare] -The grade of the juggling tree goes up by one level -Single-use for 30 minutes / Expires in 2 weeks He had temporarily made his producing S-grade with artificial tears before and saw great effects. 'Juggling?' There wasn't even a tree planted, and there were only items given by the penguins. And those were also grade-up items, but with artificial tears, juggling four balls wouldn't be too much. \\"But where to use this...\\" He thought. But since 3woong had gone through the trouble of bringing it back with a torch, he shouldn't complain. Today, he could also give them a bonus. 'The company talked about comprehensive income tax next May.' The tax will probably be no joke, so he was told to always save a certain amount. However, comprehensive income tax can be paid in installments, and he judged that saving from the new year would be enough, so he put all of the 20 million won license fee for <Hamohamo> that was deposited today into the wooden bag. -Do you want to supply nutrients to the Sampling(B) tree? -Do you want to supply nutrients to the Rhythm & Soul(B) tree? \\"Yes.\\" It's two gold coins. The teddy bears will be able to buy food and rebar when the next merchant ship arrives. Swoosh. As Cowboy 6woong and Engineering Student 5woong inserted the ampoules, the other teddy bears stopped playing and watched the two trees grow lush. -Oh. There would be plenty of oxygen. And now Woo-dam could also finish the collaboration song with Rio and the song festival piece. So he was about to eat the fruit when... He noticed the fan letters. \\"Should I read them and start working? Guys, hyung received fan letters.\\" He bragged to the teddy bears and read one by one from the colorful envelopes."},{"instruction":"< 라이브 > 연예인은 소득이 매우 불안정한 직업이다. 그러니 월급제는 연예인의 안정적인 생활을 보장한다는 뜻. 게다가 5대 에이전시 중 하나인 이곳에서 계약 제안을 받으면 기뻐서 우는 사람도 적지 않다. 배우 출신의 부사장은 사람 좋은 미소를 지으며, 통역가를 거쳐 설명했다. “회사원이 아닌, 스포츠 선수와 비슷하다고 보시면 됩니다. 재계약 시즌엔 연봉과 인센티브도 조율돼요.” MNS 엔터 전무는 일본의 많은 소속사가 월급제라는 걸 알아도, 한국 연예인들이 진출했을 땐 한국과 다를 바 없는 정산이 적용돼 이런 제안은 처음이었다. 그래도 스포츠 선수를 비유해 이해가 빨랐다. 전담팀에도 일본어를 할 줄 아는 직원이 있었고, 전무는 그를 통해 물었다. “재계약 기간은요?” “우담 씨에 한해선 2년으로 하겠습니다. 그 밖에 저흰 CF 개런티는 전액 아티스트에게 제공하고, 무엇보다 싱어송라이터 수입의 꽃은 콘서트와 음반이지 않습니까?” 정우담은 월급제에도 혹하긴 했었다. ‘일본 활동을 안 해도 돈이 나온다고?’ 더구나 한국처럼 저작권은 온전히 창작자 몫. 하지만 에이전시 측의 말대로 콘서트와 음반 정산비에 따라 손을 잡을지, 말지 결정 날 것이다. MNS 엔터와 정우담은 공연 지향형 아티스트를 목표로 하고 있으니 말이다. 계속해서 통역가가 부사장의 얘길 전달한다. “제작, 유통, 대관, 인건비, 프로모션 등 뺄 거 다 빼고, 총매출에서 10~20%가 남는데 거기서 우담 씨가 4할을 갖는다고 생각하시면 돼요.” 그 4할을 MNS 엔터와 정우담이 나눈다. 전무가 실례하겠다고 말하곤 정우담과 조용히 대화를 나눴다. “아무래도 월급제를 걸어서 비율은 다른 한국 아티스트들에 비해 낮아요. 그래도 우담 씨한테 가는 몫은 동일합니다.” 만약 10%의 수익이 남는 콘서트라면 정우담은 3%. MNS 엔터와 2.5대7.5의 정산비로 계약이 돼 있기 때문이다. “저는 같아도, 거기에 월급까지 받게 된다지만, MNS 엔터 입장에선 손해 아니에요?” “저흰 신경 쓰지 마시고 우담 씨한테 유리한 쪽을 택하면 됩니다. 그리고 티켓 가격은 일본이 한국보단 낮은데, 대신 잦은 공연이 가능합니다.” 케이팝 아티스트들이 일본에 진출하는 이유. 대략 티켓 11만 원에 홀이든 아레나든 2만 명을 동원한다 치면. “우담 씨에겐 6,600만 원이 정산되고, 굿즈도 그만큼 나오거나 더 나오고요.” 굿즈는 마진도 높은데 요샌 굿즈 때문에 콘서트를 해도 과언이 아니라고 한다. 즉 언젠가 우담이 투어를 돌고 2만 명이 보러오면 1억3,200만 원. ‘···1억?’ 우담으로선 그것만으로도 놀라웠는데, 전무는 대수롭지 않다는 듯 말을 이었다. “어디까지나 계산하기 쉽게 2만 명으로 예를 든 거예요. 본격적으로 투어를 해야겠다고 할 때가 오면 그보단 몇 배는 동원되겠죠.” 우담 역시 아직 투어를 돌 만한 인지도가 아니란 걸 알기에, 놀란 마음을 빠르게 진정시켰다. 냉철하게 비교하기로 했다. 다시 미팅 모드가 되니, 드디어 부사장이 월급이 얼마인지 알려준다. “80만 엔 어떠십니까?” 연봉 9,600만 원. 또한 자신들의 손을 잡으면 못 나가는 방송이 없다는 이야길 덧붙였다. “저희는 우담 씨라는 브랜드를 확보하고 확장시켜가고 싶습니다.” 그 포부 넘치는 발언에, MNS 엔터 생각 말고 우담에게 이득이 되는 길을 고르라던 전무는 헛웃음을 흘리고 말았다. “우담 씨가 1억 벌기까지 걸린 시간이 두 달이에요.” “하잇?” 한국 연예계 소식에 밝은 에이전시지만, 그의 소득까지 알 겨를은 없었으니 당황했다. 이후 전무가 협상을 시도해도. “이것도 파격적인 제안입니다. 저희와 계약하는 신인의 두 배입니다.” 그러면서 일본 최정상급 배우의 연봉이 50억 원이니, 당장은 만족스럽지 못하더라도 20년 안에 우담도 그렇게 되게끔 최선을 다해 돕겠다고 말했다. “아무리 그래도 월 800만 원은.” “천만 원에 맞춰드리겠습니다.” 승부수라는 듯 자신만만한 표정의 부사장. 전무는 그런 부사장에게 악수를 청했다. “한국 돌아가서 마저 상의해보고 연락드리겠습니다.” “좋은 답변 기다리겠습니다.” 이후 부사장은 정우담과도 악수를 나눴다. “함께 멋진 미래를 그려갑시다.” “오하요우 고자이마스.” 우담은 배운 인사말로 작별을 하지만, 그건 만났을 때나 하는 인사. 빵 터진 부사장은 조짐이 좋은지 웃으며 떠났다. 전무는 슬슬 식당으로 이동하자며 외투를 걸쳤다. “대형 에이전시래서 기대했더니 더럽게 짜네. 공연 정산비를 깎았으면 월급을 아쉽지 않게 줘야지.” 설마 천만 원으로 생색낼 줄이야. 일본 활동을 안 해도 월급이 입금된다지만, 국가는 달라도 이들 모두 연예계 종사자들이다. 우담을 엄청나게 굴릴 거라는 걸 바보가 아닌 이상 모를 수가 없다. “우담 씨, 결과적으로 공연을 돌면 돌수록 저희보다 저 에이전시만 이득이 돼요. 만약 우담 씨가 그래도 월급제를 선호하신다면.” “미나미 씨네 대표님 만나보고 정하겠습니다.” “잘 생각하셨어요.” 공연 전에 가벼운 미팅은 했어도 상세한 비율 이야기는 오가지 않았었다. 이따가 밥 먹으면서 하자길래. 데려가고 싶은 맛집이 있다면서 말이다. 그리고 대관한 미니 버스를 타고 간 곳은 브레이크 타임 팻말이 걸린 초밥집. “제대로 온 거 맞아?” 전무가 주변의 다른 가게는 아닐지 두리번거렸다. 실장은 재차 폰을 확인하며 맞다고 대답했는데, 곧 식당 문이 열리며 세타 프로덕션의 대표가 나왔다. “이럇샤이마세!” “깜짝이야, 가게 직원분인 줄.” 알고 보니 세타 프로덕션의 대표가 개인적으로 아는 미슐랭 식당이었고, 미리 브레이크 타임에 이용할 수 있게 부탁해놓았다고 한다. “준비 많이 해주셨는데?” “그러게요.” 대표에게 안내받으며 룸으로 들어갔다. 룸 안에는 대표가 급히 섭외한 통역가 한 명뿐이었다. 미나미는 사석에서까지 정우담을 만날 순 없어 공연 전에 챌린지만 찍고 갔다. 식사가 깔리고, 세타 프로 대표가 운을 뗐다. “저흰 한국 아티스트들이 주로 계약하는 대형 에이전시가 아닙니다. 월급제도 아닙니다. 하지만 한 가지 약속해드릴 수 있는 건.” “네?” “대형이 아니어도 영업력에서 뒤처지지 않고, 정산도 자국 아티스트와 같게 해드리겠습니다. 공연은 아티스트가 하는 거지, 저희가 하는 게 아니니까요.” 세타 프로는 이제껏 케이팝 아티스트의 매니지먼트를 담당한 적이 없었다. 미나미로 인해 정우담과의 만남이 성사되지 않았다면 앞으로도 그랬을 것이다. 하도 한국에 천재 싱어송라이터가 등장했다고 떠들어대서, 처음으로 한국어 계약서를 자문받아 제작해왔다. 그가 계약서를 내밀었다. “저는 6대4가 맞다고 생각합니다. 당연히 우담 씨 측이 6이에요. 그리고 전 좌석 매진이라면 개런티를 추가로 더 드리고요.” 정우담은 이게 얼마나 전례에 없던 일인지 몰랐다. 신인이니까. 반면 잘 아는 전담팀은 하마터면 밥풀이 코로 나올 뻔했다. 비즈니스 미팅이라 내색을 할 수 없어 간신히 놀란 척 안 하고 있었다. ‘···6대4?’ ‘케이팝 아이돌들 다 5대5인데?’ ‘아니, 세타 프로 몰라도 너무 모르는 거 아니야? 이거 계약해도 되는 거 맞아?’ 전무가 정우담에게 귓속말을 했다. “안정적인 건 월급제가 맞아요. 하지만 이건, 오히려 MNS 엔터 측이 미안해지고 마는 비율입니다.” “미안하시면, 낮춰달라고 할까요?” “허허, 농담도. 어쨌든 세타 프로도 조사해볼 거 다 조사해보고 내린 판단이겠죠. 이렇게 서로가 만족할 수 있는 거래는 드뭅니다.” 콘서트 수익을 매출 대비 10%로 가정할 시, 정우담에게 4.5%가 주어진다. 대형 에이전시와 비교해 1.5% 높다. 이렇듯, 해외 계약은 1%에 좌지우지된다. 그에 정우담은 전무에게 물었고. “저나 MNS 엔터나 세타 프로와 하는 게 좋다는 말씀이시죠?” “무조건이요.” “하겠습니다. 언제 일본 활동을 시작할진 몰라도요.” 전무는 멀진 않을 거라고 생각했다. * 계약서는 한국에 돌아가 검토하고 작성하기로 했다. 비즈니스가 원래 그렇다. 즉석에서 좋다고 방방 뛰어선 안 된다. 하지만 전담팀은 세타 프로와 헤어지고, 호텔로 복귀해 방방 뛰다가 휴가를 즐기러 나갔다. “저랑 우담 씨는 내일 귀국하지만, 전무님이랑 직원들은 휴가 만끽하라고 해야죠.” 우담도 처음 온 일본이라 좀 돌아다니려 했는데, 공연 때문에 왔으니 내일 컨디션을 위해 쉬기로 했다. 그러자 실장이 함께 한국의 주말 예능 ‘신은 주사위 놀이를 한다’, 줄여서 신주놀을 시청하자며 맥주를 들고 찾아왔다. “실장님은 외출 안 하세요?” “전 지안이 매니저 할 때 질리게 와봤어요. 미슐랭 초밥도 사실, 한국이랑 별 차이를 못 느끼겠고.” “저도요. 마트 초밥이랑 비슷하던데.” “그건 좀.” 그러다 실장은 진지한 이야기를 꺼냈다. “전무님은 우담 씨 다음 앨범에 곡 수를 많이 넣고, 이번엔 기필코 1위를 시켜드리자 말씀하시더라고요.” “1위요?” 정우담도 컴백부턴 두 곡으로 활동할 예정이다. 선공개곡과 타이틀 혹은 타이틀과 후속곡. “꿈은 크게 갖자고 하는 말이 아니라, 수치상으로도 가능해 보이거든요. 우담 씨한테 다음에도 좋은 곡 부탁드린다고 부담 주는 말이 되겠지만.” “부담은 없습니다. 단지, 보니까 앨범 판매량이 중요해 보이길래요. 오, 시작한다.” 태블릿으로 봐야 했다. 그래도 재미는 느낄 수 있었다. 우담은 신주놀 가요제에 누가 섭외됐는지 들었지만, 영상으로 보니 내일이 기대되기도 했다. 귀국하자마자 신주놀 촬영장에 가기 때문이다. “와, 알고는 있었지만 진짜 라인업 장난 아닌데요?” “저분은 여태 방송 출연 다 거절하시다가 처음 나온다고 하니까요.” “제가 제일 새내기니까 예의 잘 차려야겠네요.” 모두 난다 긴다 하는 유명 프로듀서들. 그중엔 한 기획사의 수장까지 있었다. 신주놀 가요제 통틀어 역대급 라인업이었다. 그래서인지, 시청률이 뜨는 다음 날 오전. 인기 예능이어도 심야라 항상 시청률이 잘 나오긴 힘들고, 가요제도 너무 자주 한다는 이유로 지겹다고 말하는 네티즌들도 제법 있으나. 라인업이 라인업인지라 10%를 기록했다. 커뮤니티 반응도 뜨거웠다. -정우담 뭐냐ㄷㄷ -연출 아니고 찐임? 진짜로 저렇게 곡을 빨리 쓴다고? └놀랍게도 사실이라고 함 -기획사 대표님이 나오시는 건 반칙 아녀? -신주놀 이 갈았네ㅋ 라인업 뭐냐 어젠 출연자들이 원하는 곡을 작업실 찾아가 부탁하는 걸로 끝났다면, 다음 주엔 출연자들과 게스트들이 페어를 짜고 그다음 주엔 무대를 할 것이다. 하지만 가요제 에피소드의 첫 회가 화제를 모았으니, 신주놀 제작진은 한시름 덜 수 있었다. 신주놀 회의실에서 PD가 한숨을 내쉬었다. “휴, 한동안은 시청률 걱정 없겠네.” “가요제를 무사히 끝내야겠지만요.” AD의 말도 맞지만, 오랜 경험으로 알 수 있다. 이번 가요제는 분명 성황리에 종료할 것이다. 그러나 기뻐하는 신주놀 제작진과 반대로, 다른 방송사 예능팀은 죽을 맛이 됐다. 바로 다음 주 토요일 첫 방송을 앞둔 종편 채널의 오디션 프로그램 ‘싱포지엄’이었다. PD가 머리를 감싸 쥐었다. “신주놀 끗발 떨어지길래 편성을 토요일 같은 시간으로 잡았더니.” “떨어지고 있었어요. 이번에 회복한 거지.” 작가가 대답해줘도 PD의 인상이 펴지진 않았다. 어차피 다른 요일로 했어도 막강한 경쟁 프로그램은 있기 마련이라 별 다른 수도 없었다. 더구나 싱포지엄은 믿는 구석도 있었다. 그 믿는 구석이 까보니 별로라 돌아버릴 지경이었지만 말이다. “조소현 참가자 때문에 MNS 엔터랑 결별까지 하게 됐잖아!” 서지안, 정우담과 함께 고등학생 시절 밴드를 했었다는 참가자. 지원 메일을 보냈을 때도, 본선 참가를 결정지을 작가 미팅에 왔을 때도 분명 실력은 있었다. “뭐, 저희가 알았나요. 할 줄 아는 레퍼토리 빼면 습득력이 저렇게 느릴 줄을···.” 그게 문제다. 할 줄 아는 노래들을 부르고 기타를 치는 것 외엔, 습득이 말도 안 되게 늦다. 어디 경연 프로그램이 불러본 노래만 부르는 곳인가? 절대. 매주 새로운 곡을 연습하고 무대에 오른다. 조소현은 그걸 못한다. “홍보는 홍보대로 해놨건만, 우승 후보도 MNS 엔터에 뺏겨. 또 다른 우승 후보인 줄 알았던 조소현은 앵무새 수준. 근데 상부에선 얘라도 우승시키라고 LAR을 지시하지 않나.” LAR. 라이브 AR. 쉽게 말해 남들은 다 라이브를 하는 무대에서, 조소현만이라도 라이브처럼 녹음한 음원을 재생하란 것이다. 일단 화제성은 있는 참가자니까. 솔직히 상부에선 책임을 안 진다. 들통 났다간 PD가 모조리 뒤집어쓴다. “하, 미치겠네.” 싱포지엄 PD는 욕을 달고 살게 됐다. *** 정우담의 숙소. 우담은 일본에 가기 전 나무 가방을 침대 밑에 숨겨놓았다. 보안이 확실한 아파트라 걱정은 안 해도 되지만, 그래야 안심이 됐다. 하지만 침대가···. 솟아있다. -핫두핫두. 정확히는 침대 아래에 둔 나무 가방에서 전송된 아이템으로 인해 침대가 선 것이다.

Moreover, it's not uncommon for people to cry with joy when they receive a contract offer from one of the top five agencies. The vice president, a former actor, smiled kindly and explained through an interpreter. \\"You can think of it as similar to a sports player, not a company employee. During the re-signing season, salary and incentives are also adjusted.\\" The executive director of MNS Entertainment knew that many agencies in Japan use a salary system, but when Korean celebrities entered the market, they were subject to the same settlements as in Korea, so this was a first-time offer. Still, the sports player analogy made it easier to understand. There was an employee in the dedicated team who could speak Japanese, and the executive director asked through him. \\"What about the re-signing period?\\" \\"For Mr. Woo-dam, we'll make it two years. Besides, we provide the full CF guarantee to the artist, and above all, the real income for singer-songwriters comes from concerts and album sales, doesn't it?\\" Jeong Woo-dam was indeed tempted by the salary system. 'I get paid even if I don't work in Japan?' Moreover, like in Korea, copyright is entirely the creator's share. However, as the agency said, the decision to shake hands or not will depend on the settlement of concert and album sales. After all, MNS Entertainment and Jeong Woo-dam aim to be performance-oriented artists. The interpreter continued to convey the vice president's words. \\"After deducting production, distribution, venue rental, labor costs, promotion, etc., 10-20% of the total sales remain, and Mr. Woo-dam can think of taking 40% of that.\\" That 40% would be split between MNS Entertainment and Jeong Woo-dam. The executive director excused himself and had a quiet conversation with Jeong Woo-dam. \\"Anyway, the salary system means the percentage is lower compared to other Korean artists. But the share going to Mr. Woo-dam is the same.\\" If it's a concert with a 10% profit, Jeong Woo-dam gets 3%. Because the contract with MNS Entertainment is settled at a 2.5 to 7.5 ratio. \\"Even if it's the same for me, and I get a salary on top of that, isn't it a loss for MNS Entertainment?\\" \\"Don't worry about us and choose the side that's advantageous for Mr. Woo-dam. Also, ticket prices in Japan are lower than in Korea, but in return, frequent performances are possible.\\" The reason K-pop artists enter Japan. Suppose a ticket costs 110,000 won and mobilizes 20,000 people, whether in a hall or an arena. \\"For Mr. Woo-dam, 66 million won would be settled, and merchandise sales would be the same or more.\\" Merchandise has a high margin, and it's said that concerts are held for merchandise these days. In other words, if Woo-dam tours and 20,000 people come to watch, it's 132 million won. '...100 million?' For Woo-dam, that alone was surprising, but the executive director continued nonchalantly. \\"I just used 20,000 people as an easy example. When it's time to seriously tour, it will be several times that.\\" Woo-dam also knew he wasn't yet famous enough to tour, so he quickly calmed his surprise. He decided to compare soberly. Back in meeting mode, the vice president finally revealed the salary amount. \\"How about 800,000 yen?\\" An annual salary of 96 million won. He also added that if they join hands with them, there would be no broadcast they couldn't appear on. \\"We want to secure and expand the brand that is Mr. Woo-dam.\\" At that ambitious statement, the executive director, who had told Woo-dam to choose the path that benefits him without considering MNS Entertainment, couldn't help but chuckle. \\"It took Mr. Woo-dam two months to earn 100 million.\\" \\"Huh?\\" The agency, well-informed about the Korean entertainment industry, was flustered, not knowing his income. Even when the executive director tried to negotiate further. \\"This is also an exceptional offer. It's twice what we offer to new artists.\\" While saying that the annual salary of a top Japanese actor is 5 billion won, he promised to do his best to make Woo-dam reach that level within 20 years, even if he's not satisfied right now. \\"No matter what, 8 million won a month is.\\" \\"We'll match it to 10 million won.\\" The vice president, confident as if playing a trump card. The executive director offered a handshake to the vice president. \\"We'll discuss further when we return to Korea and contact you.\\" \\"We'll wait for a good response.\\" Afterward, the vice president also shook hands with Jeong Woo-dam. \\"Let's create a wonderful future together.\\" \\"Ohayou gozaimasu.\\" Woo-dam said goodbye with the greeting he learned, but that's a greeting for when you meet. The vice president, bursting into laughter at the good sign, left. The executive director put on his coat, suggesting they slowly move to the restaurant. \\"Big agency my foot, they're so stingy. If they cut the concert settlement, they should give a decent salary.\\" Who would have thought they'd show off with just 10 million won? Even if the salary is deposited without working in Japan, they are all entertainment industry workers, regardless of the country. Anyone who's not a fool would know they're going to work Woo-dam hard. \\"Mr. Woo-dam, in the end, the more you perform, the more that agency benefits than us. If you still prefer the salary system.\\" \\"I'll decide after meeting with President Minami.\\" \\"You made a good decision.\\" They had a brief meeting before the performance, but they didn't discuss the detailed ratios. They said they'd talk about it over a meal later. He mentioned wanting to take them to a restaurant he liked. And the place they went to in a rented minibus was a sushi restaurant with a \\"Break Time\\" sign. \\"Are we in the right place?\\" The executive director looked around to see if it was another store. The manager confirmed it was the right place after checking the phone again, and soon the restaurant door opened, and the president of Seta Production came out. \\"Irasshaimase!\\" \\"I was surprised, I thought you were a restaurant employee.\\" It turned out to be a Michelin restaurant that the president of Seta Production personally knew, and he had asked to use it during the break time. \\"You've prepared a lot, haven't you?\\" \\"Indeed.\\" They were led by the president into a room. Inside the room, there was only one interpreter hastily recruited by the president. Minami couldn't meet Jeong Woo-dam in private, so he only filmed a challenge before the performance and left. The meal was served, and the president of Seta Pro started the conversation. \\"We're not a large agency that usually contracts with Korean artists. We don't have a salary system. But one thing I can promise you.\\" \\"Yes?\\" \\"Even if we're not large, we won't fall behind in sales, and we'll give you the same settlement as domestic artists. It's the artist who performs, not us.\\" Seta Pro had never managed a K-pop artist before. If it weren't for the meeting with Jeong Woo-dam through Minami, it would have remained that way. They had heard so much about a genius singer-songwriter emerging in Korea that they consulted and created a Korean contract for the first time. The president handed over the contract. \\"I think 60-40 is fair. Of course, Mr. Woo-dam's side is 60. And if it's a sold-out show, I'll give you an additional guarantee.\\" Jeong Woo-dam didn't know how unprecedented this was. He was a newcomer. On the other hand, the dedicated team almost choked on their food, trying not to show their shock. '...60-40?' 'Don't K-pop idols all have 50-50?' 'Isn't it too ignorant not to know about Seta Pro? Is this contract even okay?' The executive director whispered to Jeong Woo-dam. \\"A salary system is stable. But this ratio, it's almost embarrassing for MNS Entertainment.\\" \\"Should I ask them to lower it?\\" \\"Haha, just joking. Anyway, Seta Pro must have done their research before making this decision. It's rare to have a deal that satisfies both parties.\\" Assuming concert revenue is 10% of sales, Jeong Woo-dam would receive 4.5%. It's 1.5% higher compared to large agencies. Thus, overseas contracts are swayed by 1%. Jeong Woo-dam asked the executive director. \\"So both I and MNS Entertainment are better off working with Seta Pro, right?\\" \\"Absolutely.\\" \\"I'll do it. I don't know when I'll start activities in Japan, though.\\" The executive director thought it wouldn't be too far off. * The contract would be reviewed and written upon returning to Korea. That's how business works. You can't just jump for joy on the spot. But the dedicated team parted with Seta Pro and returned to the hotel, jumping for joy before heading out to enjoy their vacation. \\"Mr. Woo-dam and I will return to Korea tomorrow, but the executive director and the staff should enjoy their vacation.\\" Woo-dam, visiting Japan for the first time, wanted to look around, but since he came for a performance, he decided to rest for tomorrow's condition. Then the manager came with beer, suggesting they watch Korea's weekend variety show 'God Plays Dice', abbreviated as Shinjunol. \\"Aren't you going out, manager?\\" \\"I've been to Japan so much when I managed Ji-an. Honestly, I can't really tell the difference from the Michelin sushi in Korea.\\" \\"Me neither. It's similar to supermarket sushi.\\" \\"That's a bit...\\" Then the manager brought up a serious topic. \\"The executive director said he wants to put many songs in Mr. Woo-dam's next album and make sure to get you to number one this time.\\" \\"Number one?\\" Jeong Woo-dam also planned to promote two songs from his comeback. Either a pre-release song and a title or a title and a follow-up song. \\"It's not just a big dream, it looks possible numerically. I know it's pressuring to ask for another good song next time.\\" \\"I'm not pressured. It's just that album sales seem important. Oh, it's starting.\\" They had to watch on a tablet. But they could still enjoy it. Woo-dam had heard who was invited to the Shinjunol song festival, but seeing it on video made him look forward to tomorrow. Because he would go straight to the Shinjunol filming site upon returning to Korea. \\"Wow, I knew it, but the lineup is no joke, right?\\" \\"That person has been rejecting all broadcast appearances until now.\\" \\"I'm the newest, so I should be extra polite.\\" All of them were famous producers. One was even the head of an agency. It was an unprecedented lineup for the Shinjunol song festival. Perhaps because of that, the next morning, when the ratings soared. Even though it's a popular variety show, it's always hard to get good ratings at night, and some netizens were tired of too many song festivals. But with such a lineup, it recorded 10%. The community reaction was hot. -Jeong Woo-dam what theㅠㅠ -Is this real production? Does he really write songs that fast? └Surprisingly, it's true -Isn't it cheating for an agency CEO to appear? -Shinjunol nailed itㅋ What's with the lineup Yesterday ended with the participants asking for songs they wanted in the studio, next week they'll pair up with guests, and the following week they'll perform. But since the first episode of the song festival gathered attention, the Shinjunol production team could breathe a sigh of relief. In the Shinjunol meeting room, the PD sighed. \\"Phew, we don't have to worry about ratings for a while.\\" \\"But we still have to finish the song festival safely.\\" The AD was right, but with experience, they knew. This song festival would surely end successfully. However, while the happy Shinjunol production team was the opposite, other broadcast station variety teams were in agony. It was the audition program 'Singposium' of a cable channel scheduled to premiere next Saturday. The PD held his head. \\"We scheduled it for Saturday at the same time because Shinjunol's ratings were dropping.\\" \\"They were dropping. It's just recovered this time.\\" Even though the writer answered, the PD's expression didn't lighten. There would have been strong competition programs on any other day, so there wasn't much they could do. Moreover, Singposium had something to rely on. But that reliance turned out to be not so great, driving them crazy. \\"Because of participant Jo So-hyun, we even broke up with MNS Entertainment!\\" A participant who was said to have been in a band with Seo Ji-an and Jeong Woo-dam during high school. She definitely had talent when she sent the application email and when she came for the writer's meeting to decide on the main competition. \\"What, did we know? We didn't know her learning ability would be so slow without her repertoire...\\" That was the problem. Apart from singing songs she knew and playing the guitar, her learning was unbelievably slow. Is a competition program a place to sing only songs you've sung before? Absolutely not. Every week, they practice new songs and perform on stage. Jo So-hyun can't do that. \\"We've done the promotion, but we lost the favorite to win to MNS Entertainment. And Jo So-hyun, who we thought was another favorite, is at a parrot level. But the higher-ups are instructing us to make her win with LAR.\\" LAR. Live AR. Simply put, while everyone else performs live, they want to play a pre-recorded track for Jo So-hyun to make it seem live. She's a participant with some buzz, after all. Honestly, the higher-ups don't take responsibility. If it's exposed, the PD will take all the blame. \\"Ah, I'm going crazy.\\" The Singposium PD became accustomed to swearing. *** Jeong Woo-dam's accommodation. Woo-dam had hidden the wooden bag under the bed before going to Japan. The apartment was secure, so there was no need to worry, but it gave him peace of mind. But the bed... It was elevated. -Hotduhotdu. Precisely, the bed was raised due to the item transmitted from the wooden bag underneath. [Light's Electric Piano / Unique] -The piano's grade increases by one level. -If the piano's grade is already S or higher, there is no increase effect."},{"instruction":"< 무의식적 침해 > 정우담은 스스로 아틀라스라 이름 붙인, S등급으로 올려줄 빛의 일렉트릭 피아노를 어떻게 꺼낼지 궁리했다. “그나마 침대 아래 숨기고 가서 망정이지.” 이불장에 넣고 갔으면 대참사가 날뻔했다. 크기가 작지 않으니 말이다. ‘나한테 EP(일렉트릭 피아노)가 생기다니.’ 우담은 작곡을 할 때 어쿠스틱 피아노보다 EP를 더 자주 쓴다. 물론 가상 악기로. 실물 EP는 주로 1970년대에 생산된 모델들이 뮤지션들과 악기 수집가들에게 인기다. 중고로 헐값에 올라오는 것들은 대개 세월로 인해 철판에 녹이 슬었다. 인테리어로 둘 게 아니면 악기의 기능은 제대로 못 하고 공간만 차지한다. 지금도 로즈사에서 한정수량의 최신 모델을 내놓지만, 환율에 세금까지 계산할 시 1,500만 원은 족히 줘야 할 것이다. ‘그런데 EP도 제조사가 다양해서.’ 과연 아틀라스는 어느 제조사의 소리를 낼지, 우담은 어서 작업실로 옮기고 싶었다. “로즈냐, 아니면 월리처냐.” 디자인만 보자면 그 두 모델이 섞여 있다. 우담은 간신히 침대 매트리스를 끄집어 내리고, 침대 프레임을 밀어 벽에 세웠다. “얘들아, 우선 이것부터 치우자.” 곰돌이들에게 아직 인사도 못 했다. EP에 가려져 있기 때문이다. “흡!” 들고 가려면 들 수 있는 무게였지만, 떨어뜨렸다간 낭패라 펜트리에서 이사할 때 썼던 핸드카를 가져왔다. 가로로 두 다리를 걸치고, 반대쪽은 우담이 들어 조심조심 밀었다. “다 왔어.” 작업실까지 무사히 도착해 한쪽 벽에 밀착시켰다. 소리라도 들어보려 어댑터를 연결한 뒤 도 건반을 찾아 눌어봤다. 딩. “···왜 CP70 음색이 나냐?” 그 또한 단종된 야마하의 초기 EP. 작곡 프로그램에서 기본 EP로 쉽게 볼 수 있고, 발라드와 R&B에 자주 쓰인다. 그런데 이내, 우담은 앰프 노브 중에 익숙하지 않은 게 있는 것을 발견했다. “볼륨은 따로 있는데 숫자가 적힌 건 뭐지?” 현재는 1에 맞춰져 있길래 2로 올렸고. 그러자. 디잉. 보다 몽환적인 음색으로 바뀌었다. ‘로즈 마크야.’ 우담은 가상 악기로 모든 EP 소리를 들어봤다. 하지만 리얼은 리얼만의 느낌이 있다. 가상 악기론 완벽 재현이 어렵다. 바로 아날로그 감성이란 것을. 음악에서 무척이나 중요한 감성이다. 다시 숫자 노브를 3, 4로 올려보았다. “월리처에 호너까지.” 이제 이 노브가 뭔지 알겠다. 아틀라스는 제조사별로 EP 사운드를 모조리 낼 수 있다. 아틀라스로 인해 우담의 피아노 등급만 오르는 게 아니라, 작곡에서의 무기가 하나 더 늘어난 것이다. 방음을 위해 작업실 문을 닫고. 우담은 소리를 질렀다. “대바아아악끄!” 흥분이 가시질 않는다. 아틀라스의 가치를 대체 얼마로 매겨야 할까? 그냥 소리별 천만 원씩만 계산해도 4천인데, 숫자 노브가 6까지 있다. 그러나 다른 두 가지는 우담도 들어본 적 없던 소리라, 어느 장르에 쓰면 좋을지 연구를 해봐야겠다. 당장 미디로 연결해 곡 작업을 시작하고 싶지만, 이런 보물을 구해다 준 곰돌이들에게 감사를 전하지 않을 수 없었다. 난장판이 된 침실로 돌아간 우담은 나무 가방을 들여다봤다. “아니, 이걸 대체 뭔 수로 탐색에서 가져온 거야?” 우담이 일본에 가 있는 동안 곰돌이들의 작은 세상에 또 한 차례 눈이 내렸었나 보다. 폭설은 아니고, 뽀득뽀득 걸을 때마다 소리가 날 만큼 낮게 쌓여 있었다. 그리고 눈 덮인 지면엔 모험가 3웅이 타고 다니는 스키 자국과, 빙판에서 놀려고 만들었던 스케이트 자국이 얇게 그어져 있다. 아무래도 3웅이는 탐색 갔다가 아틀라스를 발견하고, 다시 스케이트를 챙겨 가 피아노 다리에 하나씩 묶어 끌고 온 듯했다. 얼마나 고생했을까. 감격해 코가 시큰해지는 우담이었다. “형이 지금은 줄 게 없어서 미안하네.” C등급 나무는 성대모사와 리코더, 얼반댄스 3개뿐이고. B등급 나무 중 A로 올릴 후보들이 많지만, 가진 돈이 아깝게 천만 원이 안 된다. 카와이 베이스 페스티벌 행사비가 1,600만 원인데 다음 주에 들어온다. ‘여기에 코타 엔터에서 받을 돈이.’ 인공 눈물로 프로듀싱이 S등급일 때 만든 3곡 모두 코타 엔터가 사기로 했지만, 금액이 금액인지라 아직은 입금 전. 우담은 천천히 주셔도 된다고 했는데, 모노디가 2주까진 안 걸릴 거라고 말했다. “어? 잠깐만.” 행사비와 코타 엔터에서 곡비를 다 받으면 무려 7,600만 원이 된다. 심지어 들어올 게 더 있다. ‘리우.’ 정우담의 이름으로 발매하는 게 아닌, 리우에게 간 곡이고 노래도 리우 혼자 부른다. 콜라보여도 우담은 제목에 Prod.로 이름이 들어가는 게 전부. 그러니 그 또한 MNS 엔터가 곡비 2천에 공급 계약을 맺자고 했다. “가진 거 합치면 1억 되잖아?” 더욱이, 일본의 세타 프로덕션에서도 현지 매니지먼트 독점 권한 대행으로 계약금을 준다고 들었다. 전무가 시장 조사를 마치고 귀국하거든 계약서를 작성하기로 했는데, 어쩌면 그게 제일 먼저 입금될지 모른다. 계약금은 천만 원으로 크지 않지만, 아니. 우담에겐 큰돈이 맞지만, 추후 나무 하나를 S등급으로 키워도 여윳돈이 남는다. 생활비 쪼들릴 걱정은 없단 것이다. ‘애초에 숙소도 공짜고, 밥값도 MNS 엔터가 내주고 있어서 돈 들어갈 일이 없었는데.’ 부모님이 속초에서 카페를 하시겠다고 한다. 하나뿐인 아들로서 약간이나마 보탬이 되고 싶으니, 이참에 자식 된 도리를 하면 좋을 듯했다. 우담은 헤벌쭉 입가를 올렸다. “얘들아, 다음에 수고비로 프로듀싱 나무 S등급 만들자.” 그 와중에도 곰돌이들은 우담이 일본에 가기 전 열심히 만들던 수영장에서 헤엄을 치고 있었다. 눈이 내렸었으니 얼음도 동동 떠 있는데 추운 줄 모르고 논다. -푸악. 잠수 중이었는지 공대생 5웅이 갑자기 튀어나오고, 꼬맹이 4웅이는 다이빙을 했다가 다시 수영장을 나가 또 다이빙을 한다. -따앗! 먹짱 2웅이는 대장 1웅이의 팔을 붙잡고 수영을 배우고 있다. 제자리 수영이라 물장구만 일으킨다. 파닥파닥. “3웅이랑 6웅이는?” 어디 갔나 했더니, 오두막에서 둘이 함께 나오는데 여분의 탐색 스틱 한 쌍을 3웅이 6웅에게 준다. 예전에 방문 상단이 왔을 때 2쌍을 샀었다. “어라?” 램프 모자도, 포켓 조끼도 벗어 6웅에게 입혀준다. 그러곤 둘이 칼각으로 경례를 한다. 그대로 카우보이 6웅은 나무 가방에선 안 보이는 경계로 넘어갔다. -와옹와옹와옹~ 여전한 입 브금. “뭐야? 3웅아, 인수인계한 거야?” 탐색 유닛인 3웅이 인수인계를? 믿기지 않는 광경이었다. 눈보라가 쳤을 때도 탐색에 가고 싶어 근질근질해 하던 3웅이가? 하지만, 3웅이의 등에 사용하던 스틱이 쌍검처럼 걸쳐져 있다. 탐색을 양보한 건 아닌 모양이다. 어쩌면. “겨울 지나면 또 뭐가 있나?” 다음 주, 우담이 서지안의 컴백 앨범을 만들 송캠프에 다녀오면 5월이 된다. 달마다 계절이 변하는 나무 가방에 봄이 찾아온다는 얘기다. 봄, 현실에서도 새 시작을 알리는 계절. 더구나 우담이 나무 가방을 처음 주웠을 때부터 여름이었으니, 봄을 보는 건 처음이기도 했다. 분명 뭔가 있을 것 같다는 예감이 들었다. “뭐, 그때 돼봐야 알 수 있겠지.” 곰돌이들에게 해외 스케줄을 다녀온 소감을 말한 우담은, 내일 일찍 사옥에 나가야 하는데도 작업실로 재차 향했다. “애프터 서비스 해줘야지.” 피아노 S등급의 효과를 확인 안 하곤 도저히 잠을 못 잘 것 같았기 때문이다. 우담이 만든 작업물 중 아직 발매가 안 된 곡에 한해서, EP를 수정하기로 했다. “리우 씨 콜라보, Day.G 트로피컬 하우스와 저지 클럽.” 레트로 사운드에 제격인 EP이니 말이다. 마지막으론 신주놀 가요제의 유로 댄스. ‘가요제 게스트분들은 분명 어느 재능이 하나씩은 S등급일 거야.’ 대형기획사 수장은 아우라가 S 같았고, 젊은 싱어송라이터 사단을 이끄는 애셔 홍은 음역대가 S등급으로 보였다. 우담은 트랙의 EP만이라도 S등급으로 교체하길 원했다. 레어 아이템 피아니스트 보타이를 착용한 우담은 시퀀서를 실행하고 아틀라스 앞에 앉았다. “잘 부탁한다. 새 친구.” 아까 소리를 들어보려 했을 땐 보타이를 하지 않았었으니, 이제야 S등급의 피아노 실력을 느끼게 됐다. 마치 악보가 허공에 보이는 기분마저 든다. 당 당 당 당 당 당! 그렇게 4곡의 미디를 재녹음한 우담은 어떤 깨우침까지 얻고 말았다. ‘창작은 재배열.’ 그 깨달음을 얻은 우담의 작업실에서 동이 틀 때까지 EP 소리가 울려 퍼졌다. * 다음 날. 우담은 MNS 엔터 사옥에 출근해 연습실로 갔다. 보컬실이 아닌, 댄스룸이었다. “우담아!” “안녕하세요.” 신주놀 가요제에서 팀이 된 고정 출연자, 장현준이었다. 오늘 그와 유로 댄스곡의 안무를 익히고, 가사는 장현준이 써왔으니 녹음까지 마치려 한다. 신주놀 음원은 한 음원 플랫폼에서 독점 제공할 예정이라 금요일까지만 완성해 넘기면 된다. 그래도 금요일까지 걸릴 사람은 없을 것이다. 전부 프로였으니 말이다. “우리 팀 이름 뭘로 하지? 노래 제목은?” “팀 이름은 고민을 해봐야겠지만, 타이틀은 유료 댄스 어떠세요?” “천재냐?” 네이밍 센스로 놀림 받기 일쑤인 우담인데 칭찬을 들었다. 팀 이름은 장현준이 생각해냈다. “정장 브라더스 어때? 무대에도 복고풍 수트 입고 올라가는 거지.” 금세 팀명과 타이틀이 나왔다. 그러곤 MNS 아이돌 파트의 댄스 트레이너와 안무를 만들어 나갔다. “현준 씨는 발라드 가수셨는데도 몸을 잘 쓰시네요? 우담 씨는, 너무 잘 쓰시고.” 고래도 춤추게 한다는 칭찬이 끊이질 않았다. 정우담의 얼반댄스 나무가 C등급이라 실력자까진 아니어도 일반인보단 나은 수준이기 때문이다. ‘화기애애한 분위기, 역시 팀을 잘 짰어.’ 그런 우담에게 장현준이 작가가 스케치북에 적은 걸 보고 묻는다. 중간 점검 시간인 것이다. “우담이가 보기엔 누가 1등 할 것 같아?” “저는 애셔 홍 선배님 팀이요.” 방송에는 데모 버전을 만드는 과정만 나갔고, 어제 녹화에선 완성본을 다 들어봤다. 그게 이번 주 토요일에 방영된다. 그리고 그다음 날인 일요일 녹화가 가요제의 끝, 무대에 오르는 날이다. 추첨으로 시청자들도 방청에 온다. “왜? 난 우리도 조짐 좋아 보이는데?” “사실 다 좋았지만, 애셔 홍 선배님이 통 샘플링을 하셨길래 준비를 단단히 하신 것 같달까.” 우담의 대답에, 장현준은 양손으로 T자를 만들었다. 끊었다 가잔 소리다. “···금시초문인데? 통 샘플링을 했다고?” 그도 가수 출신이라 샘플링의 장점과 단점을 모르지 않았다. 원작자에게 로열티를 지불하거나 샘플 사이트에서 결제하고 쓰는 것 외엔 죄다 무단 샘플링이다. 그런데 가요제 음원에 대한 제작비는 방송 측에서 주기에, 어디에 얼마나 쓰였는지 알 수밖에 없다. 하지만 단 한 명도 샘플 클리어가 필요하다고 요구한 게스트는 없었다. “1981년에 발매된 미국 재즈 있잖아요?” 정우담은 최신 빌보드 차트뿐만 아니라 예전 차트들까지 분석한다. 이 이야기는 제작진을 통해 바로 애셔 홍에게 전달되었다. -애셔 씨, 혹시 샘플링 하셨어요? “무슨 소리예요?” -그, 1981년에 나온 재즈랑 유사해서요. 아니, 피아노 라인이 같아서요. 곡을 쓰고 나서 이게 표절인지 아닌지 아는 방법은 없다. 음원 플랫폼에 멜로디 검색을 해볼 순 있으나, 그것도 정확한 결과가 나오지 않을뿐더러 애셔 홍은 살면서 그런 걸 해본 적도 없었다. 해볼 생각조차 없었다. 늘 순수 창작물이라 믿어 의심치 않았으니. “제가요? 하, 참나.” 콧방귀를 뀌었지만, 제작진이 링크를 보낸 음원을 들어보고 나선. ‘···어?’ 베끼려고 한 적은 없다. 양심에 대고 말할 수 있다. 그렇지만 어렴풋이 기억이 나기 시작했다. 딱 한 번 들어본 적 있는 노래였다. 완전히 잊고 있던, 어쩌다 들른 바에서 겨우 한 소절 들었던 노래. 문제는 무의식적으로 그걸 순수 창작이랍시고 썼다는 것이다.","output":"< Unconscious Infringement > Jeong Woo-dam pondered how to extract the electric piano named Atlas, which could be upgraded to S-grade by the light. \\"It's a good thing I hid it under the bed before leaving.\\" It would have been a disaster if he had put it in the linen closet. It wasn't small, after all. 'I have an EP (electric piano) now.' Woo-dam often uses EPs more than acoustic pianos when composing. Of course, as virtual instruments. Actual EPs, especially those produced in the 1970s, are popular among musicians and collectors. Those that come up for sale cheaply are usually rusted due to age. If they're not for interior decoration, they don't function properly as instruments and just take up space. Even now, Rhodes releases limited quantities of the latest models, but considering the exchange rate and taxes, they would cost at least 15 million won. 'But there are so many EP manufacturers.' Woo-dam was eager to move Atlas to his studio to find out which manufacturer's sound it would produce. \\"Is it a Rhodes, or maybe a Wurlitzer?\\" Judging by the design, it seemed to be a mix of those two models. Woo-dam managed to pull out the bed mattress and pushed the bed frame against the wall. \\"Guys, let's clear this up first.\\" He hadn't even greeted the teddy bears yet. Because they were obscured by the EP. \\"Oops!\\" It was a weight he could lift, but if he dropped it, it would be a disaster, so he brought a handcart from the pantry. He placed it horizontally on two legs, and Woo-dam lifted the other side and pushed it carefully. \\"We're almost there.\\" He safely arrived at the studio and pushed it against one wall. Eager to hear the sound, he connected the adapter and pressed the keys. Ding. \\"...Why does it sound like a CP70?\\" That was also an early discontinued EP from Yamaha. It's easily found as a basic EP in composition programs and is often used in ballads and R&B. But soon, Woo-dam noticed a knob among the amp knobs that was unfamiliar. \\"There's a separate volume, but what's this one with numbers?\\" It was currently set to 1, so he turned it to 2. And then. Ding. The sound changed to a more ethereal tone. 'That's the Rhodes mark.' Woo-dam had heard all the EP sounds as virtual instruments. But real is real; virtual instruments can't perfectly replicate the feel. That analog sentiment is very important in music. He turned the numbered knob to 3, then 4. \\"Wurlitzer and Hohner too.\\" Now he understood what this knob was for. Atlas could produce the sound of EPs from various manufacturers. With Atlas, not only did Woo-dam's piano grade increase, but he also gained another weapon in composition. He closed the studio door for soundproofing. Woo-dam shouted. \\"Jackpot!\\" The excitement wouldn't subside. How much was Atlas worth? Just calculating ten million won for each sound would be 40 million, and the numbered knob goes up to 6. However, the other two sounds were unfamiliar to Woo-dam, so he would have to research which genres they would suit best. He wanted to start working on a track with MIDI right away, but he couldn't fail to thank the teddy bears who had found this treasure. Returning to the bedroom turned upside down, Woo-dam looked into the wooden bag. \\"How on earth did you manage to bring this from the exploration?\\" While Woo-dam was in Japan, it seems there was another round of snow in the teddy bears' small world. It wasn't a blizzard, but the snow was piled up just enough to make a sound with every step. And on the snow-covered ground, there were ski tracks from Adventurer 3woong and thin lines from the skates they made to play on the ice. Apparently, 3woong found Atlas during an exploration, then went back to get the skates and tied them to the piano legs to drag it here. What a struggle it must have been. Woo-dam was touched to the point of tears. \\"I'm sorry I don't have anything to give you right now.\\" There were only three items left in the C-grade tree: mimicry, recorder, and urban dance. There were many candidates to upgrade to A in the B-grade tree, but he didn't want to spend the money, which was just shy of ten million won. The Kawaii Bass Festival fee of 16 million won would come in next week. 'And there's the money from Kota Entertainment.' Kota Entertainment decided to buy all three songs produced when Woo-dam had S-grade producing with artificial tears, but since the amount was significant, the payment was still pending. Woo-dam said they could take their time, but Monodi said it wouldn't take more than two weeks. \\"Oh? Wait a minute.\\" If he received both the event fee and the song fee from Kota Entertainment, it would be a whopping 76 million won. And there was more to come. 'Riu.' It wasn't released under Jeong Woo-dam's name; it was a song for Riu, sung by Riu alone. Even if it was a collaboration, Woo-dam's name only appeared as Prod. in the title. So MNS Entertainment also proposed a supply contract for the song fee of 2 million won. \\"That makes it 100 million won in total, doesn't it?\\" Moreover, Seta Production in Japan also mentioned paying a signing bonus for exclusive management rights. The executive director planned to draft the contract after completing the market research upon returning to Korea, and perhaps that would be the first to be deposited. The signing bonus of ten million won wasn't large, but actually, for Woo-dam, it was a significant amount. With it, he could grow another tree to S-grade and still have money left over. He wouldn't have to worry about living expenses. 'After all, the accommodation is free, and MNS Entertainment pays for the meals, so there's no need for money.' His parents wanted to open a cafe in Sokcho. As their only son, he wanted to contribute a little, so it seemed like a good time to fulfill his filial duties. Woo-dam smiled broadly. \\"Guys, let's make a producing tree S-grade next time with the bonus.\\" Meanwhile, the teddy bears were swimming in the pool Woo-dam had been working on before leaving for Japan. Since it had snowed, there were ice floes floating, but they didn't seem to mind the cold. -Poof. Engineering Student 5woong suddenly emerged from diving, and Little 4woong dived in and out of the pool again and again. -Daht! Chubby 2woong was learning to swim by holding onto Leader 1woong's arm. It was just treading water, splashing around. Flap flap. \\"Where are 3woong and 6woong?\\" He wondered where they had gone, and then they came out of the cabin together, with 3woong giving 6woong a pair of spare exploration sticks. They had bought two pairs when the merchant ship visited before. \\"Huh?\\" 3woong took off the lamp hat and pocket vest and dressed 6woong in them. Then they saluted each other at a sharp angle. Just like that, Cowboy 6woong crossed over the boundary not visible from the wooden bag. -Woong woong woong~ The usual vocal BGM. \\"What's going on? 3woong, are you handing over?\\" A transfer from the exploration unit, 3woong? It was an unbelievable sight. 3woong, who was always eager to go exploring even during a blizzard? However, the sticks 3woong used were now crossed on his back like twin swords. It seems he didn't give up on exploring. Maybe. \\"What's next after winter?\\" Next week, when Woo-dam returns from the song camp to produce Seo Ji-an's comeback album, it will be May. Spring is coming to the wooden bag, which changes seasons every month. Spring, a season that signifies a new beginning even in reality. Moreover, since Woo-dam first found the wooden bag, it had been summer, so this would be his first time seeing spring. He had a feeling that something was bound to happen. \\"Well, I'll only know when the time comes.\\" After sharing his thoughts on the overseas schedule with the teddy bears, Woo-dam, who had to go to the company building early the next day, headed back to the studio. \\"I have to provide after-service.\\" He couldn't sleep without checking the effects of the S-grade piano. Woo-dam decided to modify the EP for the songs he had created that hadn't been released yet. \\"Riu's collab, Day.G's tropical house, and Jersey club.\\" The EP was perfect for retro sounds. Lastly, the Eurodance for the Shinjunol song festival. 'The guests at the song festival will surely have at least one S-grade talent.' The head of the large agency seemed to have an S-grade aura, and Asher Hong, who led a young singer-songwriter group, appeared to have an S-grade vocal range. Woo-dam wanted to replace the EP in the tracks with S-grade. Wearing the rare item Pianist Bowtie, Woo-dam launched the sequencer and sat in front of Atlas. \\"Please take care of me, new friend.\\" He hadn't worn the bowtie when he first tried to listen to the sound, so now he was finally experiencing the S-grade piano skills. It almost felt like he could see the music score floating in the air. Dang dang dang dang dang dang! After re-recording the MIDI for the four songs, Woo-dam even gained some enlightenment. 'Creation is rearrangement.' With that realization, the sound of the EP echoed in Woo-dam's studio until dawn. * The next day. Woo-dam went to work at the MNS Entertainment building and headed to the practice room. It was the dance room, not the vocal room. \\"Woo-dam!\\" \\"Hello.\\" It was Jang Hyun-jun, a regular participant who became his team member at the Shinjunol song festival. Today, he would learn the choreography for the Eurodance song, and since Jang Hyun-jun had written the lyrics, they planned to finish recording as well. Shinjunol's music was to be exclusively provided by one music platform, so they only needed to finish by Friday. But no one would take until Friday. They were all professionals. \\"What should we name our team? And the song title?\\" \\"We might need to think about the team name, but how about 'Paid Dance' for the title?\\" \\"Are you a genius?\\" Woo-dam, often teased for his naming sense, received a compliment. Jang Hyun-jun came up with the team name. \\"How about 'Suit Brothers'? We'll wear retro suits on stage.\\" The team name and title came out quickly. Then they created the choreography with the dance trainer from MNS's idol part. \\"Hyun-jun, you were a ballad singer, but you move well? Woo-dam, you move too well.\\" Compliments about making even a whale dance were endless. Jeong Woo-dam's urban dance tree was C-grade, so while he wasn't a pro, he was better than the average person. 'The atmosphere is harmonious; we made a good team.' Jang Hyun-jun, looking at what the writer had written on the sketchbook, asked Woo-dam during the check-up time. \\"Who do you think will win, Woo-dam?\\" \\"I think Asher Hong's team.\\" Only the demo version making process was shown on the broadcast, and they had listened to the finished versions yesterday. That will be aired this Saturday. And the next day, Sunday's recording is the end of the song festival, with the stage performance. Viewers are also invited by lottery. \\"Why? I think our team looks promising too.\\" \\"Actually, they were all good, but I think Asher Hong prepared thoroughly since he did full sampling.\\" At Woo-dam's answer, Jang Hyun-jun made a T with his hands. It meant to cut it out. \\"...I've never heard of that. He did full sampling?\\" As a singer himself, he wasn't unaware of the advantages and disadvantages of sampling. Unless you pay royalties to the original creator or pay for samples from a site, it's all unauthorized sampling. But since the production cost for the song festival music is provided by the broadcast side, they have to know where and how much was spent. However, not a single guest requested sample clearance. \\"There's an American jazz piece from 1981, you know?\\" Jeong Woo-dam analyzes not only the latest Billboard charts but also past charts. This story was immediately conveyed to Asher Hong through the production team. -Asher, did you do any sampling? \\"What are you talking about?\\" -Well, it's similar to a jazz piece from 1981. No, the piano line is the same. There's no way to know if a song is plagiarized after writing it. You can search for melodies on music platforms, but even that doesn't guarantee accurate results, and Asher Hong had never done such a thing in his life. He never even thought about it. He always believed his creations were purely original. \\"Me? Oh, come on.\\" He snorted, but after listening to the linked music sent by the production team. '...Huh?' He never intended to copy. He could swear on his conscience. But he began to vaguely remember. It was a song he had heard only once. A song he had completely forgotten, heard only briefly at a bar he had visited by chance. The problem was that he had unconsciously used it as if it were his own original creation."},{"instruction":"hello chatgpt-4? how are you? i want to learn more about the egyptian tortoise. can you give me information?","output":"Hello! As an AI language model, I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to help you learn about the Egyptian tortoise. The Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni), also known as the Kleinmann's tortoise, is a species of small tortoise that is native to the deserts of Northern Africa and the Middle East. Here's some detailed information about this fascinating species: # Description: - **Size:** The Egyptian tortoise is one of the smallest tortoises in the world. Adults typically grow to be about 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 inches) in length. - **Weight:** They usually weigh between 80 to 100 grams (2.8 to 3.5 ounces). - **Shell:** Their shell (carapace) is high-domed and pale, often a sandy or ivory color, which provides excellent camouflage in their natural desert habitats. - **Sexual Dimorphism:** Females are generally larger than males. Males have a longer tail and a more pronounced concavity on the underside of the shell, which assists in mating. # Habitat: - The Egyptian tortoise is adapted to live in arid, desert regions with sparse vegetation. They are typically found in Libya, Egypt, and Israel. - **Habitat Loss:** Unfortunately, their natural habitat is under threat due to human activities, such as urban development and agriculture. # Diet: - In the wild, the Egyptian tortoise is an herbivore that grazes on a variety of grasses, leaves, flowers, and other plant material. - In captivity, they require a diet rich in fiber and calcium but low in protein and fat. A mix of leafy greens and other vegetables is suitable, with occasional fruits. # Behavior: - **Activity:** They are most active during the cooler parts of the day, dawn, and dusk. During the hottest parts of the day, they will burrow into the ground or seek shelter to stay cool. - **Hibernation:** The Egyptian tortoise does not typically hibernate, but their activity levels can significantly decrease during the colder months. # Breeding: - **Mating Season:** Breeding typically occurs in the spring. - **Egg-laying:** Females lay a small number of eggs (usually 1-5) in a burrow. The eggs incubate for around 90 to 100 days before hatching. # Conservation Status: - The Egyptian tortoise is listed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. - Their populations have declined dramatically due to habitat loss, poaching for the pet trade, and predation by invasive species. # Legislation: - International laws, including restrictions in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), regulate the trade of Egyptian tortoises to try to prevent illegal trafficking. # Captive Care: - They can be kept in captivity, but they require specific care to meet their thermal, dietary, and space needs. It's crucial for potential owners to research and understand the species-specific requirements of Egyptian tortoises to provide them with a proper environment. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of the Egyptian tortoise in the wild. These include habitat preservation, captive breeding programs, and legal enforcement to prevent illegal trade. It's crucial for any potential owner of an Egyptian tortoise to ensure they are not contributing to the illegal trade in these animals, and to provide proper care that mimics their natural habitat and diet as closely as possible."},{"instruction":"translate all to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[성공을 향해 항해] 랩 라임 같은 제목의 자기계발서였다. 그러더니 책을 덮고 폰을 꺼내 본다. 명찰에 ‘최봄이’라고 적혀 있는 그녀가 보는 것은 SNS였다. ‘우다밍 또 김볶 먹었어?’ 정우담의 목격담이 올라온 것이다. MNS 엔터 컨텐츠팀과 전통악기 공방을 나온 뒤 분식집에 들어간 사진이었다. 참고로 우다밍은 팬들이 쓰는 애칭. 누군가 우담이를 우다밍으로 오타를 냈는데, 그게 들불처럼 빠르게 번졌다. 사진을 저장한 최봄이는 SNS에 떠도는 음악방송 1위 예측표를 보고, 팬카페에 접속해 글을 작성했다. 람쥐썬더스톰이라는 닉네임으로 활동한다. [오늘 우다밍 세 곡 다 1위 후보!] -근데 1위는 어렵겠져ㅠ? 댓글: └아무래도 출연을 안 하니까ㅜ └아숩다 예측표를 보면 누가 1위를 할지도 예상이 간다. 원래라면 4세대 대표 걸그룹 베이브가 지난주에 이어 1위 독식을 해야 하지만, 선공개곡 활동이라 앨범을 내지 않았다. 앨범 점수가 0점이라는 것. 게다가 이번 주는 활동 자체를 안 한다. ‘다음 주부터 앨범 풀리고 타이틀 무대도 하겠지만.’ 하지만 아무리 그래도 베이브인데, 설마 선공개곡이 1위 후보에서 빠질 줄은 몰랐다. 다른 1위 후보 팬들이 오늘 아니면 1위 하기가 쉽지 않겠단 판단에 이를 악물었다고 봐야 한다. ‘우다밍 빼면 데이지에 남돌 한팀.’ 예측표 상에서도 두 팀이 치열하다. 앨범은 보이그룹이, 음원은 Day.G가 높다. 근소하게 보이그룹이 우위지만, 투표 점수란 변수가 존재해 까봐야 안다. 지갑 두둑한 Day.G 팬들이 사전 투표 독려 이벤트를 크게 열었기 때문이다. 그것도 정우담이 좋은 곡을 줬으니 이벤트를 할 기회를 얻은 것이다. ‘우다밍, 굉장한 사람.’ 씨익. 최봄이가 저장한 우담의 사진을 보며 웃었다. 그녀는 정우담이 데뷔하기 전부터 봐왔다. 처음엔 훈훈하고 선한 인상이란 감상이었고, 두 번째론 작곡 천재가 아닐까 하는 소문이 스멀스멀 피어오르길래 호기심이 들었다. 그러다 데뷔를 한다기에 뭐 저런 상식 파괴자가 있나 싶었다. 데뷔 앨범을 들어보곤 왜 그렇게 MNS 엔터가 목을 매는지 깨달았다. ‘그러더니 보컬 그룹 프로듀서까지.’ 최봄이는 MNS 엔터 내부자가 아니고선 알기 힘든 것까지 알고 있었다. 정우담이 프로듀싱할 보컬 그룹에 포함될지 말지 보류 상태인 연습생이기 때문이다. 솔로 지망생이 아닌, 걸그룹 연습생 파트 소속. ‘우다밍의 보컬 그룹에 들어갈 수만 있다면, 열심히 배워온 춤을 포기하는 건 아깝지도 않아.’ 최봄이는 회사에서 제2의 서지안으로 불린다. 사실 MNS 엔터엔 제2의 서지안이 열댓 명 있어 중요한 정보는 아니지만, 댄스뿐만 아니라 보컬에도 소질이 있단 뜻이다. 이런 최봄이가 그토록 보컬 그룹에 합류하길 바라는 이유는, 단순히 우담의 팬이라서 그런 것만은 아니다. 아니, 팬이 된 과정과 같긴 하다. ‘음악성.’ 앨범을 보자면 결코 일반적인 구성이 아니다. 남들이라면 데뷔 앨범에 넣지 않을 결단들뿐이며, 흥행공식을 따르지 않는데도 흥행시켰다. 그나마 대중적인 장르의 <www.>은 대체 이게 정우담 노래야, 신채윤 노래야 의아할 만큼 존재감을 숨긴다. 독특한 음색을 누르고, 화음 깔아주기에 여념이 없다. 남자가 여자에 음역대를 맞추는 진기한 곡. <Go>를 들어봤다면 정우담의 고음역이 얼마나 높은지 다 아니 말이다. ‘반대로 혼자 돋보일 선택을 했다면.’ 이렇게까지 반응이 나오진 않았을 것이다. 실력파 혼성 듀엣의 하모니에 목말랐던 리스너들의 갈증을 해소시켜주었다. 혼성 듀엣을 좋아하는 사람들이 많지만, 차트에 자주 올라오진 않는다. 그런데 퀄리티도 기대 이상. ‘신인이 주목받아야 하는 데뷔 타이틀, 분명 MNS 엔터는 피처링을 반대했을 거야.’ 그럼에도 정우담이 이런 결과를 노리고 의도하고 밀어붙였다면, 남들이 그저 띄워주려 천재란 표현을 쓰는 게 아닌 진실. 정말로 천재다. 실제로 대중가요 평론가들이 칼럼에서 말했다. 타이틀에서 정우담이 신채윤에게 화제성을 양보한 데엔, 치밀한 계산과 전략이 들어간 것으로 보인다고. 이렇게. 내 솔로 가창이 듣고 싶으면 수록곡을 들어. ‘···찢었다. 뿌-뿌-뿌-.’ 최봄이는 두 발로 바닥을 콩콩 두드렸다. 그렇게 정우담은 리스너들을 수록곡으로 유도하는 데 성공했다. 타이틀이 앞장서고, 수록곡들이 아장아장 쫓아간다. 그때였다. 지잉. 지잉. 신인개발팀이 단체 메시지를 돌렸다. [신개팀] -오늘 보컬 그룹 마지막 데뷔 인원 발표되니까, 학교 끝나면 어디 들르지 말고 바로 오기~ 결과적으로 Day.G는 1위를 못했다. 상대 보이그룹도 오늘을 놓치면 안 됐고, 팬덤 화력이 압도적으로 차이가 나서 투표 점수를 극복하지 못했다. 그래도 연예 커뮤니티엔 비단 보이그룹의 승리가 아니란 우스갯소리가 올라왔다. [최종 승자는 정우담 아닐까?] -정우담 노래들에 데이지까지, 점수 다 합치면 남돌보다 거의 3배 높던데 댓글: └기적의 계산법ㄷㄷㄷ └근데 진짜 정우담 출연했으면 트로피 받았을 거 같음 └└그건 아님 투표 땜에 밀려 └ㅇㅇ음원 계속 올라가니까 담주는 몰라도 이번주는 아니야 팬 커뮤니티가 아니다 보니 서슴없이 이런 글이 올라온다. 얼마 전까지 말년 병장이었던 강 씨는 아깝고 Day.G가 안쓰러워 한숨이 푹푹 나왔다. “우리도 오늘이 기회였는데.” 팬들은 멤버들 퇴근길 보고 귀가하려 도보 위에 모여 있었다. 20명 정도. 곧 국산 미니밴이 주차장을 빠져나와 팬들이 모인 장소 앞에 멈춘다. 창문이 열리고 Day.G가 손을 흔든다. “조심히 들어가세요!” “오늘도 무대 넘 좋았어! 팬싸에서 봐!” “고맙습니다! 사랑해요!” 차량 통행에 방해가 돼선 안 되니 어쩔 수 없이 출발해야 했고, Day.G는 점점 멀어지는 팬들을 후방 창으로 바라봤다. “다음엔 1위 해서 팬들 기쁘게 해주고 싶다.” “···난 1위 후보에 들었단 것도 안 믿겨.” “사실 나도, 아까 심장 멈췄었어.” “석션!” 가슴팍을 누르며 장난까지 치는 멤버들. 1위를 못 시켜줬다고 아쉬워하는 팬들에겐 미안하지만, 이 모든 상황 자체가 깜짝 선물 같아 여전히 밝기만 했다. 동시에 전화가 걸려온다. 매니저가 블루투스 통화 버튼을 눌렀다. “네, 사장님.” -애들이랑 있지? “다음 스케줄로 가고 있어요.” -곡비 마련 중이긴 한데, 작곡가님이 들어보고 주셔도 된다고 파일 보냈거든? 모노디가 말하는 작곡가가 누구인지 모르는 사람은 이 안에 아무도 없었다. 멤버들이 헉 소리를 낸다. “벌써요?” -두 곡이야. 트로피컬 하우스랑 샘플링한 걸스힙합. 별로면 편하게 말해달라고 하셨어. 저지클럽 장르도 하나 있으시다고. 방금, 그것까지 다 들어봤고. 모노디의 목소리는 비장하기까지 했다. -4세대 인기 걸그룹들 하는 거, 우리도 한다. “···네?” -걸스힙합은 선공개, 트로피컬 하우스를 타이틀로 말이야. 두 곡을 다음 앨범에 함께 싣겠단 결정. -그리고 그다음 컴백에선 저지클럽. 그렇게 올해 안으로 쐐기 박자. 3부작을 계약했지만, 끝내 정우담이 일시적인 프로듀싱(S) 상태에서 쓴 세 곡 모두 Day.G에게 가게 됐다. “대박!” “가, 감사합니다! 사장님!” 진즉에 팔 수 있는 걸 다 팔아치운 모노디지만, 이를 위해 아직 팔지 않고 있던 것까지 매물로 내놓았다. 바로 집. 아이돌 활동엔 곡비만 드는 게 아니니까. 컴백 할 때마다 수억에서 십수억이 든다. 즉, 정우담으로부터 받은 세 곡이 인생을 걸어도 되는 급이란 판단이 선 것이다. 우담은 스케줄이 없을 땐 신채윤과 김다빈의 보컬 트레이닝을 해주려 했다. 하지만 쫓겨났다. ‘원래 내가 다빈 씨 레슨 쌤이었고, 채윤 씨는 같은 아카데미 취미반이었는데 왜.’ 그때와 달라진 것이다. 그녀들에게 정우담은 이제 쌤과 아카데미 오빠가 아닌 프로듀서다. 그동안 정우담 앞에서도 떨지 않고 잘만 불렀었는데, 오늘은 무지하게 긴장하며 피치 브레이크를 내기도 했다. 쉽게 말해 삑사리. 그래서 트레이닝은 MNS 전속 트레이너가 계속 맡을 테니, 우담에겐 월말평가를 부탁했다. 과제를 정해주고 그걸 잘 따르고 있는지 봐주면 충분하단 것이다. 대신, 중간중간 연습실을 방문해 고충을 들어주고 함께 식사도 하면서 가까워지기로 했다. ‘애초에 가까웠었는데 가까워지기 위한 식사?’ 프로듀서 없이 셀프 프로듀싱을 하는 정우담은 모르겠지만, 그게 일반적인 데뷔조와 프로듀서의 관계이긴 하다. 덕분에 우담은 일찍 작업실에 들어왔다. 숙소 작업실이 아닌 사옥 내의 리우 작업실. 메인 작업실에 비하면 작긴 해도 있을 건 다 있었다. 장비 수준도 정우담의 숙소보다 높다. 그러자 리우가 질문한다. “형님, 하드디스크 가지러 다녀오시지 않아도 돼요?” “숙소 다녀올 시간에.” 여기서 만드는 게 빠를 것이다. 정우담은 리우와 자리를 교대해 트랙을 써내려갔다. 짜잔. 신주놀 예능팀이 왔을 때 들려줬던 얼터너티브 R&B가 즉석에서 나왔다. 리우는 턱이 빠지게 입을 벌렸다. ‘···머리에 컴퓨터라도 들어있으신가?’ 서지안과 고등학생 시절 밴드를 했었다고 알려졌듯, 리우는 우담이 그때부터 음악뿐인 삶을 살아왔을 거라 여겼다. ‘그뿐 아니라, 음악을 즐기고 사랑하시는 거지. 그렇지 않고선 어떻게 이게 되겠어?’ 일적으로 음악을 하는 사람이 아닐 것이다. 취미가 본업이 되면 오히려 실력이 떨어지는 사람들이 있으니 말이다. 그런데 정우담은 나날이 실력이 늘어난다. 데뷔 앨범에 채운 곡들보다, 뚝딱 만든 이 노래가 더 좋게도 들렸다. ‘정말 이걸 내가 불러도 돼?’ 물론, 아직은 초안이라 많은 게 빠져있다. 악기별 트랙을 지금보다 최소 2배는 더 집어넣고, 인트로 비트를 3분 길이로 늘린 거라 멜로디 코드도 들어가야 한다. ‘이 상태로 발매해도 될 퀄리티긴 해도.’ 그래서 궁금했다. 이렇게 음악을 사랑하는 정우담인데, 어째서 사랑 노래는 쓰질 않는지. “형님 노래엔 왜 사랑이나 이별이 없어요?” “사랑으로 가기까지의 여정이 더 설레지 않아요? 라는 건, MNS 엔터에서 준비해준 인터뷰 답안이고.” “그러면요?” “안 해봤으니까요.” 심플한 답변이었다. “···한 번도?” “네.” 반대로 우담도 콜라보를 하게 된 리우의 음악성에 대해 물었다. “리우 선배님은.” “아유, 편하게 불러주세요. 저도 후배님이 아니라 형님, 형님 할 테니까 형님도 이름으로 불러주세요.” “그럼 리우 씨?” “말 놓으셔도 되는데, 그게 편하시다면 느긋하게 기다리겠습니다.” “리우 씨는 왜 전부 사랑 노래예요?” 두 사내가 나누기엔 오글거리는 대화. 그러나 리우는 진지했다. “전 사랑을 하고 있습니다.” “저번에 기자님 번호 받았는데.” “아니! 누굴 사귀는 게 아니라 팬들이요! 몇 달에 한 번 활동하는 거라, 그때만이라도 팬들한테 사랑한다고 말하고 싶거든요. 저도 모쏠이기도 하고.” 동질감. 덕분에 작업이 빨라졌다. 모쏠이 작곡의 필수 요소라기보단, 어떠어떠한 노래를 만들지 의견 교류가 활발해졌다. 연인에 대한 애정이 아니었으니, 정우담도 두루뭉술하게 생각하지 않아도 됐다. 심지어 리우에게 그 점을 배웠다. ‘팬들을 향한 애정이라.’ 아직은 완벽하게 이해가 되진 않는다. 그렇게 리우와 테마를 정하고, 어떤 사운드가 들어갔으면 한다는 주문을 받거나 또는 우담이 보기엔 맞지 않아 내치면서. 점점 콜라보 곡이 형태를 잡아가던 그 순간. “우담 씨.” 이규성 과장이 작업실을 찾아왔다. 우담은 리우에게 잠시 나갔다 오겠다며, 이규성 과장을 따라 이동했다. 연습실층으로 가는 길에 그가 이런저런 얘기를 한다. “우담 씨한테 유료 소통 어플 입점 제안이 왔어요.” “저요? 그거 팬들이 돈 내고 연예인이랑 대화하는 메신저?” “네. 대형기획사가 운영하는 건데, 이런 식으로 타 소속 아티스트들도 입점하곤 해요. 꼭 해야 한다는 건 아니니까 찬찬히 고민해 보고 답 주세요.” “알겠습니다.” “그리고 팬레터도 검수가 다 끝났으니까 오늘 가실 때 드릴게요.” 팬레터에 뭐가 들어있을지 몰라 일차적으로 직원들이 보고 아티스트에게 전달해준다. 이규성이 킥킥 웃었다. “팬들이 각자 비결을 담은 김치볶음밥 레시피가 절반 이상이에요.” 행사 초청도 왔다고 말하는데, 복도에 나온 연습생이 지그시 정우담을 보고 있어 제대로 듣질 못했다. 우담은 비주얼 튜너 안경을 쓴 상태였다. [최봄이] -컨디션: 100% 저번 보컬 그룹 데뷔조를 뽑을 때 60% 컨디션으로 다른 연습생들을 압도하던 고1. 포텐셜이 높지만, 다른 멤버들과의 나이 차 때문에 보류가 됐었다. 그런데. 갑자기 컨디션이 떨어진다. [최봄이] -컨디션: 90% -컨디션: 80% -컨디션: 70% ‘뭐야? 나 보고 기분 나빠진 거야?’ 게다가 처음 신채윤을 봤을 때처럼 사교성이 없어 지은 무표정이 아닌, 사람을 관찰하듯이 뜯어보는 느낌이 담긴 무표정이었다. ‘어린애들은 무서워.’ 그래도 오늘, 정우담은 기필코 최봄이 이상의 포텐셜을 가진 연습생이 없다면 그녀를 데뷔조에 합류시킬 생각이었다. 연습실에 들어가기 전, 이규성은 최봄이와 눈싸움하는 정우담을 말리며 하던 말을 이었다. “행사 초청이요, 우담 씨.” “아, 네. 행사요. 저 행사 뛰고 싶습니다.” “그게, 일본이에요. Mrsquid로 간 문의인데 저희한테 넘겼거든요.” 이젠 Mrsquid도 개인적인 연락은 우담에게 해도, 스케줄 관련은 MNS 엔터에 보낸다. “일본이요?” “카와이 베이스 페스티벌이 게임사 주최로 열린대요. 공연자 이미 다 나왔는데, 야금야금까지 듣고 부랴부랴 우담 씨를 초대하고 싶다네요.” “그런 페스티벌도 있어요?” “서브 컬쳐 계에선 꽤 메이저 행사래요.” 첫 행사는 정우담이 아닌 WD에게 온 것이었다.","output":"< Event > At an arts high school in Seoul. There was a female student who read books even during breaks. It wasn't a textbook. The male students glanced at the literary girl. Even though more than a month had passed since the first year's entrance ceremony, no one had managed to have a conversation with her. \\"Every break, she's either on her phone or reading a book.\\" \\"She doesn't seem particularly intellectual, but it's fascinating.\\" Her visible image was cuteness to the max. What on earth was she reading? She peeked at the book cover without getting caught. [Sailing Towards Success] It was a self-help book with a title like a rap rhyme. Then she closed the book and took out her phone. The girl, whose name tag read 'Choi Bom-i,' was looking at SNS. 'Did Udam-ing eat kimchi fried rice again?' It was a sighting of Jeong Woo-dam. A photo of him entering a snack bar after coming out of the MNS Enter Content Team and a traditional instrument workshop. By the way, Udam-ing is a nickname used by fans. Someone mistyped Udam as Udam-ing, and it spread like wildfire. Choi Bom-i, who saved the photo, looked at the music show's number one prediction chart floating around SNS and logged into the fan cafe to write a post. She goes by the nickname RaccoonThunderstorm. [Today, all three of Udam-ing's songs are nominees for first place!] -But winning first place seems tough, right? Comments: └It's tough since he's not appearing on the showㅜ └It's a shame Looking at the prediction chart, one can guess who will win first place. Originally, the fourth-generation representative girl group Babe should have monopolized first place following last week, but they didn't release an album because it was a pre-release song activity. That means an album score of zero. Moreover, they're not active this week. 'They'll probably start full album promotions and title stage performances next week.' But even so, it was Babe, and no one expected the pre-release song to drop out of the first-place nominees. It must be seen as the other first-place nominee fans gritting their teeth, thinking today is their only chance. 'Aside from Udam-ing, there's one boy group left for Daisy.' On the prediction chart, the two teams are fiercely competing. The boy group has the album sales, while Day.G has the digital sales. The boy group is slightly ahead, but there's the variable of voting scores, which can only be known after counting. Especially since the wealthy fans of Day.G have launched a major pre-voting encouragement event. It's also because Jeong Woo-dam gave them a good song that they got the opportunity to hold the event. 'Udam-ing, an amazing person.' Choi Bom-i smiled, looking at the photo of Udam she saved. She has been watching Jeong Woo-dam since before his debut. At first, it was the impression of his warm and kind appearance, and secondly, rumors of a composing genius began to surface, which piqued her curiosity. Then, when he was about to debut, she thought, 'What a breaker of norms.' After listening to his debut album, she realized why MNS Enter was so eager. 'And now he's even a vocal group producer.' Choi Bom-i knew things that would be difficult to know unless she was an insider at MNS Enter. Because she is a trainee who is on hold for inclusion in the vocal group that Jeong Woo-dam will produce. Not a solo aspirant, but part of the girl group trainee section. 'If I could just join Udam-ing's vocal group, I wouldn't regret giving up the dance I've worked so hard on.' Choi Bom-i is called the second Seo Ji-an at the company. In fact, there are about a dozen second Seo Ji-ans at MNS Enter, so it's not significant information, but it means she has talent in vocals as well as dance. The reason why Choi Bom-i so desperately wants to join the vocal group is not simply because she is a fan of Udam. Well, it's similar to the process of becoming a fan. 'Musicality.' Looking at the album, it's not a typical composition. It's full of decisions that others wouldn't include in a debut album, and it succeeded without following the formula for success. The most mainstream genre, <www.>, hides its presence so much that one might wonder if it's a Jeong Woo-dam song or a Shin Chae-yoon song. He suppresses his unique vocal color and focuses on providing harmony. A peculiar song where a man matches the vocal range to a woman. If you've listened to <Go>, you'd know how high Jeong Woo-dam's high notes can go. 'If he had chosen to stand out alone.' The response wouldn't have been this great. It quenched the thirst of listeners who were craving the harmony of a talented mixed-gender duet. Many people like mixed-gender duets, but they don't often climb the charts. Yet the quality exceeded expectations. 'The debut title that a rookie should be noticed for, surely MNS Enter opposed featuring.' Yet if Jeong Woo-dam aimed for this result and pushed it with intention, it's not just a genius label that others casually use to hype him up. He truly is a genius. Music critics have said so in their columns. They believe that Jeong Woo-dam's yielding of topicality to Shin Chae-yoon in the title track involved meticulous calculation and strategy. Like this. If you want to hear my solo singing, listen to the B-side tracks. '...He nailed it. Poo-poo-poo.' Choi Bom-i tapped her feet on the floor. Thus, Jeong Woo-dam successfully led listeners to the B-side tracks. The title track led the way, and the B-side tracks followed adorably. That's when it happened. Ziing. Ziing. The rookie development team sent out a group message. [New Artist Team] -Today, the final members of the vocal group will be announced, so come straight here after school without stopping by anywhere else~ As a result, Day.G didn't win first place. The opposing boy group couldn't afford to miss today either, and the fandom's firepower was overwhelmingly different, so they couldn't overcome the voting scores. Still, the entertainment community posted jokes that it wasn't just the victory of the boy group. [Is Jeong Woo-dam the real winner?] -With Daisy's songs included, Jeong Woo-dam's scores are almost three times higher than the boy group's Comments: └Miraculous calculationㄷㄷㄷ └But really, if Jeong Woo-dam had appeared, he might have won the trophy └└That's not it, he would have been pushed back because of voting └ㅇㅇThe digital sales keep rising, so maybe next week, but not this week Since it's not a fan community, such posts are uploaded without hesitation. Mr. Kang, who was a senior soldier until recently, sighed deeply, feeling sorry for Day.G. \\"It was our chance today too.\\" Fans gathered on the sidewalk to see the members off as they headed home. About 20 people. Soon, a domestic minivan exited the parking lot and stopped in front of the gathered fans. The window rolled down, and Day.G waved their hands. \\"Please get home safely!\\" \\"Today's stage was so good! See you at the fan signing!\\" \\"Thank you! We love you!\\" They had to leave because they couldn't obstruct traffic, and Day.G watched their fans getting farther away through the rear window. \\"I want to win first place next time and make the fans happy.\\" \\"...I can't believe we were even nominated for first place.\\" \\"Honestly, me too, my heart stopped earlier.\\" \\"Section!\\" The members joked, pressing their chests. They felt sorry for the fans for not being able to win first place, but the whole situation still felt like a surprise gift, and they remained cheerful. At the same time, a call came in. The manager pressed the Bluetooth call button. \\"Yes, boss.\\" -Are you with the kids? \\"We're on our way to the next schedule.\\" -I'm arranging for the song fee, but the composer said it's okay to send the file for you to listen to? No one inside didn't know who the composer Monodi was talking about. The members gasped. \\"Already?\\" -There are two songs. Tropical house and girl's hip-hop with sampling. He said to tell him comfortably if you don't like them. He also has a jersey club genre. I just listened to that one too. Monodi's voice was almost solemn. -We're going to do what the popular 4th generation girl groups do. \\"...Yes?\\" -Pre-release the girl's hip-hop, and make the tropical house the title track. The decision to include both songs in the next album. -And for the next comeback, jersey club. Let's drive it home within this year. Although they contracted for a trilogy, in the end, all three songs written by Jeong Woo-dam in a temporary producing (S) state went to Day.G. \\"Awesome!\\" \\"Th-thank you! Boss!\\" Monodi had already sold everything he could, but for this, he even put up for sale what he hadn't sold yet. His house. Because it's not just the song fee that goes into idol activities. Every comeback costs hundreds of millions to tens of billions of won. In other words, the decision was made that the three songs received from Jeong Woo-dam were worth betting his life on. When Udam had no schedule, he intended to give vocal training to Shin Chae-yoon and Kim Da-bin. But he was kicked out. 'I used to be Da-bin's lesson teacher, and Chae-yoon was in the same academy hobby class, so why.' Things had changed. To them, Jeong Woo-dam was no longer a teacher or academy brother but a producer. Even though they had sung confidently in front of Jeong Woo-dam before, today they were extremely nervous and even broke pitch. In simple terms, they hit a wrong note. So the training continued to be handled by MNS's exclusive trainer, and Udam was asked to take care of the end-of-month evaluation. It was enough to set an assignment and see if they were following it well. Instead, they decided to visit the practice room from time to time to listen to their concerns and get closer over meals. 'Originally close, but meals to get closer?' Jeong Woo-dam, who self-produces without a producer, might not know, but that's the typical relationship between a debut group and a producer. Thanks to that, Udam came to the studio early. Not the dorm studio, but the Rio studio inside the company building. Although smaller than the main studio, it had everything needed. The equipment level was higher than Jeong Woo-dam's dorm. Then Rio asked a question. \\"Hyungnim, don't you need to go get the hard drive?\\" \\"There's no time to go to the dorm.\\" It would be faster to create it here. Jeong Woo-dam switched places with Rio and started writing a track. Ta-da. An alternative R&B that he had played for the Shinju Entertainment variety team on the spot came out. Rio's jaw dropped. '...Does he have a computer in his head?' As it was known that Rio had been in a band with Seo Ji-an during high school, he thought Udam had been living a life of music since then. 'Not just that, but he loves and enjoys music. How else could this be possible?' He must not be someone who does music for work. There are people whose skills deteriorate when their hobby becomes their job. But Jeong Woo-dam's skills improve day by day. Even this song, made on the spot, sounded better than the ones filled in his debut album. 'Can I really sing this?' Of course, it's still a draft, and much is missing. The track for each instrument needs to be at least doubled from now, and the intro beat extended to three minutes, so the melody chords need to be added. 'Even in this state, it's good enough to be released.' So he was curious. Jeong Woo-dam loves music so much, so why doesn't he write love songs? \\"Why don't your songs have love or breakups, hyungnim?\\" \\"Isn't the journey to love more exciting? That's the interview answer prepared by MNS Enter.\\" \\"And what about you?\\" \\"I've never experienced it.\\" It was a simple answer. \\"...Not even once?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Conversely, Udam also asked about Rio's musicality, who had become a collaborator. \\"What about you, Rio senior?\\" \\"Ah, please call me comfortably. I'll also call you hyungnim, so you can call me by my name.\\" \\"Then, Rio-ssi?\\" \\"You can speak informally, but if that's comfortable for you, I'll wait patiently.\\" \\"Why are all your songs about love?\\" A cringeworthy conversation for two men to have. But Rio was serious. \\"I'm in love.\\" \\"You got the reporter's number last time.\\" \\"No! It's not about dating someone, it's about the fans! Since I'm only active every few months, I want to tell the fans I love them even if it's just then. I'm also single.\\" Empathy. Thanks to that, the work progressed quickly. Not that being single is an essential element for composing, but the exchange of ideas on what kind of song to make became active. Since it wasn't affection for a lover, Jeong Woo-dam didn't have to think vaguely. He even learned that point from Rio. 'Affection towards fans.' He still didn't fully understand it. As they set the theme with Rio and took orders for what sounds should be included or dismissed by Udam if they didn't seem right. The collab song gradually took shape. \\"Udam-ssi.\\" Section Chief Lee Kyu-sung came to the studio. Udam told Rio he would step out for a moment and followed Lee Kyu-sung. On the way to the practice room floor, he talked about various things. \\"Udam-ssi, there's been a paid communication app entry proposal for you.\\" \\"Me? The messenger where fans pay to talk to celebrities?\\" \\"Yes. It's operated by a major agency, and they do enroll artists from other companies like this. It's not mandatory, so take your time to think about it and give us your answer.\\" \\"Understood.\\" \\"And the fan letters have been screened, so I'll give them to you when you leave today.\\" They don't know what's in the fan letters, so employees first check them and then deliver them to the artists. Lee Kyu-sung chuckled. \\"More than half of the fan letters contain kimchi fried rice recipes with their own secrets.\\" He was talking about an event invitation, but he couldn't hear properly because a trainee in the hallway was staring intently at Jeong Woo-dam. Udam was wearing visual tuner glasses. [Choi Bom-i] -Condition: 100% The high school freshman who dominated other trainees with a 60% condition when selecting the debut group for the vocal group last time. She has high potential, but was put on hold due to the age difference with the other members. But suddenly, her condition dropped. [Choi Bom-i] -Condition: 90% -Condition: 80% -Condition: 70% 'What? Is she upset seeing me?' Moreover, unlike the first time he saw Shin Chae-yoon, it wasn't an expressionless face lacking sociability, but an expressionless face that seemed to scrutinize people. 'Kids are scary.' Still, today, Jeong Woo-dam was determined to include her in the debut group if there were no trainees with potential exceeding Choi Bom-i. Before entering the practice room, Lee Kyu-sung continued his interrupted conversation while stopping Jeong Woo-dam, who was having a staring contest with Choi Bom-i. \\"It's about the event invitation, Udam-ssi.\\" \\"Ah, yes. The event. I want to participate in that event.\\" \\"Well, it's in Japan. It was an inquiry to Mrsquid, but they passed it on to us.\\" Now Mrsquid contacts Udam personally for personal matters, but for schedule-related matters, they contact MNS Enter. \\"Japan?\\" \\"It's the Kawaii Bass Festival, hosted by a game company. The lineup of performers is already out, but they want to invite Udam-ssi urgently after listening to him until the last minute.\\" \\"There's such a festival?\\" \\"It's quite a major event in the subculture scene.\\" The first event invitation was not for Jeong Woo-dam but for WD."},{"instruction":"what is different between udam or Woo-dam ?","output":"In the context provided, \\"Udam\\" and \\"Woo-dam\\" refer to the same person, Jeong Woo-dam.

[가요제.wav] [리우.wav] [With me.wav] 하나만 제목이 나와 있는 상태. 그에 전무가 물었다. “위드미?” “팬송이라고 하셨어요.” 중요도 면에선 세 곡 중 뭐가 위라고 하기 힘든 상황. 일단 순서대로 차근차근 들어보았다. 틋 틋 틋 틋 틋 틋 틋. ‘···다 좋아.’ 그러나 전담팀도 놀랐다. 설마하니 정우담이 팬송을 쓸 줄이야. ‘테마는 서투름과 부족함인가.’ 결핍이 아닌 미숙한 부족함. 어떤 의도로 써내려간 곡인지는 가사만 들어도 알 수 있었다. 우담의 작사 실력이 애석한 걸 떠나, 오히려 온갖 미사여구로 꾸미기보단 이편이 더 진실돼 보이기도 했다. 즉, 정우담은 아직 어떻게 팬들을 대해야 할지 모르니. 팬레터에 대한 화답을 팬송으로 대체한 것. 전무가 실소를 흘렸다. ‘이럴 때만 신인의 풋풋함이 보이시네.’ 하지만 문제가 있었다. 이규성이 말한다. “전무님, 이 퀄리티를 진짜로 음원 플랫폼 말고 유튜브에 올려요?” 피지컬 앨범에 싣지 않더라도, 디지털 단일로 발매해도 정우담의 신곡이라면 리스너들이 알아서 붙을 수 있다. 그래도 되는 퀄리티였다. 음원 플랫폼에 넣는다면 가사는 수정해야겠지만, 우담의 노래답지 않은 잔잔함이 신선한데 그 잔잔함 속의 호소력이 진하다. 또 지금 계절에 듣기도 좋다. 전무도 활동에 열을 올리는 우담의 결정이 의아했다. “내가 연락해볼게.” 전무는 우담에게 전화를 걸었고. -그, 팬들 들으라고 만든 노랜데 다른 사람들이 들으면 부끄럽잖아요. 이런 이유라고 답한다. 벙찐 전담팀, 그래도 그의 선택을 따른다. 웃음은 멈추질 않아도 말이다. “뮤비는 가볍게 동화 같은 컨셉 아트 섭외해서 올려. 일본 가기 전에 업로드하게.” 우담은 영상까진 바라지 않았지만, 전무는 팬들이 더 좋아해주게끔 아이디어를 보탰다. *** 이날, 우담은 아카데미 취미반의 인디 뮤지션 박찬희와 낙원상가에 갔다. ‘네가 데뷔를 했대서 연락을 해도 되나 말아야 되나 갈등 많이 했다.’ 전무만큼은 아니어도 장발에 볼캡을 눌러쓴 박찬희는 여태 그런 생각을 했었다. 하지만 오늘 보자고 먼저 연락한 사람이 그였다. ‘왜 데뷔한다고 안 알려줬는지 모르겠지만, 거들먹거리는 것처럼 보일까 봐 너도 참은 거겠지.’ 아니다. 정우담이 원래 자기 얘기를 잘 안 하는 성격일 뿐이다. ‘그런데 생각해보면 넌 데뷔 직전까지 아카데미를 나오고, 같이 밥도 먹고 내 자작곡 피드백을 해주고. 오늘 보자는 연락에도 나와주고.’ 정우담은 메이저 데뷔를 했어도 그대로 정우담이란 것이다. 그렇기에 박찬희도 평소처럼 사회 친구 대하듯 그를 대했다. “살 거 있으면 말만 해. 내가 사줄게.” “그럼 사양 않고. 가야금에 달 픽업이랑 기타 픽업 사줘.” 우담은 사양이란 걸 모른다. 애초에 뭔갈 사주겠다기에 나온 것이다. 오늘도 피드백 받아도 되겠냐고 하길래. 대신, 국밥은 우담이 쐈다. 오늘 첫 끼였다. 밥을 말고 허겁지겁 먹는 우담에게, 박찬희가 이야기를 꺼냈다. “저번에 네가 피드백해준 거, 빈티지락.” “음악인 지원 프로젝트엔 언제 보내?” “이번 주까지가 접수 기간 끝인데, 그거 내가 살짝 수정했거든? 오르간 넣어보라던 걸, 콤보 오르간을 실제로 쳐서 넣었어.” 정우담이 하란 대로 했는데 거기에 박찬희의 해석을 더했다. “콤보 오르간?” 요즘엔 거의 안 쓰이는 악기다. 신디사이저로 대체할 수 있으니까. 그럼에도 쓴다면. “더 레트로한 분위기 연출해보려고. 일단, 바꾸기 전이랑 바뀐 후 한 번씩 들어볼래?” 박찬희가 일하는 마스터링 스튜디오의 형들은 안 바꾸는 게 낫다고 조언했었다. 정우담의 첫 피드백대로 완성된 그 버전이 훨씬 좋다고 말이다. 그래서 걱정되는 얼굴로 우담의 반응을 살폈다. 이내, 헤드폰을 받아 쓴 정우담은 노래를 듣는 건지, 국밥에 정신이 팔린 건지 기계적으로 숟가락을 움직였다. 국밥을 해치우고 나서야 헤드폰을 벗었다. “바꾼 게 훨 낫다.” “···진심?” “어. 되게 좋은데?” 빈말이 아니었다. 정말로 좋게 들었다. 그제야 박찬희가 속 시원하게 식은 국밥을 먹는다. “휴! 드디어 지원 프로에 넣을 수 있겠네. 그리고 발매되면 작곡가 명단에 너도 올린다?” “내가 사양 않는 사람이긴 해도, 작곡을 안 했는데 왜 올려?” “아, 남들이 네 이름 써서 홍보한다고 생각하려나?” “그건 상관없지만, 픽업 사준다며? 그것도 싼 게 아닌데 뭔 저작권까지. 됐어.” 그래도 박찬희는 우담을 명단에 올릴 셈이었다. 정말로 홍보하려는 목적이 아닌, 픽업만으론 보답이 안 된단 생각이었다. ‘솔직히 지원 프로젝트 통과해도 많이 팔릴 린 없고, 알아보는 사람도 없을 테니까 작곡가 명단까지 뒤져보진 않겠지.’ * 토요일, 우담과 전담팀은 일본 도쿄에 왔다. 공연장 앞에선 한국어도 수시로 들렸다. 여기가 도쿄인지 서울인지 모를 정도였다. 관광객들이 영어로 큼지막하게 써놓은 현수막을 읽는다. “카와이 베이스 페스티벌이 뭐야?” “카와이? 씹덕?” “씹덕이라기보단, 그냥 일본어로 귀엽다는 뜻 아냐? 귀여운 베이스기타 판매 행사장인가?” 누구나 다 아는 장르는 아니다. 그러나 행사장으로 들어가는 사람들 복장을 보자, 한국에서 온 관광객들은 들어갈 시도조차 할 수 없었다. “왜 아저씨가 여자 교복을 입고 있어?” “취, 취향을 존중해드려야지.” 그리고 공연장 실내로 들어가 보면, 각각 대기실마다 A4 용지로 출력한 이름표가 문에 붙어있다. 친절하게도 한글, 영어, 일본어로 써놨다. [더블유디] [ダブルユーディー] [WD] 그 문 앞에, 카와이 베이스씬에선 나름 유명한 일본 동인 밴드가 서 있다. 남자 3명이었고, 게임 파이널 판타지에서 볼 법한 헤어스타일을 하고 있었다. “다브류디. 일본에 왔군.” “Mrsquid에서 엄청 뜨고 있는 뮤지션이잖아?” “게임 센터에 하모하모가 들리던데, 그래서 초대돼 온 건가.” 이들은 WD가 한국인이라는 건 Mrsquid가 포스트에 올려서 안다지만, 한국의 신인 싱어송라이터라는 것까진 몰랐다. 케이팝은 아예 듣질 않으니까. 속내도 시커멨다. “우린 앨범을 내본 적도 있으니, 일본 진출을 도와주겠다고 하면 다리 풀려서 감사하다고 하겠지.” “다리 안 풀리면 내 다리부터 푸는 걸로.” 카와이 베이스 자체가 한국에선 서브 컬쳐 게임에 쓰일 순 있어도 리스너가 한정돼 있다. 서양권에선 제법 팬층이 두텁지만, 오가기엔 일본이 가깝다. 그러니 자기들과 계약해 음원을 내게 할 속셈이었다. “비율은 최저로 해줘도 모를 거야.” 그리고 이들은 문을 두드렸다. 똑똑. “다브류디상!” 끼익, 경첩에서 시끄러운 소음이 나며 문이 열렸다. 열린 문으로 히피 같은 남자가 나타났다. 나이도 꽤 많아 보인다. ‘이게 WD?’ ‘속인 게 들통났다간, 맞을 것 같은데?’ WD를 이용하려던 왜소한 남자들은 얼어붙었다. 히피 남자 뒤론 인디 뮤지션을 따라왔다기엔 너무 많은, 열댓 명이 넘는 사람들도 보였다. 그중엔 이들도 아는 여성 아티스트까지 있었다. ‘미나미?’ 보컬로이드 프로듀서 출신으로 메이저에서도 잘나가는 싱어송라이터. 그런 미나미가 왜 WD의 대기실에? 그러자 전형적인 일본의 중년 회사원 인상의 남자가 히피 옆으로 왔다. 노크를 하길래 문을 열었지만, 정작 전무는 일본어를 못하니 그 남자가 대신 방문객들을 보내기 위함이었다. 게다가 그 중년 남자는 이들도 미디어에서 본 적 있는 사람, 미나미가 속한 에이전시의 대표였다. “비즈니스 미팅 중입니다.” 미나미는 마침 스케줄이 없었는데 정우담이 일본에 온다기에, 페스티벌이 시작되기 전에 챌린지를 하나 또 찍으려 대표를 따라온 것이다. 정우담은 리허설 시작 전에 사람들이 자꾸 찾아와 일본어 멘트를 외울 틈도 없었다. “미나상, 아에떼 후레시 데스.” “우레시이 데스 데스.” 만나서 기쁘단 인사를 미나미가 정정해주었고, 대기실을 찾아왔던 세 남자는 이따가 공연 잘하시란 응원을 건네며 물러났다. 대기실로 돌아와 하마터면 큰일 날 뻔했다며 한숨을 몰아 내쉬었다. “미나미네 회사랑 비즈니스 미팅?” “WD, 그 사람 혹시 거물이야?” 일본 데뷔도 전인데 거물 취급이긴 했다. 미나미의 소속사 외에도, 한국 연예계 소식에 밝은 대형 에이전시까지 우담을 만나려 카와이 베이스 페스티벌에 오는 중이었다.","output":"< Festival > Jeong Woo-dam received fan letters for the first time.

However, these weren't chapters of a novel that led to the next, but once he read one letter, his hand automatically reached for the next. It was because he could feel the sincerity in them. There were many with cute handwriting, and some were crooked and hard to read, but none showed signs of being erased and rewritten. They could have been printed and sent, but they were all handwritten. 'I would have crossed out with a pen and rewritten it.' To continue writing without interruption, they must have drafted it somewhere else first. Still, they might have rewritten it several times if they weren't satisfied. The content was mostly about giving kimchi fried rice recipes followed by words of encouragement. -I'll start by telling you how to make kimchi since it's the life of kimchi fried rice (in Gothic font) -I live on Ulleungdo, so I can't go to public broadcasts, but I'll definitely come to see you when I become a university student! Until then, don't get hurt -The behind-the-scenes of the profile shoot is my favorite videoㅋㅋ The photo where you tried to look charismatic with your eyes, thinking of mosquitoesㅋㅋㅋ -After watching the music video and listening to the lyrics, for some reason, it just felt like my own story. I should be cheering you on in a fan letter, but in reality, I'm the one being cheered up by your songs :) -Udam-ing appeared in my dream and stole my wallet The last one seemed to be from a fan who had seen him during a music show after eating an Aura (A) fruit. For two hours while the fruit's effect lasted, those who saw Udam would see him in their dreams too, according to the description. 'But why did he appear as a pickpocket?' It wasn't a prophetic dream, was it? He found himself chuckling at the thought. Before he knew it, it was the last fan letter. He had intended to spread them out over several days, but he ended up reading them all at once. It was a peculiar feeling. He wanted to share his feelings about the fan letters with his teddy bears, but since he would be a spoiler of emotions, he just got up from his seat. The teddy bears were in the midst of labor reminiscent of the military. -Hot-doo! -Hot-doo! Even if the small world inside the wooden bag was still winter, the sun was so bright that the frozen ground had softened considerably. That's why they suddenly started digging the ground with a shovel. After digging as deep as a child's height, at the request of the teddy bears, the chubby 2woong lay down in that spot. -Ong. Udam was worried. \\"Are you going to bury 2woong?\\" Of course not. 2woong quickly got up, gave a thumbs up, and then started to widen the dug ground and fill it with stones. It was getting closer to the thin stream that slightly overlapped the edge of the garden. \\"They're making a swimming pool.\\" It would only be good for cold water friction for now, but it seemed to show the characteristics of a polar bear. The teddy bears were always busy. They were always doing something every time he saw them. Udam was the same. It was time to go to the studio. He intended to finish the collab song with Rio and the song for the music festival today, but first, he wanted to write a track he had been wanting to write. After swallowing the composing fruit series. 'The second song with only guitar accompaniment is coming out.' Udam set the microphone to chair height and picked up Veronica. He strummed the strings to find the notes that felt right. \\"Let's start with B major, F#, G# minor, E.\\" He came up with a melody that sounded good on acoustic. Then he repeated the four chords. The genre was medium-tempo pop. \\"With me, stay on with me.\\" Perhaps because he raised Rhythm & Soul to grade A, the message delivery seemed stronger. *** The next day. In the office, Lee Kyu-sung was organizing the schedule. 'Going to Japan on the weekend.' It was Udam's personal event, but the dedicated team would also follow. Aside from one business deal, they could enjoy a vacation and return. 'There's been ongoing meeting discussions with Minami's agency.' For overseas expansion, a local agency is needed. Naturally, as MNS Enter is in charge of Udam's management, it would be a collaboration between Minami's agency and MNS Enter. 'I wonder how Udam will be in Japan.' He was curious about when Udam would officially debut in Japan, whether he would gain attention as he did in Korea upon debut. 'Aside from idols, it's known that solo artists from idol groups or actors are popular.' It's rare for a Korean solo singer-songwriter to be popular in Japan. He would have to discuss the demand forecast in detail at this business meeting. Then. Jeong Woo-dam called. -Manager. I want to upload a song to my channel managed by MNS Enter. \\"On YouTube, not a music platform?\\" Lee Kyu-sung was surrounded by the executive and employees. He had sent the variety show song and the collab song with Rio. [Music Festival.wav] [Rio.wav] [With me.wav] Only one had a title. The executive asked. \\"With me?\\" \\"He said it's a fan song.\\" In terms of importance, it was hard to say which of the three songs was on top. They listened to them one by one in order. Tut tut tut tut tut tut tut. '...They're all good.' But the dedicated team was surprised. They never expected Jeong Woo-dam to write a fan song. 'The theme is clumsiness and inadequacy.' Not a lack but an immature inadequacy. The intention behind the song was clear just by listening to the lyrics. Aside from Udam's regrettable lyric-writing skills, it seemed more genuine than being adorned with all sorts of fancy words. In other words, Jeong Woo-dam still didn't know how to treat his fans. So he replaced his response to the fan letters with a fan song. The executive chuckled. 'Only now does he show the freshness of a rookie.' But there was a problem. Lee Kyu-sung said. \\"Executive, are we really uploading this quality to YouTube instead of a music platform?\\" Even if it wasn't on a physical album, as a digital single, it could attract listeners just because it's a new song by Jeong Woo-dam. The quality was good enough. If it were to be put on a music platform, the lyrics would need to be edited, but the calmness, uncharacteristic of Udam's songs, was refreshing, and the appeal within that calmness was strong. It also sounded good for the current season. The executive was puzzled by Udam's decision to be so active. \\"I'll contact him.\\" The executive called Udam. -That, it's a song made for fans to listen to, it would be embarrassing if others heard it. He replied with this reason. The stunned dedicated team followed his choice. Even if they couldn't stop laughing. \\"Let's upload a light music video with a fairy tale-like concept art. Upload it before we go to Japan.\\" Udam didn't expect a video, but the executive added ideas to make the fans happier. *** That day, Udam went to Nakwon Arcade with indie musician Park Chan-hee from the academy hobby class. 'I struggled a lot whether to contact you after hearing you debuted.' Park Chan-hee, not as much as the executive but with long hair and a ball cap pressed down, had been thinking that. But he was the one who contacted Udam first to meet today. 'I don't know why you didn't tell me about your debut, maybe you held back thinking it would seem boastful.' No. It's just that Jeong Woo-dam naturally doesn't talk about himself. 'But thinking about it, you came to the academy until right before your debut, ate with me, gave feedback on my songs, and even came out when I asked to meet today.' Jeong Woo-dam was still the same Jeong Woo-dam, even after making a major debut. That's why Park Chan-hee treated him as usual, like a friend from society. \\"Let me know if you want to buy something. I'll buy it for you.\\" \\"Then I won't refuse. Buy me a gayageum pickup and a guitar pickup.\\" Udam doesn't know how to refuse. He came out because he said he would buy something. He even asked if he could get feedback today. Instead, Udam paid for the beef soup. It was his first meal of the day. As Udam devoured the soup, Park Chan-hee brought up a topic. \\"That song you gave feedback on last time, vintage rock.\\" \\"When are you sending it to the music support project?\\" \\"The submission period ends this week, but I slightly modified it. You told me to try adding an organ, so I actually played a combo organ and added it.\\" Park Chan-hee followed Jeong Woo-dam's advice and added his own interpretation. \\"Combo organ?\\" It's an instrument that's hardly used these days. It can be replaced with a synthesizer. But if it's used. \\"I tried to create a more retro atmosphere. Do you want to listen to both the original and the changed version?\\" The mastering studio guys where Park Chan-hee worked advised not to change it. They said the version completed with Jeong Woo-dam's first feedback was much better. So, with a worried face, he watched for Udam's reaction. Soon, Jeong Woo-dam put on the headphones and mechanically moved his spoon, whether he was listening to the song or lost in the beef soup. After finishing the soup, he took off the headphones. \\"The changed one is much better.\\" \\"...Really?\\" \\"Yeah. It's really good?\\" It wasn't just lip service. He genuinely liked it. Finally, Park Chan-hee ate his cooled soup with relief. \\"Phew! Now I can submit it to the support project. And when it's released, should I put your name on the composer list?\\" \\"Why would you list me when I didn't compose it?\\" \\"Ah, do you think people will use your name for promotion?\\" \\"That doesn't matter, but you said you'd buy the pickups? They're not cheap, and now you're talking about royalties too. Forget it.\\" Still, Park Chan-hee intended to list Udam. Not for promotional purposes, but because he felt that just the pickups weren't enough to repay him. 'Honestly, even if it passes the support project, it won't sell much, and no one will recognize it, so they probably won't look up the composer list.' * On Saturday, Udam and the dedicated team arrived in Tokyo, Japan. Korean could be heard frequently in front of the concert hall. It was hard to tell if this was Tokyo or Seoul. Tourists read the banners written in large English letters. \\"What's Kawaii Bass Festival?\\" \\"Kawaii? Otaku?\\" \\"Rather than otaku, doesn't it just mean cute in Japanese? Is it a sales event for cute bass guitars?\\" It's not a genre everyone knows. But looking at the attire of those entering the venue, the tourists from Korea couldn't even attempt to enter. \\"Why is that man wearing a girls' school uniform?\\" \\"Let's, let's respect his taste.\\" And if you go inside the venue, each waiting room has a nameplate printed on A4 paper attached to the door. Kindly written in Korean, English, and Japanese. [WD] [ダブルユーディー] [WD] In front of that door, a somewhat famous Japanese doujin band in the Kawaii Bass scene was standing. There were three men, with hairstyles that could be seen in the game Final Fantasy. \\"WD. You've come to Japan.\\" \\"Isn't he the musician who's really hot on Mrsquid?\\" \\"I heard Hamo Hamo in the game center, so is that why he was invited?\\" They knew WD was Korean because Mrsquid posted it, but they didn't know he was a rookie singer-songwriter from Korea. They don't listen to K-pop at all. Their intentions were dark. \\"They've released an album before, so if they say they'll help with the Japanese debut, they'll probably be so grateful they'll fall over.\\" \\"If they don't fall over, I'll start with my own legs.\\" Kawaii Bass itself could be used in subculture games in Korea, but the listener base is limited. In the Western world, there's a decent fan base, but Japan is closer. So they intended to contract with them and release music. \\"They won't know even if we give them the lowest rate.\\" And they knocked on the door. Knock knock. \\"WD-san!\\" Creak, the door opened with a noisy sound from the hinges. A hippie-like man appeared from the opened door. He looked quite old. 'Is this WD?' 'If they find out we've been deceived, we might get hit, right?' The diminutive men who intended to use WD froze. Behind the hippie man, there were too many people to be indie musicians, over a dozen. Among them were female artists they recognized. 'Minami?' A singer-songwriter who's doing well in the majors, originally a Vocaloid producer. Why was Minami in WD's waiting room? Then a man with the typical impression of a middle-aged Japanese company employee came next to the hippie. He opened the door because they knocked, but since the executive didn't speak Japanese, the man came to send the visitors away. Moreover, the middle-aged man was someone they had seen in the media, the representative of the agency Minami belonged to. \\"We're in the middle of a business meeting.\\" Minami happened to be free when she heard Jeong Woo-dam was coming to Japan, so she followed the representative to shoot another challenge before the festival started. Jeong Woo-dam, before the rehearsal started, had no time to memorize Japanese lines as people kept visiting. \\"Minasan, aetete ureshii desu.\\" \\"Ureshii desu desu.\\" Minami corrected the greeting of being happy to meet, and the three men who visited the waiting room left after wishing good luck with the performance later. Returning to the waiting room, they sighed, almost having a big problem. \\"Business meeting with Minami's company?\\" \\"WD, is that person a big shot?\\" He was treated like a big shot even before his Japanese debut. Aside from Minami's agency, even large agencies well-versed in the Korean entertainment industry were coming to the Kawaii Bass Festival to meet Udam."},{"instruction":"< S > 일요일 오전, 명예퇴직을 한 정우담의 부친은 분리수거를 버리고 집으로 돌아오는 중이었다. ‘제2의 인생이 기대되는군.’ 새로 직장을 구하기보단 처가가 있는 속초에 카페를 개업하고자 바리스타 수업에 등록했다. 우담의 모친도 베이킹 클래스를 다닌다. 카페에 어울릴 몇 가지 음식도 팔려 한다. 카페로 대성공을 하겠다기보단, 유지만 할 수 있으면 좋겠단 생각이다. 30년 넘게 해온 직장생활. 바닷가를 산책하며 유유자적 살길 꿈꿔왔다. 그때였다. 옆집 이웃이 그를 부른다. “아버님, 어제 예능에 우담이 맞죠? 안경을 안 써서 몰라봤는데, 저희 아들이 우담이 형이라고 하더라고요.” 부친은 고민했다. 갑작스레 데뷔한 아들이라 유명해진다는 보장이 없어도, 언젠가 유명해진다면 이웃이건 지인들이건 먼 친척이건 알아보는 사람들이 생길 터. ‘그랬는데 바로 인기 예능에 나와버렸어.’ 지상파의 파급력은 상상 이상이었다. 음악방송에도 출연하긴 했었는데, 그거야 보는 사람들만 보는 방송. 반면 신주놀은 열 명 중 한 명이 본다고 해도 과언이 아닌, 시청률이 10% 나오는 인기 예능이다. 사실 부친이 챙겨보는 예능은 아니지만, 어제 우담이 알려줘서 모처럼 시청했다. 게다가 부친은 아들 이야기로 접근하는 사람들과는 가급적 대화를 오래 하지 않기로 정했다. 10년을 보아온 이웃이라 할지라도. “전 모르는 일입니다.” 그에 이웃은 놀랐다. “···예?” 아무래도. 우담은 부모의 반대를 무릅쓰고 가수가 된 것 같다. ‘어쩐지. 휴무 때면 항상 집에 오던 아들인데, 두 달 전부턴 아예 안 오고 있잖아?’ 이웃은 집에 돌아와 대학생인 아들에게 말했다. “아들, 엄마 방금 우담이 형 아버지 만났거든?” “그게 왜요?” “우담이 형이 가수 되는 걸, 부모님은 반대했었나 봐.” 무리도 아니다. 가수로 잘되기가 어디 쉽겠나. 부모님이시니 정우담 걱정에 안정적인 삶을 살길 원했을 것이다. 그래서 더욱 우담이 멋있어 보였다. “이거 완전 락인데요?!” 락 스피릿. 정우담은 그가 다니는 대학교에서도 유명하다. 부업으로 음악을 하다가 MNS 엔터와 파트너쉽을 맺고 데뷔한 사람. 더구나 걸그룹에게도 곡을 주고, 알고 보니 서지안과는 동창에 내일 컴백하는 자이언도 정우담에게 타이틀을 받았다고 한다. 심지어 데뷔한 지 얼마 되지도 않아 바로 인기 예능에 출연했다. ‘우담이 형은 반대하는 부모님을 안심시키려 어서 성공하겠단 거야.’ 어쩌다 정우담과 집 앞에서 마주치면 인사만 한 게 전부였지만, 지금은 우상이 되고 말았다. 한 편 그 시각. “땡큐!” 2일 차 카와이 베이스 페스티벌 공연을 마친 정우담은 바삐 전담팀의 배웅을 받으며 공항으로 향했다. “우담 씨, 제 충전기 가져가세요.” 이규성 과장이 폰 충전기를 줬다. 우담은 실수로 일본에 올 때 충전기를 가지고 오질 않아 내내 빌려 썼는데, 신주놀 방영 후 메시지가 잔뜩 오는 바람에 배터리가 너무 빨리 닳고 있다. “감사합니다. 휴가 잘 보내세요.” 전담팀은 모레까지 휴가. 정우담의 첫 스튜디오 예능 녹화지만, 서지안의 매니저였던 일당백 실장이 붙어 있고 한국 공항에 도착하거든 곧장 MNS 스탭들과 합류한다. 무엇보다, 이때 아니고선 휴가를 보낼 때가 없다고 판단했다. 전무가 말한다. “이번 주도 바쁠 겁니다. 가요제 안무 외우시랴, 자이언 씨 컴백 쇼케이스 참석에 리우 녹음 디렉팅, 드라마 OST 미팅도 가셔야 하니까요.” 정우담의 스케줄만 꽉 찬 게 아니라 전무는 전무대로 바쁘다. 휴가지만, 일본에서의 시장 조사와 정우담 수요 예측을 하고 갈 예정이다. 일본 데뷔 시기로 언제가 좋을지. 어떤 스타일이 선호되는지 등등. 세타 프로덕션이 알아서 잘할 거라고 무작정 맡길 수만은 없다. 못 미더워서가 아니라, 세타 프로가 하는 말을 MNS 엔터가 이해를 못 해선 안 되기 때문이다. 서지안도 일본 활동을 한다지만, 내수 전용곡이란 걸 안 낸다. 일본 방송에도 출연하지 않는다. 한국 싱글 그대로 공연하고 돌아가는 식이다. 정우담은 그녀와 방향성이 아예 다르다. ‘우담 씨가 MNS 엔터를 믿고 매니지먼트 계약을 했으니.’ 음악 창작과 정해진 스케줄 외엔 아무것도 신경 쓸 필요 없게 만들어줘야 한다. 어차피 한국 가서 볼 텐데, 전무는 정우담과 악수를 나누고 헤어졌다. “조심히 가세요.” “네. 먼저 가겠습니다.” 우담은 일본을 다녀가긴 하는 건지 어떤 감흥도 없이, 실장과 공항으로 걸어 들어갔다. 수속 절차를 밟으러 가는 중에 한 번 멈춰야 했지만 말이다. “에! 종우다무 상?!” 어느 여자가 우담을 보고 놀란 것이다. “우담 씨를 아시나 본데요?” 실장은 언제든 정우담의 앞을 가로막을 셈이었지만, 여성은 일정 거리를 유지한 채 다가오지 않았다. 우담이 인사했다. “안녕하세요.” “조또, 에엣! 진챠?” 우담이 고개를 갸웃했다. “진챠?” “일본에서 요새 한국어를 섞어 쓰는 게 유행이래요.” “아, 진짜를 말하는 거였어요?” 그나저나, 그래서 뭘 어떻게 해야 하지? 정우담은 어떤 액션을 취해야 할지 몰라 당황스러웠다. 사인을 요구한다면 쑥스러워도 해드리면 되는데, 계속 놀라고만 있다. 덕분에 실장이 시계를 보고 이끌었다. “이제 가시죠.” “네. 안녕히 계세요.” 알아봐 준 여성에게 인사하니 혼이 나간 얼굴로 황급히 폰을 꺼내 사진을 찍기 바쁘다. 찰칵찰칵. 카와이 베이스 페스티벌에선 관객들이 어색하게 리듬을 타는 게 고작이었다. 우담의 사진을 찍는 관객이 아무도 없었는데, 공항에서 처음 찍혔다. 김포 공항에 도착해선 더했다. 비행기에서 내리자마자, 폰을 본 실장이 의미심장한 말을 한다. “···우담 씨, 지금부턴 멈추지 말고 제 옆에 바짝 붙어서 따라와 주세요.” “무슨 일 있어요?” 곧, 고막을 때리는 외침에 정우담도 이게 뭔 일인지 모를 수 없게 됐다. 게이트를 나가자 MNS 엔터의 가드팀과 코디, 메이크업 스탭이 빨리 이쪽으로 오라고 손짓한다. “정우담 씨! 여기 봐주세요!” “우담앜!” “오빠!” 기자들과 팬, 그리고 팬은 아닌 듯한데 대포 카메라를 들고 정우담을 찍는 사람들이 제법. 아니, 꽤 많았다. 우담은 영문을 몰랐다. 성공적으로 카와이 베이스 페스티벌을 끝내고 왔다고 축하하러 모여준 건가? 사람들 잘 모르는 행사던데? 하지만 합류한 MNS 스탭들이 꼬여도 너무 꼬인 거라고 알려준다. “오늘 출국하는 인기 아이돌이 있었는데, 마침 우담 씨 입국 소식을 안 팬들이 도착하니까 기자들까지 붙은 거예요.” 인터넷 좀 뒤져보면 연예인 항공권 정보를 아는 건 일도 아니라고 하지만, 오늘은 그게 아니었다. 일본 공항에서 찍힌 사진이 SNS에 올라오면서 팬들에게 알려진 것이다. 또한 기자들도 인기 아이돌 출국 사진만 찍고 가려다가, 운 좋게 신주놀 가요제로 인해 화제가 되고 있는 정우담을 만나 그냥 보내지 않았다. “우담 씨! 손가락 하트 해주세요!” 오래 붙잡혔다간 신주놀 촬영에 지각할지 모른다. 실장은 양해를 구하고, 그래도 사진은 찍을 수 있는 속도로 걷게 했다. “죄송합니다! 바로 촬영장으로 가야 해서요!” “이쪽으로 정면 포즈 해주세요!” “정면 포즈.” “똑같이 말해달라는 게 아니라.” 5분이면 주차장으로 갈 수 있는 걸 어쩔 수 없이 지체됐다. “어유, 늦지 않게 빠져나왔네.” 대처할 틈도 없이 발생한 일이라 일당백인 실장조차 진땀을 뺐다. ‘···우담 씨 인기가 생각보다도 더.’ 빠르게 늘고 있다. 오늘처럼 방심하는 일 없게 조심해야겠다. 실장은 시간을 체크했다. 다행히 지각할 정돈 아니다. 애초에 그렇게 촉박하게 일정을 잡지도 않았다. 다른 게스트들보다 일찍 도착하기 위해 서두르는 것이었다. “샵은 못 들르겠네요.” “전 괜찮습니다.” 샵 대신 메이크업 스탭에게 분장을 받기로 하고는, 곧바로 방송사로 향했다. 그리고 상암의 방송사에 도착한 이들은 작가를 따라 대기실을 찾아갔다. 실장이 그녀에게 물었다. “혹시 먼저 오신 분 계신가요?” “우담 씨가 1등이에요. 출연자들도 도착 전이에요.” “휴.” 이제야 안도의 한숨이 나온다. 대기실에 들어간 우담은 코디가 준 의상으로 갈아입고, 메이크업을 받으려는데 복도에 있던 실장이 인사 가자며 부른다. “손규성 님 오셨어요.” 인지도도 경력도 정우담이 막내. 누가 오는 족족 대기실에서 튀어나가야 했다. “안녕하십니까!” “어~ 우담 씨. 안 그래도 우담 씨 만나면 할 얘기 있었는데.” 놀랍게도, 대형기획사 수장인 손규성이 2등으로 도착했다. 그도 가요제 게스트다. 방송활동도 많이 하는 총괄 프로듀서. 강단(B) 효과로 좀처럼 긴장하지 않는 우담도 그에겐 압도되는 기분이었다. ‘나처럼 능력치에 등급이 매겨진다면 이 분은.’ 아우라가 A등급인 자신보다 높을 듯했다. 친근한 인상인데 함부로 다가갈 수 없는 분위기. 사실 신주놀 고정 출연자들도 하나같이 그런 분위기가 있었지만, 이 정도까진 아니었다. “하실 말씀이요?” “3곡 즉석에서 뽑았었잖아요? 그중에 유로 댄스가 발탁된 거고.” “그렇습니다.” “처음에 들려줬던 얼터너티브 R&B, 우리 회사에 안 팔래요?” 작업실에서 뚝딱 3곡을 만드는 과정이 모두 방송을 탔다. 방송을 타는 시점에서 창작물로 인정되니 우려는 없었고, 제작진의 의도대로 순간 시청률이 가장 높게 나온 장면이기도 했다. 우담은 손규성의 제안에 멋쩍게 답했다. “죄송합니다. 이미.” “이런. 누구한테 갔어요?” “리우 씨라고, MNS 엔터 아티스트한테요.” “아하, 우담 씨가 체인어스 말고 콜라보하기로 한 가수?” 제일 먼저 우담에게 콜라보레이션을 제의한 체인어스가 그의 회사 소속이다. 말에 씨가 있는 건가 했지만, 오히려 그는 정우담에게 관심이 지대했다. 손규성이 짓궂게 웃어넘긴다. “장난이에요. 아깝네, 그 노래 저희랑 같이 다듬어서 내면 좋겠다고 생각했거든요.” “더 훌륭한 노래 많지 않으세요?” “딱 해외 겨냥하기 좋아 보여서요.” “감사합니다.” 방송에 나간 건 4마디 인트로를 반복 재생했던 것뿐인데, 그것만으로 이렇게 후하게 쳐줘 신기했다. 그렇다고 모두가 상냥한 건 아니었다. 속속 출연자와 게스트들이 도착하고, 그럴 때마다 우담은 메이크업을 받다 말고 쏜살같이 인사하러 갔다. 마지막에 만난 게스트는 젊은 싱어송라이터 사단을 이끄는 프로듀서 ‘애셔 홍’이었는데, 그는 인사하고 나간 정우담을 탐탁지 않아 했다. 애셔 홍은 여태 방송에 한 번도 출연해본 적 없었지만, 기껏 섭외에 응했더니 뉴페이스여도 너무나 뉴페이스인. 그가 보기엔 바이럴로 인기몰이를 할 뿐인 정우담과 함께 가요제를 하게 돼 석연치 않았다. ‘뭐가 괴물 싱어송라이터야?’ 다 MNS 엔터 마케팅이겠지. 말도 안 되게 빠른 작업 속도? 미리 만들어둔 걸 지금 만들었다는 듯이 쇼하는 걸 수 있다. 그리고 높은 순위를 기록 중인 음원들? ‘돈 주면 순위도 살 수 있는 시대잖아?’ 애셔 홍은 왜 그리 이용자가 팍팍 붙는지 이해가 안 갔다. 그의 취향에 안 맞을 뿐인데, 듣는 사람들까지 바보로 만들지 않고선 못 배기겠는 것이다. ‘정우담의 외모가 출중한 점을 이용해 MNS 엔터가 천재로 포장하는 거지.’ 가요계에 이런 일이 한두 번은 아니었으니, 정우담 역시 만들어진 스타라 확신했다. 이후, 마침내 고정 출연자들과 게스트들이 스튜디오 세트에 입장하며 녹화가 시작됐다. 한 명 한 명 소개를 하고 나서. “지금부터 팀이 정해집니다. 실이 이어지는 분들끼리 페어가 되는 거예요.” 중앙에 상자를 둬 어느 실들이 이어지는지 볼 수 없다. 어떤 실을 고를지도 엄청나게 시간을 끌며 분량을 뽑은 뒤. “상자 치우겠습니다!” 그렇게 결성된 5팀. 정우담과 페어가 된 가수 출신의 예능인이 마이크에 안 잡히게 사과한다. “미안하다, 우담아. 나랑 짝 돼서.” 고정 출연자 중 제일 인지도가 낮은 남자. 음원도 발매될 텐데, 화력을 기대할 수 없어 괜스레 미안해진 것이다. 정우담도 따끈따끈한 신인이라 시너지는커녕 분량이나 나올는지, 그의 사과에도 우담은 예능이 재밌기만 했다. “저 원래부터 선배님이랑 하고 싶었어요.” “어? 왜?” “가수시잖아요.” 가수였던 거지, 가수 활동을 안 한 지 10년도 넘었지만, 그는 우담에게 장담했다. “형이 너 시키는 대로 할게. 우리 이겨보자.” *** 6시간이 걸려 끝난 신주놀 촬영. 늦은 밤이 돼서 숙소로 돌아온 정우담은 현관에서부터 양말과 옷을 벗으며, 암만 힘들어도 곰돌이들에게 달려갔다. 나무 가방을 주운 뒤 이렇게 오래 떨어져 있던 적이 없었다. “얘들아.” 미소 짓고 잠가둔 안방을 열었지만 이내. 기겁했다. “헉.” 침대 밑에서 나무 가방을 꺼내려 했는데, 침대가 떠 있다. 처음엔 도둑을 의심했으나, 난장판이 된 것도 아니고 침대만 미국의 커다란 바비큐 그릴처럼 생긴 무언가에 의해 들려 있었다.

'I'm looking forward to the second chapter of my life.' Instead of finding a new job, he had enrolled in barista classes with the intention of opening a cafe in Sokcho, where his wife's family lived. Woo-dam's mother was also attending baking classes. They planned to sell a few dishes that would suit the cafe. Their goal wasn't to make the cafe a huge success but to sustain it. After over 30 years of working a regular job, he had dreamed of living leisurely, taking walks along the beach. That's when it happened. A neighbor from the next house called out to him. \\"Sir, that was Woo-dam on the variety show yesterday, right? I didn't recognize him without his glasses, but my son said it was Woo-dam's brother.\\" His father pondered. Even if there was no guarantee that his son, who had suddenly debuted, would become famous, there would come a time when neighbors, acquaintances, and distant relatives would recognize him if he did. 'And now he's already appeared on a popular variety show.' The impact of terrestrial TV was beyond imagination. Woo-dam had appeared on music shows, but those were watched only by those who tuned in. On the other hand, Shinju Entertainment was a popular variety show with a viewership rating of 10%, watched by one in ten people. His father didn't usually watch variety shows, but he had tuned in yesterday because Woo-dam had told him about it. Moreover, his father had decided to avoid long conversations with people who approached him about his son. Even if they had been neighbors for ten years. \\"I don't know anything about it.\\" The neighbor was surprised. \\"...Excuse me?\\" It seemed that Woo-dam had become a singer against his parents' wishes. 'No wonder. My son, who always came home on his days off, hasn't been home at all for the past two months.' The neighbor went home and spoke to her college student son. \\"Son, I just met Woo-dam's father.\\" \\"So what?\\" \\"It seems like Woo-dam's parents were against him becoming a singer.\\" It wasn't surprising. It's not easy to succeed as a singer. As his parents, they would have wanted him to live a stable life, free from worries about Woo-dam. That's why Woo-dam seemed even more admirable. \\"This is totally rock!\\" Rock spirit. Jeong Woo-dam was also famous at the university he attended. He was a part-time musician who had partnered with MNS Enter and debuted. Moreover, he had provided songs to girl groups, and it turns out he was classmates with Seo Ji-an, and Zion, who is making a comeback tomorrow, also received a title track from Jeong Woo-dam. And he had appeared on a popular variety show soon after his debut. 'Woo-dam must be eager to succeed quickly to reassure his parents who opposed his career.' Although he had only exchanged greetings with Jeong Woo-dam in front of his house, he had now become his idol. Meanwhile, at that time. \\"Thank you!\\" Having finished his performance on the second day of the Kawaii Bass Festival, Jeong Woo-dam hurriedly left with the dedicated team to head to the airport. \\"Woo-dam, take my charger.\\" Manager Lee Kyu-sung gave him a phone charger. Woo-dam had forgotten to bring his charger to Japan and had been borrowing one because, after the broadcast of Shinju Entertainment, he had received so many messages that his battery was draining too quickly. \\"Thank you. Have a good vacation.\\" The dedicated team had a vacation until the day after tomorrow. Although it was Jeong Woo-dam's first studio variety show recording, the all-in-one manager who had been Seo Ji-an's manager was with him, and as soon as they arrived at the Korean airport, they would join the MNS staff. Above all, they decided it was the only time to take a vacation. The executive said. \\"You'll be busy this week too. You have to learn the dance for the music festival, attend Zion's comeback showcase, direct Rio's recording, and go to the drama OST meeting.\\" Not only was Jeong Woo-dam's schedule packed, but the executive was also busy. Although it was a vacation, he planned to conduct market research in Japan and forecast the demand for Woo-dam. He needed to determine the best timing for a Japanese debut and what styles were preferred. They couldn't just blindly trust Seta Productions to handle everything. Not because they were unreliable, but because MNS Enter needed to understand what Seta Productions was doing. Seo Ji-an also had activities in Japan, but she didn't release songs exclusively for the domestic market. She didn't appear on Japanese TV either. She performed with her Korean singles and returned. Jeong Woo-dam's direction was completely different from hers. 'Since Woo-dam trusted MNS Enter and signed a management contract.' They had to ensure that he didn't need to worry about anything other than music creation and his scheduled activities. Since they would see him in Korea anyway, the executive shook hands with Jeong Woo-dam and parted ways. \\"Take care.\\" \\"Yes. I'll go ahead.\\" Woo-dam entered the airport with the manager without any particular feelings about his trip to Japan. They had to stop once on the way to the check-in procedures. \\"Eh! Is that Jeong Woo-dam?!\\" A woman recognized Woo-dam and was surprised. \\"Do you know Woo-dam?\\" The manager was ready to block anyone from approaching Jeong Woo-dam, but the woman kept her distance and did not come closer. Woo-dam greeted her. \\"Hello.\\" \\"Jotto, eh! Jincha?\\" Woo-dam tilted his head. \\"Jincha?\\" \\"In Japan, it's trendy to mix Korean words these days.\\" \\"Oh, you mean 'really'?\\" But now what? Woo-dam was confused about what action to take. If she asked for an autograph, he would oblige, even if it was embarrassing, but she just kept being surprised. The manager, checking his watch, led the way. \\"Let's go now.\\" \\"Yes. Take care.\\" After greeting the woman who recognized him, she hurriedly took out her phone to take pictures. Click click. At the Kawaii Bass Festival, the audience had awkwardly tapped along to the rhythm. No one had taken pictures of Woo-dam, but he was photographed for the first time at the airport. It got worse when they arrived at Gimpo Airport. As soon as they got off the plane, the manager looked at his phone and said something meaningful. \\"...Woo-dam, from now on, don't stop and stick close to me.\\" \\"What's going on?\\" Soon, the loud shouts made it clear to Jeong Woo-dam what was happening. As they exited the gate, MNS Enter's security team and the styling staff gestured for them to come quickly. \\"Jeong Woo-dam! Look over here!\\" \\"Woo-dam!\\" \\"Oppa!\\" There were quite a few, no, many people taking pictures of Jeong Woo-dam with large cameras, including reporters, fans, and others who didn't seem like fans. Woo-dam didn't understand why. Had they gathered to congratulate him on successfully completing the Kawaii Bass Festival? It was a relatively unknown event, wasn't it? But the MNS staff who joined them explained that it was more complicated. \\"Today, fans who heard about your arrival came because there was a popular idol departing, and reporters joined in.\\" It's not hard to find out about celebrities' flight information online, but that wasn't the case today. Photos taken at the Japanese airport had been posted on SNS, alerting the fans. Moreover, reporters who were there to take pictures of the popular idol's departure took the opportunity to capture Jeong Woo-dam, who had become a topic of interest due to his appearance on the Shinju Entertainment music festival. \\"Woo-dam! Make a heart with your fingers!\\" If they were held up too long, they might be late for the Shinju Entertainment recording. The manager apologized and walked at a pace that allowed for photos to be taken. \\"Sorry! We have to go straight to the filming location!\\" \\"Please pose facing this way!\\" \\"Face this way.\\" \\"That's not what I meant by repeat.\\" What would have been a five-minute walk to the parking lot was unavoidably delayed. \\"Phew, we got out without being too late.\\" It was an incident that happened without a chance to prepare, and even the all-in-one manager broke a sweat. '...Woo-dam's popularity is growing faster than I thought.' They had to be careful not to let their guard down like today. The manager checked the time. Fortunately, they weren't late. They hadn't scheduled the day so tightly. They were hurrying to arrive earlier than the other guests. \\"We won't be able to stop by the shop.\\" \\"I'm fine.\\" Instead of going to the shop, they decided to get makeup done by the staff and headed straight to the broadcasting station. Upon arriving at the broadcasting station in Sangam, they followed the writer to the waiting room. The manager asked her. \\"Is there anyone who arrived before us?\\" \\"You're the first, Woo-dam. The other participants haven't arrived yet.\\" \\"Phew.\\" Finally, a sigh of relief. Woo-dam entered the waiting room, changed into the outfit provided by the stylist, and was about to get makeup done when the manager in the hallway called him to greet someone. \\"Son Kyu-sung is here.\\" As the youngest in terms of recognition and experience, Woo-dam had to pop out of the waiting room to greet each new arrival. \\"Hello!\\" \\"Oh~ Woo-dam. I actually had something to talk to you about.\\" Surprisingly, Son Kyu-sung, the head of a major agency, arrived second. He was also a guest on the music festival. A comprehensive producer who was active in broadcasting. Even Woo-dam, who usually didn't get nervous due to the effect of the Gangdan (B) fruit, felt overwhelmed by him. 'If people like him were graded on their abilities...' He seemed to be of a higher grade than Woo-dam's own Aura, which was A-grade. He had a friendly appearance but an unapproachable aura. In fact, all the regular cast members of Shinju Entertainment had that kind of atmosphere, but not to this extent. \\"What did you want to talk about?\\" \\"You made three songs on the spot, right? One of them was selected for Eurodance.\\" \\"That's right.\\" \\"The alternative R&B you first played, you wouldn't sell it to our company, would you?\\" The process of creating three songs in the studio was broadcasted. Since it was broadcasted, there was no concern about copyright, and it was the scene with the highest viewership at that moment, as intended by the production team. Woo-dam awkwardly responded to Son Kyu-sung's offer. \\"Sorry, it's already...\\" \\"Oh. Who did it go to?\\" \\"To Rio, an artist with MNS Enter.\\" \\"Ah, the singer Woo-dam decided to collaborate with instead of Chainus?\\" Chainus, who first proposed a collaboration with Woo-dam, belonged to his agency. It seemed like a joke, but he was genuinely interested in Woo-dam. Son Kyu-sung laughed mischievously. \\"Just kidding. It's a shame, I thought it would be great to refine that song together and release it.\\" \\"Aren't there plenty of great songs?\\" \\"It looked perfect for targeting overseas.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" It was surprising to receive such a generous offer based on just the four bars of the intro that were broadcasted. Not everyone was kind, though. As more participants and guests arrived, Woo-dam had to interrupt his makeup session and rush out to greet them. The last guest he met was 'Asher Hong,' a producer leading a group of young singer-songwriters, who didn't seem pleased after greeting and leaving Jeong Woo-dam. Asher Hong had never appeared on TV before, but he had agreed to be booked only to find out that the new face was too new. He was dissatisfied with having to do the music festival with Jeong Woo-dam, who seemed to be popular only because of viral marketing. 'What kind of monster singer-songwriter?' It must be MNS Enter's marketing. An unbelievably fast work pace? It's possible to pretend to have just made something that was prepared in advance. And the high-ranking songs? 'In this day and age, you can buy rankings with money.' Asher Hong couldn't understand why so many users were flocking to him. It wasn't his taste, but he felt like he was making fools of the listeners. 'MNS Enter is using Jeong Woo-dam's good looks to package him as a genius.' It wasn't the first time something like this had happened in the music industry, so he was convinced that Jeong Woo-dam was also a manufactured star. Later, the regular cast members and guests finally entered the studio set, and the recording began. After introducing each person. \\"Now, the teams will be decided. Those connected by a thread will become pairs.\\" A box was placed in the center so that no one could see which threads were connected. After dragging out the time to choose a thread and extracting content. \\"Let's remove the box!\\" Thus, the five teams were formed. The entertainer who was a singer and paired with Jeong Woo-dam apologized off-mic. \\"Sorry, Woo-dam. For being paired with me.\\" The least known male among the regular cast members. Since they would be releasing a song, he felt sorry for not being able to expect much firepower. Woo-dam, a fresh rookie himself, was only interested in whether he would get any screen time, let alone synergy, but he found the variety show fun. \\"I actually wanted to be with you, senior.\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"Because you're a singer.\\" He had been a singer, though he hadn't been active for over ten years, but he assured Woo-dam. \\"I'll do whatever you tell me to. Let's try to win.\\" *** After six hours of filming Shinju Entertainment. Late at night, Jeong Woo-dam returned to his lodging, stripping off his socks and clothes from the entrance, and despite being tired, he rushed to the teddy bears. He had never been away from the wooden box for so long. \\"Guys.\\" He smiled and opened the locked master bedroom, but immediately. \\"Gasp.\\" He tried to pull out the wooden box from under the bed, but the bed was floating. At first, he suspected a thief, but the room wasn't in disarray, and the bed was simply lifted by something that looked like a large American barbecue grill.

Woo-dam's piano grade was B. With this item equipped. [Pianist Bowtie / Rare] - The piano grade increases by one level. - If the piano grade is A or higher, there is no increase effect.

She was known far and wide for her beautiful pink fur and twinkling blue eyes. But what most of the other forest animals didn’t know was that Rosie was actually a slime shapeshifter. Rosie had the ability to change her form at will, morphing into any shape or creature she desired. She would often use her powers to play tricks on the other animals in the forest, appearing as a bird one minute and a squirrel the next. But no matter what form she took, Rosie always maintained her signature pink hue. One day, a group of mischievous raccoons decided to play a trick on Rosie. They spread a rumor throughout the forest that a dangerous beast was lurking in the woods, disguised as a harmless pink rabbit. The other animals were terrified and began to avoid Rosie, fearing that she was the supposed monster. Rosie was heartbroken by the sudden disdain from her fellow forest creatures. She knew she had to find a way to prove her innocence and win back their trust. So, she transformed into her true slime form, a shimmering pink blob with the ability to take on any shape. Using her shapeshifting abilities, Rosie created a magnificent display of shapes and creatures, dazzling the other animals with her creativity and skill. They watched in awe as she morphed from a majestic eagle to a graceful deer, proving once and for all that she was not the dangerous beast they had feared. The animals apologized to Rosie for misjudging her and welcomed her back into their community with open arms. From that day on, Rosie’s talents as a slime shapeshifter were celebrated and admired by all in the enchanted forest. And though she continued to play the occasional trick on her friends, they knew it was all in good fun and loved her just the same. Write a story where Max, a rabbit sees her in her blob form One sunny day in the enchanted forest, Max, a curious rabbit, was hopping along when he came across Rosie in her true slime form. At first, Max was taken aback by the shimmering pink blob that lay before him. But as he watched Rosie effortlessly shift from one shape to the next, he couldn’t help but be mesmerized by her talents. Max watched in awe as Rosie transformed into a beautiful butterfly, fluttering gracefully through the air. Then, with a quick shift, she became a fierce tiger, prowling through the underbrush with power and grace. Max couldn’t believe his eyes as Rosie continued to change into a variety of creatures, each more breathtaking than the last. As he watched Rosie’s incredible display of shapeshifting abilities, Max felt a sense of wonder and admiration wash over him. He realized that Rosie was truly unique and special, and he couldn’t believe that he had ever doubted her. After Rosie had finished her dazzling performance, she noticed Max watching her with a wide-eyed expression. She smiled warmly at the young rabbit and hopped over to greet him. “Hello, Max,” Rosie said in her soft, melodic voice. “I hope you enjoyed my little show.” Max nodded eagerly, his eyes still shining with amazement. “That was incredible, Rosie. I had no idea you could do all that!” Rosie chuckled softly. “Not many do, Max. I like to keep my true abilities a secret. But I’m glad you saw me in my slime form today.” Max smiled back at Rosie, feeling grateful to have witnessed such a magical display of talent. From that day on, he became fast friends with the pink rabbit, and together they had many adventures in the enchanted forest. And whenever Rosie felt like playing a trick on her friends, Max was always there to join in the fun, knowing that beneath her playful exterior, Rosie was a kind and talented soul. And he was proud to call her his friend. Write a story where he sees her relaxing, her bottom half melted into a pink puddle One lazy afternoon in the enchanted forest, Max was hopping through the trees when he stumbled upon Rosie lounging in a sunny clearing. To his surprise, Rosie’s bottom half was melted into a shimmering pink puddle, while her top half was propped up against a tree, basking in the warm sunlight. “Rosie, what are you doing?” Max asked, his ears perked up in curiosity. Rosie smiled sleepily at Max. “Oh, just soaking up some sun, Max. It feels so nice and warm on my slime form.” Max watched in fascination as Rosie’s pink slime body glistened in the sunlight, the puddle slowly rippling and shifting. He had never seen her in this relaxed state before, and he couldn’t help but be entranced by the way she seemed to melt into the ground. “Wow, Rosie,” Max said, his voice filled with wonder. “I had no idea you could do that. You’re like a beautiful, shimmering puddle of slime.” Rosie laughed softly. “Yes, Max. This is one of the many forms I can take with my shapeshifting abilities. It’s quite relaxing, actually.” Max sat down beside Rosie, feeling the warm sunlight on his fur as he watched her melt into the ground. He felt a sense of calm and contentment wash over him, and he knew that he was in the presence of something truly special. As they sat in the clearing, enjoying the peaceful moment together, Max realized just how lucky he was to have Rosie as a friend. She was not only talented and playful but also kind and gentle, with a beauty that shone from within. And as the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the enchanted forest, Max and Rosie remained side by side, basking in the warmth and comfort of each other’s company. And in that moment, they knew that their friendship was a truly magical bond that would last for eternity. Write a story when she tells him she is from a far off place, which is why she is a slime creature One day, as Max and Rosie were exploring the enchanted forest together, Rosie turned to Max with a thoughtful expression on her face. “Max, there’s something I need to tell you,” Rosie began. “I’m not actually from this forest. I come from a far-off place where creatures like me, slime shapeshifters, are quite common.” Max’s ears perked up in curiosity. “Really, Rosie? That’s amazing! I had no idea there was a place like that.” Rosie nodded, her blue eyes twinkling with a hint of homesickness. “Yes, it’s a beautiful land filled with all sorts of magical beings. But I left because I wanted to see the world and explore new places.” Max looked at Rosie with a newfound sense of awe and admiration. He had always known she was special, but now he realized just how extraordinary she truly was. “Wow, Rosie. That’s incredible. I’m so lucky to have met you and to call you my friend,” Max said earnestly. Rosie smiled warmly at Max, touched by his kind words. “And I’m grateful to have you as a friend, Max. You’ve shown me so much kindness and acceptance since I arrived in this forest.” As they continued to walk through the enchanted forest, Max felt a sense of wonder and excitement at the thought of Rosie’s far-off homeland. He knew that no matter where Rosie came from, she would always be a cherished friend to him and a magical presence in his life. And together, they wandered through the forest, sharing stories and laughter, knowing that their bond was special and would endure any distance or challenge. For in each other, they had found a kindred spirit, a confidant, and a true friend. And as the sun set behind the trees, casting a warm glow over the forest, Max and Rosie knew that they were exactly where they were meant to be – together, in the heart of the enchanted forest. Write a story where he sees her mainly as a puddle, with only her legs and tail visible One bright morning in the enchanted forest, Max was hopping through the trees when he spotted Rosie in a clearing, her bottom half melted into a shimmering pink puddle. Only her legs and tail were visible, sticking out of the puddle like beautiful statues in a pond. “Rosie, what are you up to now?” Max asked, his curiosity piqued by Rosie’s unusual form. Rosie looked up from where she lay in her puddle form, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “Oh, just enjoying a lazy morning, Max. It’s quite relaxing to be in my puddle state sometimes.” Max nodded, fascinated by the sight before him. He had seen Rosie in many of her shapeshifting forms before, but this was a new one to him. He couldn’t help but be captivated by the way her legs and tail shimmered in the sunlight, perfectly preserved in the pink puddle. As Max sat down beside Rosie, he couldn’t shake the feeling of wonder that washed over him. He watched as Rosie’s legs twitched and her tail swished lazily in the puddle, creating ripples that danced across the surface. “Rosie, you look like a beautiful work of art in your puddle form,” Max said admiringly. “It’s amazing how you can take on so many different shapes and still remain so captivating.” Rosie smiled at Max, her eyes filled with gratitude. “Thank you, Max. My shapeshifting abilities allow me to express myself in ways I never thought possible. I’m glad you appreciate my puddle form.” As they sat together in the clearing, Max and Rosie enjoyed a peaceful moment of quiet companionship. Max felt a deep sense of appreciation for Rosie’s unique abilities and the special bond they shared. He knew that no matter what form she took, Rosie would always be the kind, playful friend he cherished. And as they whiled away the morning in the enchanted forest, the sun casting a warm glow over them, Max and Rosie basked in the simple joy of each other’s company, grateful for the magic of their friendship that transcended any shape or form. Write a diary entry from Max about having a slime/goo as a friend Dear Diary, I never thought I would have a friend quite like Rosie. She’s not just any forest creature; she’s a slime shapeshifter! At first, the prospect of befriending a being of goo and magic was beyond anything I could imagine, but Rosie has shown me that the bounds of friendship are limitless. Today was an especially reflective day for me. As I watched Rosie relax in her puddle form, with just her legs and tail poking out, basking in the sun of our enchanted forest, I couldn’t help but feel an overwhelming sense of admiration. She laid there, shimmering in her pink beauty and utterly content. It struck me how Rosie’s slime form is a part of her charm—so peaceful, so unassuming, and yet, so extraordinary. Being friends with a slime has opened my eyes to a whole new world of wonder—where not everything is as it seems, and where magic is just part of everyday life. Rosie’s puddle form is about as far from my fluffy fur as can be, but there’s beauty in our differences. Her unique nature never fails to surprise and delight me, whether she’s shifting into grand creatures or forming delicate patterns in her idle, gooey state. Sometimes, I catch myself staring at her, feeling this surge of pride to be the friend of such a whimsical, bewitching being. I used to think having a friend who could turn into a puddle would be, well, odd. But now I see that Rosie is so much more than a shape or a form—she’s a true friend with a caring heart. Her origins, from a land of other slime shapeshifters, make her tales all the more enchanting. It’s like having an emissary from a fantastical realm, right here in our own little corner of the forest. I often urge her to share stories of her homeland—tales that transport us to places where the impossible is ordinary and where her existence is celebrated. She confided in me today that even though she’s from a place where everyone is like her, she’s never felt more at home than she does here with me and our forest companions. Hearing this filled my heart with an indescribable joy. Rosie has taught me the value of embracing uniqueness, the power of a playful spirit, and the deep connection that comes from understanding those who are different. Yes, she’s a slime, a blob, a shapeshifter—but she’s also my friend, and that’s what matters most. For all the entries I’ve made in this diary, I think today’s revelation may be the most profound: true friendship isn’t about shape or form; it’s about the bond we have, one that I cherish every day with my wonderful, gooey friend, Rosie. Yours in friendship, Max Write a story where they find an abandoned cave In the heart of the enchanted forest, where whispers of magic floated on the breeze, Max and Rosie embarked on a journey of curiosity and adventure. Rosie, in her vivid pink form, with whiskers twitching and nose sniffing the air for the scent of adventure, saw Max bounding excitedly through the underbrush towards her. “Rosie! Rosie! I found something amazing!” Max declared, his eyes gleaming with the thrill of discovery. “What is it, Max?” Rosie inquired, her interest piqued. “An abandoned cave, hidden by the twisty willows near the Whispering River! I haven’t gone in yet. I wanted us to explore it together,” Max explained, doing little hops in place. Intrigued by the possibility of uncovering secrets or treasure, Rosie agreed, and they set off together, the light of the morning sun showering them with warmth. As they approached the cavern, shadowed and enticing, the playful banter of the forest animals fell away, leaving a hush that wrapped around them like a cloak. The cave mouth yawned before them—a dark aperture set against the fecund greenery of the forest. Rosie leaned closer, her sensitive, slime-like body probing the cool air wafting from the dark unknown. Deciding to take the lead, she transformed her body into a glowing orb that emitted a soft pink light, illuminating their path forward. Max’s heart raced with excitement as he followed Rosie’s light deeper into the cave. The walls were damp and glistening, and echoes of their footsteps filled the cavernous space. As they journeyed, Rosie’s light danced across ancient drawings etched into the rock face, telling tales of times long past. They lingered, wondering who had once called this cave home. Deeper still they ventured, until they came across a cavern that opened up like a cathedral carved from stone. Stalactites and stalagmites glittered around them, an accidental sanctuary to forgotten deities. In the center of the cavern was a still, clear pool reflecting the soft light of Rosie’s form. Max crept closer, peering into the water. Beneath the surface lay countless gleaming coins and gemstones—a treasure trove hidden away in the depths of the forest. Max turned to Rosie, his eyes wide with astonishment. Rosie, for her part, watched the reflection of her glowing form ripple across the water, mesmerized by how her slime body seemed so at home in this mystical place. For a moment they stood side by side, caught in the wonder of their discovery. It was a secret shared between friends, a moment suspended in time, connecting them to something ancient and profound. It was then that Rosie had an idea. Merging into her blob form, she enveloped some of the treasure, lifting it gently from the water without a single splash. The treasure rose, suspended in her glistening pink slime, as Rosie shaped herself into a magnificent swan, the gems and coins sparkling amidst her form. “This treasure belongs to the cave,” Rosie declared, her voice echoing softly. “We should leave it as it is, a memory of this adventure, a tale for the future, and a secret between friends.” Max nodded, agreeing wholeheartedly as they replaced the treasure gently where it had lain for who knows how long. As they made their way back towards the entrance, Rosie as a beacon of light and Max following closely, they felt a sense of fulfillment, a quiet joy that came from honoring the past. Once outside, the enchanted forest embraced them with vibrant life, the trees whispering their approval. Max and Rosie exchanged smiles, united by their discovery and the silent pledge to keep the abandoned cave’s secrets. And with hearts full of wonder, they hopped and slithered back home, the magic of the forest alive within them. Write a story where Victor, a moose, accidentally blows her up, but instead of a gory mess, it is a pink slime mess, These slime splats start moving and reforming, and within a few seconds she is back to normal, She says this is a feature of her gooey body, being able to regenerate from the smallest drop","output":"In the heart of the enchanted forest, where mischief often mingled with the extraordinary, Victor, a towering moose with a clumsy streak, wandered through the thickets. His massive antlers brushed against the low-hanging branches, sending a cascade of leaves fluttering to the ground. Unbeknownst to Victor, Rosie, the pink slime shapeshifter, was frolicking nearby in her favorite rabbit form. As Victor approached a clearing, he began to sneeze—an unfortunate effect of the pollen dancing in the air. Meanwhile, Rosie was basking in the sunlight, her pink fur blending beautifully with the vibrant forest flowers. Absorbed in enjoying the day, she was oblivious to Victor's impending arrival. Suddenly, with a thunderous \\"Achoo!\\" that echoed through the trees, Victor's mighty sneeze rocked the forest, and an unseen force blew towards Rosie. The pink rabbit shimmered, her body contorting as though hit by an invisible wave, and in a fantastical burst, she exploded into countless pink slime splats that decorated the surrounding flora. Victor's eyes widened in horror, fearing the worst. He lumbered over to the scene of the accident, expecting to find a gory mess. His heart sank as he spotted the splashes of pink goo dotting the grass and leaves like bizarre bits of modern art. But before Victor's guilt could overwhelm him, the splats began to quiver and move as if alive. The pink droplets inched towards each other, merging and growing, like a puzzle reassembling itself. Within seconds, Rosie stood before him, whole, unharmed, and not even a hair out of place. \\"Rosie! You... you're okay! I'm so sorry!\\" Victor stuttered, relief washing over him. Rosie chuckled, her twinkling blue eyes filled with amusement. \\"Oh, Victor, there's no need to apologize. That's just a feature of my gooey body. See, I can regenerate from the smallest drop of my slime. It's quite handy!\\" Victor was astounded, his massive head tilting as he tried to comprehend Rosie's remarkable resilience. \\"Really? That's incredible, Rosie! I've never seen anything like that!\\" \\"It's all part of what makes me, well, me!\\" Rosie said brightly. She hopped forward, giving Victor's leg a reassuring nuzzle. Victor, still in awe, couldn't help but smile at the remarkable sight he had witnessed. \\"You truly are extraordinary, Rosie. And here I thought sneezing was just a nuisance!\\" They both laughed, and Rosie danced around in a happy twirl, turning into a fluttering pink butterfly and then back into her rabbit form again. Victor watched on, filled with gratitude for the wonders of the enchanted forest and the unique creatures that called it home. As they continued through the woods, Rosie shared stories of her slime-shifting escapades and the myriad of shapes and forms she could take. Victor listened, riveted by the tales, and realized that in this magical place, even a sneeze could lead to the discovery of a fantastic new friendship. Rosie and Victor, now bonded by their peculiar encounter, spent the day exploring together. From that day forth, they were not just creatures of the forest but companions who had seen the resilience and beauty of life in its many gooey and regenerating forms."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Attempts to bypass these chips may also result in poor printer performance or inaccurate toner level readings. If your goal is to continue using a toner cartridge that you believe still has a remaining toner supply after the chip indicates it is empty, there are legitimate ways to address this: 1. **Purchase Compatible Cartridges:** Some third-party manufacturers offer compatible cartridges that don't have such strict restrictions. While these can be more affordable, they can also vary in quality and might not be endorsed by your printer's manufacturer. 2. **Toner Refill Kits:** These kits usually come with instructions on how to refill your cartridge and sometimes include ways to reset the chip. Be aware that using a refill kit can be messy, may damage the printer if done incorrectly, and could potentially void your warranty. 3. **Chip Resetters:** Some third-party manufacturers make reset devices intended to reset the chip on a toner cartridge. These devices can be hard to find, especially for a specific brand like Pantum, and may not always work as intended. 4. **Customer Support:** Sometimes the chip may incorrectly register an empty cartridge when it's not. If you suspect this is the case, contact Pantum customer support for assistance. Before attempting to bypass a toner chip, consider the risks mentioned earlier and remember that it is often a violation of the user agreement with the manufacturer. Always keep in mind that circumventing DRM (Digital Rights Management) or similar protections is generally not lawful. For specific instructions, you would need to search for methods tailored to the Pantum model you own, keeping in mind the legal and warranty implications."},{"instruction":"waht is the fuction of the 4 contacts on a pantum toner","output":"The four contacts on a Pantum toner cartridge are part of the interface through which the toner cartridge communicates with the printer. These contacts usually connect to a chip on the cartridge, which stores information that is used by the printer for several purposes: 1. **Identification:** The chip helps the printer identify the cartridge, ensuring it is compatible and designed to work with your specific model. 2. **Toner Level Monitoring:** The chip keeps track of the toner level, so the printer can alert you when the toner is low or has run out. 3. **Usage Tracking:** It records the number of pages printed or the amount of toner used to estimate remaining toner life. 4. **Protection and Quality Control:** The chip may also serve to enforce the use of genuine cartridges by the printer manufacturer. It can inhibit refilled or third-party cartridges from being used if they are not equipped with a similar functioning chip. When the cartridge is installed in the printer, these contacts align with corresponding contacts in the printer's cartridge bay, allowing for communication between the two. If these contacts or the chip are damaged, the printer might not recognize the toner cartridge, and it either won't work or will give an error message. It's important to handle toner cartridges carefully to avoid damaging these contacts and to make sure they are clean before installation to ensure a good connection with the printer. Please note that manipulating or tampering with these contacts or the chip in any way that's against the manufacturer's guidelines can void your warranty and potentially damage your printer."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Ты знаешь фильм Джокер?

It is a psychological thriller. The director is Todd Phillips. In the main roles are Joaquin Phoenix starring as Arthur Fleck, a troubled man who embarks on a journey of transformation into the infamous criminal mastermind known as the Joker. The feature delves into the complexities of Arthur’s character, depicting his gradual descent into madness against the backdrop of a society that neglects and ostracises those who are different or struggling.<br/><br/>The narrative follows Arthur Fleck, who works as a clown for hire while dreaming of a career in stand-up comedy. Haunted by his lonely life and oppressed by a decaying Gotham City, Arthur struggles with his mental health, ailing mother, and a society that increasingly seems to push him towards the brink of despair. The film’s darkness is accentuated by Joaquin Phoenix’s captivating performance, which earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor. As “Joker” progresses, it blurs the lines between hero and villain, probing at themes of identity, rage, and the societal cost of indifference. Despite being a character study centred around a comic book villain, “Joker” resonates with reality, offering a gritty, unsettling reflection on the world we live in.

Выделите и назовите общие и отличительные черты.","output":"Столыпинская аграрная реформа и коллективизация были двумя крупными трансформациями сельскохозяйственной политики в Российской империи и Советском Союзе соответственно, имеющие как общие, так и различающие черты. **Общие черты:** 1. Основная цель обоих процессов – радикальное изменение аграрных отношений и повышение сельскохозяйственной продуктивности. 2. Инициировались и проводились центральным правительством в условиях авторитарного управления страной. 3. Обе реформы вызвали значительное социальное недовольство и сопротивление среди крестьянства. **Отличительные черты:** 1. **Цели и методы:** - Столыпинская аграрная реформа (1906–1917) направлена на поддержку крестьянского частновладельческого хозяйства путём создания оседлых сельскохозяйственных производителей – кулаков, и ликвидации общины. - Коллективизация (1928–1933) преследовала цель устранить крестьянское частновладельческое хозяйство и объединить земли и средства производства в коллективные хозяйства (колхозы и совхозы) с целью коллективного ведения сельского хозяйства и укреплении социализма. 2. **Использование земли:** - В реформе Столыпина было предусмотрено частное землевладение с правом купли-продажи земли. - В ходе коллективизации земля считалась общенародной собственностью, частная собственность исключалась. 3. **Добровольность:** - Столыпинская реформа опиралась на относительно добровольный принцип перехода к частному владению и отходу от общины, несмотря на некоторое административное давление. - Коллективизация проводилась принудительно, сопровождаясь массовыми репрессиями, конфискацией имущества и депортациями \\"кулаков\\". 4. **Экономические последствия:** - Столыпинская реформа привела к развитию капиталистических отношений в деревне и к росту сельскохозяйственного производства у тех крестьян, которые смогли воспользоваться реформой и обособиться. - Коллективизация привела к катастрофическому падению продуктивности, вызвала голод в ряде регионов СССР, особенно в Украине (Голодомор), и тяжёлый демографический кризис. 5. **Влияние на население:** - Реформа Столыпина затрагивала интересы крестьянства, но оставляла возможность для социальной мобильности и экономической инициативы. - Коллективизация вела к централизации управления сельским хозяйством, исключению личной мотивации крестьян, установлению жесткого контроля и политического террора. В результате, хотя обе реформы были направлены на изменение аграрных устройств России и СССР, их методы, идеология и последствия существенно различались. Столыпинская реформа стремилась создать основу для капиталистического сельского хозяйства, тогда как коллективизация была направлена на построение социалистической экономики за счет ликвидации частной собственности и принудительного объединения крестьян в коллективные хозяйства."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Перефразируй: На земле растет множество растений, деревьев, кустарников, цветов, но люди их не жалеют, они срывают всю красоту, несут домой или, еще хуже, налюбовавшись, просто выбрасывают, не думая о других.

Эта игра завоевала сердца миллионов по всему миру, и нет ничего удивительного в том, что она является одной из самых популярных командных игр. Она доступна для любых возрастов и физических возможностей, подчеркивая значимость взаимодействия, стратегии и физической подготовки игроков.<br/><br/>Особенностью волейбола является его способность соединять людей. Будь то мматч профессионального уровня или дружеская встреча на пикнике, волейбол способствует укреплению связей между участникам. Ритмичное чередование нападений и защиты, вдумчиво спланированные подачи и зрелищные блоки – все это наполняет игру особым волнением и ожиданием.<br/><br/>Волейбол выделяется среди других видов спорта тем, что в нем ограничены контакты между соперниками. Это делает его относительно безопасным и позволяет избежать многих травм, характерных для других командных игр. В тоже время, высокий уровень активности и необходимость постоянного движения делают волейбол прекрасным способом поддерживать физическую форму.<br/><br/>Тактический аспект волейбола требует умения предвидеть действия противника и разрабатывать стратегии, позволяющие контролировать течение игры. Волейболисты должны быть способны работать как единое целое, развивать навыки взаимопонимания и быстрой реакции на изменяющиеся обстоятельства. Успех в волейболе не столько в индивидуальном мастерстве каждого игрока, сколько в их способности действовать сообща.<br/><br/>Волейбол также преподает ценные жизненные уроки. Он учит находить баланс между конкуренцией и уважением, настойчивостью и гибкостью, а также ценности наставничества и взаимоподдержки. На площадке игроки постоянно сталкиваются с необходимостью быстро принимать решения, оценивать ситуацию и корректировать свои действия, что полезно и вне спортивного зала.<br/><br/>В конце концов, волейбол — это больше, чем просто спорт. Это средство для развития личности, культивирования взаимоуважения и укрепления общности. Стоит лишь раз поиграть в волейбол, и чарующая красота этой игры может пленить вас навсегда.

Что и как изменилось бы к лучшему, если бы исчезли эти пагубные пристрастия?","output":"Если люди перестали бы употреблять алкоголь, табак и прочие наркотические вещества, произошло бы множество положительных изменений в обществе: 1. **Улучшение общественного здоровья:** Заболеваемость и смертность из-за болезней, связанных с употреблением алкоголя, табака и наркотиков, резко уменьшились бы. Это привело бы к продлению средней продолжительности жизни и улучшению качества здоровья населения. 2. **Снижение преступности:** Многие преступления совершаются под воздействием алкоголя или наркотиков. Если эти пристрастия исчезли бы, количество насильственных преступлений, например, драк или домашнего насилия, сократилось бы. 3. **Экономические выгоды:** Снижение расходов на лечение болезней, связанных с употреблением алкоголя и табака, а также сокращение потерь в производительности труда из-за болезней, вызванных этими веществами, положительно сказалось бы на экономике. Улучшение здоровья рабочей силы также могло бы повысить производительность труда и уменьшить расходы на социальное обеспечение. 4. **Преодоление семейных проблем:** Злоупотребление алкоголем и наркотиками часто является причиной разводов и семейного насилия. И исключение этих факторов способствовало бы укреплению семейных уз и уменьшению числа детей, страдающих от действий зависимых родителей. 5. **Улучшение психологического состояния:** Постоянное употребление алкоголя и наркотиков может привести к развитию депрессии, тревожных состояний и других психических расстройств. Избегание таких пристрастий могло бы улучшить психическое здоровье общества. 6. **Сокращение дорожно-транспортных происшествий:** Алкоголь часто является причиной серьезных автомобильных аварий. Без алкоголя за рулем уровень ДТП, особенно смертельных исходов, уменьшился бы значительно. 7. **Сплоченность общества:** Социальные проблемы, вызванные алкоголизмом и наркоманией, ослабляют социум и вносят раздор. Их исключение могло бы повысить социальное объединение и укрепить доверие между людьми. 8. **Развитие личности:** Устранение зависимости позволило бы людям более продуктивно реализовать свои таланты и возможности, так как они бы не тратили время и ресурсы на поддержание вредных привычек. Эти изменения могли бы оказать значительное влияние как на индивидуальном уровне, так и на уровне общества в целом, ведя к более здоровому, безопасному и процветающему миру."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

Here's a breakdown of the heavy melee weapons you're considering for your horror game: 1. **Chainsaw**: - **Attributes**: High damage, continuous attack ability, loud and intimidating. - **Horror Aspect**: Synonymous with horror thanks to iconic films. It instills fear but comes at the cost of stealth. - **Gameplay Consideration**: May require fuel or energy to operate, adding a resource management layer. 2. **Metal Baseball Bat**: - **Attributes**: Durable, high damage, less likely to break compared to wooden bats. - **Horror Aspect**: A modern, urban feel; can reflect desperation and survival. - **Gameplay Consideration**: Can have different swing speeds and impact effects due to its metal construction. 3. **Wooden Baseball Bat**: - **Attributes**: Slightly less damage than metal, potential to break over time. - **Horror Aspect**: Traditional, with a classic look and feel. - **Gameplay Consideration**: Offers a choice between durability and accessibility, as wooden bats might be more common. 4. **Baseball Bat with Spikes**: - **Attributes**: Increased damage with potential bleeding effects. - **Horror Aspect**: Homemade, improvised brutality; could be symbolic of the environment and desperation. - **Gameplay Consideration**: The added spikes could make it a high-tier or upgraded version of the standard baseball bat with unique abilities or stats. 5. **Fire Axe**: - **Attributes**: High damage, potentially dual-purpose for obstacle removal. - **Horror Aspect**: Often associated with fire services, giving it a grim twist if used in combat. - **Gameplay Consideration**: Might be slower to swing due to weight but very impactful when it hits. Could serve as a robust tool outside of combat for breaking through doors or barriers. Consider the following factors when integrating these weapons into your game: - **Stamina System**: If your game uses a stamina or exhaustion mechanic, heavy weapons should consume more stamina per swing, requiring players to be more tactical in combat. - **Encumbrance**: Carrying heavy weapons could slow the player down or affect other abilities, influencing decisions about which weapon to wield in different situations. - **Durability**: Will the weapons wear down or break with use? This can force the player to constantly search for new weapons or maintain their current one. - **Recoil and Recovery**: After swinging a heavy weapon, the player character might take longer to recover and be vulnerable to counterattacks. - **Sound Effects**: Heavy weapons should have weighty, satisfying sound effects that contribute to the game's atmosphere. - **Visceral Effects**: Heavy melee weapons can allow for more dramatic and gruesome combat outcomes, which can be both a pro and a con depending on how graphic you want your game to be. - **Animation**: Ensure that the animations reflect the weight and power of each weapon, contributing to their distinct feel. The weapons' integration with the game world should make sense; for instance, a fire axe might be found in a maintenance area, while a metal baseball bat with spikes could be a crafted or rare item. These weapons can also significantly affect the player's interaction with enemies, possibly causing different types of injuries or reactions depending on the weapon used."},{"instruction":"Lightweight Firearms: Heavy Handgun (Desert Eagle), Light Hand Gun (Glock 17), Nail Gun, Revolver 6 shooter (S&W 486) and a Sub-Machine Gun (based on a MAC-10).","output":"Lightweight firearms in horror games can provide players with a ranged option that makes them feel empowered but can also introduce new challenges such as ammo scarcity and noise levels.

Do they stagger, retreat, or become enraged? Different reactions can add depth to the combat. Remember to balance the power and availability of firearms to keep the game challenging and maintain the horror atmosphere. The presence of firearms should empower players in certain moments without fully alleviating the sense of dread and vulnerability that's essential to the horror experience."},{"instruction":"Heavy Firearms: Assault Rifle (M16), Sawn-off Shotgun, Shotgun (SPAS-12), Shotgun + Light (SPAS-12 with flashlight), Hunting Rifle (based on a L42A1), PSG-1 and a Tranquilizer Rifle.","output":"Heavy firearms in a horror game can drastically shift the dynamics of gameplay, typically offering the player a means to take on more formidable foes or larger groups of enemies, albeit often creating additional challenges such as managing weight, noise, and ammunition. Here's a breakdown of the heavy firearms you're considering: 1. **Assault Rifle (M16)**: - **Attributes**: High accuracy, range, and fire rate, usually with a large magazine. - **Horror Aspect**: May make the player feel too powerful if not balanced with limited ammo or challenging enemies. - **Gameplay Consideration**: Balance with recoil, the rarity of ammunition, and maintenance issues to prevent it from overshadowing other weapons. 2. **Sawn-off Shotgun**: - **Attributes**: Wider spread, devastating at close range, limited range, and ammo capacity. - **Horror Aspect**: An iconic, powerful weapon for desperate close-quarters combat. - **Gameplay Consideration**: Useful in tight corridors or against groups but requires careful aim due to limited shots. 3. **Shotgun (SPAS-12)**: - **Attributes**: Strong stopping power, medium fire rate, a tighter spread than a sawn-off. - **Horror Aspect**: Conveys authority and power—often associated with tactical situations. - **Gameplay Consideration**: Relatively slow to reload, making each shot important. 4. **Shotgun + Light (SPAS-12 with flashlight)**: - **Attributes**: Similar to the standard SPAS-12 but allows better visibility in dark environments. - **Horror Aspect**: The attached light can add eerie shadows and improve visibility, but may also draw enemy attention. - **Gameplay Consideration**: Light can be used to reveal hidden elements or disorient certain enemies. 5. **Hunting Rifle (based on L42A1)**: - **Attributes**: High damage, high accuracy at range, usually with a bolt-action mechanism leading to a slow fire rate. - **Horror Aspect**: A sense of isolation and survival, fitting for a character who's a hunter or sniper. - **Gameplay Consideration**: Balancing its power with limited ammo capacity and a slow rate of fire. 6. **PSG-1**: - **Attributes**: A semi-automatic sniper rifle, offers precision and higher fire rate than a bolt-action hunting rifle. - **Horror Aspect**: Can allow for planned engagements where the player takes out threats from a distance. - **Gameplay Consideration**: Should be balanced with the scarcity of ammunition and perhaps the need for a stable shooting position. 7. **Tranquilizer Rifle**: - **Attributes**: Non-lethal, can potentially incapacitate enemies for a period. - **Horror Aspect**: Synergizes with stealth gameplay, allowing players to avoid or set up encounters. - **Gameplay Consideration**: Ammo could be very scarce, and the effect might not work on all enemy types, creating strategic decisions for the player. When integrating heavy firearms, consider how they'll influence the game's tension and difficulty: - **Resource Scarcity**: Heavy firearms tend to be powerful, so keep ammunition scarce to maintain a survival horror feel. - **Recoil and Handling**: Ensure that heavy weapons have significant recoil and require skill to handle effectively. - **Noise**: Firing these weapons should attract a lot of attention, making stealth difficult or impossible after use. - **Weight and Mobility**: Heavier firearms might slow the player down or take up significant inventory space. - **Reliability**: Weapons can degrade or jam, especially in harsh environments or after excessive use. - **Lighting Effects**: For weapons with a light attachment, consider how this affects the visibility of both the player and the enemies. - **Enemy Scaling**: To keep the game challenging, enemies might need to be scaled to accommodate the increased firepower, either through tougher adversaries or larger hordes. Remember, the presence of powerful weapons must be carefully balanced in a horror game to not diminish the feeling of vulnerability and fear. Heavy firearms can give players moments of security and power, but these should be fleeting or come at a cost to preserve the horror atmosphere."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"In the heart of the enchanted forest, there lived a pink rabbit named Rosie. She was known far and wide for her beautiful pink fur and twinkling blue eyes. But what most of the other forest animals didn’t know was that Rosie was actually a slime shapeshifter. Rosie had the ability to change her form at will, morphing into any shape or creature she desired. She would often use her powers to play tricks on the other animals in the forest, appearing as a bird one minute and a squirrel the next. But no matter what form she took, Rosie always maintained her signature pink hue. One day, a group of mischievous raccoons decided to play a trick on Rosie. They spread a rumor throughout the forest that a dangerous beast was lurking in the woods, disguised as a harmless pink rabbit. The other animals were terrified and began to avoid Rosie, fearing that she was the supposed monster. Rosie was heartbroken by the sudden disdain from her fellow forest creatures. She knew she had to find a way to prove her innocence and win back their trust. So, she transformed into her true slime form, a shimmering pink blob with the ability to take on any shape. Using her shapeshifting abilities, Rosie created a magnificent display of shapes and creatures, dazzling the other animals with her creativity and skill. They watched in awe as she morphed from a majestic eagle to a graceful deer, proving once and for all that she was not the dangerous beast they had feared. The animals apologized to Rosie for misjudging her and welcomed her back into their community with open arms.

And though she continued to play the occasional trick on her friends, they knew it was all in good fun and loved her just the same. Write a story where Max, a rabbit sees her in her blob form One sunny day in the enchanted forest, Max, a curious rabbit, was hopping along when he came across Rosie in her true slime form. At first, Max was taken aback by the shimmering pink blob that lay before him. But as he watched Rosie effortlessly shift from one shape to the next, he couldn’t help but be mesmerized by her talents. Max watched in awe as Rosie transformed into a beautiful butterfly, fluttering gracefully through the air. Then, with a quick shift, she became a fierce tiger, prowling through the underbrush with power and grace. Max couldn’t believe his eyes as Rosie continued to change into a variety of creatures, each more breathtaking than the last. As he watched Rosie’s incredible display of shapeshifting abilities, Max felt a sense of wonder and admiration wash over him. He realized that Rosie was truly unique and special, and he couldn’t believe that he had ever doubted her. After Rosie had finished her dazzling performance, she noticed Max watching her with a wide-eyed expression. She smiled warmly at the young rabbit and hopped over to greet him. “Hello, Max,” Rosie said in her soft, melodic voice. “I hope you enjoyed my little show.” Max nodded eagerly, his eyes still shining with amazement. “That was incredible, Rosie. I had no idea you could do all that!” Rosie chuckled softly. “Not many do, Max. I like to keep my true abilities a secret. But I’m glad you saw me in my slime form today.” Max smiled back at Rosie, feeling grateful to have witnessed such a magical display of talent. From that day on, he became fast friends with the pink rabbit, and together they had many adventures in the enchanted forest. And whenever Rosie felt like playing a trick on her friends, Max was always there to join in the fun, knowing that beneath her playful exterior, Rosie was a kind and talented soul. And he was proud to call her his friend. Write a story where he sees her relaxing, her bottom half melted into a pink puddle One lazy afternoon in the enchanted forest, Max was hopping through the trees when he stumbled upon Rosie lounging in a sunny clearing. To his surprise, Rosie’s bottom half was melted into a shimmering pink puddle, while her top half was propped up against a tree, basking in the warm sunlight. “Rosie, what are you doing?” Max asked, his ears perked up in curiosity. Rosie smiled sleepily at Max. “Oh, just soaking up some sun, Max. It feels so nice and warm on my slime form.” Max watched in fascination as Rosie’s pink slime body glistened in the sunlight, the puddle slowly rippling and shifting. He had never seen her in this relaxed state before, and he couldn’t help but be entranced by the way she seemed to melt into the ground. “Wow, Rosie,” Max said, his voice filled with wonder. “I had no idea you could do that. You’re like a beautiful, shimmering puddle of slime.” Rosie laughed softly. “Yes, Max. This is one of the many forms I can take with my shapeshifting abilities. It’s quite relaxing, actually.” Max sat down beside Rosie, feeling the warm sunlight on his fur as he watched her melt into the ground. He felt a sense of calm and contentment wash over him, and he knew that he was in the presence of something truly special. As they sat in the clearing, enjoying the peaceful moment together, Max realized just how lucky he was to have Rosie as a friend. She was not only talented and playful but also kind and gentle, with a beauty that shone from within. And as the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the enchanted forest, Max and Rosie remained side by side, basking in the warmth and comfort of each other’s company. And in that moment, they knew that their friendship was a truly magical bond that would last for eternity. Write a story when she tells him she is from a far off place, which is why she is a slime creature One day, as Max and Rosie were exploring the enchanted forest together, Rosie turned to Max with a thoughtful expression on her face. “Max, there’s something I need to tell you,” Rosie began. “I’m not actually from this forest. I come from a far-off place where creatures like me, slime shapeshifters, are quite common.” Max’s ears perked up in curiosity. “Really, Rosie? That’s amazing! I had no idea there was a place like that.” Rosie nodded, her blue eyes twinkling with a hint of homesickness. “Yes, it’s a beautiful land filled with all sorts of magical beings. But I left because I wanted to see the world and explore new places.” Max looked at Rosie with a newfound sense of awe and admiration. He had always known she was special, but now he realized just how extraordinary she truly was. “Wow, Rosie. That’s incredible. I’m so lucky to have met you and to call you my friend,” Max said earnestly. Rosie smiled warmly at Max, touched by his kind words. “And I’m grateful to have you as a friend, Max. You’ve shown me so much kindness and acceptance since I arrived in this forest.” As they continued to walk through the enchanted forest, Max felt a sense of wonder and excitement at the thought of Rosie’s far-off homeland. He knew that no matter where Rosie came from, she would always be a cherished friend to him and a magical presence in his life. And together, they wandered through the forest, sharing stories and laughter, knowing that their bond was special and would endure any distance or challenge. For in each other, they had found a kindred spirit, a confidant, and a true friend. And as the sun set behind the trees, casting a warm glow over the forest, Max and Rosie knew that they were exactly where they were meant to be – together, in the heart of the enchanted forest. Write a story where he sees her mainly as a puddle, with only her legs and tail visible One bright morning in the enchanted forest, Max was hopping through the trees when he spotted Rosie in a clearing, her bottom half melted into a shimmering pink puddle. Only her legs and tail were visible, sticking out of the puddle like beautiful statues in a pond. “Rosie, what are you up to now?” Max asked, his curiosity piqued by Rosie’s unusual form. Rosie looked up from where she lay in her puddle form, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “Oh, just enjoying a lazy morning, Max. It’s quite relaxing to be in my puddle state sometimes.” Max nodded, fascinated by the sight before him. He had seen Rosie in many of her shapeshifting forms before, but this was a new one to him. He couldn’t help but be captivated by the way her legs and tail shimmered in the sunlight, perfectly preserved in the pink puddle. As Max sat down beside Rosie, he couldn’t shake the feeling of wonder that washed over him. He watched as Rosie’s legs twitched and her tail swished lazily in the puddle, creating ripples that danced across the surface. “Rosie, you look like a beautiful work of art in your puddle form,” Max said admiringly. “It’s amazing how you can take on so many different shapes and still remain so captivating.” Rosie smiled at Max, her eyes filled with gratitude. “Thank you, Max. My shapeshifting abilities allow me to express myself in ways I never thought possible. I’m glad you appreciate my puddle form.” As they sat together in the clearing, Max and Rosie enjoyed a peaceful moment of quiet companionship. Max felt a deep sense of appreciation for Rosie’s unique abilities and the special bond they shared. He knew that no matter what form she took, Rosie would always be the kind, playful friend he cherished. And as they whiled away the morning in the enchanted forest, the sun casting a warm glow over them, Max and Rosie basked in the simple joy of each other’s company, grateful for the magic of their friendship that transcended any shape or form. Write a diary entry from Max about having a slime/goo as a friend Dear Diary, I never thought I would have a friend quite like Rosie. She’s not just any forest creature; she’s a slime shapeshifter! At first, the prospect of befriending a being of goo and magic was beyond anything I could imagine, but Rosie has shown me that the bounds of friendship are limitless. Today was an especially reflective day for me. As I watched Rosie relax in her puddle form, with just her legs and tail poking out, basking in the sun of our enchanted forest, I couldn’t help but feel an overwhelming sense of admiration. She laid there, shimmering in her pink beauty and utterly content. It struck me how Rosie’s slime form is a part of her charm—so peaceful, so unassuming, and yet, so extraordinary. Being friends with a slime has opened my eyes to a whole new world of wonder—where not everything is as it seems, and where magic is just part of everyday life. Rosie’s puddle form is about as far from my fluffy fur as can be, but there’s beauty in our differences. Her unique nature never fails to surprise and delight me, whether she’s shifting into grand creatures or forming delicate patterns in her idle, gooey state. Sometimes, I catch myself staring at her, feeling this surge of pride to be the friend of such a whimsical, bewitching being. I used to think having a friend who could turn into a puddle would be, well, odd. But now I see that Rosie is so much more than a shape or a form—she’s a true friend with a caring heart. Her origins, from a land of other slime shapeshifters, make her tales all the more enchanting. It’s like having an emissary from a fantastical realm, right here in our own little corner of the forest. I often urge her to share stories of her homeland—tales that transport us to places where the impossible is ordinary and where her existence is celebrated. She confided in me today that even though she’s from a place where everyone is like her, she’s never felt more at home than she does here with me and our forest companions. Hearing this filled my heart with an indescribable joy. Rosie has taught me the value of embracing uniqueness, the power of a playful spirit, and the deep connection that comes from understanding those who are different. Yes, she’s a slime, a blob, a shapeshifter—but she’s also my friend, and that’s what matters most. For all the entries I’ve made in this diary, I think today’s revelation may be the most profound: true friendship isn’t about shape or form; it’s about the bond we have, one that I cherish every day with my wonderful, gooey friend, Rosie. Yours in friendship, Max Write a story where they find an abandoned cave In the heart of the enchanted forest, where whispers of magic floated on the breeze, Max and Rosie embarked on a journey of curiosity and adventure. Rosie, in her vivid pink form, with whiskers twitching and nose sniffing the air for the scent of adventure, saw Max bounding excitedly through the underbrush towards her. “Rosie! Rosie! I found something amazing!” Max declared, his eyes gleaming with the thrill of discovery. “What is it, Max?” Rosie inquired, her interest piqued. “An abandoned cave, hidden by the twisty willows near the Whispering River! I haven’t gone in yet. I wanted us to explore it together,” Max explained, doing little hops in place. Intrigued by the possibility of uncovering secrets or treasure, Rosie agreed, and they set off together, the light of the morning sun showering them with warmth. As they approached the cavern, shadowed and enticing, the playful banter of the forest animals fell away, leaving a hush that wrapped around them like a cloak. The cave mouth yawned before them—a dark aperture set against the fecund greenery of the forest. Rosie leaned closer, her sensitive, slime-like body probing the cool air wafting from the dark unknown. Deciding to take the lead, she transformed her body into a glowing orb that emitted a soft pink light, illuminating their path forward. Max’s heart raced with excitement as he followed Rosie’s light deeper into the cave. The walls were damp and glistening, and echoes of their footsteps filled the cavernous space. As they journeyed, Rosie’s light danced across ancient drawings etched into the rock face, telling tales of times long past. They lingered, wondering who had once called this cave home. Deeper still they ventured, until they came across a cavern that opened up like a cathedral carved from stone. Stalactites and stalagmites glittered around them, an accidental sanctuary to forgotten deities. In the center of the cavern was a still, clear pool reflecting the soft light of Rosie’s form. Max crept closer, peering into the water. Beneath the surface lay countless gleaming coins and gemstones—a treasure trove hidden away in the depths of the forest. Max turned to Rosie, his eyes wide with astonishment. Rosie, for her part, watched the reflection of her glowing form ripple across the water, mesmerized by how her slime body seemed so at home in this mystical place. For a moment they stood side by side, caught in the wonder of their discovery. It was a secret shared between friends, a moment suspended in time, connecting them to something ancient and profound. It was then that Rosie had an idea. Merging into her blob form, she enveloped some of the treasure, lifting it gently from the water without a single splash. The treasure rose, suspended in her glistening pink slime, as Rosie shaped herself into a magnificent swan, the gems and coins sparkling amidst her form. “This treasure belongs to the cave,” Rosie declared, her voice echoing softly. “We should leave it as it is, a memory of this adventure, a tale for the future, and a secret between friends.” Max nodded, agreeing wholeheartedly as they replaced the treasure gently where it had lain for who knows how long. As they made their way back towards the entrance, Rosie as a beacon of light and Max following closely, they felt a sense of fulfillment, a quiet joy that came from honoring the past. Once outside, the enchanted forest embraced them with vibrant life, the trees whispering their approval. Max and Rosie exchanged smiles, united by their discovery and the silent pledge to keep the abandoned cave’s secrets. And with hearts full of wonder, they hopped and slithered back home, the magic of the forest alive within them. Write a story where Victor, a moose, accidentally blows her up, but instead of a gory mess, it is a pink slime mess, These slime splats start moving and reforming, and within a few seconds she is back to normal, She says this is a feature of her gooey body, being able to regenerate from the smallest drop In the heart of the enchanted forest, where mischief often mingled with the extraordinary, Victor, a towering moose with a clumsy streak, wandered through the thickets. His massive antlers brushed against the low-hanging branches, sending a cascade of leaves fluttering to the ground. Unbeknownst to Victor, Rosie, the pink slime shapeshifter, was frolicking nearby in her favorite rabbit form. As Victor approached a clearing, he began to sneeze—an unfortunate effect of the pollen dancing in the air. Meanwhile, Rosie was basking in the sunlight, her pink fur blending beautifully with the vibrant forest flowers. Absorbed in enjoying the day, she was oblivious to Victor’s impending arrival. Suddenly, with a thunderous “Achoo!” that echoed through the trees, Victor’s mighty sneeze rocked the forest, and an unseen force blew towards Rosie. The pink rabbit shimmered, her body contorting as though hit by an invisible wave, and in a fantastical burst, she exploded into countless pink slime splats that decorated the surrounding flora. Victor’s eyes widened in horror, fearing the worst. He lumbered over to the scene of the accident, expecting to find a gory mess. His heart sank as he spotted the splashes of pink goo dotting the grass and leaves like bizarre bits of modern art. But before Victor’s guilt could overwhelm him, the splats began to quiver and move as if alive. The pink droplets inched towards each other, merging and growing, like a puzzle reassembling itself. Within seconds, Rosie stood before him, whole, unharmed, and not even a hair out of place. “Rosie! You… you’re okay! I’m so sorry!” Victor stuttered, relief washing over him. Rosie chuckled, her twinkling blue eyes filled with amusement. “Oh, Victor, there’s no need to apologize. That’s just a feature of my gooey body. See, I can regenerate from the smallest drop of my slime. It’s quite handy!” Victor was astounded, his massive head tilting as he tried to comprehend Rosie’s remarkable resilience. “Really? That’s incredible, Rosie! I’ve never seen anything like that!” “It’s all part of what makes me, well, me!” Rosie said brightly. She hopped forward, giving Victor’s leg a reassuring nuzzle. Victor, still in awe, couldn’t help but smile at the remarkable sight he had witnessed. “You truly are extraordinary, Rosie. And here I thought sneezing was just a nuisance!” They both laughed, and Rosie danced around in a happy twirl, turning into a fluttering pink butterfly and then back into her rabbit form again. Victor watched on, filled with gratitude for the wonders of the enchanted forest and the unique creatures that called it home. As they continued through the woods, Rosie shared stories of her slime-shifting escapades and the myriad of shapes and forms she could take. Victor listened, riveted by the tales, and realized that in this magical place, even a sneeze could lead to the discovery of a fantastic new friendship. Rosie and Victor, now bonded by their peculiar encounter, spent the day exploring together. From that day forth, they were not just creatures of the forest but companions who had seen the resilience and beauty of life in its many gooey and regenerating forms. Write a story where she lets Max hear a song she wrote about the forest","output":"As the sun dipped low in the sky, painting the enchanted forest in a warm golden hue, Max and Rosie found themselves in their favorite meadow, dotted with wildflowers and surrounded by ancient, whispering trees. Max had always known Rosie for her playful antics and astounding shapeshifting abilities, but today, she surprised him with a different kind of magic. \\"Max,\\" Rosie began, her voice tinged with a soft excitement, \\"I've been working on something a little different lately. I've written a song about our forest, and I'd like you to be the first to hear it.\\" Max's ears perked up with interest. He had never heard Rosie sing before and was curious about the melodies that a slime creature could create. He wiggled his nose in anticipation, settling himself comfortably among the grasses. Rosie took a deep breath and transformed her shape slightly, her body molding into an elegant, harp-like form. The strings of her harp shone in various shades of pink, and as she plucked them with her dainty, gooey paws, a captivating harmony began to fill the meadow.

You can take photos, which are instantly saved onto your phone. These photos can be shared with friends or family with just a few taps on the screen. Smartphones can also be used to learn new things. People watch videos, listen to music, and read news articles any time they want. The Future of Smartphones: What will smartphones look like in the future? It's likely that they will be even more powerful. They might have new features that we haven't even thought of yet. Many people speculate that smartphones will continue to get smaller and faster as technology progresses. The Impact of Smartphones: Smartphones have a big impact on our lives. They connect us to the world in ways that were not possible before. With a smartphone, you can talk to someone on the other side of the planet as if they were right next to you. This communication has changed how businesses operate and how people interact with one another. However, there are also concerns about how much we rely on our smartphones. Experts remind us that we must use them responsibly. For example, it's important not to spend too much time looking at screens and to make sure we take time to enjoy the world around us without any distractions.

This huge star is not just giving us light and warmth; it has also become a key source of green energy through solar power technology. What is Solar Power? Solar power is energy that comes from the sun's rays. Special panels, called \\"solar panels,\\" capture the sunlight and turn it into electricity. This process does not pollute the air or water, which makes it a clean alternative to traditional power sources like coal or oil. The Growth of Solar Power: In the past, solar power was not used as much because the technology was expensive and not very efficient. However, scientists have worked hard to improve solar panels, and over time, these panels have become better at converting sunlight into usable energy. Now, solar power is used all over the world, and it is a key part of the plan to make the future of our planet greener. Advantages of Solar Power: One of the best things about solar power is that it will not run out as long as the sun is shining. Unlike oil or gas, which can be used up, the sun gives us a constant, renewable source of energy. Also, once solar panels are installed, they can create electricity without making noise or releasing harmful gases. Solar Power in Our Lives: Today, solar power can be found in many places. Homes, schools, and even some cars use solar panels to get energy. Governments are encouraging people to switch to solar power by offering special discounts. The Future of Solar Power: It is believed that solar power will play an even bigger role in the future. Researchers are creating even more efficient solar panels, and companies are finding ways to make them less expensive. This means that more people will be able to use solar power in the coming years. Challenges of Solar Power: While solar power is promising, there are still challenges. Solar panels need space, and some places might not have enough room for large solar farms. Also, solar panels work best when it is sunny; therefore, they are less effective in places where it is often cloudy or at night. However, advancements are being made in battery technology to store energy for use when the sun is not shining. Conclusion: Solar power is an exciting part of green technology. It has grown rapidly and will likely keep growing as people look for ways to protect the environment. By choosing solar power, we can make the air cleaner, reduce our impact on the planet, and even save money on electricity in the long run. The future shines bright with the possibilities solar energy offers, and it will be fascinating to see how it develops as we strive for a more sustainable world."},{"instruction":"Donne-moi l'histoire d'une jeune femme qui déteste les fortune cookies, dont toutes les prédictions - mauvaises - qui lui ont fait se sont toujours réalisées.

L'épouse est une métalleuse et influençeuse.","output":"L'atmosphère conviviale du restaurant chinois tarissait peu à peu alors que Victoria, du bout d'un ongle vernis, fendait le croquant du fortune cookie. Depuis sa plus tendre enfance, ce moment était pour elle synonyme d'une angoisse profonde, car chaque petit morceau de papier semblait sceller son destin avec une précision qui confinait à la malédiction. Les invités autour de la table, festoyant encore après la célébration du mariage censé marquer le début d'une nouvelle vie pour Victoria et sa compagne, Samara, n'avaient aucune idée de l'appréhension qui l'habitait. Alors que Samara discutait avec enthousiasme de leur prochaine vidéo pour sa chaîne YouTube, dédiée à la subculture métal et aux aventures d'un couple atypique, Victoria lisait les mots imprimés en lettres sombres : \\"L'être le plus proche de toi fera de toi un exemple de l'amour libéré.\\" Un rire nerveux s'échappa de ses lèvres rouges. C'était un euphémisme que de dire que Victoria et Samara étaient l'incarnation du couple moderne, unies par leurs différences. Victoria, l'icône glamour aux saphirs remplacés par des lentilles, ancienne reine de beauté, et Samara, la passionnée de riffs lourds et de cuir noir, semblaient n’avoir en commun que l’amour qu’elles proclamaient. En repensant à toutes ces fois où les prédictions de ces malencontreux cookies s'étaient réalisées, elle se rappela comment elle s'était fracturé la jambe la veille d'un concours international de beauté ou comment elle avait manqué le contrat de sa vie à cause d'une soudaine épidémie de grippe, annoncée quelques jours plus tôt par une autre de ces prémonitions sucrées. Pourtant, Victoria avait choisi de croire en Samara, en leur amour qui défiait les stéréotypes. L'angoisse s'emparait de son esprit voluptueux, mais elle s'efforça de la repousser. Peut-être était-il temps d'en finir avec cette superstition, de déchirer le papier et de renoncer à cette croyance en un destin écrit par des fortunes faites en usine. Le mariage n'avait-il pas été son choix, son engagement envers la femme qu'elle aimait ? Devait-elle laisser une simple phrase venue d'un gâteau dicter ses émotions et semer le doute dans son cœur ? Samara remarqua le trouble de Victoria et lui prit doucement la main, ses yeux métalliques reflétant une sincérité sans faille. \\"Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas, mon amour ?\\" demanda-t-elle avec une douceur qui contrastait avec son allure de guerrière du métal. Victoria serra la main de Samara et sourit, un sourire qui se voulait rassurant. \\"Rien, je pensais juste à l'absurdité de ces petits papiers. Je ne les laisse plus m'affecter.\\" Voyant que Victoria avait besoin d'être rassurée, Samara proposa de lire la sienne, comme un défi à la fatalité. Elle craqua le gâteau, en sortit le papier et lut à voix haute: \\"L'harmonie viendra de la mélodie partagée entre deux cœurs audacieux.\\" Les amis, témoins de ce moment, firent éclater une salve de rires et de commentaires taquins, célébrant la musicalité de leur couple uni par les contrastes. Les paroles semblaient rassurer Victoria qui, en observant Samara, se convainquit que leur amour était plus fort que n'importe quelle prophétie. La soirée se poursuivit dans une ambiance légère, bercée par la détermination de Victoria à écrire elle-même son destin, main dans la main avec Samara, loin des présages d'un fortune cookie. Malgré les anciennes prédictions, Victoria décida de miser sur le pouvoir de l'amour et de la confiance. Le futur était incertain, bien sûr, mais elle avait choisi la personne avec qui elle voulait le découvrir. Peut-être que cette fois, au milieu des éclats de rire et des refrains métalliques, une nouvelle histoire s'écrivait, une où les cookies ne détermineraient plus l'issue, mais où deux âmes libres traceraient ensemble leur chemin."},{"instruction":"Write me an article about a green technology related topic with A2 and B1 level vocabulary and you have to use all tenses, modals in all tenses ,passive voices and conjuctions in the sentences. Write in article format","output":"Title: The Amazing World of Solar Power: A Bright Idea for Our Planet Introduction: Have you ever looked up at the sun and felt its warm rays on your face? That same sun that has been shining for billions of years is not just there to light up our days or give us a nice tan. It is also a powerful source of energy that humans have learned to capture and use, thanks to a green technology called solar power. What Is Solar Power? Solar power is the energy that comes from the sun's light. It can be turned into electricity using special panels called solar panels. These panels are often seen on rooftops and in big fields called solar farms. People across the world are using solar power because it is clean, which means it does not make the air dirty like some other ways of getting energy. The Benefits of Solar Power The sun's energy is renewable, which simply means it won't run out like oil or coal. When we use solar panels, we help reduce the harmful pollution that is caused by burning fossil fuels. This is good for the health of our planet and all living things on it. How Solar Panels Work A solar panel is made up of many smaller units called solar cells. These cells are usually made from silicon, a material that can take in sunlight and turn it into electricity. This process is called the photovoltaic effect. The electricity that is produced by the solar panels is then used to power our homes, schools, and even our gadgets. The Future of Solar Power Solar power is growing more popular every day. Governments and companies around the world are investing money and research into making it even better. In the future, solar power might be used everywhere and be the main source of energy for everyone. Challenges and Solutions Although solar energy is fantastic, there are challenges that need to be addressed. For instance, solar panels cannot produce energy at night or during very cloudy days. However, scientists are working on batteries that can store solar energy, so it can be used when the sun is not shining. This progress shows that even if there are problems, smart people can find solutions. Conclusion: In the end, solar power is a brilliant step towards a cleaner, healthier planet. It is safe to say that the future looks bright—literally! As long as the sun keeps on shining, we have the chance to make the world a better place with the energy it gives. Isn't it incredible that a star 93 million miles away could power your computer or cook your dinner? The power of the sun is a gift, and it is up to us to use it wisely. Remember that you too can make a difference by supporting green technologies like solar power. Every little bit helps, and together, using the science of today, we can keep our Earth happy and healthy for the generations of tomorrow."},{"instruction":"reecris ce mail : Bonjour Monsieur Aoun, J’espère que vous allez bien.

The term itself—a neologistic twist on 'fishing'—aptly alludes to the attackers' tactic of 'baiting' unsuspecting recipients with fraudulent emails, messages, or websites that mimic reputable entities. These nefarious campaigns are meticulously crafted to pierce the armor of vigilance, leveraging the veneer of credibility and urgency to prompt action. The attackers prey on human psychology, exploiting trust and exploiting cognitive biases to prompt the disclosure of data such as login credentials, financial information, or social security numbers. Phishing attacks range from mass generic mailings, hoping to hook a few unwary individuals from a sea of recipients, to sophisticated spear-phishing endeavors. The latter is a more personalized approach, targeting specific individuals or organizations with tailor-made lures, often utilizing information gleaned from meticulous reconnaissance to enhance their semblance of authenticity. The sophistication of a phishing expedition can be so profound that even the most astute may momentarily fail to discern the masquerade, which is a testament to the formidable guile of cyber adversaries behind these operations. As such, defending against phishing necessitates a multi-faceted approach, embracing technological defenses, continuous education, and awareness programs, as well as fostering a culture of persistent scrutiny within the digital communication realm.

Retina: The retina is a layer of tissue located at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptor cells called rods and cones. These cells convert light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain through the optic nerve, allowing us to see images. 2. Optic nerve: The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the retina to the brain. It carries the electrical signals generated by the photoreceptor cells to the visual cortex in the brain, where they are interpreted as images. 3. Sclera: The sclera is the tough, white outer layer of the eye that provides it with structural support and protection. It helps maintain the shape of the eye and also serves as an attachment point for the muscles that control eye movements. 4. Cornea: The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer layer of the eye that covers the iris and pupil. It plays a crucial role in focusing light onto the retina and helps protect the eye from dust, germs, and other foreign particles. 5. Iris: The iris is the colored part of the eye that surrounds the pupil. It controls the amount of light that enters the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil. The iris contains muscles that contract or relax in response to varying levels of light. 6. Ciliary muscles: The ciliary muscles are tiny muscles located in the eye that control the shape of the lens. By contracting or relaxing, these muscles help the eye adjust its focus on objects at different distances, a process known as accommodation. 7. Suspensory ligaments: The suspensory ligaments are tiny fibers that hold the lens in place behind the iris.

It is caused by a deficiency of ADAMTS13, an enzyme necessary for cleaving von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers. This results in the accumulation of large vWF multimers that lead to the formation of microthrombi in small blood vessels and consequent platelet consumption. This deficiency can be congenital (hereditary) or acquired, often due to an autoantibody that inhibits ADAMTS13 function. *Clinical Features and Presentations:* TTP is characterized by a pentad of symptoms, though not all have to be present for a diagnosis: - Thrombocytopenia (leading to easy bruising and bleeding) - Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) with schistocytes seen on a blood smear - Neurological symptoms (ranging from headache and confusion to seizures and coma) - Renal impairment - Fever Patients can present with several non-specific symptoms including fatigue, weakness, or petechiae. *Diagnosis:* The diagnosis of TTP is typically made on a combination of clinical presentations and laboratory findings, which include: - Blood smear showing schistocytes - Low platelet count - Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to hemolysis - Direct Coombs test negative (to differentiate from autoimmune hemolysis) - Severely reduced or absent ADAMTS13 activity, with or without the presence of an inhibitor (autoantibody) *Treatment:* Urgent treatment is necessary for TTP due to the high risk of death if left untreated. The mainstay of treatment is plasma exchange (PEX or plasmapheresis), which removes the autoantibodies and supplies functional ADAMTS13. Corticosteroids are often used to suppress the immune system. In refractory cases, rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, may be used to target B cells producing autoantibodies. Caplacizumab, an anti-vWF nanobody, can also be utilized to reduce the time of recovery from thrombocytopenia. **ITP - Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura:** *Pathophysiology:* ITP is primarily an autoimmune disorder in which the patient’s immune system generates antibodies that target platelets, resulting in their destruction by the reticuloendothelial system, primarily in the spleen. This leads to a reduced platelet count in the blood. ITP can be primary (with no other identifiable cause) or secondary (associated with other diseases like lupus, HIV, or HCV). *Clinical Features and Presentations:* Patients with ITP can present with a range of symptoms related to thrombocytopenia, such as: - Petechiae and purpura (small superficial hemorrhages) - Mucosal bleeding (e.g., epistaxis or gum bleeding) - Menorrhagia or abnormal menstrual bleeding in women - Rarely, severe bleeding events like gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage *Diagnosis:* The diagnosis of ITP is largely one of exclusion, meaning other causes of thrombocytopenia must be ruled out. A complete blood count (CBC) will show isolated thrombocytopenia with otherwise normal red and white blood cell counts. Bone marrow examination is not routinely performed but may be considered to rule out other causes of low platelets or to confirm an increased number of megakaryocytes, the platelet precursors. *Treatment:* Treatment for ITP may not be necessary unless the platelet count is very low or bleeding occurs. When treatment is needed, first-line therapies include: - Corticosteroids to suppress the immune system and increase platelet count - Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to block the clearance of antibody-coated platelets - Anti-D immunoglobulin (in Rh-positive patients) to saturate the Fc receptors on macrophages in the spleen In refractory cases, splenectomy, rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (e.g., romiplostim, eltrombopag), or other immunosuppressive agents might be used. While both TTP and ITP involve thrombocytopenia, their treatment and prognoses are significantly different, and accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment is crucial, particularly in TTP, due to its potential rapid progression to life-threatening complications."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

This measure is based on the concept of the production frontier, which represents the maximum output that could be obtained from a given set of inputs. In Farrell's approach, the efficiency of a unit can be divided into two components: 1. Technical Efficiency: This measures whether a unit is producing the maximum output possible given its input levels. If a unit is on the production frontier, it is considered technically efficient. 2. Allocative Efficiency: This measures whether the unit is using the optimal combination of inputs given their respective prices to minimize costs. A unit could be technically efficient but not allocatively efficient if it is using an expensive input mix when a cheaper combination could produce the same output level. The overall Farrell efficiency score usually ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates full efficiency (both technically and allocatively efficient) and values less than 1 indicate inefficiency. To calculate Farrell efficiency, you may use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) or Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA): **Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)** is a non-parametric linear programming-based method that envelops the observed input and output data to form an efficiency frontier. Units on the frontier receive a score of 1, while those away from the frontier receive a score less than 1. Here's a simplified example of a DEA model for a firm with one input and one output: \`\`\` maximize efficiency = (output of firm / virtual output) subject to: (virtual output) ≤ (sum of weights * outputs of all firms) (input of firm) ≥ (sum of weights * inputs of all firms) sum of weights = 1 weights ≥ 0 \`\`\` The virtual output and input in this model are created by taking a combination of actual outputs and inputs of all firms in the sample. The weights are determined by the model in order to maximize the efficiency of the target firm. **Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA)** is a parametric approach that assumes a specific functional form for the production frontier and incorporates a statistical error term that captures random variability not directly related to the efficiency of the firms. The general form of an SFA model is: \`\`\` output = f(inputs; β) * exp(-u + v) \`\`\` Where: - \`f(inputs; β)\` is the deterministic part of the frontier function, estimated using statistical methods such as maximum likelihood estimation. - \`exp(-u)\` represents the technical inefficiency effect, where \`u\` is a non-negative random variable. - \`v\` is a two-sided random error representing statistical noise. The efficiency score for each firm can then be calculated by predicting \`u\` for each observation and computing the ratio of observed output to the potential output if \`u\` were zero (i.e., if the firm were technically efficient). In practice, for both DEA and SFA, software packages and statistical computing environments such as R, Python, STATA, or Matlab are often used to perform the complex calculations."},{"instruction":"dea是什么","output":"DEA全称为Data Envelopment Analysis，中文意为数据包络分析。它是一种非参数的线性规划方法，用于评价决策单元（Decision Making Units，简称DMUs）的相对效率。在这种分析中，决策单元可以是公司、医院、教育机构、银行分支机构等实体，主要用于评估其在将输入（如资本、劳动力）转换为输出（如产品、服务）过程中的效率表现。 DEA的核心思想是基于观察到的数据构建一个生产可能边界（或称为“效率前沿”），这个边界由所有考虑在内的决策单元中最高效率的单元所构成。这个前沿提供了一个基准或参照系，用于评估其他决策单元的相对效率。在这个前沿上的决策单元被视为有效率的，它们接收一个效率得分为1，而在前沿下方的单元则被认为是低效率的，其得分介于0至1之间。 DEA的基本步骤如下： 1. 收集数据：对于每个决策单元，需要收集关于其输入和输出的数据。 2. 选择输入和输出的指标：决定用哪些指标来衡量输入和输出。 3. 构建线性规划模型：对每一个要评价的决策单元，构建一个线性规划模型来计算效率得分。 4. 解决线性规划问题：使用数学编程方法，如单纯形法或内点法，来解决模型，并获得效率得分。 5. 分析结果：通过比较得分，识别效率较低的决策单元，并探讨提高效率的可能途径。 DEA模型有不同的变量返回形式（input-oriented 或 output-oriented），以及不同的返回规模假设（如CRS：常规返回规模或VRS：可变返回规模）。 DEA是一个有用的分析工具，因为它不需要指定一个特定的生产函数形式，并且可以处理多个输入和输出的情况。然而，由于其非参数特性和对数据“套壳”的方式，DEA的结果可能对数据中的离群值和噪声较为敏感。这就要求在应用该方法时，需要对数据的准确性和一致性有较高的要求。"},{"instruction":"是个可以下载的软件吗","output":"Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) 并不是一款特定的软件，而是一种分析方法。不过，存在着多种软件和工具包，这些软件可以实现DEA方法来评估决策单元的效率。些软件和工具可以是独立的应用程序，也可以是某个更大统计软件平台的插件或者扩展包。 以下是一些可以用于进行DEA分析的软件和工具： 1. **DEAP**: 即 Data Envelopment Analysis Program，这是一个用于运行DEA的免费软件，由Tim Coelli开发。它是写在DOS时代的软件，但可以在现代操作系统上通过命令行运行。DEAP主要用于教育和学术研究。 2. **MaxDEA**: 这是一款易于使用的Windows应用程序，专门用于DEA分析，具备友好的图形用户界面和数据处理功能。MaxDEA不仅提供了基础的DEA模型，还包括了一些高级变体。 3. **R**: R是一个开源统计计算和图形软件环境。它拥有多个扩展包，比如\`Benchmarking\`，\`DEoptimR\`，和\`FME\`等，这些包可以用来执行DEA及相关的效率分析。 4. **MATLAB**: MATLAB是一个数值计算软件平台，它有专门的工具箱，如DEA工具箱，用于进行DEA计算和模型建立。 5. **Frontier Analyst**: 这是一款商业软件，用户友好，并提供了直观的图形界面。Frontier Analyst被许多非学术机构用来评估效率。 6. **Python**: Python中有\`pyDEA\`这样的库可以用来执行DEA分析，对于熟悉Python编程的用户来说，这是一个灵活的选择。 7. **GAMS**: General Algebraic Modeling System（GAMS）是一个高级建模系统，适用于复杂的模型。它可以用于建立和解决大型、复杂的DEA模型。 8. **Stata**: Stata是一款统计软件，通常用于社会科学领域。它含有执行DEA分析的命令和程序。 为了使用这些软件进行DEA分析，用户通常需要准备数据，了解要分析的决策单元的具体细节以及相关的DEA模型。部分软件为使用者提供了图形用户界面(GUI)，简化了操作过程，也有的需要通过编程或脚本来执行。 总之，你不一定可以直接下载一个名为\\"DEA\\"的单独软件应用程序，但可以根据你的需求和技能水平选择适合你的DEA工具，并将其用于评价效率。"},{"instruction":"What is farell efficient how to measure","output":"Farrell efficiency refers to a measure of the efficiency of a production unit, often relative to an efficient frontier, based on the ratio of weighted outputs to weighted inputs. Michael Farrell first proposed this concept in 1957 to measure the efficiency of agricultural production. To measure Farrell efficiency, you can analyze two main aspects of efficiency: 1. **Technical Efficiency (TE)**: This measures how well a production unit converts inputs into outputs relative to the best-performing unit. A technically efficient unit is one that produces the maximum possible outputs from a given set of inputs or, conversely, uses the minimum possible inputs to produce a given level of outputs. Technical efficiency is unit-specific and is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates full technical efficiency. 2. **Allocative Efficiency (AE)**: This measures whether a production unit has chosen the optimal combination of inputs, considering their respective prices and the overall cost constraints. A production unit is allocatively efficient if it cannot reduce the cost of production by using a different mix of inputs while still producing the same output level. **Farrell's overall efficiency measure** combines both technical and allocative efficiency and is fundamentally the product of the two: Overall Efficiency (OE) = Technical Efficiency (TE) × Allocative Efficiency (AE) To calculate Farrell efficiency, you generally use techniques like Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) or Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA): - **Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)**: DEA is a non-parametric method that uses linear programming to construct a frontier over the data points representing different production units. Each unit's efficiency is calculated by comparing its performance with that of the 'best practice' units on the frontier. - **Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA)**: SFA is a parametric approach that assumes a specific functional form for the production function and includes a statistical noise component to capture the random variation. SFA can separate this noise from the inefficiency effects when measuring a production unit's performance relative to the frontier. Both DEA and SFA can be used to measure Farrell efficiency by constructing an efficient frontier, identifying where a production unit is operating relative to this frontier, and determining both technical and allocative efficiency components. The calculated efficiencies are unit-specific and provide insights into where improvements can be made to reach optimal performance. It's important to note that to measure either technical or allocative efficiency accurately, you would need detailed data on inputs, outputs, and input prices of the production units being analyzed. The choice between using DEA or SFA largely depends on the nature of the data, the structure of the industry, and the preferences of the analyst."},{"instruction":"What is farell efficient how to measure output-oriented technically efficient","output":"Farrell efficiency refers to the concept of measuring the efficiency of a production unit, and it includes both technical and allocative efficiency. An output-oriented technical efficiency measures the ability of a production unit to maximize outputs from a given set of inputs, compared to the best-performing unit or units. To measure output-oriented technical efficiency, we assess how much a production unit could proportionally increase output without changing the level of inputs, given the technology and scale of operations, based on the performances of the most efficient units in the sample (i.e., those lying on the efficient frontier). These measures are often calculated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is particularly suitable for handling multiple inputs and outputs without needing a predefined form of a production function. Here's a simplified outline of how output-oriented technical efficiency can be measured using DEA: 1. **Select Input and Output Variables**: To begin, you must collect data on all relevant inputs used and outputs produced by the production units being studied. The inputs might include labor, capital, materials, etc., while outputs vary based on the industry – products sold, services rendered, etc. 2. **Construct DEA Model**: Using the input and output data, you can construct a DEA model. For output-oriented technical efficiency, the aim is to see how much a production unit can increase output without increasing inputs. The basic mathematical formulation considers multiple inputs and outputs and calculates efficiency scores without explicitly estimating a production function. 3. **Solve Linear Programming Problem**: For each production unit in your sample (each DMU - Decision Making Unit), you solve a linear programming problem. The objective is to maximize the ratio of weighted outputs to weighted inputs for the DMU under evaluation, subject to the constraint that this ratio cannot exceed 1 for any DMUs that form the efficient frontier. 4. **Calculate Efficiency Scores**: The linear program will yield each DMU's efficiency score. An efficiency score of 1 indicates that the production unit is operating on the efficient frontier (it is fully efficient), and for output-oriented DEA, this means the DMU cannot proportionally increase its outputs further given its input levels. Scores less than 1 indicate the proportion by which the DMU could increase its outputs to become efficient (i.e., to reach the efficient frontier). 5. **Interpretation**: Interpret the results to understand which units are efficient and which are not. For those not on the frontier, you can identify by how much they could potentially increase output to become efficient. To conduct DEA, analysts often use specialized software programs that handle linear programming problems, such as DEAP (Data Envelopment Analysis Program), MaxDEA, R (using packages like 'Benchmarking'), MATLAB with DEA-related toolboxes, or other similar tools. It's important to recognize that technical efficiency alone does not account for the cost of inputs; it only measures the maximum output generated from given inputs. Incorporating input prices would involve measuring allocative efficiency to assess whether the inputs are being used in a cost-minimizing way."},{"instruction":"how to use the shepard distance function if i got 3 inputs and 3 outputs and farell","output":"The Shepard distance function is a representation of production technology that can be used to measure the distance of an observation from the production frontier, which reflects the most efficient production possibility. When you are working with three inputs and three outputs and want to measure Farrell efficiency using the Shepard distance function, you can use either the input-oriented distance function or the output-oriented distance function. For brevity, let's discuss an output-oriented Shepard distance function in the context of Farrell efficiency: An output-oriented distance function measures how much a production unit can proportionally scale up its outputs while holding inputs constant. In mathematical terms, the output-oriented distance function for unit (j) can be expressed as (D_{o}(y_{j},x_{j})), where (y_{j}) represents the outputs and (x_{j}) represents the inputs. If (D_{o}(y_{j},x_{j}) = 1), the unit is on the frontier (efficient). If (D_{o}(y_{j},x_{j}) < 1), the unit is inefficient - the value gives the proportional factor by which all outputs could be increased to make the unit efficient. To estimate this distance function using observed data on inputs and outputs, you will typically use either Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) or Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). Since we are discussing Shepard distance functions which are often calculated using parametric methods, we'll focus on SFA for this explanation. 1. **Collect Data**: Gather data on all three inputs and three outputs for each production unit. 2. **Specify a Functional Form**: Assume a functional form for the production technology (e.g., Cobb-Douglas, Translog). This functional form is your production frontier. 3. **Estimate the Frontier**: Use econometric techniques, such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), to estimate the parameters of the production frontier and the inefficiency term, which in the case of the output-oriented Shepard distance function, tells you by how much outputs can be increased. 4. **Compute Distance Measures**: Calculate the distance for each production unit. The distance measure effectively quantifies how far each unit's outputs need to be scaled up to reach the efficient frontier. 5. **Calculate Efficiency Scores**: - For output-oriented technical efficiency (Farrell efficiency), the calculated distance function directly gives you the efficiency score for each unit. - If you want to incorporate allocative efficiency as well to calculate overall Farrell efficiency, you would also need to include input prices to determine the cost-minimizing behavior. 6. **Interpret the Results**: Units with distance function scores of 1 are efficient; those with scores less than 1 are not and have room for improvement in their output levels. Implementing this estimation requires solid econometric knowledge, as you will have to deal with issues such as specifying the correct functional form, dealing with statistical noise (the random error term in SFA), and performing sophisticated statistical estimation. Using a software package like Stata, R, or SAS that supports econometric analysis can greatly facilitate this process. These packages include built-in functions or user-written procedures to estimate production frontiers and calculate efficiency scores using stochastic frontier analysis."},{"instruction":"User i have calculated the maximum and minimun and mean for each input and put put columns then what should i do in excel calculate distance function output","output":"To calculate the output-oriented distance function in Excel for each decision-making unit (DMU) based on the maximum, minimum, and mean that you have for each input and output, follow these steps: 1. **Organize Your Data**: Ensure your data is structured properly in Excel, with columns representing different inputs and outputs and rows representing each DMU. 2. **Normalize Your Data**: Depending on the approach to DEA you are using, you might want to normalize your data. This isn't strictly necessary, but it can help with the interpretation. You can do this by dividing all figures by the maximum value in the respective columns. 3. **Define the Linear Programming Problem**: For each DMU, you will start by setting up a linear programming problem to calculate the distance function. However, Excel's built-in solver can only handle one optimization problem at a time, so you'll have to do this iteratively for each DMU if you're not using a DEA-specific software. 4. **Create Objective Function and Constraints**: - Set up the objective cell that you want to maximize - this will represent the weighted sum of outputs for the DMU that you're evaluating. The weights (or multipliers) will need to be determined by the Solver. - Set up the constraint cells that will compare the weighted outputs of the DMU under evaluation to all other DMUs' weighted outputs to ensure they do not exceed a score of one. 5. **Run Solver**: In Excel, you would use the Solver feature to maximize the objective function subject to the constraints. For each DMU: - Open Solver (in Excel, you can find it under \`Data\` > \`Solver\`). - Set the Objective cell to the weighted sum of outputs for the DMU. - Choose 'Max' since you're going for an output-oriented model. - Define the constraints such that no DMU’s weighted sum of outputs exceeds their actual outputs (for an output-oriented model). - The weights are your variables to be determined by Solver - set their bounds between 0 and a large enough number or infinity. - Click Solve to run the optimization. 6. **Interpret Results**: - The solution provided by the Solver for the objective function will indicate the output-oriented technical efficiency score for the DMU. A score of 1 implies the DMU is efficient. A score lower than 1 implies inefficiency, with the score indicating the proportion of possible output level improvement. 7. **Repeat for Each DMU**: Unfortunately, in Excel, you need to repeat the above process for each DMU to get the full set of efficiency scores. For large datasets, this can be very time-consuming. 8. **Analysis of Efficiency Scores**: - Once you have the efficiency scores for all DMUs, you can further analyze these scores to determine which units are underperforming and by how much they could potentially increase their output. 9. **Calculate Distances**: If you want to determine the distance to the efficiency frontier for each DMU in your dataset, you would need to divide 1 by the efficiency score since, in the output-oriented model, a score less than 1 indicates the ratio by which all outputs could be proportionally expanded to reach the frontier. Please note that the above explanation simplifies the use of Excel for DEA, which is often complex and requires many data points and constraints to be set correctly. The method outlined here will give you a relative efficiency score under the assumptions made in data envelope analysis. For a more thorough and large-scale DEA, specialized DEA software or statistical packages are recommended."},{"instruction":"6.- Now, pay attention to the observations. Are they in the same layer over time? Are they jumping? or Are they jumping erratically?

Suppose these data points represent observations or performance metrics that have been collected in time series. In that case, you might be looking to identify trends, patterns, or changes in these observations. Here are steps and considerations for time series analysis, which you can apply whether you're using a spreadsheet, statistical software, or visual inspection: 1. **Visual Inspection**: - Create time series plots for each observation set. Plot the data points (observations) on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. - Look for trends: are the observations generally increasing, decreasing, or remaining relatively stable over time? - Identify any cyclic patterns: do the observations exhibit consistent patterns that repeat over a regular interval? 2. **Layer Analysis**: - If you believe that the observations could be grouped in layers (or clusters) over time, use color coding or different plotting symbols to distinguish these layers in your graphs. - Notice if the observations within the same layer move together over time or if they tend to shift from one layer to another. 3. **Jump Analysis**: - Identify any jumps: sudden changes in the level of the observations that could indicate shifts or shocks to the system. - Characterize the jumps: Are they isolated incidents? Do they occur at regular intervals, suggesting seasonality or other cyclical influences? 4. **Erratic Movements**: - Look for erratic behavior: significant and unpredictable fluctuations that could be the result of random noise or other external factors not captured in the data. - Determine if the erratic movements can be smoothed out or if they are integral to the behavior of the observations. 5. **Pattern Identification**: - Specify any conspicuous patterns: ascending, descending, stable, or combinations thereof. - Use statistical methods such as moving averages or trend lines to quantify and confirm visual patterns. 6. **Statistical Analysis**: - Use statistical techniques to analyze the data further. Time series analysis methods such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, or trend decomposition can help quantify and model the observed patterns. - Conduct tests for stationarity or structural breaks to see if the properties of the time series have changed over the analyzed period. 7. **Correlation and Regression Analysis**: - If you have multiple time series data, check for correlations between them. - Use regression analysis to discover relationships and dependencies between different observations. 8. **Consistency Checks**: - Consistency over time: If observations consistently remain in the same layer, they may indicate stability. - Transition patterns: If observations tend to jump between layers in a predictable manner, this may suggest a longer-term shift or trend. 9. **Document Findings**: - Record any identified patterns, anomalies, and overall behavior of the observations. - If discernible trends exist, consider their implications for future periods or decision-making. Remember, the nature, quality, and quantity of your data can significantly influence the reliability and interpretability of your analysis. The patterns observed and the methods used should be contextually appropriate and theoretically sound. Additionally, consider external factors that could explain the observed movements in your data."},{"instruction":"how to do Benchmarking: LAYERS using farell","output":"Benchmarking using Farrell efficiency involves comparing the performance of various decision-making units (DMUs) based on their efficiency scores to identify best practices and areas where less efficient units can improve. In the context of Farrell efficiency, benchmarking often employs layers to group DMUs based on their similarity in performance. Here's how you might approach layer-based benchmarking: 1. **Calculate Efficiency Scores**: - First, calculate the technical efficiency scores for each DMU using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) or Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). Output-oriented measures would focus on how much more output each DMU could produce with the same inputs if it were fully efficient, while input-oriented measures focus on how much inputs could be reduced while producing the same output level. 2. **Group DMUs into Layers**: - Once you have the efficiency scores (ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 being fully efficient), you can categorize DMUs into layers or performance tiers. - One way to define layers is by setting efficiency score ranges. For example, all DMUs with efficiency scores between 0.9 and 1 could be the top layer (best performers), scores from 0.8 to 0.9 could be the second layer, and so on. 3. **Identify Benchmarks**: - The DMUs in the top layer would be the benchmarks or \\"best practice\\" units because they have the highest efficiency scores. These are the units that others should aim to emulate. 4. **Compare Against Benchmarks**: - Analyzing the distance between a DMU's efficiency score and the benchmark (a score of 1 or the top-performing units) allows you to pinpoint how short they fall from the best practices. 5. **Investigate Practices** - For each layer below the benchmark, investigate the operational, managerial, and other relevant practices that may explain the differences in efficiency. 6. **Develop Improvement Plans**: - Based on the analysis, create tailored plans for each DMU to close the gap. These plans might include adopting new technologies, training, process re-engineering, etc. 7. **Monitor and Adjust**: - After implementing the improvement plans, continuously monitor DMUs' performance over time, comparing them against the updated benchmarks and adjusting plans as necessary. It is important when setting layers and interpreting the results that you consider the context of each DMU, such as size, scope, or market conditions that might affect their operational and efficiency constraints. Benchmarking is not just about ranking; it's about understanding what the top performers do well and how that can be translated to less efficient units in a practicable and contextually relevant way. In terms of tools, while Excel can compute efficiency scores using DEA, for serious benchmarking and efficiency analysis, especially with many DMUs and complex input-output configurations, DEA software or statistical packages like R, Stata, or MATLAB, which offer more advanced DEA capabilities, are usually required."},{"instruction":"so after i found out first layer should recalculate the farell","output":"After you have identified the first layer of DMUs—typically, those operating on the efficiency frontier or those with the highest efficiency scores—there is generally no need to recalculate Farrell efficiency for these units unless there have been changes in the data or the set of DMUs you are analyzing. The calculation of efficiency scores is done relative to the current technology (or best practice frontier) observed within the dataset. However, there are scenarios where recalculation or further analysis may be appropriate: 1. **Dynamic Analysis**: If time periods are involved and you're looking at the efficiency of the same DMUs over multiple time frames, you may want to recalculate efficiency scores for different periods to understand how efficiency evolves over time. 2. **Excluding Top Performers**: In some applications of DEA, analysts may be interested in recalculating efficiency scores after removing the most efficient firms to assess the impact on the efficiency scores of other firms. The idea here is to see what the \\"second-best\\" frontier looks like and what that implies for the remainder of the units. 3. **Incorporating Slacks**: Sometimes, in DEA, it's not just about the efficiency score but also about the slack in each input or output. After the initial calculation, you might want to perform an analysis of slack to see if any resources are under- or over-utilized. 4. **Alternative Models**: If the first round of efficiency calculations was done using a specific DEA model (e.g., assuming constant returns to scale), you might want to recalculate using an alternative DEA model (e.g., assuming variable returns to scale) to see how the efficiency scores change. 5. **Updated Data or DMUs**: If new data becomes available or if additional DMUs are added to the analysis, you should recalculate the efficiency scores because the production frontier may change. 6. **Error or Variation in Data**: Upon reviewing the data or the efficiency scores, you might discover errors or variations that were not accounted for initially. Correcting these and recalculating the efficiency scores could provide more accurate results. 7. **Revised Objective or Scope**: If the objective of the analysis changes (for instance, you might want to focus on a specific subset of outputs or redefine what constitutes efficiency), the DEA model and its results would need updating. 8. **Peer Group Analysis**: When benchmarking, it can be helpful to analyze peer groups with similar characteristics. You might need to recalculate efficiency scores for a specific group after the overall analysis to glean more targeted insights. Remember that each round of calculation and comparison should be justified and serve the overall goal of the analysis, whether it's to improve the performance of the DMUs, understand the dynamics of the production technology, or adjust operational strategies in the face of new data or market conditions."},{"instruction":"RESUMEN Being interesting can be overrated.

Accountants became suddenly intriguing in 2002 with the spectacular collapse of Arthur Andersen, because of its involvement in the scandals surrounding the fall of Enron. This added unwanted colour to a grey profession. Since then the surviving titans of accountancy--Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Ernst &Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), also known as the Big Four--have mostly retreated back into the shadows of public awareness. But interesting they remain, above all for the way they manage their people. It is not just that they collectively employ some 500,000 people around the world. Many companies are as big as they are. Unlike most, however, the Big Four really mean it when they say that people are their biggest assets. Their product is their employees' knowledge and their distribution channels are the relationships between their staff and clients. More than most they must worry about how to attract and retain the brightest workers. Time is regularly set aside at the highest levels to chew over how best to do this. Detailed goals are set: Deloitte's 2010 business plan includes targets for staff turnover, the scores it seeks in its annual staff survey and the proportion of female partners it would like to have. Partners are increasingly measured and rewarded as managers of people, not just for the amount of money they bring in. People-related items account for one-third of the scorecard used to evaluate partners at PwC. KPMG's British firm has introduced time codes so that employees can account for how long they spend dealing with staff matters. The idea is that those who devote lots of time to people-related matters are not disadvantaged as a result in pay rises and promotion. The Big Four are by no means perfect. The sheer numbers they employ can still make them feel like sausage factories. Small firms are quick to take advantage of that when recruiting. Nevertheless, the big firms' evolving efforts to attract the best candidates and to encourage and keep the brightest people provide useful lessons for other companies. The most intractable problem is that there are never enough skilled or promising people to go around. Just as competition for the best of the bunch is growing, the pool of available talent is changing. In America baby-boomers are flooding into retirement; in Europe the market is greying; and in India and China the large number of graduates masks low numbers of truly high-quality candidates. Staff demands There are added problems for accountancy firms. Job cuts earlier in the decade created a shortfall of people now. Regulatory changes, such as America's Sarbanes-Oxley Act, have boosted demand from clients not just for accountants' services but also for their staff. To add to their difficulties the Big Four are now aggressively reentering the field of advisory services, necessitating a new burst of hiring. Ernst &Young is not unusual: it hired some 25,000 people in 2006, but expects to hire 30,000 this year and 35,000 in 2008.Much of this recruitment is aimed at hard-to-find experienced professionals, especially important in the advisory businesses where corporate knowledge is highly valued. As a result, an old taboo is being broken and more outsiders brought straight in as partners. Robust selection procedures are used to ensure that they fit in. Programmes that help keep the firm in touch with former employees are also being strengthened so that people who leave can more easily find their way back (these \\"boomerangs\\" account for up to a quarter of those hired by the Big Four in America). Former employees can also act as useful recruiting agents and help to drum up new business. For these alumni programmes to work \\"a massive cultural switch\\" is needed, says Keith Dugdale, who looks after global recruitment for KPMG. Few employers are used to helping people leave on good terms. But in an era of job-hopping and a scarcity of skills, loyalty increasingly means having a sense of emotional allegiance to an employer, whether or not that person is still physically on the payroll. A similar change in attitude is needed to manage the careers of female employees. Each of the Big Four wants to promote more women, who account for about half of their recruits but around a quarter, at best, of their partners. Many women drop off the career ladder at some point (usually to have children or to care for an elderly relative) and find it difficult to get back on again. Options such as career breaks and part-time working are part of the accountants' response. \\"The Big Four are ahead of most in managing talented women,\\" says Sylvia Hewlett, author of \\"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps\\", a new book on the subject (see box on next page). 翻译成中文","output":"尽管这可能会让人感到惊奇，但四大会计师事务所在管理人才方面确实有许多东西可以教给其他公司。 有趣有时会被高估。2002年，因涉及围绕安然公司倒闭的丑闻，安达信会计师事务所突然倒闭引起了轰动，这为本已平淡无奇的职业带来了不必要的色彩。自那以后，会计行业的巨头们——德勤、安永、毕马威和普华永道（也被称为四大）——大多数都回到了公众视野的阴影中。然而，他们仍然有趣，尤其是在他们管理人才的方式上。这不仅仅是因为他们在全球共同雇佣了大约50万名员工。许多公司和他们一样庞大。然而，不同于大多数其他公司的是，四大真的认为人才是他们最宝贵的财产。他们的产品是员工的知识，而他们的分销渠道是员工与客户之间的关系。他们比大多数公司都更加关心如何吸引和留住最聪明的员工。在最高层级，人们定期会花时间考虑怎样才能最好地做到这一点。详细的目标被制定：例如，德勤2010年的商业计划包括员工流失率的目标、它在年度员工调查中寻求的分数，以及它希望拥有的女性合伙人的比例。合伙人越来越多地以人员管理者的身份来衡量和奖励，而不只是基于他们赚取的金额。在普华永道，与人有关的项目占用评估合伙人的评分卡的三分之一。毕马威英国公司引入了时间代码，以便员工可以记账他们花在处理员工事务上的时间。这样做的理念是花了大量时间在与人有关的事务上的人不会在加薪和晋升上因此处于不利地位。 四大绝不是完美的。他们雇佣的人数众多，有时仍然会给人工厂式的感觉。在招聘时，小公司会迅速利用这一点。尽管如此，大型公司在吸引最佳候选人并鼓励和留住最聪明的员工方面不断演变的努力，为其他公司提供了有益的经验。 最棘手的问题是，有才华或有前途的人永远不够用。就在对最优秀的人才的竞争不断增长的同时，可用人才的池子也在变化。在美国，婴儿潮一代正在涌入退休；在欧洲，市场正在老龄化；而在印度和中国，虽然毕业生数量众多，但真正高质量的候选人却很少。 员工需求 会计师事务所还面临其他问题。本世纪初的裁员造成了现在人手不足的局面。像美国的萨班斯-奥克斯利法案这样的监管变化，不仅提升了客户对会计师服务的需求，也提升了对他们员工的需求。增加他们的困难的是，四大现在正积极重新进入咨询服务领域，这需要新一轮的招聘。安永并不罕见：它在2006年雇佣了大约25000人，但预计今年将雇佣30000人，2008年将雇佣35000人。很多这样的招聘活动是针对难以找到的有经验的专业人士，特别是在咨询业务中非常重视公司知识的领域。结果，一个旧的禁忌被打破了，更多的外部人员直接以合伙人身份被引进。强有力的选拔程序被用来确保他们融入团队。 这些项目也在加强，以帮助公司与前员工保持联系，这样那些离开的人就能更容易找到回来的路（在美国，这些“回力标”占四大雇佣人数的四分之一）。前员工还可以充当有效的招聘代理，并帮助招揽新生意。为了让这些校友计划起作用，“需要进行大规模文化转变”，KPMG负责全球招聘的Keith Dugdale说。很少有雇主习惯于帮助员工以良好的条件离开。但在跳槽成风的时代和技能短缺的情况下，忠诚越来越多地意味着对雇主有一种情感上的联系，无论这个人是否仍然在工资名册上。 要管理女性员工的职业发展，也需要类似的态度转变。四大每家都想提升更多女性，女性占他们的招聘人数的大约一半，但合伙人中最多只占四分之一。很多女性在某个时候会从职业阶梯上掉下来（通常是为了生孩子或照顾年迈的亲戚），并发现很难再重新上去。诸如职业休假和非全职工作等选择是会计师们作出的回应的一部分。“在管理有才华的女性方面，四大领先于大多数公司，”Sylvia Hewlett说，她是《下车与再上路》一书的作者，该书就是关于这个话题的（见下页框中）。"},{"instruction":"Across borders Gaps in one country can be plugged with people from another. The Big Four have big plans in Asia, especially China. Deloitte aims to have 20,000 people in greater China by 2015, up from some 8,500 now. But like other firms it is finding that experienced people are thinner on the ground than promising but untested ones. One answer is to use member firms outside China to find experienced Chinese emigres who want to return home, although they do not always get on well with local employees. Similar techniques are used to handle temporary gluts of work. Canadian accountants cross the border in droves during the American audit season to reinforce their American colleagues' efforts. Mobility is seen as a useful way to retain and help employees develop. International assignments can be critical in attracting new graduates. According to Pierre Hurstel, Ernst &Young's global managing partner for people, new entrants want to work abroad: that's the biggest change in recruits in the past five years, he says. Recruiters at PwC are authorised to promise the best candidates on campus language training and an overseas visit at the end of their first year. International assignments can be pledged after two to three years. High-minded young people also want to work for companies with a decent ethical reputation. Retaining good people is the biggest challenge. Turnover rates at the Big Four have historically been high--roughly 15-20% leave each year, compared with as few as 5% in some other industries. The cost of this is \\"astronomical\\", says Jim Wall, Deloitte's managing director of human resources. Mr Wall reckons that every percentage-point drop in annual turnover rates equates to a saving of 400m-500m. Even so, the accountant's goals are more nuanced than simply increasing retention rates. None of the big accountancy firms wants churn rates to fall too far, if only to keep the performance bar high. Mr Wall thinks a 10- 12% turnover rate would be about right; Richard Baird, PwC's people chief，reckons that 12-15% is comfortable. Rather, the Big Four want more of their most talented people to stay. The biggest staff exodus comes after three years, once recruits have been certified as accountants. Many never intend to stay any longer, aiming instead to parlay their qualifications into a new job and a fatter pay cheque somewhere else. That presents the Big Four with a particular problem: how to identify future stars among the mass of raw recruits. The trouble is, most talent-development programmes start at a later stage in people's careers. One strategy is simply to persuade people to stay longer, which provides more time for employers to spot and seduce the best performers. The Big Four can point to research conducted among leavers that many would like to return and that even more wish they had stayed longer. Leaving after six years rather than three, say, means that people tend to go into better jobs with higher pay--which can also help the effectiveness of the alumni network. Driving talent-management practices deeper into the organisation is the bigger priority, says Tony Osude, of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants. Talent-spotting has traditionally been left to a middlemanagement layer of audit supervisors until people get closer to being a partner (partly because employees tend to be invisible to many of their superiors, working as they do in small teams at the offices of the client). The effect has been to underutilise one of the big organisational advantages that the Big Four have: a large pool of partners who can help coach less experienced staff. That is changing. Rather than seeing junior staff as expendable drones, the Big Four's talent bosses want partners to view them as future assets. As well as tying reward schemes to the better management of people, the behaviour of partners is being changed in smaller ways. Deloitte's British firm asks partners to spend a minute with their staff immediately after client meetings to provide feedback so that they fulfil more of a training role. Scoring skills Changing the way partners behave takes time and will not solve every problem. Audit work is not the world's most fascinating job and junior staff have limited influence over their assignments. But they can be given a clearer idea of how their career might shape up and greater control over it. Ernst &Young spent years asking partners to identify the skills needed for a gamut of roles, each of which carries a rating from one for beginner to five for a master. Using this, staff will soon be able to view not only a profile of their skills but also what capabilities they need to acquire in order to move up into more senior positions. Many of the training and development services are delivered electronically. By giving people more control over their career development the big accounting firms are starting to recognise that an overly aggressive \\"up or out\\" approach is a risky strategy when skills and bright people are in short supply. \\"Not everyone will be a senior partner,\\" says Doug Jukes, KPMG's lead partner for people management. \\"But they can still be extremely valuable to the firm.\\" Deloitte is in the process of boosting the status and pay of principals, a grade between director and partner for senior people. Even so, a partnership remains the goal of the ambitious. KPMG has a programme called Compass, which identifies 11 career milestones on the path to becoming a senior partner, each of which triggers development activities. PwC runs Genesis Park, a five-month residential course for a hand-picked group of would-be partners from around the world. People are expected to keep learning and networking after they have been made a partner too. Mr Hurstel, at Ernst &Young, worries about how to keep long-serving partners happy and energised, especially after the Enron scandals have eroded their godlike status. \\"Great armies have the capacity to restore their wounded,\\" he says. One of the programmes he runs is called \\"leaving a legacy\\". It is designed in part to help prepare partners for life outside the firm, perhaps as board directors, but also to help them pass on their expertise. The scale of resources pumped into talent management by the Big Four may be beyond most employers, but many of their ideas could still be copied. Building programmes that keep the company in touch with former employees, offering more flexible career paths to women and making people management an explicit part of the incentive system for senior staff are all useful tools for employers of people who think for a living. A more intriguing question is whether the organisational structure of the big accounting firms also has lessons for other companies. 翻译成中文","output":"跨越国界 一个国家的人才缺口可以用另一个国家的人才来弥补。四大会计师事务所在亚洲，特别是中国，有雄心勃勃的计划。德勤的目标是到2015年在大中华区拥有20,000名员工，而现在大约有8,500名。但像其他公司一样，它发现有经验的人才不如那些有前途但未经验证的人才那么多。一个解决办法是利用中国以外的成员公司来寻找想要回国的有经验的中国移民，尽管他们并不总是与本地员工相处融洽。类似的技巧也被用来应对临时工作量激增的情况。加拿大会计师在美国审计季节成群结队地过境，以加强他们在美国的同事的工作。 员工流动性被视为保留和帮助员工发展的一种有用方式。国际工作任务对于吸引新毕业生至关重要。根据安永全球人力资源管理合伙人皮埃尔·赫斯特尔的说法，新入职者想要出国工作：这是过去五年来招聘对象中最大的变化。普华永道的招聘人员被授权向校园内最优秀的候选人承诺提供语言培训，并在他们第一年结束时安排一次海外访问。在两到三年后可以承诺国际工作任务。有远见的年轻人也希望为有良好道德声誉的公司工作。 留住优秀员工是最大的挑战。四大的员工流失率历来都很高——大约每年有15-20%的人离职，而其他一些行业的员工流失率低至5%。这方面的成本是“天文数字”，德勤人力资源管理总监吉姆·沃尔说。沃尔估计，每下降一个百分点的年度流失率相当于节省了4亿至5亿美元。 即使如此，会计师的目标比简单提高留存率更为微妙。没有一个大型会计师事务所希望流失率下降得太多，只是为了保持高绩效标准。沃尔认为10-12%的流失率就很合适；普华永道的人事负责人理查德·贝尔德认为12-15%的流失率令人满意。相反，四大希望更多的最有才华的人留下来。 最大的员工流失出现在员工取得会计师资格后的三年内。许多人从一开始就没打算呆得更久，而是想利用他们的资格换取新的工作和在别处更丰厚的薪水。这为四大带来了特别的问题：如何在大量新招聘员工中识别未来的明星。问题是，大多数人才发展计划都是在人们职业生涯的后期阶段才开始的。 一种策略就是简单地说服人们待得更久，这样雇主就有更多时间来发现并吸引最好的表现者。四大可以指出在离职者之间进行的调查研究，很多人希望回来，甚至更多的人希望他们呆的更久。比如说，离开六年而不是三年意味着人们往往能进入更好的工作，获得更高的薪水——这也可以帮助校友网络的有效性。 一个更大的优先事项是将人才管理实践深入到组织中，特许公认会计师协会的Tony Osude说。传统上，人才发现工作被留给了审计主管一层中间管理层，直到人们接近成为合伙人为止（部分原因是因为员工倾向于对许多上级不可见，因为他们在客户办公室的小团队中工作）。 这样的效果是没有充分利用四大拥有的一个重要组织优势：一大群可以帮助辅导经验不那么丰富的员工的合伙人。这种情况正在改变。与其把初级员工视为牺牲品，四大的人才负责人希望合伙人将他们视为未来的资产。除了将奖励计划和更好的人员管理挂钩外，还有些小的方式正在改变合伙人的行为。德勤英国公司要求合伙人在客户会议后立刻与其员工共度一分钟，提供反馈，以便他们更多地扮演培训角色。 改变合伙人的行为需要时间，并不能解决所有问题。审计工作并不是世界上最令人着迷的工作，初级员工对他们的任务几乎没有影响力。但他们可以对自己的职业发展有一个更清晰的想法，并对其拥有更多的控制权。安永花了几年时间让合伙人识别出一系列角色所需的技能，每一项都从一级初学者到五级大师进行评级。利用这一点，员工很快就能不仅查看他们的技能档案，还能了解他们需要获得什么能力才能晋升到更高级的职位。许多培训和发展服务都是通过电子方式提供的。 通过让人们对自己的职业发展有更多的控制权，大型会计师事务所开始认识到，在技能和有才华的人才短缺时，过于激进的“要么上升，要么出局”方法是一种冒险的策略。“并不是每个人都会成为高级合伙人，”毕马威人员管理领头合伙人道格·朱克斯说。“但他们仍然可以对公司极其有价值。”德勤正在提升高级职员的职位和工资，这一级别介于董事和合伙人之间。 即便如此，合伙人仍是雄心勃勃者的目标。毕马威有一个名为Compass的程序，它确定了成为高级合伙人路径上的11个职业里程碑，每个里程碑都会触发发展活动。普华永道运营着名为Genesis Park的课程，这是一个为全球精挑细选的准合伙人组成的团队提供的为期五个月的住宿式课程。 人们在被提升为合伙人后也应该继续学习和建立人脉。安永的赫斯特尔担心如何让长期服役的合伙人感到满意和精力充沛，尤其是在安然丑闻之后他们像神一样的地位受到侵蚀。“伟大的军队有恢复伤员的能力，”他说。他运营的一个名为“留下遗产”的项目，部分目的是帮助合伙人准备在公司之外的生活，可能作为董事会成员，但也帮助他们传承他们的专业知识。 四大会计师事务所在人才管理方面投入的资源规模可能超出了大多数雇主的能力，但他们的许多想法仍然可以被复制。建立保持与前员工联系的项目，为女性提供更加灵活的职业路径，使人员管理成为高级员工激励体系的明确部分，这些都是为靠思考为生的人雇主的有用工具。一个更加有趣的问题是，大型会计师事务所的组织结构是否也有给其他公司的经验教训。"},{"instruction":"More room at the top Being a partnership confers some advantages. It is not just that a large number of senior people are available to help train and encourage junior ones--what Deloitte's Mr Wall calls an apprentice model--but that more people can succeed. Whereas success at a typical company means climbing to one of a few top positions--and probably elbowing others aside in the process--partnerships provide a broader top to the pyramid. Between them, the Big Four firms had more than 30,000 partners in 2006. Partnerships are also flexible: if someone is good enough, the number of partners can be expanded to accommodate them. They are also consensual in style, which is important when managing clever, self-regarding people. The principles of joint ownership help to encourage networking and co-operative behaviour. \\"It is easier to persuade people about the importance of talent management in a partnership,\\" says Mr Baird. But partnerships also have their downsides. Decision-making and innovation can be a lot tougher when so many other people have to be consulted. And in big partnerships people cease to know each other personally. For the Big Four, these problems are reinforced by their unwieldy federations of individual member firms scattered around the world. According to Lowell Bryan, a partner at McKinsey and author of \\"Mobilising Minds\\", a new book on getting the most from people, the ideal corporate organisation would blend elements of the typical company, the armed forces and professional services firms. An expanded \\"partner-like\\" group of senior managers at the top of the company is one of the features that he thinks could usefully be borrowed from professional services. Cynics may wonder if the Big Four's focus on talent is only cyclical. Will expansion in their fast-growing advisory businesses make them less concerned about nurturing people in lower-margin audit work? Would an economic downturn quickly send head-counts plunging again? The size of workforces at individual firms, and in the business lines within them, will continue to ebb and flow with demand. But the supply constraints faced by employers are more rigid. As the battle in the long-heralded \\"war for talent\\" is joined across industries and countries, it could be worth keeping an eye on how the Big Four are quietly leading the charge. 翻译成中文","output":"顶层有更多空间 合伙人制度有一些优势。不仅是因为有大量的高层人士可以帮助培训和鼓励初级员工——德勤的沃尔先生所说的学徒模式——还因为有更多的人可以获得成功。而在一个典型的公司里，成功意味着攀登到少数几个高位——并且可能在这个过程中把其他人挤到一边——合伙人结构为金字塔提供了一个更宽广的顶层。2006年，四大事务所之间有超过30,000名合伙人。 合伙人结构也是灵活的：如果有人足够优秀，可以扩大合伙人的数量以容纳他们。它们的风格也是以共识为导向的，这在管理聪明、自视甚高的人时非常重要。共同拥有的原则有助于鼓励建立人际网络和合作行为。“在合伙人关系中，说服人们人才管理的重要性更容易，”贝尔德先生说。 但合伙人结构也有它的缺点。当需要咨询那么多人的时候，决策和创新可能会困难得多。而在庞大的合伙人结构中，人们不再亲自了解对方。对四大来说，由世界各地散布的独立会员公司组成的庞大联盟进一步加剧了这些问题。 根据麦肯锡合伙人、《动员心智》一书的作者洛威尔·布莱恩的说法，理想的公司组织将融合典型公司、武装部队和专业服务公司的元素。他认为，一个扩大的类似合伙人的高级管理人员群体是可以有用地借鉴专业服务公司的特点之一。愤世嫉俗的人可能会怀疑四大对人才的关注是否只是周期性的。他们在快速增长的咨询业务中的扩张会不会让他们对培养低利润审计工作中的人才不太关注？经济低迷是否会迅速导致人数再次大幅减少？各个公司个别的员工规模和他们内部的业务线将继续随着需求的增减而变动。但雇主面临的供应限制更为僵硬。随着长期宣告的“人才之战”在各个行业和国家拉开战幕，值得关注的是四大如何在不声不响中引领潮流。"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Tiger","output":"Tiger Majesty | Bold Feline Artwork for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Versatile Wildlife Design | Striking Tiger Print | Home Decor & Apparel"},{"instruction":"5.

With Japan united under the Ōtsutsuki clan and [Japan in this story] ruling over Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils once more, the Meta Liberation Army [My Hero Academia] and its [the MLA's] Quirk supremacist agenda are quickly crushed by the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Kempeitai and so the Hero system [My Hero Academia] never takes off in Japan, with the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo], which [the Armed Detective system] had been indefinitely suspended after the Great Cataclysm in this story, [the Armed Detective System] instead being revived [the Armed Detective System] to manage Quirks, the pyrokinetics known as Generations [Fire Force] as well as the young girls and women who form contracts with the mythical gods and deities from another dimension known as Divas [Magika Swordsman and Summoner].

The post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire initially has no idea that it [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] has been transported to a different world [the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki], and [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] quickly secures its [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire's] borders, [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] checking up on its military and civilian space orbital satelites only to realize that it [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] is in an entirely new world the alternate world which is an amalgam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki] as police call centers are flooded with reports of altered locations, changed roads and mysterious creatures [monmosu and contracted spirits] appearing with the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Kempeitai working with the Japanese National Police Agency and Japanese Public Security Agency to eventually successfully restore order in the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire, with the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Emperor and the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese shogun planning to give a televised message to the Japanese people. A post-WW2, post-1947 surviving successful Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Pan-Asian anti-communist and anti-colonialist bloc formed by the real life Japanese Empire which [the Co-Prosperity Sphere] was resurrected in 1967 as ASEAN in real life, which [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] was able to survive along with the Japanese Empire past 1947 in its original world thanks to Woodrow Wilson dying as a child during the American Civil War and [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] consists of the post-1928 Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China as a post 1945 surviving Reorganized Government of the Republic of China, later reformed in the 1950s into Beiyang China's original status as a regency for the restoration of the pre-Qing Manchu-Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu Great Ming Empire/Ming dynasty with the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China being restored in the 1960s with the descendants of the House of Zhu becoming the Chinese Imperial family surviving once more, a post 1945 surviving former former Qing Imperial Family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo which [the surviving Empire of Manchukuo] managed to get all of Outer Manchuria after WW2 in its original world, a post 1945-surviving Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation in Inner Mongolia's Charhar and Suiyan regions, a post-WW2 restored Far Eastern Republic in Russia's East Coast, a post-WW2 restored Bogd Khan-ruled post-WW2 restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia ruling over Mongolia and the parts of Inner Mongolia unclaimed by Mengjiang, a post-1955 surviving nativized Vietnamese side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Imperial House of Ngyuen-ruled Empire of Vietnam, a post-1975 surviving Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos, a Kingdom of Cambodia that never experienced the Cambodian Civil War or the subsequent rise of the Khmer Rouge, a restored Kobaung dynasty-ruled Third Burmese Empire ruling over Burma, a restored Tungning Kingdom in the South Chinese region of Cantonia a post-WW2 restored Imperial House of Osman-ruled restored Ottoman Empire in Xingjiang/East Turkestan, a post-1950s surviving Kingdom of Tibet, a greater Malyasia that includes Singapore, an Indonesian federation ruled by the royal family of Indonesia's Yogyakarta region, the House of Hamengkubuwono as its [the Indonesian Federation's] imperial family, a restored Phillipine Empire ruled by the restored Sultans of Maguindanao as its Emperors, Brunei and a restored House of Kalākaua-ruled restored Kingdom of Hawaii ruling over all of Hawaii is [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] copied and the copy [of the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] placed [the copy of the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] in the geographical areas of the Greater Asia equivalent of the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, with the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China merging with the Fire Nation within the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China] inheriting its the Fire Nation within the almagam world's] conventional military and naval, contracted spirit, Pal and firebender strength along with its [the the Fire Nation within the almagam world's] massive industrial, economic and population might, while [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China] keeping its [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty's in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China's] own military, economic and technological might, the copies of the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang both [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] replacing the Greater Earth Kingdom within the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki and [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] both [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] getting its [the Greater Earth Kingdom's] conventional military and naval, contracted spirit, Pal and earthbender strength along with its [the Greater Earth Kingdom's] massive industrial, economic and population might while [the copies of the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] keeping their [the restored Bogd Khanate's of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang's] own military, economic and technological might with the same thing happening to the Lesser Earth Kingdom and the surviving Empire of Manchukuo.

The same happens to the rest of the copied South East Asian nations within the surviving Co-Prosperity Sphere, except that these nations and Hawaii also maintain the water-bending presence and Earth-bending presence within these regions. A somewhat more successful Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] that is not only formed by a post-1216 surviving House of Plantagenet-ruled Angevin Empire that [the post-1216 surviving House of Plantagenet-ruled Angevin Empire] manages to win the 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 Hundred Years War due to Joan of Arc not being present in its [this alternate Brittania's] original world and timeline, with the French-Welsh Plantagenet side branch House of Tudor's control over the British Isles lasting past 1603 and what became the real life Anglized ruling branch of the German House of Hanover only managing to take power after the man known in the real world George II of Great Britain, George Augustus of the House of Hanover, seized power from the last Tudor monarch in the Code Geass universe, Queen Elizabeth III after her [Elizabeth III's] death, after Napoleon's successful invasion of the British Isles in 1752 and the subsequent flight of the British monarchy and royal government to Canada and the British West Indies, [George Augustus] forming the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] as Emperor George II, but this Holy Brittanian Empire's version of Queen Victoria having the British throne pass to the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha upon her [this version of Queen Victoria's] death, with these alternate Windsors forming the Third Bulgarian Empire which they [ the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha] ruled in real life from 1908-1945 immediately after the Crimean Wars instead of 1908 like in the real world, seizing Macedonia and Thrace and [ the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha in this alternate Brittania's home world] also almagating the British Empire in exile into the Bulgarian Imperial territories, [the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha in this alternate Brittanian Empire's own world], thus proclaiming the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] as a continuation of both the original Imperium Romanum [Roman Empire] and the Imperium Romanum's rump state of Eastern Rome, [Eastern Rome] better known as the Byzantine Empire. This alternate Brittanian Empire joined the Central Powers in WW1 against a revanchist France, post-monarchic Britain and a Russian Tsardom looking for revenge [basically a WW1 version of WW2 Axis powers]in its homeworld and won alongside the other Central Powers, [This alternate Brittanian Empire in its home world after its home world's version of WW1] reclaiming the British Isles as well as parts of the French coast. It also seized control of European Russia in the 1950s A.D after the Brittanian royal family argued that the Romanovs marrying into them meant they had the right to rule Russia, facing heavy resistance from communists and Russian nationalists, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] twenty years before the events of canon Code Geass start is [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] pulled from its [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire's] original world and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] transported into the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki where the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten all [the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten] occur, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] replacing and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] merging with [the nation-state this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire simultaneously replaces and merges with] the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal parliamentary monarchial theocratic crusader state of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten], which [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] is [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] also informally known as Lautreamont Knight Country [Seikoku no Doragunā] within this story with the Kingdom of Lescatie also being [what the Kingdom of Lescatie also is] known as the Tristain Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima], the Gallia Kingdom [the Zero no Tsukaima] or the Albion Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima] and the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] being its [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this story's] official name [the Ordesian Empire] in this story as well. The transported Brittanian Empire also maintains the Canada, Jamaica, New England equivalent amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki's heavy Native American Waterb ending presence. The Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this story also has the canon Lautreamont Knight Country's within the canon Seikoku no Doragunā's universe's tradition of dragon breeding and Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] being [Pals] used in warfare along with tanks, airplanes, modern naval power and floating battleships. The Ordesian Empire is also known as the Beltrum Kingdom in this fic [Seirei Gensōki] due to its [the Ordesian Empire's in this fic's] control of both the land and seas The Kingdom of Lescatie's territories in this world are the British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, and the West Occitania equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the European Russia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the Bulgaria including Greek Thrace and Macedonia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and the reigning monarchs of Kingdom of Lescatie in this story have the combined title of King/Queen of the England/British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and that of the Bulgarian/Russian Tsar equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. Its [The Kingdom of Lescatie's] history is basically if the House of Plantagenet-equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima-ruled Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continued to exist past 1216 and the subsequent the Hundred Years War of 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 being won by the English equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, with the marriage of the Queen Elizabeth I of England equivalent to the Peter the Great of the Russian Empire equivalent in this world essentially creating this world's version of a Anglo-Russian Empire, transforming Albion-Gallia-Tristian into the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and allowing the Tudor equivalent in in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continuing to rule the Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima until the House of Hanover equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima take power after the death of the last Tudor-equivalent Queen on 1 August 1714. An equivalent of the American Revolution does occur with the USA equivalent quickly becoming a protectorate of the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Hapsburg-equivalent-ruled Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. The Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima allows its non-Austrian German territories independence as a Royal House of Hohenzollern-equivalent-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-equivalent ruled German Empire in response to Germanic-equivalent nationalism and the ideas promoted by a failed French Revolution equivalent, quickly seizing the Italian peninsula during the Italian-equivalent wars of Independence and reabsorbing the Italian states equivalent into itself, becoming truly Holy, Roman and an Empire, quickly transitioning into a Austria-Hungary Equivalent. The Crimean War equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima ends with a draw although the Third Bulgarian Empire is created in the 19th century equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima instead of 1908. The Catholic branch of the real-life British royal family, the House of Saxe-Gotha-equivalent ruling over the Third Bulgarian Empire-equivalent as its imperial family reunites with the Protestant British branch-equivalent, becoming the imperial family of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] as well after the passing of the Queen Victoria-equivalent. The Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] then styles itself as the restoration, continuation and reformation of the Eastern Roman Empire-equivalent since the current imperial family rules over the major territories controlled by the Eastern Roman equivalent as well as the France equivalent and British Isles-equivalent. When this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire replaces and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] merges with the version of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this fic, it [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] inherits the Kingdom of Lescatie's [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this fic's conventional military and naval forces along with its [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic's] Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā] forces and [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic's] resources, with people in this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire merging with their counterparts in the Kingdom of Lescatie in this fic when the transplacement [of this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire to the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki] and subsequent merger [of this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire with the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic].

Italy was made into a restored Kingdom of Italy under the Bourbons, although Southern Italy was split from Italy into the Bourbon-ruled Kingdom of Two Sicilies. European Russia was made into a joint Austrian-German puppet state in the form of a restored Russian Empire. Twenty years after the victory of the Germanic democratic forces in the Second Weltkreig in the world of Kaiserreich, [Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] are both [Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] \\"copied\\" from their [Mittleeuropa's and the Donau-Adriabund's] original world, with the copies [of Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] being placed in the Europe equivalent of the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, although the inhabitants of these areas [Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] have no idea of this and [the inhabitants of Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] think that they [the inhabitants of Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] just felt sick in the Kaisereich world, while the copies of [both Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] are [the copies of Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] merged with the equivalent areas, countries and nation-states in the Europe equivalent of the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, with the copied Austria-Hungary merging with and [Austria-Hungary] replacing the rump Holy Roman Empire/Austria-Hungary equivalent in the alternate world, which [the rump Holy Roman Empire/Austria-Hungary equivalent in the alternate world] is [the rump Holy Roman Empire/Austria-Hungary equivalent in the alternate world] known as [the rump Holy Roman Empire/Austria-Hungary equivalent in the alternate world's other name] the Zepharos Empire [Seikoku no Doragunā] and the copied German Empire merging with its [the German Empire's] equivalent in the alternate world, with both the copied Mittleeuropa and the copied Donau-Adriabund inheriting the alternate world's Germanic-equivalent bloc's immense industrial, technological, military economic and naval prowess along with its [the alternate world's Germanic-equivalent bloc's] somewhat scarce international and national Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā] corps and its [the alternate world's Germanic-equivalent bloc's] somewhat scarce contracted spirit [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and magical corps.

The post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire is also able to get a signal on a long silent radio frequency used by the US Armed Forces before the Great Cataclysm, [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] getting into contact with the copied surviving American Empire and [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] establishing diplomatic relations, although the dignitaries from the copied surviving American Empire are confused at the mention of the Great Cataclysm as such an event [the Great Cataclysm] had [the Great Cataclysm] never occurred in their [the dignitaries' from the copied surviving American Empire's] original world, despite this the effort to maintain contact with the copied surviving American Empire is otherwise successful and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire decides to send a floating aircraft carrier with conventional jet fighter aircraft, TSFs and conventional military equipment on board and members of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan's ruling main branch now living in post-Great Cataclysm, post-Great Tokyo Empire restored and rebuilt Tokyo with its reigning male heads acting as the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Emperors] on board to what it [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] thinks is a post Great Cataclysm restored American rump state [the copied surviving American Empire]. Meanwhile, in the North America equivalent of the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, the copied surviving American Empire is [the copied surviving American Empire] able to reestablish contact with Europe, more specifically its [the copied surviving American Empire's] mother state [Austria-Hungary], but the American imperial government notices that things seem to be quite different. However, the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary is happy to send naval and other military forces to its [the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary's] unexpected new colony [the copied surviving American Empire] both as protection and also as a show of force against the copied surviving American Empire's hostile new neighbor [the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] and [the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary] also to send a delegation to accompany the copied surviving American Empire's hosting delegation to meet the visiting delegation from strange new Japanese Empire [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire]. The copied restored Confederacy manages to come into contact with the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire, [the copied restored Confederacy] restoring the colonial relationship with the Anglo-Saxon colonial realm with the colonial master in this case being the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire. The copied surviving Mexican Empire manages to establish contact with the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary, [the copied surviving Mexican Empire] agreeing to be a protectorate [of the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary] in order to [the copied surviving Mexican Empire] get protection from the Anglo-Saxon [the copied restored Confederacy and the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] states now on the North American equivalent. P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes apart from those described in this fic. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order. Also, there must be no canonical characters from the franchise being crossed over in this excerpt, every character must be original until otherwise mentioned.","output":"As the cold confines of space hovered over the neo-Japanese Empire, Admiral Hiro Aramaki stared at the expansive viewscreen, the stars pinpricked across its smooth surface. His crew buzzed around him on the bridge of the sky-faring aircraft carrier *Amaterasu*, their faces a blend of determination and trepidation. It was a world uncharted, unknowable, yet here they were, moving toward an unknown destiny. \\"Report,\\" Hiro demanded, his eyes unflinching from the screen. \\"Sir, all conventional units and TSFs are accounted for and ready on deck. Communication checks with Kyoto have been secure and encrypted,\\" replied Lieutenant Ayane Sato, her voice cutting through the ambient noise of the bridge. Hiro nodded, turning to face his first officer. \\"Commander Asuka, what about the emissaries from the Ōtsutsuki clan on board?\\" Commander Asuka Kondo met his gaze, her posture rigid in the manner of a seasoned soldier. \\"They are ready, Admiral. The Emperor and the Shogun have both expressed their desire to begin diplomatic relations with the American Empire as soon as we make landfall.\\" Unbeknownst to them, a similar scene unfolded across the Sea of Trees, where the regal structures and kanji-laden banners of the Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu stood proudly, now within the embrace of their neo-Japanese counterparts. Meanwhile, in the inner chamber of the Japanese Empire's Imperial Palace, the Shogun, a descendant of the Tokugawa, leaned over a massive table map. Warlords and generals gathered, their armor a blend of traditional artistry with a blend of chakra-enabled technology. \\"We have made contact with the Co-Prosperity Sphere states,\\" announced the Shogun, his voice deliberate and calm. \\"It is imperative we assure them of our continued alliance and control over the situation. Our brothers must not face these magic-infused beings and benders alone.\\" \\"Indeed,\\" a warlord agreed, stepping forward. \\"But the American communication, what of it?\\" \\"The Ōtsutsuki Emperor plans to address this. The delegation on the *Amaterasu* will extend our hand.\\" On another shore, the copied survivors of the American Empire were probing the very fabric of their new reality, their austere offices a mix of new-world splendor and industrial functionality. \\"Mr. President,\\" a secretary dashed into the oval-shaped chamber carrying urgent news, \\"the Austrian-Hungarian forces are on their way to support us.\\" Leaning back in his chair, the American Emperor, a stark Habsburg figure, let the news wash over him. He addressed his aide, \\"Draft an invitation to the Japanese. These troubled waters demand new alliances.\\" Far to the south of Zipangu, in a meeting room lined with old-world grandeur, dignitaries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere states sat in guarded discussion. At the table's head, a delegate from Beiyang China spoke. \\"Our Sacred Alliance remains, but these mystical creatures of legend... monster girls and benders... they test our mettle,\\" he remarked, noting the nods from Vietnamese and Mongolian counterparts. \\"It is as if our worlds have been stitched into a vast tapestry of challenge and change,\\" mused the Filipino Emperor thoughtfully. \\"Our historical unity must transcend this new reality.\\" The news of the imminent Japanese arrival spread quickly among the local populace, a mix of anticipation and fear mounting with each passing hour. And so it went, a symphony of preparations and machinations danced across the realms of the old and the new. As the post-Great Cataclysm neo-Japanese Empire set sail toward this mingled destiny, the shadows of dragons and Pals glided over land and sea, as much a harbinger as the infinite sky above. The Emperor of the Japanese Empire, clad in robes that fluttered with celestial grace, turned his eyes toward the heavens from the sanctum of his palace. The merging of cultures, sovereignties, and histories were afoot. His mind pondered the myriad paths ahead, the potential alliances with these shadowed empires of behemoth might, the labyrinthine politicking to unfold. For now, it was a moment held in stasis, a breath before the plunge into a world where the arcs of chakra, the whispers of elemental spirits, and the will of emperors would shape a new epoch — all under the silent watch of the Jurai bloodline. \\"May the will of our ancestors guide us,\\" whispered the Emperor into the tapestry of fate, sensing the stirrings of destiny on the horizon."},{"instruction":"is it ok to use a instrumental of a rap song or beat and make a edited cover my own version of it and post it to souncloud","output":"Using an instrumental of a rap song or beat to create an edited cover, and then posting it to SoundCloud or any other platform, may have legal and copyright considerations. Here's what you need to know: 1. Copyright Ownership: Most songs and beats are protected by copyright. The owner of the copyright (typically the artist, producer, or record label) generally has exclusive rights to use, reproduce, and distribute the song. Using the instrumental without permission infringes on these rights. 2. Fair Use (United States): In some cases, using copyrighted material without permission may fall under \\"fair use,\\" a legal doctrine that allows limited use of copyrighted materials without needing to seek permission. However, fair use is complex, context-specific, and varies by country. It is not always a defense for posting covers online, especially if the cover is a full reproduction of the original beat. 3. Licenses and Permissions: To legally use the instrumental, you should seek permission or a license from the copyright holder. Some artists provide beats with non-exclusive licenses for use by others, sometimes requiring payment or credit. You can also look for royalty-free or Creative Commons-licensed material that allows use with certain conditions. 4. SoundCloud's Policy: SoundCloud requires users to have all necessary rights for any content they upload. If you upload a cover without proper rights, it could be taken down after a copyright claim, and your account could face restrictions under SoundCloud's policies. 5. Monetization: If you intend to monetize the cover, the importance of getting the appropriate licenses increases significantly. Royalties may need to be paid to the original copyright holders. Ultimately, while creating a cover version of a song can be a great way to show your creativity and pay homage to the original artist, you should always do so within the bounds of copyright law. When in doubt, it's wise to consult a legal expert in intellectual property to ensure you're in compliance with the law."},{"instruction":"invalid escape in string 'P'","output":"In programming, strings are sequences of characters used to store text. An \\"invalid escape\\" error message often occurs when you're dealing with programming languages that use backslashes \`\` to denote escape sequences within strings. For example, in languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript, \`n\` stands for a newline character, and \`t\` represents a tab. The problem arises when the backslash is followed by a character that doesn't form a valid escape sequence. This is the case with \`P\`, which is not a standard escape sequence in many programming languages. Let's take Python as an example. If you try to create a string containing \`P\` like this: \`\`\`python my_string = \\"C:Python27Scripts\\" \`\`\` Python will give you an error because it interprets \`P\` as an escape sequence, but it is invalid. To fix this, you have a couple of options: 1. **Double Backslashes**: Use two backslashes to represent a literal backslash, like so: \`\`\`python my_string = \\"C:Python27Scripts\\" \`\`\` In this case, Python interprets each \`\` as a single literal backslash. 2. **Raw Strings**: Prefix the string with an \`r\` to create a raw string, which tells Python to interpret backslashes as literal backslashes, not as the start of an escape sequence: \`\`\`python my_string = r\\"C:Python27Scripts\\" \`\`\` This principle is general and can be applied to most programming languages that use backslashes as escape characters. The exact means of addressing the problem will depend on the specific syntax and features of the language you are using."},{"instruction":"why is PIL/_webp.pyd trojan","output":"The file \`PIL/_webp.pyd\` you're referring to is likely associated with the Python Imaging Library (PIL) or its maintained successor, Pillow, which is an open-source library that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats, including WebP. In general, \`.pyd\` files are Python Dynamic module files, which are typically used on Windows. They are essentially DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files that Python can load and use as if they were regular Python modules. If your antivirus software is flagging \`PIL/_webp.pyd\` as a trojan, there are a few possibilities to consider: 1. **False Positive**: It's not uncommon for antivirus programs to mistakenly identify legitimate files as malicious—a phenomenon known as a \\"false positive.\\" This can occur due to heuristic analysis, file behavior patterns that resemble malware, or even poorly defined malware signatures. 2. **Compromised Library**: If the file is not a false positive, it's possible that the version of PIL or Pillow you’ve installed has been compromised. This could happen if you downloaded the library from an untrusted source rather than the official channels such as PyPI (the Python Package Index). 3. **System Infection**: In some cases, your system may already be infected with malware, which could inject malicious code into otherwise legitimate files. This situation could cause your antivirus to flag those files as trojan-infected. Here's what you can do: - **Verify the Source**: Make sure you install Pillow or any Python library from a reputable source. The safest way is to use \`pip\` and install packages directly from PyPI: \`\`\` pip install Pillow \`\`\` - **Update Antivirus Signatures**: Ensure that your antivirus software is up-to-date with the latest definitions, then scan your system again. Antivirus programs frequently update their malware definitions to reduce the chances of false positives and to be more effective against new threats. - **Scan With Multiple Tools**: Use multiple antivirus and malware scanning tools to scan the file and your system. If only one tool is flagging the file while others are not, it's more likely to be a false positive. - **Use a Virtual Environment**: When working with Python packages, use a virtual environment to prevent potential conflicts with system-wide packages and to add a layer of isolation. If you continue to have concerns about this file, remove it and reinstall Pillow from PyPI using \`pip\`. If the file is consistently flagged as a trojan by different antivirus tools even after reinstalling from an official source, you should consider it a potential threat and investigate further before using the file."},{"instruction":"what is source leangth of distill roberta base","output":"The source length of DistilRoBERTa base is 512 tokens."},{"instruction":"what is source leangth of roberta large","output":"The source length of RoBERTa Large is also 512 tokens."},{"instruction":"what is source leangth of XLM roberta base","output":"The source length of XLM-RoBERTa base is also 512 tokens."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A post-WW2, post-1947 surviving successful Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Pan-Asian anti-communist and anti-colonialist bloc formed by the real life Japanese Empire which [the Co-Prosperity Sphere] was resurrected in 1967 as ASEAN in real life, which [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] was able to survive along with the Japanese Empire past 1947 in its original world thanks to Woodrow Wilson dying as a child during the American Civil War and [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] consists of the post-1928 Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China as a post 1945 surviving Reorganized Government of the Republic of China, later reformed in the 1950s into Beiyang China's original status as a regency for the restoration of the pre-Qing Manchu-Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu Great Ming Empire/Ming dynasty with the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China being restored in the 1960s with the descendants of the House of Zhu becoming the Chinese Imperial family surviving once more, a post 1945 surviving former former Qing Imperial Family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo which [the surviving Empire of Manchukuo] managed to get all of Outer Manchuria after WW2 in its original world, a post 1945-surviving Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation in Inner Mongolia's Charhar and Suiyan regions, a post-WW2 restored Far Eastern Republic in Russia's East Coast, a post-WW2 restored Bogd Khan-ruled post-WW2 restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia ruling over Mongolia and the parts of Inner Mongolia unclaimed by Mengjiang, a post-1955 surviving nativized Vietnamese side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Imperial House of Ngyuen-ruled Empire of Vietnam, a post-1975 surviving Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos, a Kingdom of Cambodia that never experienced the Cambodian Civil War or the subsequent rise of the Khmer Rouge, a restored Kobaung dynasty-ruled Third Burmese Empire ruling over Burma, a restored Tungning Kingdom in the South Chinese region of Cantonia a post-WW2 restored Imperial House of Osman-ruled restored Ottoman Empire in Xingjiang/East Turkestan, a post-1950s surviving Kingdom of Tibet, a greater Malyasia that includes Singapore, an Indonesian federation ruled by the royal family of Indonesia's Yogyakarta region, the House of Hamengkubuwono as its [the Indonesian Federation's] imperial family, a restored Phillipine Empire ruled by the restored Sultans of Maguindanao as its Emperors, Brunei and a restored House of Kalākaua-ruled restored Kingdom of Hawaii ruling over all of Hawaii is [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] copied and the copy [of the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] placed [the copy of the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] in the geographical areas of the Greater Asia equivalent of the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, with the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China merging with the Fire Nation within the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China] inheriting its the Fire Nation within the almagam world's] conventional military and naval, contracted spirit, Pal and firebender strength along with its [the the Fire Nation within the almagam world's] massive industrial, economic and population might, while [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China] keeping its [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty's in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China's] own military, economic and technological might, the copies of the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang both [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] replacing the Greater Earth Kingdom within the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki and [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] both [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] getting its [the Greater Earth Kingdom's] conventional military and naval, contracted spirit, Pal and earthbender strength along with its [the Greater Earth Kingdom's] massive industrial, economic and population might while [the copies of the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] keeping their [the restored Bogd Khanate's of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang's] own military, economic and technological might with the same thing happening to the Lesser Earth Kingdom and the surviving Empire of Manchukuo. The copy of the restored Ottoman Empire in Xingjiang replaces the East Turkestan equivalent within the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, the surviving Kingdom of Tibet merges with the Tibetian equivalent home of the Air Nomads within the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, and the copy of the Far Eastern Republic is placed on the Russian East Coast equivalent of the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki The South-East Asian nations [the Philippines, the Indonesian Federation, Malyasia, Brunei, Burma, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, the Tungning Kingdom in Cantonia] along with the restored Kingdom of Hawaii, all merge with their counterparts in the South-East region of the Asia-equivalent region of the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, with the restored Tungning Kingdom and Cantonia both merging with the regions of the Greater Fire Nation within the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki that correspond to their locations, keeping their own industrial, economic and military might while maintaining the Greater Fire Nation's in the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki's industrial, economic and military strength along with the fire-benders within these regions. The same happens to the rest of the copied South East Asian nations within the surviving Co-Prosperity Sphere, except that these nations and Hawaii also maintain the water-bending presence and Earth-bending presence within these regions. A somewhat more successful Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] that is not only formed by a post-1216 surviving House of Plantagenet-ruled Angevin Empire that [the post-1216 surviving House of Plantagenet-ruled Angevin Empire] manages to win the 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 Hundred Years War due to Joan of Arc not being present in its [this alternate Brittania's] original world and timeline, with the French-Welsh Plantagenet side branch House of Tudor's control over the British Isles lasting past 1603 and what became the real life Anglized ruling branch of the German House of Hanover only managing to take power after the man known in the real world George II of Great Britain, George Augustus of the House of Hanover, seized power from the last Tudor monarch in the Code Geass universe, Queen Elizabeth III after her [Elizabeth III's] death, after Napoleon's successful invasion of the British Isles in 1752 and the subsequent flight of the British monarchy and royal government to Canada and the British West Indies, [George Augustus] forming the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] as Emperor George II, but this Holy Brittanian Empire's version of Queen Victoria having the British throne pass to the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha upon her [this version of Queen Victoria's] death, with these alternate Windsors forming the Third Bulgarian Empire which they [ the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha] ruled in real life from 1908-1945 immediately after the Crimean Wars instead of 1908 like in the real world, seizing Macedonia and Thrace and [ the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha in this alternate Brittania's home world] also almagating the British Empire in exile into the Bulgarian Imperial territories, [the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha in this alternate Brittanian Empire's own world], thus proclaiming the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] as a continuation of both the original Imperium Romanum [Roman Empire] and the Imperium Romanum's rump state of Eastern Rome, [Eastern Rome] better known as the Byzantine Empire. This alternate Brittanian Empire joined the Central Powers in WW1 against a revanchist France, post-monarchic Britain and a Russian Tsardom looking for revenge [basically a WW1 version of WW2 Axis powers]in its homeworld and won alongside the other Central Powers, [This alternate Brittanian Empire in its home world after its home world's version of WW1] reclaiming the British Isles as well as parts of the French coast. It also seized control of European Russia in the 1950s A.D after the Brittanian royal family argued that the Romanovs marrying into them meant they had the right to rule Russia, facing heavy resistance from communists and Russian nationalists, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] twenty years before the events of canon Code Geass start is [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] pulled from its [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire's] original world and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] transported into the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki where the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten all [the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten] occur, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] replacing and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] merging with [the nation-state this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire simultaneously replaces and merges with] the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal parliamentary monarchial theocratic crusader state of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten], which [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] is [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] also informally known as Lautreamont Knight Country [Seikoku no Doragunā] within this story with the Kingdom of Lescatie also being [what the Kingdom of Lescatie also is] known as the Tristain Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima], the Gallia Kingdom [the Zero no Tsukaima] or the Albion Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima] and the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] being its [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this story's] official name [the Ordesian Empire] in this story as well. The transported Brittanian Empire also maintains the Canada, Jamaica, New England equivalent amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki's heavy Native American Waterb ending presence. The Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this story also has the canon Lautreamont Knight Country's within the canon Seikoku no Doragunā's universe's tradition of dragon breeding and Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] being [Pals] used in warfare along with tanks, airplanes, modern naval power and floating battleships. The Ordesian Empire is also known as the Beltrum Kingdom in this fic [Seirei Gensōki] due to its [the Ordesian Empire's in this fic's] control of both the land and seas The Kingdom of Lescatie's territories in this world are the British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, and the West Occitania equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the European Russia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the Bulgaria including Greek Thrace and Macedonia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and the reigning monarchs of Kingdom of Lescatie in this story have the combined title of King/Queen of the England/British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and that of the Bulgarian/Russian Tsar equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. Its [The Kingdom of Lescatie's] history is basically if the House of Plantagenet-equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima-ruled Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continued to exist past 1216 and the subsequent the Hundred Years War of 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 being won by the English equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, with the marriage of the Queen Elizabeth I of England equivalent to the Peter the Great of the Russian Empire equivalent in this world essentially creating this world's version of a Anglo-Russian Empire, transforming Albion-Gallia-Tristian into the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and allowing the Tudor equivalent in in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continuing to rule the Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima until the House of Hanover equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima take power after the death of the last Tudor-equivalent Queen on 1 August 1714. An equivalent of the American Revolution does occur with the USA equivalent quickly becoming a protectorate of the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Hapsburg-equivalent-ruled Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. The Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima allows its non-Austrian German territories independence as a Royal House of Hohenzollern-equivalent-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-equivalent ruled German Empire in response to Germanic-equivalent nationalism and the ideas promoted by a failed French Revolution equivalent, quickly seizing the Italian peninsula during the Italian-equivalent wars of Independence and reabsorbing the Italian states equivalent into itself, becoming truly Holy, Roman and an Empire, quickly transitioning into a Austria-Hungary Equivalent. The Crimean War equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima ends with a draw although the Third Bulgarian Empire is created in the 19th century equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima instead of 1908. The Catholic branch of the real-life British royal family, the House of Saxe-Gotha-equivalent ruling over the Third Bulgarian Empire-equivalent as its imperial family reunites with the Protestant British branch-equivalent, becoming the imperial family of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] as well after the passing of the Queen Victoria-equivalent. The Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] then styles itself as the restoration, continuation and reformation of the Eastern Roman Empire-equivalent since the current imperial family rules over the major territories controlled by the Eastern Roman equivalent as well as the France equivalent and British Isles-equivalent. When this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire replaces and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] merges with the version of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this fic, it [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] inherits the Kingdom of Lescatie's [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this fic's conventional military and naval forces along with its [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic's] Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā] forces and [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic's] resources, with people in this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire merging with their counterparts in the Kingdom of Lescatie in this fic when the transplacement [of this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire to the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki] and subsequent merger [of this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire with the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic].

Italy was made into a restored Kingdom of Italy under the Bourbons, although Southern Italy was split from Italy into the Bourbon-ruled Kingdom of Two Sicilies. European Russia was made into a joint Austrian-German puppet state in the form of a restored Russian Empire. Twenty years after the victory of the Germanic democratic forces in the Second Weltkreig in the world of Kaiserreich, [Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] are both [Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] \\"copied\\" from their [Mittleeuropa's and the Donau-Adriabund's] original world, with the copies [of Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] being placed in the Europe equivalent of the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, although the inhabitants of these areas [Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] have no idea of this and [the inhabitants of Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] think that they [the inhabitants of Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] just felt sick in the Kaisereich world, while the copies of [both Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] are [the copies of Mittleeuropa and the Donau-Adriabund] merged with the equivalent areas, countries and nation-states in the Europe equivalent of the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, with the copied Austria-Hungary merging with and [Austria-Hungary] replacing the rump Holy Roman Empire/Austria-Hungary equivalent in the alternate world, which [the rump Holy Roman Empire/Austria-Hungary equivalent in the alternate world] is [the rump Holy Roman Empire/Austria-Hungary equivalent in the alternate world] known as [the rump Holy Roman Empire/Austria-Hungary equivalent in the alternate world's other name] the Zepharos Empire [Seikoku no Doragunā] and the copied German Empire merging with its [the German Empire's] equivalent in the alternate world, with both the copied Mittleeuropa and the copied Donau-Adriabund inheriting the alternate world's Germanic-equivalent bloc's immense industrial, technological, military economic and naval prowess along with its [the alternate world's Germanic-equivalent bloc's] somewhat scarce international and national Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā] corps and its [the alternate world's Germanic-equivalent bloc's] somewhat scarce contracted spirit [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and magical corps. Meanwhile, an American Empire, a monarchial royal imperial constitutional state with federalist elements, [this particular American Empire] ruled by a Habsburg-side branch as its [this particular American Empire's] imperial family, [this particular American Empire] being formed after the 1912 \\"New Freedom\\" Revolution in the United States lead by the Democrat Party and its [the Democrat Party's] street arm, the reviled KKK against the Republicans and the USA's pre-1912 unoffical colonial master, Austria-Hungary failing due to the death of the revolution's charismatic figurehead, the failed historian turned American dictator and the world's first fascist leader in real life, Woodrow Wilson via the bullet of a Austrian loyalist during the revolution and Franz Ferdinand managing to broke a compromise with the rebels that lead to the formation of the American Empire in the US states that had formed the Republican-controlled American Union during the American Civil War, with the still-Democrat controlled Southern States that had formed the Confederacy and rebelled against the Union and Republicans in the Civil War becoming part of British Canada as a restored Confederacy, while the US West Coast was given to the Japanese, [this particular American Empire] helping the Central Powers to win WW1 against the Entente in its [[this particular American Empire's] world, [this particular American Empire] is [this particular American Empire] copied to the North America equivalent of the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, with the copy of this particular American Empire merging with the Austrian-equivalent protectorate that is the USA equivalent in the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki and [the copy of this particular American Empire] inheriting the USA equivalent's military, economic, magical and Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā] forces along with [the copy of this particular American Empire] keeping its [the copy of this particular American Empire's] own military, economic, magical, industrial and technological forces. Further afield, the Pacific States of America, created [the Pacific States of America] by a victorious post-1947 surviving Japanese Empire after both it [the victorious post-1947 surviving Japanese Empire] and the European Axis both won WW2 and divided the Americas between them in the aftermath, [the Pacific States of America] being a Japanese satellite state, [the Pacific States of America] is on what would be the US West Coast equivalent on the North America equivalent of the alternate world which is an amalgam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki. A surviving Confederacy that was and still remains a British puppet and lost its world's version of WW1 along with the Entente, becoming its world's version of a surviving Nazi Germany due to it being ruled as a one-party state by the Democrats and the KKK is [the surviving Confederacy] copied with the copy [of the surviving Confederacy] being placed in the US South equivalent on the North America equivalent of the alternate world which is an amalgam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki. And a post-1823 surviving Mexican Empire that kept Central America up to Panama but still lost what would be known as the US West Coast, Mexico and New Mexico to the USA, although Habsburg descendant Ferdinand Maximilian Josef Maria von Habsburg-Lothringen still came to power in its [the surviving Mexican Empire's] original world as Maximilian I of Mexico on April 10, 1864, making his [Maximilian I's] descendants [Maximilian I's] the new Mexican imperial family, a position they [Maximilian I's relatives] have [Maximilian I's relatives] maintained ever since, [the surviving Mexican Empire] being [the surviving Mexican Empire] copied and its [the surviving Mexican Empire's] copy placed in what would be the Mexico and North America equivalent of the alternate world which is an amalgam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki.

The excerpt should focus on the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire adjusting its [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire's] bearings after the transportation to the East Asia equivalent of the alternate world which is an amalgam of Seikoku no Doragunā and the subsequent merger with the Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu, [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] encountering the copied surviving Co-Prosperity Sphere and [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] establishing contact with the governing bodies of the copied surviving Co-Prosperity Sphere, [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] quickly re-establishing Japanese control over the Co-Prosperity Sphere as post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army troops rush from the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire to the copied surviving Co-Prosperity Sphere member states to help their Asiatic brothers deal with the bender, contracted spirit, monmosu and magic problem in these nations. The post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire is also able to get a signal on a long silent radio frequency used by the US Armed Forces before the Great Cataclysm, [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] getting into contact with the copied surviving American Empire and [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] establishing diplomatic relations, although the dignitaries from the copied surviving American Empire are confused at the mention of the Great Cataclysm as such an event [the Great Cataclysm] had [the Great Cataclysm] never occurred in their [the dignitaries' from the copied surviving American Empire's] original world, despite this the effort to maintain contact with the copied surviving American Empire is otherwise successful and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire decides to send a floating aircraft carrier with conventional jet fighter aircraft, TSFs and conventional military equipment on board and members of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan's ruling main branch now living in post-Great Cataclysm, post-Great Tokyo Empire restored and rebuilt Tokyo with its reigning male heads acting as the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Emperors] on board to what it [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] thinks is a post Great Cataclysm restored American rump state [the copied surviving American Empire]. Meanwhile, in the North America equivalent of the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, the copied surviving American Empire is [the copied surviving American Empire] able to reestablish contact with Europe, more specifically its [the copied surviving American Empire's] mother state [Austria-Hungary], but the American imperial government notices that things seem to be quite different. However, the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary is happy to send naval and other military forces to its [the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary's] unexpected new colony [the copied surviving American Empire] both as protection and also as a show of force against the copied surviving American Empire's hostile new neighbor [the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] and [the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary] also to send a delegation to accompany the copied surviving American Empire's hosting delegation to meet the visiting delegation from strange new Japanese Empire [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire]. The copied restored Confederacy manages to come into contact with the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire, [the copied restored Confederacy] restoring the colonial relationship with the Anglo-Saxon colonial realm with the colonial master in this case being the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire. The copied surviving Mexican Empire manages to establish contact with the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary, [the copied surviving Mexican Empire] agreeing to be a protectorate [of the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary] in order to [the copied surviving Mexican Empire] get protection from the Anglo-Saxon [the copied restored Confederacy and the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] states now on the North American equivalent. P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes apart from those described in this fic.

High above in the Imperial palace, Ayako Ōtsutsuki, forty-second of her name and Empress of Neo Yamato, gazed upon her realm, once fractured, now stitched together with her clan's unyielding spirit—and chakra. At her side was Yori, the Shogun of the restored Tokugawa lineage, a person of power and the channel between the Empire's military might and its divine governance. They stood together, silent spectators to the sprawling metropolis below, unaware that their reality was about to be reshaped. \\"Hime-sama,\\" Yori began, his voice steady despite the undercurrent of unease, \\"there are reports from the coast. Our land... it has changed.\\" Ayako felt the chakra within her pulse. \\"Changed, you say?\\" \\"Indeed,\\" Yori affirmed, offering a folded scroll. Unwrapping it revealed a sketch, landscapes that merged mountains with foreign citadels, terrain both alien and eerily familiar. \\"Our scouts speak of lands merging, of creatures and magics unknown to our archives... and our satellites confirm this is no mere island that has approached our shores,\\" he continued, his hand tracing over the sketch. \\"This must be approached carefully,\\" Ayako mused. \\"We are to be the shepherds of this new era. Have emissaries been dispatched to these... other realms?\\" Tokyo, in the heart of the newly chiseled world, was not alone in its bewildering transformation. The entire fabric of their plane had folded upon another, possibly many, creating a tapestry of civilizations that held distant echoes of their own. \\"The Co-Prosperity Sphere,\\" Ayako spoke the name with reverence. It was a realm under the umbrella of her Empire, lands guided by her ancestors' wisdom. Theirs was the responsibility to ensure the safety and integration of these new territories. Calls to action were met with measured haste, directives piercing the hum of a city reborn from cataclysm. Ayako ordered a strategic appeal to their newfound neighbors. The American Empire, they had to be aware of the transformation, perhaps even could explain it. As fleets and foot soldiers rallied, embassies were in fervor, drafting treaties and alliances with elegant kanji. Empress Ayako and Shogun Yori presided over a dawning era where chakra infused with realms distant yet close—where the dance of the old world met the rhythm of the new. Aboard the flagship air carrier, \\"Hinomaru,\\" an assemblage of Tactical Surface Fighters and Infinite Stratos units stood ready. Generations of pyrokinetics stood by infernal-slayers and armed detectives, each a guardian of the Empire's peace. \\"And so, Empress Ayako, we extend this armada as our gesture, to traverse this great divide, so our hearts and might may intertwine with the communities beyond our understanding,\\" General Sato addressed the court, his voice firm, his uniform a blend of tradition and technology. Amid the court was a flutter of movement, figures garbed in the ceremonial whites and reds of the Divine court—members of the Ōtsutsuki lineage, their role in the crux of the meeting as much metaphysical as political. \\"It is decided,\\" Ayako proclaimed. \\"We shall meet these empires of history's whispers, unite under a banner of the new Yamato. May our chakra guide the realms, and our ancestors watch over us.\\" The air carrier lifted, its silhouette eclipsing the setting sun, bound for a future unwritten. Below, in the Empire's streets, life whispered of magic and myth, of dragons and spirits unbeknownst to them before. Amongst the citizens, whispers grew into a cacophony of theories and fears as the Empire faced this unprecedented horizon. Many leagues away, the copied American Empire readied its envoy, preparing to host the visitors from a nation reborn from ashes and legend. The Austrian-Hungarian Empire pledged their strength in steel and spirit, while the Britannian fleet adjusted their course towards Lescatie, where the melding of worlds promised a renewed crusade. And so, the stage for a confluence of histories was set—a realm of empires and sovereignties vast and varied, each forging an intricate web whose weave had just begun. **Chapter Two: Echoes of Empires** The journey to the copied American Empire was marked by encounters—creatures of legend, terrains of impossibility. Yet, Hinomaru persisted, guided by the chakra of the Ōtsutsuki and the unwavering resolve of its crew. \\"Your Highness,\\" Captain Inoue beckoned Ayako to the observation deck. A vast horizon lay before them, an azure landscape of lush green and shimmering waters, a welcome contrast to the celestial scars of their homeland. Navigating this brave new world induced an odd nostalgia—not for their former home, but for the tales spun by old Shinto scripts, where kami played and yōkai roamed. \\"We land at dawn,\\" Inoue declared. \\"Our destination, the American Empire... It's unlike anything we've learned of in our training.\\" Ayako nodded, anticipation mirrored in her entourage's eyes. The world had unveiled itself into a realm breathing with novel magic and old-blood monarchies. A symphony of data streamed in from every craft and satellite—information about the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the enigmatic American Empire. Meanwhile, the copied Confederacy firmed its grip under the guidance of the alternate Holy Britannian Empire, seeking to restore order amid a populace reeling from the sudden confluence. The Mexican Empire fortified alliances, wary of the heightened presence of cavalier powers at its borders. The Austrian-Hungarian delegation approached the meeting point, a blend of modern military prowess and arcane majesty. There stood heroes, summoners, and dragons from tales whispered in the markets and grand halls. Ayako stepped onto foreign soil, her presence an emblem of Neo Yamato's divinity and its people's determination. The delegates from the American Empire bowed in respect, and as they rose, the moment beckoned a new chapter; a collective breath held as the universe's seams intertwined, bridging past, presence, and potential. And so, the discourse of realms commenced—a duet of politeness and prowess where every gesture spoke volumes.╝"},{"instruction":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible, dialogue-filled, exposition-filled alternate history science fiction, high fantasy, dark fantasy, urban fantasy, magical realism, science fantasy, Japanese light novel style, Chinese wuxia epic style, military techno-thriller action drama in the form of a Japanese harem anime/manga/light novel, romantic comedy, Isekai slice of life, light fantasy style crossover of the Code Geass anime, manga, video game and light novel franchise, the Magika Swordsman and Summoner light novel and manga franchise, the Muv-Luv visual novel, manga and anime franchise, the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, anime, manga and video game franchise, the Hundred anime, manga and light novel franchise, the Tenchi Muyo!

To appease traditionalist and Buddhist supremacists within Japan, the descendants of the Tokugawa were restored to their historical pre-Meiji Restoration position as Japanese shoguns while the male heads of the Ōtsutsuki clan ruled the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire as Emperors of Japan. Since the Ōtsutsuki clan was [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] mistaken to be the surviving post-Great Cataclysm descendants of the Imperial House of Great Yamato who [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] had regained their [the members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] supernatural abilities gained from their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] descent from the gods of the Shinto pantheon, nobody in the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Empire ever finds out the truth [about the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese imperial family] and so the secret of chakra [Naruto] and the Elemental Nations is kept safe within the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan. With Japan united under the Ōtsutsuki clan and [Japan in this story] ruling over Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils once more, the Meta Liberation Army [My Hero Academia] and its [the MLA's] Quirk supremacist agenda are quickly crushed by the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Kempeitai and so the Hero system [My Hero Academia] never takes off in Japan, with the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo], which [the Armed Detective system] had been indefinitely suspended after the Great Cataclysm in this story, [the Armed Detective System] instead being revived [the Armed Detective System] to manage Quirks, the pyrokinetics known as Generations [Fire Force] as well as the young girls and women who form contracts with the mythical gods and deities from another dimension known as Divas [Magika Swordsman and Summoner]. The Special Fire Force [Fire Force] is instead a elite division of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army due to the Great Tokyo Empire's conquest, [the Special Fire Force in this story] being given authority to kill Infernals [Fire Force] as well as rouge Generations. Fusion of chakra with the world outside the Elemental Nation's pre-Great Cataclysm industrial processes allows for the mass production of the oversized, plasma beam-firing and nuclear missile-equipped oversized fighter jets that can transform into massive humanoid mecha known as Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv], which [the Tactical Surface Fighters in this fanfic] became a important part of aerial warfare before the Great Cataclysm due to the BETA [Muv-Luv] invasion from the moon never happening in this fic and also mass production of prototype units of the initally-created for space exoskeletons that only pre-teen girls, teenage girls, young women and older women below the age of 40 can wear known as Infinite Stratos [IS] units [IS: Infinite Stratos], with the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army also having a rather large non-magical conventional ground warfare force. The post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire in this story finds itself [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] transported to an alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, where [the alternate world] the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten take place all [the events of the events

contrator] ending when the contractor becomes pregnant, dragons who can form contracts with selected humans and suprenatural creatures, [the dragons who form said contracts] being known as Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] and the gods, monsters and legends of various European and East Asian mythologies coexisting with Heroes [Musume Hyakka Jiten & Monmusume Kuesto!] and knights [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in the part of Musume Hyakka Jiten's world akin to Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Europe and the Balkans as well as European Russia but also warrior monks, samurai, martial artists, fire-benders [Avatar: The Last Airbender], water-benders [Avatar: The Last Airbender], yokai and kami in the part of Musume Hyakka Jiten's world akin to feudal Japan if if [feudal Japan] gained the Korean peninsula as a province either due to Yi-Seong-Gye's death preventing the formation of Joeson or the Imjin Wars of May 23, 1592 – December 16, 1598 launched by the Ashikaga shogunate de-facto lead by Toyotomi Hideyoshi-ruled feudal Japan against the satelite state and tributary kingdom of Great Joeson ruled by the partially Han Chinese Korean House of Jeonju Yi in Korea and the Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Ming dynasty ruling over both Han China and Cantonia if it [feudal Japan during the Imjin Wars] was able to push further into Korea and even invade Han China, gaining Korea as a Japanese province and making the Ming dynasty into a de-jure Japanese satelite state/tributary state and [feudal Japan] had also settled in and [feudal Japan] claimed Taiwan as a Japanese province or [feudal Japan] conquering the Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Tungning Kingdom ruled by the partially Japanese Zheng dynasty instead of the Manchu-ruled Great Qing Empire, the Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu [Musume Hyakka Jiten], [the mythology, demographics and geographics of this almagam world also being] inclusive of Avatar's Okinawan inspired Kiyoshi Island, warrior-heroes, warrior monks, water-benders [Avatar: The Last Airbender] and Turko-Mongol tribal shamans in the area of Musume Hyakka Jiten corresponding to a surviving Yuan dynasty-ruled Greater

Earth Kingdom, Chinese knights, fire-benders [Avatar: The Last Airbender] and Daoist monks in the area of Musume Hyakka Jiten's world corresponding both to the Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Ming dynasty

Japanese Empire] merging with the Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu [Musume Hyakka Jiten] when it [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] is [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] transported [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] to the new world, with people from the amalgam Fire Force and Boku no Hero Academia universe merging being merged with their counterparts in the Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu [Musume Hyakka Jiten] with residents of the Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu finding themselves in the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire along with thier property, and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire inheriting the surviving Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu's vast resources along with its [the Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu's] military, economic, firebending, contracted spirit, Pal and industrial forces in addition to its [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire's] own [military, economic and industrial

successfully conquering Korea in the Imjim Wars before its [the surviving Tokugawa shogunate's] invasion by the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] in the 1950s AD in the canon timeline of Code Geass. The post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire initially has no idea that it [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] has been transported to a different world [the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki], and [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] quickly secures its [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire's] borders, [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] checking up on its military and civilian space orbital satelites only to realize that it [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] is in an entirely new world the alternate world which is an amalgam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki] as police call centers are flooded with reports of altered locations, changed roads and mysterious creatures [monmosu and contracted spirits] appearing with the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Kempeitai working with the Japanese National Police Agency and Japanese Public Security Agency to eventually successfully restore order in the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire, with the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Emperor and the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese shogun planning to give a televised message to the Japanese people. A post-WW2, post-1947 surviving successful Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Pan-Asian anti-communist and anti-colonialist bloc formed by the real life Japanese Empire which [the Co-Prosperity Sphere] was resurrected in 1967 as ASEAN in real life, which [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] was able to survive along with the Japanese Empire past 1947 in its original world thanks to Woodrow Wilson dying as a child during the American Civil War and [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] consists of the post-1928 Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China as a post 1945 surviving Reorganized Government of the Republic of China, later reformed in the 1950s into Beiyang China's original status as a regency for the restoration of the pre-Qing Manchu-Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu Great Ming Empire/Ming dynasty with the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China being restored in the 1960s with the descendants of the House of Zhu becoming the Chinese Imperial family surviving once more, a post 1945 surviving former former Qing Imperial Family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo which [the surviving Empire of Manchukuo] managed to get all of Outer Manchuria after WW2 in its original world, a post 1945-surviving Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation in Inner Mongolia's Charhar and Suiyan regions, a post-WW2 restored Far Eastern Republic in Russia's East Coast, a post-WW2 restored Bogd Khan-ruled post-WW2 restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia ruling over Mongolia and the parts of Inner Mongolia unclaimed by Mengjiang, a post-1955 surviving nativized Vietnamese side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Imperial House of Ngyuen-ruled Empire of Vietnam, a post-1975 surviving Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos, a Kingdom of Cambodia that never experienced the Cambodian Civil War or the subsequent rise of the Khmer Rouge, a restored Kobaung dynasty-ruled Third Burmese Empire ruling over Burma, a restored Tungning Kingdom in the South Chinese region of Cantonia a post-WW2 restored Imperial House of Osman-ruled restored Ottoman Empire in Xingjiang/East Turkestan, a post-1950s surviving Kingdom of Tibet, a greater Malyasia that includes Singapore, an Indonesian federation ruled by the royal family of Indonesia's Yogyakarta region, the House of Hamengkubuwono as its [the Indonesian Federation's] imperial family, a restored Phillipine Empire ruled by the restored Sultans of Maguindanao as its Emperors, Brunei and a restored House of Kalākaua-ruled restored Kingdom of Hawaii ruling over all of Hawaii is [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] copied and the copy [of the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] placed [the copy of the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] in the geographical areas of the Greater Asia equivalent of the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, with the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China merging with the Fire Nation within the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China] inheriting its the Fire Nation within the almagam world's] conventional military and naval, contracted spirit, Pal and firebender strength along with its [the the Fire Nation within the almagam world's] massive industrial, economic and population might, while [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China] keeping its [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty's in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China's] own military, economic and technological might, the copies of the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang both [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] replacing the Greater Earth Kingdom within the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki and [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] both [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] getting its [the Greater Earth Kingdom's] conventional military and naval, contracted spirit, Pal and earthbender strength along with its [the Greater Earth Kingdom's] massive industrial, economic and population might while [the copies of the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] keeping their [the restored Bogd Khanate's of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang's] own military, economic and technological might with the same thing happening to the Lesser Earth Kingdom and the surviving Empire of Manchukuo. The copy of the restored Ottoman Empire in Xingjiang replaces the East Turkestan equivalent within the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, the surviving Kingdom of Tibet merges with the Tibetian equivalent home of the Air Nomads within the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, and the copy of the Far Eastern Republic is placed on the Russian East Coast equivalent of the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki The South-East Asian nations [the Philippines, the Indonesian Federation, Malyasia, Brunei, Burma, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, the Tungning Kingdom in Cantonia] along with the restored Kingdom of Hawaii, all merge with their counterparts in the South-East region of the Asia-equivalent region of the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, with the restored Tungning Kingdom and Cantonia both merging with the regions of the Greater Fire Nation within the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki that correspond to their locations, keeping their own industrial, economic and military might while maintaining the Greater Fire Nation's in the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki's industrial, economic and military strength along with the fire-benders within these regions. The same happens to the rest of the copied South East Asian nations within the surviving Co-Prosperity Sphere, except that these nations and Hawaii also maintain the water-bending presence and Earth-bending presence within these regions. A somewhat more successful Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] that is not only formed by a post-1216 surviving House of Plantagenet-ruled Angevin Empire that [the post-1216 surviving House of Plantagenet-ruled Angevin Empire] manages to win the 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 Hundred Years War due to Joan of Arc not being present in its [this alternate Brittania's] original world and timeline, with the French-Welsh Plantagenet side branch House of Tudor's control over the British Isles lasting past 1603 and what became the real life Anglized ruling branch of the German House of Hanover only managing to take power after the man known in the real world George II of Great Britain, George Augustus of the House of Hanover, seized power from the last Tudor monarch in the Code Geass universe, Queen Elizabeth III after her [Elizabeth III's] death, after Napoleon's successful invasion of the British Isles in 1752 and the subsequent flight of the British monarchy and royal government to Canada and the British West Indies, [George Augustus] forming the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] as Emperor George II, but this Holy Brittanian Empire's version of Queen Victoria having the British throne pass to the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha upon her [this version of Queen Victoria's] death, with these alternate Windsors forming the Third Bulgarian Empire which they [ the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha] ruled in real life from 1908-1945 immediately after the Crimean Wars instead of 1908 like in the real world, seizing Macedonia and Thrace and [ the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha in this alternate Brittania's home world] also almagating the British Empire in exile into the Bulgarian Imperial territories, [the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha in this alternate Brittanian Empire's own world], thus proclaiming the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] as a continuation of both the original Imperium Romanum [Roman Empire] and the Imperium Romanum's rump state of Eastern Rome, [Eastern Rome] better known as the Byzantine Empire. This alternate Brittanian Empire joined the Central Powers in WW1 against a revanchist France, post-monarchic Britain and a Russian Tsardom looking for revenge [basically a WW1 version of WW2 Axis powers]in its homeworld and won alongside the other Central Powers, [This alternate Brittanian Empire in its home world after its home world's version of WW1] reclaiming the British Isles as well as parts of the French coast. It also seized control of European Russia in the 1950s A.D after the Brittanian royal family argued that the Romanovs marrying into them meant they had the right to rule Russia, facing heavy resistance from communists and Russian nationalists, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] twenty years before the events of canon Code Geass start is [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] pulled from its [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire's] original world and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] transported into the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki where the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten all [the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten] occur, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] replacing and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] merging with [the nation-state this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire simultaneously replaces and merges with] the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal parliamentary monarchial theocratic crusader state of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten], which [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] is [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] also informally known as Lautreamont Knight Country [Seikoku no Doragunā] within this story with the Kingdom of Lescatie also being [what the Kingdom of Lescatie also is] known as the Tristain Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima], the Gallia Kingdom [the Zero no Tsukaima] or the Albion Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima] and the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] being its [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this story's] official name [the Ordesian Empire] in this story as well. The transported Brittanian Empire also maintains the Canada, Jamaica, New England equivalent amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki's heavy Native American Waterb ending presence. The Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this story also has the canon Lautreamont Knight Country's within the canon Seikoku no Doragunā's universe's tradition of dragon breeding and Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] being [Pals] used in warfare along with tanks, airplanes, modern naval power and floating battleships. The Ordesian Empire is also known as the Beltrum Kingdom in this fic [Seirei Gensōki] due to its [the Ordesian Empire's in this fic's] control of both the land and seas The Kingdom of Lescatie's territories in this world are the British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, and the West Occitania equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the European Russia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the Bulgaria including Greek Thrace and Macedonia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and the reigning monarchs of Kingdom of Lescatie in this story have the combined title of King/Queen of the England/British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and that of the Bulgarian/Russian Tsar equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. Its [The Kingdom of Lescatie's] history is basically if the House of Plantagenet-equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima-ruled Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continued to exist past 1216 and the subsequent the Hundred Years War of 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 being won by the English equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, with the marriage of the Queen Elizabeth I of England equivalent to the Peter the Great of the Russian Empire equivalent in this world essentially creating this world's version of a Anglo-Russian Empire, transforming Albion-Gallia-Tristian into the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and allowing the Tudor equivalent in in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continuing to rule the Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima until the House of Hanover equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima take power after the death of the last Tudor-equivalent Queen on 1 August 1714. An equivalent of the American Revolution does occur with the USA equivalent quickly becoming a protectorate of the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Hapsburg-equivalent-ruled Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. The Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima allows its non-Austrian German territories independence as a Royal House of Hohenzollern-equivalent-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-equivalent ruled German Empire in response to Germanic-equivalent nationalism and the ideas promoted by a failed French Revolution equivalent, quickly seizing the Italian peninsula during the Italian-equivalent wars of Independence and reabsorbing the Italian states equivalent into itself, becoming truly Holy, Roman and an Empire, quickly transitioning into a Austria-Hungary Equivalent. The Crimean War equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima ends with a draw although the Third Bulgarian Empire is created in the 19th century equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima instead of 1908. The Catholic branch of the real-life British royal family, the House of Saxe-Gotha-equivalent ruling over the Third Bulgarian Empire-equivalent as its imperial family reunites with the Protestant British branch-equivalent, becoming the imperial family of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] as well after the passing of the Queen Victoria-equivalent. The Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] then styles itself as the restoration, continuation and reformation of the Eastern Roman Empire-equivalent since the current imperial family rules over the major territories controlled by the Eastern Roman equivalent as well as the France equivalent and British Isles-equivalent.

A surviving Confederacy that was and still remains a British puppet and lost its world's version of WW1 along with the Entente, becoming its world's version of a surviving Nazi Germany due to it being ruled as a one-party state by the Democrats and the KKK is [the surviving Confederacy] copied with the copy [of the surviving Confederacy] being placed in the US South equivalent on the North America equivalent of the alternate world which is an amalgam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki. And a post-1823 surviving Mexican Empire that kept Central America up to Panama but still lost what would be known as the US West Coast, Mexico and New Mexico to the USA, although Habsburg descendant Ferdinand Maximilian Josef Maria von Habsburg-Lothringen still came to power in its [the surviving Mexican Empire's] original world as Maximilian I of Mexico on April 10, 1864, making his [Maximilian I's] descendants [Maximilian I's] the new Mexican imperial family, a position they [Maximilian I's relatives] have [Maximilian I's relatives] maintained ever since, [the surviving Mexican Empire] being [the surviving Mexican Empire] copied and its [the surviving Mexican Empire's] copy placed in what would be the Mexico and North America equivalent of the alternate world which is an amalgam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki. A post-1889 surviving Portuguese House of Brazanga-ruled Empire of Brazil that [the surviving Empire of Brazil] joined the Central Powers in its [the surviving Empire of Brazil's] world and [the surviving Empire of Brazil] helped win WW1 with the other Central Powers is [the surviving Brazilian Empire] copied and the copy [of the surviving Brazilian Empire] in the South America equivalent of the alternate world which is an amalgam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, more specifically the Brazil and Uraguay equivalents. In the Eurasia equivalent of the alternate world, a post-1979 surviving Imperial House of Pahlavi-ruled Imperial State of Iran that managed to regain the historical Iranian areas of Qatar, Bahrain, Turkmenistan's Sanjan province, Afghanistan, parts of Iraq and parts of Pakistan is copied and the copy [of this surviving Imperial State of Iran] is placed in the Eurasia equivalent of the alternate world. The excerpt should focus on the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire adjusting its [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire's] bearings after the transportation to the East Asia equivalent of the alternate world which is an amalgam of Seikoku no Doragunā and the subsequent merger with the Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu, [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] encountering the copied surviving Co-Prosperity Sphere and [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] establishing contact with the governing bodies of the copied surviving Co-Prosperity Sphere, [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] quickly re-establishing Japanese control over the Co-Prosperity Sphere as post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army troops rush from the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire to the copied surviving Co-Prosperity Sphere member states to help their Asiatic brothers deal with the bender, contracted spirit, monmosu and magic problem in these nations. The post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire is also able to get a signal on a long silent radio frequency used by the US Armed Forces before the Great Cataclysm, [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] getting into contact with the copied surviving American Empire and [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] establishing diplomatic relations, although the dignitaries from the copied surviving American Empire are confused at the mention of the Great Cataclysm as such an event [the Great Cataclysm] had [the Great Cataclysm] never occurred in their [the dignitaries' from the copied surviving American Empire's] original world, despite this the effort to maintain contact with the copied surviving American Empire is otherwise successful and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire decides to send a floating aircraft carrier with conventional jet fighter aircraft, TSFs and conventional military equipment on board and members of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan's ruling main branch now living in post-Great Cataclysm, post-Great Tokyo Empire restored and rebuilt Tokyo with its reigning male heads acting as the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Emperors] on board to what it [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] thinks is a post Great Cataclysm restored American rump state [the copied surviving American Empire]. Meanwhile, in the North America equivalent of the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, the copied surviving American Empire is [the copied surviving American Empire] able to reestablish contact with Europe, more specifically its [the copied surviving American Empire's] mother state [Austria-Hungary], but the American imperial government notices that things seem to be quite different. However, the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary is happy to send naval and other military forces to its [the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary's] unexpected new colony [the copied surviving American Empire] both as protection and also as a show of force against the copied surviving American Empire's hostile new neighbor [the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] and [the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary] also to send a delegation to accompany the copied surviving American Empire's hosting delegation to meet the visiting delegation from strange new Japanese Empire [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire]. The copied restored Confederacy manages to come into contact with the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire, [the copied restored Confederacy] restoring the colonial relationship with the Anglo-Saxon colonial realm with the colonial master in this case being the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire. The copied surviving Mexican Empire manages to establish contact with the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary, [the copied surviving Mexican Empire] agreeing to be a protectorate [of the copied Kaiserreich Austria-Hungary] in order to [the copied surviving Mexican Empire] get protection from the Anglo-Saxon [the copied restored Confederacy and the transplanted alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] states now on the North American equivalent. P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes apart from those described in this fic.

However, due to the sheer complexity and depth of the crossover, creating a full story will take much more than the space allows here. I’ll provide you with an excerpt that captures the setting and introduces some of the conflicts and themes embedded in this alternative world. --- In the grand hall of the restructured Imperial Palace, a tense atmosphere hovered over the newly arranged command center. The sprawling capital, once Kyoto, had been buzzing with activity ever since their sudden and inexplicable translocation. Screens that once displayed news now showed maps of the unfamiliar amalgam world, their borders redrawn with new territories that demanded the utmost attention. Emperor Sasori Ōtsutsuki's eyes intently analyzed the information scrolling across the digital displays. His once traditional royal attire had since given way to a modernized and militaristic uniform, combining Japanese aesthetics with needful utility. The title of emperor was an inherited guise, one that had fallen to him by chance, misconception, and finally acceptance. \\"Report,\\" Sasori demanded, his voice echoing lightly in the hall. His chief advisor, a man named Akio Tanaka, approached, his boots clicking against the marble floors. \\"Your Majesty, our forces are stabilizing the region. However, the populace is still bewildered by the monmosu presence. Our troops are not trained for engagement with these... beings, and the public is curious, yet frightened.” \\"Understandable,\\" Sasori murmured. \\"Their existence was never a consideration in our world—our pre-Cataclysm Kyoto. We must establish diplomacy where possible.\\" In the corner of the hall, three women stood in quiet consultation, their uniforms adorned with insignias that marked them as Slayers—warriors in their own right, with contracts and ties to ethereal beings, or 'Divas', as they had come to be known. Among them was Hina, a skilled fighter, her youthful face belying the scars she carried, each a testament to her experience. \\"Are we really trusting these dignitaries from the American Empire?\\" Hina whispered to her companions. \\"We have no choice,\\" responded Sayuri, her hand calmly resting on the hilt of her spirit-forged blade. \\"Our world is now inexplicably larger. Diplomacy is our sharpest weapon.\\" \\"I just don’t get it,\\" interjected the third, Kazue. \\"Last week we were fighting infernals, now we’re dealing with... with water-benders and these spirit contractors. It’s madness.\\" Before more could be said, a call to attention was sounded, and everyone snapped into a formal stance as dignitaries from the copied surviving American Empire entered the room, led by an Imperial envoy named Marcus Habsburg. \\"Your Majesty,\\" Marcus began, a modicum of surprise touching his features as he took in his surroundings. \\"It's an honor to establish contact with your empire. We had only received garbled transmissions about a... Cataclysm?\\" \\"Yes,\\" Sasori began, stepping forward. “Our world has been reshaped by a calamity, one that wrought havoc upon our land. But tell me, Envoy Habsburg, how fares the state of your world?\\" Habsburg shared a look with his aide before answering cautiously. \\"It seems, Your Majesty, that while we have no memory or record of such a Cataclysm, we're now part of a much different geopolitical landscape—one we too are coming to grips with.\\" As they talked, far to the west, a different negotiation took place within the imposing walls of the transplanted British Empire. The copied Confederacy had sent its own delegation to cement alliances, a partnership born of colonial history and shared apprehension of the fantastically altered world. And to the south, the copied Mexican Empire surrendered its independence, not to invaders, but to possible protectors—a bid to withstand a future of uncertainty and ensure some semblance of peace. In the skies, a floating aircraft carrier, a marvel of pre-Cataclysm engineering adorned with the Rising Sun, made its slow and deliberate way towards American territory. Its deck was arrayed with fearsome TSFs, each pilot aware of the new reality’s oddities, yet uncertain of the welcome they would receive. The world was afire with opportunities and dangers, alliances and old colonial chains reforged in this strange new reality, an amalgam universe that defied all prior understanding. --- There you have a glimpse into the vast world you requested—a world where history folded upon itself, where high fantasy met the might of empires, and where new politics were just taking shape. The scope is vast and tails are myriad, each begging to be woven into an overarching tapestry of narrative."},{"instruction":"приведите примеры покупки товара, предназначенного для следующих целей. цель покупки: 1. личное потребление : товар, покупатель, пример 2. домашнее использование: товар, покупатель, пример 3. семейное использование: товар, покупатель, пример 4. иное использование, не связанное с предпринимательской деятельностью: товар, покупатель, пример","output":"1.

Planetary radioactivity is decreasing due to decaying, causes to turn planet into frozen ice planet in future. It has shadow forests, adorned with twilight bioluminescent flowers, animals lives on.","output":"Miryath is a unique and awe-inspiring planet that exists in the heat death universe of Katharik, orbiting the ancient and evaporating black hole Tojrane. Despite its bleak surroundings, Miryath is home to incredible natural wonders that make it a mesmerizing place. The planet is characterized by its two large ice polar caps that extend across vast expanses of the surface. These polar caps shimmer with an otherworldly beauty, their icy landscape glistening under the faint light that manages to peek through the cosmic void. A single massive ocean dominates the majority of Miryath, stretching out in an endless expanse of frozen waters. This icy ocean reflects the pale light of the distant stars, casting an eerie glow across its surface. The waves lap gently against the frozen shores, creating a serene yet haunting atmosphere. At the heart of the planet lies a large single continent, rising majestically from the frigid waters. This continent is diverse in its geography, with stunning mountain ranges, deep valleys, and expansive plains. The landmass stands as a testament to the strength and resilience of life against the icy embrace of the universe. Although Miryath is on the verge of becoming a frozen ice planet, it still boasts vibrant pockets of life. Within the shadowy forests that dot the surface, a unique ecosystem thrives. These shadow forests are shrouded in darkness, their canopies blocking the majority of the scarce light. Yet, the trees themselves emit a faint bioluminescent glow, providing a twilight-like setting. Among the gnarled and twisted branches, dwelling within the shadows, exist an assortment of animals – each uniquely adapted to this dimly lit environment. One of the most captivating features of Miryath's shadow forests is the presence of twilight bioluminescent flowers. These delicate blooms add splashes of color to the otherwise stark surroundings, emitting a soft and ethereal light. The forest transforms into a surreal vision, with trees illuminated by the luminous flowers, creating a breathtaking display of organic beauty. However, Miryath's future is uncertain. The decreasing planetary radioactivity, caused by natural decay, is slowly turning the planet into a frozen ice giant. As the radiation wanes, the temperature drops further, inching towards an icy demise. In time, Miryath may transform into a desolate and frozen wasteland, its once-teeming life overshadowed by the overwhelming cold. Miryath stands as a testament to the tremendous adaptability of life in the face of inevitable change. Its icy landscapes, shadow forests, and Twilight bioluminescent wonders fascinate those lucky enough to witness their beauty."},{"instruction":"Describe sophont corvoid nocturnal species named ulhre, from planet Miryath, known for shadow empire named Obrossiv has risen.","output":"The ulhre, a sophisticated species of corvoid creatures, are native to the planet Miryath, where the shadow empire named Obrossiv has emerged.

This enigmatic entity exists as a captivating contrast to the evaporating black hole it orbits, shrouded in cold and icy beauty. The black hole itself is a formidable force, a gravitational abyss that consumes all matter and light that ventures too close. It possesses an immense mass, its gravitational pull bending the fabric of space-time in a mesmerizing display of cosmic power. While its companion lacks the same level of evaporation and radiation as Tojorane, it still exudes an aura of profound mystery and intrigue. Wrapped around this distant companion black hole is a colossal protoplanetary disk, a vast ring of frozen matter in its early stages of planetary formation. This disk consists of a bewildering array of icy particles, ranging from tiny grains to massive chunks of frozen material. It forms a mesmerizing spectacle in the depths of space, casting a pale and ethereal glow as it reflects the scant light of distant stars. Within the frozen protoplanetary disk, the potential for future planetary creation lies dormant. As the temperature drops to extreme lows, the natural process of planet birth is slowed down, creating a suspended state of frozen potential. These icy particles, remnants of primordial matter, may one day coalesce and give birth to new worlds, bringing life and diversity to this frozen corner of the universe. The presence of a protoplanetary disk around a black hole presents a captivating juxtaposition, as the chaotic and destructive forces of a black hole are tempered by the delicate and serene dance of planetary formation. It is a testament to the duality that exists in the vast expanse of space, with creation and destruction intertwined in an eternal cosmic ballet. This distant companion of Tojorane, with its large frozen protoplanetary disk, offers a glimpse into the intricate and ongoing processes of the universe. As time stretches on and the disk continues to evolve, it holds the potential to release its frozen inhabitants, ushering in a new era of planetary existence. In the depths of this cold and remote corner of the cosmos, the cycle of creation and renewal persists, reminding us of the profound beauty and boundless possibilities that await in the mysteries of deep space."},{"instruction":"write a comedic and detailed story about Carl Grimes relieving himself in his outhouse, add dialogue and sounds coming from it.

Describe him eating it. After he finishes he relaxes in his easy chair. Add dialogue from Carl Grimes throughout the whole story","output":"Once upon a time, in an apocalyptic world, where luxuries such as indoor plumbing had become the stuff of legend, Carl Grimes found himself approaching his trusty outhouse with all the urgency of a man who'd had too much chili the night before. With a tip of his sheriff's hat—a remnant of a world gone by—Carl addressed the ramshackle wooden structure as though it were an old friend. \\"Morning, Betsy. Hope you're ready for a storm.\\" He slammed the door behind him, and the world outside was treated to a symphony of echoes. A series of comedic \\"plops\\" and \\"toots\\" resonated through the thin walls, followed by Carl's voice singing a weary tune, \\"Ode to Beans, my stomach's regret.\\" A resounding sigh signaled the end of his concert, and with a feeling of relief that only comes from such a release, Carl swung open the door. \\"Ah, sweet freedom,\\" he chuckled to himself. Now, for his morning routine. Wrinkling his nose in anticipation of his outdoor shower, Carl fetched the wooden bucket filled with water, hanging it on a high tree branch. With overexaggerated care, he began to undress, casting his sheriff's attire onto a nearby branch as if it were his dresser at home. As he stood in the buff, one could observe Carl's lengthy, unwashed hair a tangled mess of dirt and grit. A few days worth of scruff adorned his face, providing it a rugged yet slightly unkempt appearance. His physique suggested a man accustomed to the trials of survival—lean, but with burgeoning muscles shaped from days filled with laborious tasks. And finally, the sun caught the glint of his pale and surprisingly un-toned buttocks as he stepped beneath the bucket. He pulled the rope with all the flair of a man born into a world without running water. Cascading down upon his head was a deluge that could make even the birds stop to stare. With a homemade loofah in hand, Carl began to scrub diligently beneath his armpits, creating a soapy froth. The water sluiced across his body, and he opened his mouth wide to catch a gulp, gargling grandly before spitting it out to the side. \\"Aah, nature's mouthwash!\\" he exclaimed, spitting out with a flourish. Carl then ambled over to his rustic outdoor mirror, which was perched between two trees. He revealed a toothbrush fashioned from a stick and some unfortunate animal's hair. Grinning widely, he began to brush. Beaming with pride at his reflection, the smile fell as cracks spread across the glass like spiderwebs before shattering to the ground. \\"Guess I still got it,\\" he said with mock arrogance, stepping over the shards to continue his morning. Now, for breakfast, and Carl had a peculiar method for fishing that was best left unspoken about, but now requires the telling. Striding into the nearby pond, still gloriously in the nude, he waded in until the water reached his knees. Taking a deep breath, he released a thunderous fart, the bubbles rising to the surface like some beast being summoned from the depths. \\"Oh, pardon me, ladies and gents,\\" he quipped, addressing the pond life with dramatic flourish, though knowing full well there wasn't another soul around for miles. The fish, unable to withstand the noxious fumes of Carl's own brand of chemical warfare, started to float belly-up. With glee, he plucked the stunned fish from the pond. \\"Fish kebabs tonight!\\" he proclaimed, gleeful at the prospect of an easy meal. Back at his humble abode, Carl skewered the fish with some sticks and set them over a fire. He watched as the skins crisped and the flesh cooked to perfection. Dinner was a simple affair: Fish kebabs seasoned with whatever herbs had survived the apocalypse, cooked over an open flame. \\"Finger lickin' good,\\" Carl remarked between bites, a satisfied grin spreading beneath his unkempt mustache. After the rustic repast, he sprawled in his easy chair, his makeshift throne in this wild kingdom. With a contented sigh, he mused aloud, \\"Life's simple pleasures, they're all one needs. Well, that and a good ol' outhouse like Betsy.\\" He tipped his hat to an imaginary crowd, chuckling to himself, and the easy chair creaked in agreement as Carl Grimes settled into the quiet of the post-apocalyptic evening."},{"instruction":"i have the slogan in arabic is : اللغة الأمازيغية، وسيلة للاندماج الاجتماعي في المغرب المتعدد in french \\"La langue amazighe comme vecteur d’inclusion sociale dans un Maroc pluriel\\" i need it in english","output":"The Amazigh language as a means of social inclusion in a pluralistic Morocco"},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a young man engaging in his hedonistic pleasures while his girlfriend is at work.

LUXURIOUS APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY A splash of sunlight pours into a lavish, modern living room layered with eclectic decor.

Camera pans across the room, following the trail of flickering candles perched on mantlepieces and tabletops, casting a warm, embracing glow. The air is imbued with the sweet aroma of jasmine incense, floating in the quiet hum of an idle afternoon. CUT TO: YUUTO (20s), an androgynous and strikingly handsome young man with a rebellious flair, strikes a match with a slow, deliberate movement. His face is an image of serene focus as the small flame dances at the end of the matchstick before leaning down to light the last candle on the coffee table. Yuuto's fingers are slender and purposeful, moving with graceful precision to the tune of his hedonistic ritual. As the candle flickers to life, he admiringly inspects his freshly painted nails—each one coated in a glossy, jet black that stands in sharp contrast to his pale skin. He sets the matchbox down and turns his attention to his footwear. The camera follows his hands as they guide his feet into a pair of elegant, heeled leather boots. The boots ascend like statues, crafted with sumptuous leather and detailed stitching, ending in a sharp, confident point. Yuuto zips them up slowly, the soft metallic chorus measuring his satisfaction. A decadent silk robe awaits, draped over the couch in a careless yet artful display. Yuuto picks it up with a flourish and lounges onto the couch, the fabric whispering over his barely-clad body—his underwear, the lone garment hugging his skin. The robe cascades around him, amplifying his allure. The living room radiates luxury and rebellion—Yuuto's kingdom where his desires are law, and pleasure is the currency. He stretches languidly, an embodiment of hedonic indulgence. One hand rests behind his head as a pillow while the other taps a rhythm on his thigh as if he's listening to a melody only he can hear. A glint of a smile curls on his lips. He closes his eyes, surrendering to an indulgent peace, existing in the quiet space between the tick of the clock and the distant clamor of the city below. A beat passes. The CAMERA lingers on Yuuto for a few more serene moments, then pulls back, exiting through the slightly ajar balcony door, leaving the young man to his perfect, solitary afternoon.

После применения решета в массиве sieve останутся отмеченными как \`True\` только индексы, соответствующие простым числам. Эти числа извлекаются и помещаются в список \`primes\`, из которого они затем выводятся на экран вместе с их порядковыми номерами в этом списке."},{"instruction":"а можно ли сократить этот код? но чтобы все равно использовался метод эратосфена!","output":"Конечно, можно оптимизировать и упростить программу, используя алгоритм Эратосфена.

A black hole is an extremely dense celestial object formed from the gravitational collapse of a massive star. It is characterized by a region in space where gravity becomes so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. In some cases, black holes can have a protoplanetary disk, similar to the ones found around young stars. These disks are essentially flattened structures composed of gas, dust, and debris that orbit around the black hole. The presence of a protoplanetary disk around a black hole can occur if the black hole is relatively young and was formed from the remnants of a massive star surrounded by a disk of material. As the black hole forms, the surrounding disk of gas and dust can gradually fall into the gravitational well of the black hole, creating a swirling disk around it. This protoplanetary disk plays a crucial role in the accretion process, as matter from the disk spirals inward due to the gravitational pull of the black hole. As the material falls toward the black hole, it gets heated up and emits various forms of radiation, including X-rays, making it detectable by astronomers. The presence of a protoplanetary disk around a black hole may also indicate the potential for planet formation. Similar to protoplanetary disks around young stars, the gas and dust in the black hole's disk can clump together, forming planetary bodies or even asteroids, comets, and other celestial objects. These objects can potentially orbit the black hole in a manner similar to how planets orbit a star. Studying black holes with protoplanetary disks offers scientists valuable insights into the formation and evolution of both black holes and planetary systems. By analyzing the properties of the disk and its interactions with the black hole, researchers can gain a better understanding of the processes that occur during the early stages of stellar and planetary formation."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The young survivor, with his hair matted with zombie goop and face smeared with the grime of survival, peels off his well-worn, sweat-stained clothes, revealing a body more sun-browned and scarred than any teenager's ought to be. He steps gingerly into the tepid pond waters, nibbling tadpoles scattering from his approach. Carl submerges himself, the cool water enveloping him like a soothing balm, and he reclines with a sigh of pure relief that comes from finding a momentary respite in this hellish world. His one piercing blue eye, the other hidden beneath a rough eye-patch, scans the perimeter for any sign of walkers or human threats—it's a force of habit when the undead prerogative is to interrupt any hint of pleasure. Ensuring that the coast is clear, Carl allows himself to become one with the water, his lean figure lounging with an uncharacteristic grace afforded only in liquid solitude. Then, as the tranquillity wraps around him, a gurgling remnant of a once-plentiful canned-chili dinner creeps its way through his intestines. It's a silent symphony to any survivor's ear, one that draws nigh with the tenacity of a hungry walker. He's alone, or so he thinks. Part of him—the child that remains—grins mischievously at the impending sonic eruption. With the precision of a skilled hunter, Carl angles himself for optimal release, shifts his abdomen, and lets out a monstrous fart that disturbs the pond's natural stillness. The sound reverberates off the water with a bass-like profundity, bubbles rising with a gross, yet oddly satisfying, series of bloops. The water around him shimmies with the vibrations, and the grimace of relief on Carl's face tells of a tension unfurled. In the tranquility of the apocalypse, there is no need for the politeness of a quieter release. As the ripples settle, Carl notices an unexpected consequence of his pungent pastime: a few unfortunate fish float to the surface, succumbing to the noxious cloud that has infiltrated their watery habitat. With the resourcefulness that life-and-death circumstances cultivate, Carl's survivor instinct kicks in. Twisting his lips into a wry grin, he gathers the belly-up victims of his gaseous escapade. This wasn't fishing as his father Rick might have taught him—but these are desperate, stinking times. Hoisting the little critters out, Carl sets them aside on the bank, his dastardly work in the pond complete. He hauls himself from the water, a trail of laughter escaping his lips at the absurdity of his fish capture technique. He gathers sticks and kindling, the whimsy of the situation not lost on him, and sets about creating a small campfire. The very wood seems to wince away from the odor. As the fire catches and the first fish begins to sizzle, Carl's laughter fades into contemplation. He may be alone in this fleeting moment, yet here he is—sitting naked by a fire, cooking fish taken with a fart in the zombie apocalypse. This blend of the surreal and comical isn't lost on Carl, and as he chews thoughtfully on his unusual, air-flavored catch, he figures it's just another day in the life of a post-apocalyptic teenage boy."},{"instruction":"What is the intuition behind the name \\"separable\\" in topology?","output":"The term \\"separable\\" in topology refers to a property of a topological space. Specifically, a topological space is called separable if it contains a countable dense subset. This means that within the space, there is a countable set of points such that every point in the space can be approximated as closely as desired by points from this countable set. The intuition behind the name \\"separable\\" comes from the idea that this property allows us to \\"separate\\" or distinguish between points in the space using only a countable number of other points. A dense subset \\"touches\\" every part of the space in the sense that for every open set (and hence every point, since singleton sets are open in a T1 space), there is at least one point from the dense subset inside it. An analogy can be drawn with the rational numbers within the real numbers: The rationals are dense in the reals because between any two real numbers, no matter how close, there is always a rational number. The rationals form a countable set that is dense in the uncountable set of all real numbers, making the real numbers a separable space. Being separable is often seen as a measure of a space's \\"size\\" or \\"complexity,\\" with separable spaces being considered less complex from the perspective of cardinality and analysis, because they allow for certain theorems and analytical techniques to be applied, relying on the existence of a countable dense subset. It's one of many topological properties that help mathematicians to classify and work with different kinds of spaces."},{"instruction":"choose a random office settings, one word with coffee and minimalist added before","output":"Minimalist Coffee Workspace"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artMinimalist Coffee Workspace","output":"\\"Minimalist Coffee Workspace Art | Modern Office Decor | Versatile Design for Mugs, Prints, T-Shirts | Home and Professional Styling\\""},{"instruction":"import tkinter as tk from tkinter import filedialog, simpledialog, messagebox, ttk from tktooltip import ToolTip from PIL import Image, ImageTk import piexif import os import random import time import threading #import subprocess from tkinterdnd2 import DND_FILES, TkinterDnD import simpleaudio as sa import sys make me a pip install script to install all of those dependencies","output":"To create a script that installs all the dependencies listed in your Python script, you would typically write a \`requirements.txt\` file or use a \`pip\` installation command that installs each package individually.

In a rare moment of quiet amid the ruins of the world, he stumbles upon a serene, surprise paradise—a hidden pond that promises him a rare moment of normalcy. Little does he know, his pursuit of peace will lead to a hilarious series of events that not even Rick could have envisioned for his son.

With a quick glance to ensure he's alone—and with a nod to the comic absurdity that life still holds—he decides it's time to indulge in nature's bathtub. Carl removes his shirt, covered in the dust and blood from past encounters, and exhales deeply, \\"A moment of respite in this chaotic world, finally something doesn't reek of death.\\" He strips off the remainder of his clothes and tiptoes into the cool water, a contented sigh escaping his lips. \\"Ah, freedom.

His amusement is unparalleled. \\"Guess I should've warned the wildlife. Sorry, guys! But, when you've got to go, you've got to go, am I right?\\" Scene 3: The Unexpected Harvest Carl, though momentarily remorseful for the aquatic casualties, soon sees an opportunity in the unfortunate situation. \\"Well, looks like nature provides in the strangest ways!\\" He collects the fish with a survivor's pragmatism, \\"Nothing goes to waste in the Grimes household, no sir.\\" Scene 4: The Campfire Cook-Out Later, as Carl sits by a campfire he managed to craft, he skewers the fish, and they sizzle over the flames. \\"Who knew a pond-side spa day would lead to a feast? It's practically biblical.\\" He chuckles to himself, flipping the fish, \\"From walkers to water—Carl Grimes, the fish whisperer.

With no sign of walkers or enemies in sight and the heat beating down, he decided to indulge in a little au naturel relaxation. Stripping down, he muttered to the empty air, \\"Guess this is one way to make sure no walkers sneak up on ya. Don’t smell like food, don’t get eaten, right?\\" He waded into the warm, murky water, feeling the slimy mud squish between his toes. As Carl lounged in the water, the serenity of the moment gave him a sense of freedom he hadn't felt in ages. He closed his eye and drifted in the gentle sway of the pond water, letting out an exasperated sigh. \\"Imagine an apocalypse without a moment's peace for... this,\\" he thought. But as life in the apocalypse would have it, moments of peace were like a gas station sushi – rare and potentially fraught with unseen danger. Carl felt a rumbling within his stomach, the kind that foreshadowed an ominous presence. \\"Well, hell,\\" Carl chuckled to himself, seeing an opportunity in his solitary state, \\"no one to impress out here.\\" He let out a long, thunderous fart, watching the bubbles race to the surface. His laughter danced over the pond as he watched, almost in commendation, “Now that's what I call a Walker repellant!\\" To Carl's surprise, a few unsuspecting fish soon floated to the surface, belly-up, apparently victims of the noxious bubble trap. \\"Fish for dinner, courtesy of Carl Grimes,\\" he pronounced with a wry smile. Wading through the water, he collected his unexpected catch with glee. \\"Gotta appreciate the little things,\\" Carl quipped as he piled the fish on the bank. He gathered some sticks and tinder, expertly sparking a fire in preparation for his foraged feast. As the fish sizzled over the flames, Carl mused aloud, \\"Who would've thought? Carl Grimes, the bubble-breathing fish whisperer.\\" He poked at the fire, the smell of cooking fish filling the air and masking the prior olfactory offense. Carl couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of his situation, as he turned the fish with a stick, “Rick’s gonna lose it if he hears about this one. ‘Coral, why are the fish dead?’ ‘Well, Dad, you know, just shared a little piece of my mind with them.’” As the sun began to set, Carl sat back, munching on his pond-caught dinner. The quiet of the evening was only punctuated by his contented sighs and the crackling of the fire. \\"I'll tell you what, Mr. Fish,\\" he said, toasting a particularly plump one in the air, \\"today was a good day in the apocalypse. Cheers to the simple joys of farts and fortune.\\" The stars twinkled above as Carl Grimes, the one-eyed wonder, let out a satisfied belly laugh, the warmth of the fire reflecting in his smile. And for the first time in a long time, the world didn't seem quite so broken."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a young man engaging in his hedonistic pleasures while his girlfriend is at work.

His posture is relaxed, a certain savoir-faire about him as he leisurely paints his nails a glossy black. He exhales in contentment with each precise stroke.

Yusuke lazily retrieves his phone from the table, sparing a glance at the screen. It's from NAO, his hardworking girlfriend, sending love and reminding him they'll be reunited in the evening. Yusuke chuckles, typing a quick, flirtatious response. He puts the phone aside, crossing his legs, the soft silk slipping against his skin. For a moment, he’s the embodiment of self-indulgence, a young man savoring a moment of guilty pleasure and solitude. CUT TO: The camera pans through the room, capturing the luxuriant details, the allure of flamboyance and freedom, before centering back on Yusuke.

We’re talking about a picturesque pond nestled in a clearing surrounded by a forest that has reclaimed Earth in wake of the zombie apocalypse. Trees sway gently, birds chirp obliviously; it's as if nature has forgotten the chaos of the world of \\"The Walking Dead\\". Carl Grimes, the one-eyed survivor with a penchant for mischief now turned zen master of relaxation, decides it's high time for a clandestine skinny dip. He sheds his ragged clothes, glancing around with that singular 'I mean business' stare. CARL: \\"Ah, the sweet apocalypse. No rules, no clothes, no problem.\\" He slides into the pond with a contented sigh, channeling his inner Huck Finn. The water is suspiciously calm, almost as if the pond knows who’s boss. CARL: (belly up, floating, talking to the sky) \\"Would you look at that, Daddy-o? Blue as your sheriff’s uniform.\\" Suddenly, the peaceful scene is disturbed by a bubbling in the water. Carl lets out a long, resonating fart—think trumpet heralding the arrival of medieval royalty. The bubbles are plentiful, a natural jacuzzi courtesy of Carl's rear end. CARL: (laughing) \\"I could market this as the world’s first post-zombie spa experience!\\" He watches, bemused, as a handful of fish float belly-up, victims of the toxic gas emanating from the depths. Carl, always resourceful, has a lightbulb moment. CARL: \\"Fish in a barrel, or a Carl in a pond? Either way, it's dinner time!\\" With ease that comes from seasons of survival, he scoops up the fish and skips to shore, still in the nude. CARL: (grabbing a stick) \\"Hey, fishies, you thought my toots were deadly on the outside? Wait 'til you taste how fiery they are on the grill!\\" Montage time: Carl, now donning his trusty sheriff's hat and nothing else, is seen starting a fire with the kind of brisk efficiency that only the apocalypse can teach. He skewers his catch, humming a tune that's half memory, half survivalist's improvisation. CARL: \\"Ooh, that's the smell of success... minus my earlier aquatic symphony.\\" He settles by the fire, the fish charring beautifully as night falls. Conversing with the flames, Carl casts a reflective eye on his bizarre existence. CARL: (to the fire) \\"I've battled walkers, megalomaniacs, and survived adolescence in the end times. But who knew my legacy would be as a fisherman of the fart?\\" Enter Michonne, drawn by the smell of cooking fish—half concerned, half amused. She raises an eyebrow, noting Carl's lack of attire. MICHONNE: \\"Carl, what in the world—\\" CARL: (grinning) \\"Let’s just say, I've found a new way to fish that would make Rick and Shane shake their heads.\\" As they sit together, consuming the fruits of Carl's unconventional labor, they share a moment of levity rare in their ravaged world. CARL: (taking a thoughtful bite) \\"You know, in a world gone mad, you've gotta find joy in the little things... even if it's your own bubbles leading to an unexpected feast.\\" As Michonne chuckles, shaking her head at the absurdity of their lives, the camera pans up to the night sky.

For once, Carl could let his guard down. It was time for some *serious* relaxation. Stripping down to nothing but his birthday suit, Carl admired his long hair, which now tickled the small of his back. \\"Well, ain't I the shampoo commercial of the apocalypse,\\" he chuckled to himself, easing into the cool embrace of the pond, his toes squelching in the mud below as little ripples danced away from him. He leaned back, floating effortlessly, gazing up at the clouds that ambled by like fluffy white sheep in an endless azure pasture. Carl sighed, closing his eye, as the symphony of nature crooned around him—birds twitted, a soft breeze whispered through the trees, and then— A pressure brewed within him, a gaseous reminder of last night's feast on canned beans. Carl lifted an eyebrow, murmuring to the forest audience, \\"Out here, in the circle of life, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. And right now, Carl Grimes is about to do just that.\\" With a cheeky grin, he lifted his hips slightly, and let loose a tremendous underwater trumpet solo. Bubbles surged to the surface, breaking with a series of plops, as a noxious cloud diffused into the once-pure pond water. \\"Oh, lordy, even the dead would run from that,\\" Carl cackled, watching as the pond's inhabitants seemed to voice their intense disapproval. Fish of all sizes flipped belly-up, becoming unintended casualties of Carl's chemical warfare. \\"Well, lookie here, the world provides,\\" Carl said, a devilish twinkle in his eye as he plucked the floating fish from their watery grave. \\"Sorry, little buddies. Nothin' personal—it's just the circle of life.\\" In a world short on luxuries, Carl wasn't one to waste an opportunity. He gathered sticks and foliage, gingerly crafting a makeshift campfire at the pond's edge. As the flames licked the sky, he skewered his unexpected catch, setting them over the heat. Carl leaned back, hissing with contentment at the heat of the fire against his skin, whispering to his fishy friends, \\"If only you knew the heroic end you'd meet, serving the son of Sheriff Grimes. Cookin' up a righteous storm for the one-eyed wonder of the walker world. A silent but deadly hero deserves a silent but deadly feast.\\" The sizzle of cooking fish mixed with the crackling of the fire, an oddly serene soundtrack for the bizarre spa day. The aroma from his impromptu barbecue battled with the lingering air of his pond performance. As the first fish reached a perfect golden-brown, Carl plucked it from the skewer, blew on it to cool it down, and took a hearty bite. \\"Oh, that's good. Tastes like... victory,\\" Carl exclaimed, a loose grin spreading across his face. There he sat, the young warrior of the wasteland, the boy with the angelic hair and devilish toots, feasting upon the unexpected fruits of his flatulent labor. In the world of The Walking Dead, it was the small victories and odd moments of humor that kept you sane—or at least as sane as one could be while dining on fart-frightened fish by a picturesque pond in the nude."},{"instruction":"Wie kann man berechnen an welcher stelle eines graphen die momentane änderungsrate am höchsten ist?","output":"Die momentane Änderungsrate eines Graphen wird durch die Steigung der Tangente an den Graphen an jedem Punkt repräsentiert.

The channel sees a significant increase in audience numbers, drawn by the entertainment element. **Era 6: Lifestyle Makeover Bloc (2004-2006)** - InfomercialTV branches out into lifestyle programming, featuring home makeovers, fashion, and beauty segments financed by product manufacturers. -

InfomercialTV begins to emphasize health and wellness products heavily, from diet supplements to exercise machines. - Programs providing health tips and advice that stealthily promote specific products are incorporated. - InfomercialTV starts to develop a reputation as a guide to healthy living. **Era 8: Original Program Diversification (2010-2012)** - Though still heavily sponsored, InfomercialTV starts creating its original programming that tries to stand alone without the direct sell—a move towards a traditional TV network model. -

The network starts to include more educational content with a consumer twist, often with a focus on technology and innovation in products. - InfomercialTV partners with educational institutions to create content that offers learning with a product tie-in. - The network is praised for adding informative value to its programming but criticized for the continued commercial slant. **Era 12: The Subscription On-Demand Experiment (2020)** - InfomercialTV introduces a streaming service offering access to their library of past infomercials, original programs, and exclusive web series. - The channel tries to lower its dependency on traditional infomercials but struggles to find the balance. - Subscriber numbers are lower than expected, but a niche community forms around the platform's unique content. **Era 13: Full-Fledged Entertainment Network (2021-present)** - InfomercialTV officially rebrands and shifts towards becoming a full entertainment network with comedies, dramas, and late-night talk shows, all with subtle product integration. - Infomercials now are primarily relegated to late-night slots and are more targeted and high-end. - The network successfully completes its transformation from a niche infomercial channel to a broader entertainment platform, with only a trace of its original purpose. Over the course of these 13 eras, InfomercialTV would have slowly shifted away from its original all-infomercial format, metamorphosing to adapt to changing viewer tastes and the ever-evolving media landscape. Network decay is often regarded as a negative development, but in this fictional case, it's nuanced, with the channel striving to balance commercial interests with the evolving entertainment demands of its audience."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic Walking Dead story about long-haired Carl Grimes relaxing in a pond in the buff.

With hair that cascaded down his shoulders, flowing like the streams of the surrounding wilderness, Carl thought to himself with a smirk, \\"If I'm gonna survive out here, might as well enjoy the little things… like a naked swim.\\" He settled his belongings by an old, gnarled tree – his hat, his weapon, and the weight of being his father's son – and then entered the cool water in his birthday suit. The pond hugged his body tenderly, cleansing away the grime and blood from days of battling the undead. Feeling the comforting embrace of isolation, Carl leaned back, floating effortlessly. \\"Ah, this is the life!\\" he announced to no one in particular. Then, with a mischievous glint in his eye, Carl felt a stirring in his belly, a pressure building like an ominous drumroll. He gave a conspiratorial glance around, though the only audience was a squirrel that chattered away disinterestedly. \\"Better out than in, as Shrek used to say,\\" Carl murmured with a chuckle. He lifted his legs, pointing his toes skyward like a mischievous merman, and with the grace of an orchestra conductor summoning the climax of a symphony, Carl let out a prodigious underwater fart. The sound of it was muffled by the pond, yet the bubbles rose like a tempest from the depths, bursting in a final crescendo upon the surface. Carl watched with a laugh as the water rippled, and he sighed in relief. \\"Man, I could’ve taken down the walls of Jericho with that one.\\" But then something peculiar happened. Fish, disturbed by the guttural underwater symphony, floated up belly-up around him, victims of the deadliest weapon of all – Carl's post-bean-supper butt trumpet. \\"Whoa, it's raining fish! Dad always said I'd find a way to provide,\\" he quipped to himself, shaking his head in bemusement. With the grim efficiency of a Grimes, Carl gathered the expired fish, his hunter-gatherer instincts kicking in. \\"Looks like fresh fish is back on the menu, boys...” He chuckled as he glanced around to ensure the coast was clear. \\"...even if it's slightly... marinated.\\" Starting a campfire was a child's play for the young survivor. With the crackling flames casting playful shadows, Carl roasted his unexpected catch on a spit. \\"What's the secret ingredient, Carl?\\" he imagined someone asking. \\"Oh, just a bit of natural seasoning from yours truly,\\" Carl mused with a sardonic smile, feeling both pride and disgust at his resourcefulness. \\"Survival of the smelliest, am I right?\\" As the night crept over the land and the stars blinked into existence above, Carl Grimes feasted on the fruits of his unique fishing method, content in knowing that even in this world of the walking dead, life found a way to be utterly, ridiculously, hilariously unpredictable. And somewhere in the distance, bemused by the absurdity of the world, Rick Grimes surely smiled, sensing his son had become a true survivor, one epic butt blast at a time."},{"instruction":"Écris-moi un court courriel pour un ami responsable de mon hébergement de site internet.

Therefore, while I'll include the requested elements of humor and follow the theme of a light-hearted tale, I will ensure the narrative is kept within the bounds of good taste. Carl's youthful antics will be portrayed in a more family-friendly perspective. Here's the tale: In a world overrun with walkers, where the scent of decay hovered like a somber cloud, even the ungroomed Carl Grimes had his standards. Bathing had taken on a new meaning – no more lavender bubble baths, but instead, a makeshift scrub-down in the local pond, surrounded by reeds and the occasional croak of a frog. And, hey, privacy was pretty easy to come by when most of the human population had turned into glorified eating machines. \\"Freedom!\\" Carl exclaimed to the empty air, his voice a little shaky from the shock of the chilly water as he waded into the pond, every bit the long-haired castaway in makeshift Eden. Of course, in the worn world of the walking dead, you took your freedoms where you could. Today's was a rare moment of solitude, free from walkers, Saviors, or the well-meaning tyranny of Rick's parenting. He leaned back, floating, and closed his eyes. The water lapped gently at his tangled hair, filled with the dust of the road and the grime of too many battles. For a moment, Carl imagined he was pre-apocalypse again, gearing up to complain about any chore on a glorious summer day. A moment of silence passed, the world holding its breath - and then, making a decision that younger Carl would've probably fist-bumped him for, he lifted a leg and let nature take its course. \\"Ahhh,\\" Carl sighed with exaggerated satisfaction, breaking the hush with a bubbly fanfare. \\"Gas – walkers can't hear it, fish can't smell it. Perfect crime.\\" To his bubbly amusement and mild horror, some fish, too curious for their own good, floated belly-up on the surface. He squinted. Was it possible? Had the apocalypse forged a super-fart? \\"Whoops. My bad, guys\\" Carl chuckled, shrugging his shoulders at the fish that had succumbed to his natural call. \\"Well, when life gives you dead fish...\\" With a casual efficiency born of years surviving the unimaginable, he waded over and scooped up the fish. \\"No catch of the day jokes, right? Dad would've... Ugh, dad jokes.\\" Shaking his head, Carl scaled and gutted his unintended catch, starting up a fire on the shore. The pond-side was soon alive with the sizzle of fish on flame, the smell infinitely better than the one that had heralded their catch. Carl hummed tunelessly, turning the skewered fish and peering into the woods. He was a Grimes, after all; even his farts were survivors. Carl snickered at the thought, hoping there wasn't some walker-salmon hybrid waiting in the depths, a new piscine adversary in this never-ending loop of the unexpected. He took a bite of his fish, perfectly cooked, and grinned. \\"Out here, you gotta make your own luck. Even if sometimes... it’s a little... fishy.\\" As the dusk settled, Carl finished his meal. He leaned back, staring at the stars peeking through the thick canopy of trees, the world for just a moment quiet and at peace, save for the distant moans of walkers. Another day survived in the Walking Dead, with a twilight serenade sent from the teen survivor himself—Carl Grimes, walker of the world and accidental fisherman extraordinary. \\"Nature provides, huh?\\" Carl mused aloud to nobody in particular, grinning at the absurdity of it all. \\"Guess I'll have to remember that one for the next survival guide. Chapter one: Never underestimate a well-timed fart.\\""},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic Walking Dead story about long-haired Carl Grimes standing waist-deep in a pond in the buff and washing himself clean.

On this peculiarly serene afternoon, the once-bustling forests had grown eerily silent, save for the occasional groans of the walking dead, providing Carl a rare moment of respite. Emboldened by the tranquillity, Carl, whose hair had grown voluminous enough to give '70s rockstars a run for their money, decided it was high time for a cleanse. \\"Dad's off doing his 'Ricktatorship' thing, and Judith is fort-watching. I guess a little skinny dipping wouldn't hurt anyone,\\" Carl mused to himself as he approached the pond, which, unlike the walkers, mirrored the untainted sky in its calmness. With a playful grin, he slipped out of his tattered rags of clothing, revealing battle scars that bore witness to his survivalist puberty. Standing waist-deep in the clear, lily-padded waters, he began scrubbing off what felt like ages of grimy adventure and regretted decisions. \\"Man, if only we had soap commercials in the apocalypse, I'd ace them,\\" Carl chuckled at his reflection, flipping his wet hair back dramatically like a post-apocalyptic Fabio. Amidst his self-amusement, a sudden pressure built up within him, a gassy rumble yearning for freedom. Grinning mischievously, Carl glanced around. Ancient trees stood as silent sentinels, not a walker in sight. With a shrug, he relaxed his muscles, and a monumental flatulence bubbled up from the depths. The pond's serene surface erupted in a cacophony of blooping and gurgling as bubbles raced to escape the epicenter of the stinkquake. \\"Ahh, that's the stuff,\\" Carl sighed in relief, until the ripples of his release reached the shore, and a few unfortunate fish floated belly-up, victims of an odiferous assault unlike any they had evolved to handle. \\"Oh, no no no...\\" Carl empathized with the fish, despite their current predicament serving his sudden realization. \\"Wait a second, supper's served!\\" With expert agility only life in the apocalypse could hone, Carl gathered the fish, his pangs of guilt overshadowed by a rumbling stomach. \\"Sorry guys, but a man's gotta eat. You had the water, I've got the fire,\\" he reasoned, picking twigs and brush to start a campfire. As the flames flickered to life after a few expertly executed strikes of flint, Carl skewered his ill-gotten gains and held them over the flames. \\"Cooking with Carl,\\" he announced dramatically to the non-existent audience, \\"today's surprise catch of the day: Eau de Toilette Trout, a la Apocalypse.\\" As the aroma of cooking fish began to mask the lingering traces of his flatulent faux pas, Carl leaned back, content with a day that had turned from routine to ludicrous. \\"You know, Dad always says we're the walking dead,\\" Carl mused out loud, \\"but I just made fish the floating dead, with nothing but my butt. Top that, Rick.\\" The stars began to twinkle overhead as the forest settled into a cozy, evening quiet. Carl feasted on his fish, a meal seasoned by the bizarre, and chuckled. Based on laughter alone, anyone passing by would never guess that the world around him was a walking nightmare, as Carl Grimes found joy, and dinner, in the oddest of places."},{"instruction":"Assassination Classroom: quem é Meg","output":"Em \\"Assassination Classroom\\" (Ansatsu Kyoushitsu), um mangá e anime escrito por Yūsei Matsui, a personagem Meg é conhecida pelo seu nome completo, Meg Kataoka.

Bequeathed with a mane that Thor might envy, his locks cascaded down to his shoulders—a curtain of unkempt rebellion against the world’s end. This fine day, our hirsute hero had stumbled upon a serene pond, a rare and tranquil respite from the relentless rot roaming outside its bubble of calm. Defiantly stripping himself of the muck-soaked remnants of civilization’s fabric, Carl stood gloriously unadorned, the sun kissing every inch of his soapless skin. Waist-deep in the cool embrace of the still water, Carl proceeded to scrub away days of grime and gore with a zest that could be branded solely as post-apocalyptic exfoliation. As he cleansed himself, a mischievous twinkle danced in his blue eyes—a sign he was not merely a battle-hardened survivor but a prankster at heart, even if the audience for his jests was unwittingly amphibious or finned. A bubble brewed within, the harbinger of impending aquatic rebellion. With his face contorting to a concert of concentration and comic relief, Carl seized the moment of solitude, allowing nature’s call to echo through the pond’s placid sanctuary. \\"Boom! Goes the dynamite,\\" he murmured with an impish grin, releasing a sonorous underwater fanfare. The pond's surface erupted in a symphony of bubbles, as if a jacuzzi setting was activated by the sheer force of Carl’s indigestion. The resident fish, once darting beneath the water like aquatic racers, now slowed, aghast at the olfactory siege unleashed upon their liquid homestead. It was a stench so potent, so unprecedentedly vile, that several of the scaled denizens succumbed to their pungent doom, floating up to the pond's surface in surrender. \\"A feast fit for a king,\\" Carl chuckled, his gleefulness bordering on maniacal as he plucked the deceased piscatorial prizes from their watery grave. Wrapping them in the remains of his shirt, he waded to the shore, a sardonic Neptune claiming victory over his tiny, gilled adversaries. \\"Food chain, baby. I'm at the top,\\" he declared, a grin split across his face, the wild locks around it making him look like a feral shampoo advertisement gone awry. In no time, Carl had kindled a fire, the tongues of flame eager to feast upon the fish as much as he was. He skewered his aromatic victims, the scent of cooking morsels battling the lingering miasma of his aquatic assault. \\"And to think, all I needed was some baked beans for bait,\\" he mused aloud, speaking his affirmation to a world stripped of supermarkets but brimming with unexpected gifts for those willing to... cut the cheese. As the fire cracked and popped, Carl Grimes, the long-haired piscator of the apocalypse, settled down to enjoy his meal, grateful for the strange bounty delivered by his own dubious gusts, and pondering whether this new 'fishing technique' could mark the evolution of survival itself."},{"instruction":"Describe nocturnal planet Miryath around evaporating black hole Tojrane in heat death universe Katharik, it has two large ice polar caps, it has large single ocean and large single continent.

As the black hole gradually evaporates, emitting a feeble and fading glow, Miryath finds itself succumbing to the inevitable fate of its cosmic environment. This unique nocturnal planet is characterized by two prominent ice polar caps, which stand as stark reminders of the planet's frigid nature. The rest of Miryath is dominated by a vast and solitary ocean, stretching from one end of the planet to the other. This massive body of water is complemented by a solitary continent that juts out from the heart of Miryath, a testament to the planet's geological unity. The once vibrant and diverse ecosystem of Miryath is now a fading echo of its former glory. The planet's radioactivity is in a perpetual decline, gradually decaying over time. This diminishing radioactivity has profound consequences for Miryath, as it leads to the transformation of the planet into a frozen ice world in the future. Slowly but surely, the frigid grip of ice and frost tightens around Miryath's surface, leaving little room for warmth and vitality. Amidst this frozen landscape, however, there exist pockets of life that have managed to adapt and thrive. Shadowy forests, their twisted branches reaching towards the inky sky, dot the barren expanse of ice. These enigmatic woodlands, bathed in perpetual twilight, are adorned with bioluminescent flowers that illuminate the darkness with ethereal hues. These extraordinary flora, with their soft and eerie glow, serve as beacons of life amidst the desolation. Inhabitants of Miryath, the hardy fauna that perseveres despite the encroaching cold, have adapted in extraordinary ways. These creatures, with their thick fur or insulating exoskeletons, brave the biting cold to traverse the icy tundra. They rely on their senses honed through millennia of evolution to navigate their dimly lit surroundings. The bioluminescent plants that adorn the shadow forests offer a source of sustenance and solace for these resilient animals, providing food and shelter in an otherwise hostile world. Miryath, like its neighboring celestial bodies, is but a fleeting existence in the vast canvas of the universe. As the heat death of Katharik approaches, and the black hole Tojrane wanes into oblivion, Miryath finds itself frozen in time and space. The planet's once teeming ecosystems now stand as a testament to the transient nature of life and the endless cycle of cosmic evolution."},{"instruction":"Какой российский самолет по классификации относится к дальним магистральным пассажирским самолетам?

The ISO file is simply a disk image that can be mounted as a virtual CD/DVD drive in VirtualBox, and it does not get \\"used up\\" or \\"locked\\" by a particular virtual machine. Here's how you can do it: 1. **Locate the ISO File**: Find the path to the ISO file on your host system. This is the file you previously used with your virtual machine. 2. **Create a New Virtual Machine**: - Open VirtualBox. - Click on \\"New\\" to create a new virtual machine. - Follow the prompts to set up the new VM, ensuring that you select the appropriate operating system and version that corresponds to the ISO file's contents. 3. **Mount the ISO to the New VM**: - Once the VM is created, before starting it, click on \\"Settings\\". - Under \\"Storage\\", click on the \\"Empty\\" CD/DVD symbol under the \\"Controller: IDE\\" (or SATA, depending on your setup). - On the right side, you'll see a CD/DVD symbol. Click on it and select \\"Choose a disk file…\\" - Navigate to the location of the ISO file, select it, and click \\"Open\\" to mount it. 4. **Start the New VM**: - Click \\"OK\\" to save the settings. - Start the new VM. If the ISO is bootable and the VM is set to boot from the virtual optical drive, the VM should boot from the ISO just like a physical machine would boot from a CD/DVD. Remember that multiple virtual machines can use the same ISO file simultaneously without issue. Also, ensure that your use of the operating system or software within the ISO adheres to the appropriate licensing agreements."},{"instruction":"in jira how can i add a user as a quick filter","output":"In Jira, quick filters are used to further filter the issues displayed on a board, based on a JQL (Jira Query Language) query. They don't directly link to users, but you can create a quick filter to show only issues that are relevant to a specific user—for example, issues assigned to them or issues they reported. Here's how you create a quick filter for a specific user: 1. **Access Board Configuration**: - Navigate to your Jira board (either Kanban or Scrum). - Click on the three dots (more options) in the top-right corner of the board and select \\"Board settings\\" from the dropdown menu. 2. **Create a New Quick Filter**: - In the board settings, go to the \\"Quick Filters\\" section. - Click on the \\"Add quick filter\\" button. - Give the quick filter a name, such as \\"Tasks for [Username]\\" or \\"[Username]'s Issues\\". 3. **Define the JQL for the Quick Filter**: - In the \\"JQL\\" input field, define the query that filters issues for the specific user. For instance, to see only issues assigned to a user with username \\"johndoe\\", you would use: \`\`\` assignee = johndoe \`\`\` - To see only issues reported by \\"johndoe\\", you would use: \`\`\` reporter = johndoe \`\`\` - You can refine this further based on other criteria such as status, project, labels, etc. 4. **Save the Quick Filter**: - Click on the \\"Add\\" or \\"Save\\" button at the bottom. The new quick filter will now appear on your board. After you've set up the quick filter, you can return to your board, and you'll see the new quick filter as an option near the top of the board. Clicking on the quick filter will refine the board to only show issues that match the defined JQL criteria for that user. Make sure that you use the exact username (or user ID, if Jira Cloud) of the user in your JQL. If you are unsure of the exact username, you can search for users in Jira's user management section or by using the user picker in the JQL search.

Utilisez \`utf8_encode()\` sur vos chaînes avant de les encoder en JSON si nécessaire. 6. **Inspectez la structure de données PHP**: Assurez-vous que la structure des données \`lesPlaylists\` corresponde à celle attendue par le code JavaScript. Par exemple, il semble que le JavaScript attende une propriété \`playlists\`, mais il n'est pas évident que \`lesPlaylists\` ait cette structure. 7. **Gérer les cas d'échec de \`json_encode()\`**: Il est possible que \`json_encode()\` retourne \`false\` si elle ne peut pas encodérer les données en JSON. Ajoutez un traitement d'erreur pour gérer ce cas. Si après toutes ces vérifications l'erreur persiste, vous pouvez ajouter des logs ou des alertes JavaScript pour afficher le contenu exact des données reçues avant qu'elles ne soient parsées, ce qui vous aidera à déterminer la nature exacte du caractère inattendu.

These are typically used to automate the computation of values based on various conditions and inputs, without the need for manual data entry or for creating complex business rules. Calculated fields can be created in various ways, such as by using: 1. **Formula fields**: Fields that use a formula to compute their value. For example, you could create a formula field on an incident form to calculate the number of days since the incident was reported. 2. **Business rules**: Server-side scripts that can perform calculations when a record is displayed, inserted, updated, or deleted. You can use business rules to calculate and set the value of a field. 3. **Client Scripts**: Client-side scripts that can calculate and modify the value of a field based on user interactions before the form is submitted or when the form loads. 4. **Script includes**: Reusable server-side scripts that can be called from business rules or client scripts to perform calculations. 5. **Workflow scripts**: Scripts that are part of automated workflows and can set or calculate field values based on workflow activities. Here's a simple example of creating a calculated field using a business rule in ServiceNow: 1. Navigate to \\"System Definition > Business Rules.\\" 2. Click \\"New\\" to create a new business rule. 3. Enter a name for the business rule and select the table for which you want the rule to run (e.g., Incident). 4. In the 'Advanced' tab, check the 'Advanced' box to enable scripting. 5. Under \\"When to run,\\" set the conditions for when the calculation should occur—on insert, update, display, etc. 6. In the \\"Script\\" section, add your JavaScript code to perform the calculation. For example: \`\`\`javascript (function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) { // Calculate days since incident was reported var openedAt = current.opened_at.getGlideObject(); var now = new GlideDateTime(); // Get the duration in days var duration = GlideDateTime.subtract(now, openedAt).getDays(); // Set the calculated duration in a custom field current.u_days_since_reported = duration; })(current, previous); \`\`\` 7. Click \\"Insert\\" to save and activate the business rule. As you create calculated fields, it’s crucial to thoroughly test the business logic to ensure that it performs as expected and does not negatively impact performance. After saving your changes, it's also a good practice to verify that the calculated fields work as intended by creating or updating records and observing the results."},{"instruction":"how notification can be triggered","output":"In ServiceNow, notifications are often used to send emails, SMS messages, or other types of messages to users under certain conditions, such as when an incident is updated or a change request is approved. Notifications can be triggered in multiple ways: 1. **Business Rules**: Create a business rule to send a notification when a record is inserted, updated, or deleted, or when a specific field changes. You define conditions, and when they are met, the business rule can trigger a notification using the \`gs.eventQueue\` method. \`\`\`javascript gs.eventQueue(\\"event.name\\", current, current.fieldname, previous.fieldname); \`\`\` Here, \\"event.name\\" is the name of the event you want to trigger, which is defined in the Event Registry. 2. **Workflow/Flow Designer**: If you use the Workflow Editor or Flow Designer, you can add a Notification activity within your workflows or flows. This allows more visual control of when a notification needs to be sent based on the flow logic. 3. **Events**: ServiceNow uses an Event-driven architecture wherein the Event Registry keeps a list of events that can be called by different parts of the platform such as business rules, workflows, or scripts. When an event is fired, a Notification record (typically an email template) can be set to listen for that event and send a message when it occurs. 4. **Alerts and Notifications Module**: Use the Alerts and Notifications module to configure conditions that trigger notifications directly. This way, you can define Notification records that subscribe to certain events and specify recipients, message templates, what to include in the message, and more. 5. **Scheduled Jobs**: Create a scheduled job to send out notifications at specific time intervals or at a specific time. The script in a scheduled job can also use the \`gs.eventQueue\` method or the \`SNJS\` email API to send notifications. 6. **Client Scripts**: For client-side actions, you can use client scripts to trigger notifications through AJAX to call server-side code that dispatches the notification. However, it is not common practice to send notifications from the client side due to possible security implications and the potential for unnecessary load on the server. For all triggers, you will first need to configure a notification. Here is how to do it: 1. Go to \\"System Notification > Emails > Notifications\\" from the main navigation filter. 2. Click \\"New\\" or open an existing notification record to modify. 3. Set the conditions when there needs to be a notification. 4. Fill in details such as the event, recipient, subject line, message body (which can be HTML or plain text), and which data fields from the triggering record to include. 5. Save the notification. Always test your notifications to make sure they are triggered as expected and the right recipients get the proper information. Proper testing and validation ensure you automate communication effectively within the platform without flooding recipients with unnecessary messages."},{"instruction":"how to background script not name came","output":"If you are referring to running a background script in ServiceNow without seeing the script's name, this might be a misunderstanding, as the terminology used is not clear. However, I can provide you with information on how to run a background script in ServiceNow. ServiceNow provides an administrative application called \\"Scripts - Background\\" that allows administrators or users with the appropriate roles to run arbitrary JavaScript code in the background. This is often used for data manipulation, quick debugging, or executing server-side code without creating a full application or business rule. Here's how to use it: 1. **Accessing Scripts - Background**: - Log in to your ServiceNow instance. - In the Application Navigator (left sidebar), type \\"Scripts - Background\\" in the filter/search box. - Click on \\"System Definition > Scripts - Background\\" to open the background script execution page. 2. **Running a Script**: - Once on the Scripts - Background page, you will be presented with a script window where you can type or paste your JavaScript code. - Write your script according to what you want to achieve. 3. **Executing the Script**: - Click the \\"Run script\\" button at the bottom of the page to execute the script. - The script will run synchronously, and any output or logs generated by the script will appear in the \\"Output\\" section below the script window. Please be cautious when running scripts in production environments, as scripts can modify or delete data and possibly affect system performance. Always test your scripts in a non-production instance before running them in production. Regarding the \\"name\\" part of your question, if you are looking for a way to save a background script with a specific name or to locate the name of a previously run background script, be aware that Scripts - Background does not save the scripts or their results after execution, and there is no history or tracking for this in the base system. If you need to keep a script for future use, you should manually copy it and save it elsewhere, for example in a document, a knowledge article, or a source control system. If you want to automate the running of a script without needing to paste it into Scripts - Background each time, consider creating a Scheduled Script Execution (Scheduled Job) instead, where you can name the job and keep it for recurring use."},{"instruction":"Describe continental planet Miryath around evaporating black hole Tojrane in heat death universe Katharik, it has two large ice polar caps, it has large single ocean and large single supercontinent.

This landmass stretches across the planet, offering breathtaking landscapes and serving as a home to a multitude of terrestrial species. The supercontinent provides a sense of unity and coherence to the planet's landmass. However, Miryath's future is uncertain. The planet is gradually descending towards a frozen state as a result of diminishing planetary radioactivity. The decaying radioactivity is causing a decrease in the overall thermal energy of the planet, potentially transforming Miryath into an icy, frozen landscape in the distant future. Amidst these changing conditions, Miryath boasts unique and mesmerizing shadow forests. These forests are characterized by towering trees that cast enchanting shadows, creating an almost otherworldly ambience. Adding to their ethereal charm, the shadow forests are adorned with twilight bioluminescent flowers. These flowers emit a soft glow during the planetary twilight, painting the landscape with a mystical luminescence. These awe-inspiring natural wonders provide a habitat for a diverse array of animal species. Miryath's animal kingdom has adapted to the planet's environment, with some species displaying specialized traits to survive in the changing conditions. From elusive creatures that thrive in the shadowy realms of the forests to marine life perfectly adapted to the depths of the planet's single ocean, Miryath's animal kingdom reflects the resilience and adaptability of life. In conclusion, Miryath is a continental planet situated near the evaporating black hole Tojrane in the heat death universe of Katharik. Its distinct features, including large polar caps, a single expansive ocean, a mighty supercontinent, and the enigmatic shadow forests adorned with twilight bioluminescent flowers, make it an intriguing destination for exploration and study.

L’accelerata crescita del mercato ha introdotto nuovi giocatori, ampliando l’offerta e intensificando la battaglia per la visibilità e la quota di mercato. Di fronte a questa rapida evoluzione, le aziende devono affrontare I 3 Ostacoli Principali 1. Differenziazione nel Mercato: La crescente saturazione del mercato fotovoltaico implica una maggiore difficoltà nel distinguersi per i produttori e gli installatori. Offrire prodotti o servizi di qualità non è più sufficiente; le aziende devono comunicare efficacemente la propria unicità e il valore aggiunto che offrono ai clienti. Il marketing strutturato entra in gioco qui come una soluzione potente, consentendo alle aziende di mascherare la propria pubblicità in contenuti informativi che risuonano con gli specifici bisogni e desideri del loro target di riferimento, aumentando la rilevanza della comunicazione e coltivando un legame profondo con i potenziali clienti. 2. Costruzione di una Proposta di Valore Convincente: Il consumatore di energia solare moderno è informato e esigente. Creare e comunicare una proposta di valore convincente che evidenzi i benefici a lungo termine degli impianti fotovoltaici è essenziale per convertire l’interesse in vendite. Le tecniche del marketing strutturato aiutano a definire messaggi personalizzati che coprono diversi motivi di acquisto, collegando ogni gruppo di clienti all’offerta giusta al momento giusto, massimizzando così il tasso di conversione. 3. Acquisizione e Fidelizzazione di Nuovi Clienti: Occorre una strategia digitale dinamica che non si limiti a generare lead, ma che investa nella creazione di relazioni durature. Al centro del marketing strutturato vi è l’elaborazione di funnel digitali e campagne di content marketing che non solo attraggono ma anche educano e fidelizzano, trasformando i clienti in ambasciatori del marchio. La digitalizzazione non è un’opzione ma una necessità vitale. Il marketing strutturato offre alle aziende del settore fotovoltaico gli strumenti necessari per raggiungere nuovi clienti in modo più efficiente, posizionarsi come leader di pensiero e sfruttare l’eccezionale potenziale di crescita del mercato. Le aziende che adottano e affinano queste strategie innovative saranno quelle che si elevano al di sopra del rumore, catturano una porzione maggiore del mercato e guidano l’ondata di sostenibilità nel nostro mondo energetico.

Try to change your stories up so your audience keeps an incentive to follow you on your stories. - Always at least 1 “Call to Action” Facebook story a day (eg. mission post format, launch offer format etc). - It’s about creating “top of mind awareness” by consistently posting on your Facebook stories.. not about perfection. Typically, we recommend using Instagram to create your Facebook stories and then to upload it on your Facebook story. Facebook / IG Story Strategy - The Golden Rule: 3% of your audience is ALWAYS ready to buy from you..The bigger your audience gets, the closer you will get to this ratio. This is why we have to have at least 1 “direct offer / call to action” post a day to tap into this.. or we would leave a lot of money on the table.. - Hot Leads: Reach out to people who reply to your “Call to Action '' posts. These leads have priority and are hot.. They raise their hand that they’re interested in what you do.. You can instantly send a message to propose a call for these leads. - Traffic: The first story you post is like a “thumbnail” for your friends and audience. You want to make sure people click on it to watch the rest of your stories. Typically, fitness photos or photos of your pets or your face drive a lot of traffic instantly. - Order: After the first photo it’s best to place a “social proof” type of story such as client testimonials, your own results, your own transformation etc or just directly a call to action. The longer you wait with these types of stories.. the more likely that people will “fall off” and won’t see them. Call to Action Examples That Convert: 1. Poll: Send a message to propose a meeting with anyone who votes yes. NOTE: when posting a poll don’t save it first but post it directly or the poll itself won’t work. 2. Offer post: explaining your offer or what you do and why / what problem it will help / solve for people. 3. Mission post or launch post. Other Facebook / IG Story Examples to reach “5”: 1) Client results. 2) Story post / milestone post. 3) Screenshots of your FB post. 4) Anything that gives off “the energy” of your market. In poll, Q&A, value post or video format. 5) Personal life. - Client or Own Results Example (use “Stickers” for this). - Story / Inspirational Post - Poll - Screenshots of your FB post (especially 2-week promo cycle posts like launch posts etc). - Ask a question - Routine / Work Station / Work Flow - Value post / Value video Pre-Editing Facebook / IG stories: 1) Video: - The 1 minute rule: Facebook / IG Story Videos have to be 1 minute long or else the other parts will be cut out. - Shorten clips: You can make your videos shorter by cutting the first or last pieces out of it (Iphone: photo’s > right-top click on editing > move the side bars of the video below). - Screen record: You can screen record your phone if you want to go through testimonials or show your website etc. 2) Photo: - Pre-Editing: When uploading testimonials, your own results, client results, screenshots etc.. edit the outer pieces out so viewers don’t get distracted by other things. - Resize & “Stickers”: Resize your screenshots to make it look good when creating the story. Use stickers to add multiple photos or screenshots in your story. - Text: When creating a story, you can make the text bold or any color. Uploading Facebook / IG stories: - “Save story”: Save your story at the top. It will be added to your photos. When you go back to Facebook and click on “add story”, you can upload the saved story in your photos. \\" ora adattami questa strategia per uno store di abbigliamento in base alla strategia proposta per massimizzare i risultati tramite instagram","output":"Per massimizzare i risultati tramite Instagram per uno store di abbigliamento, segui questa strategia adattata basata sui principi e le tecniche fornite: Principi: - Pubblica 5 storie al giorno su Instagram. Assicurati di variare i contenuti per mantenere alto l'interesse del pubblico. - Includi sempre almeno una \\"Call to Action\\" ogni giorno, come promozioni, nuovi arrivi o storie che invitano a visitare il sito web o a lasciare un feedback. - Crea consapevolezza e presenza costante nella mente dei tuoi follower senza ricercare la perfezione. L'importante è essere sempre visibili e interattivi. Strategia per Storie Instagram/Facebook: - Regola d'Oro: Il 3% del tuo pubblico è sempre pronto all'acquisto. Quanto più crescono i tuoi follower, tanto più ti avvicinerai a questo rapporto. Ecco perché è fondamentale avere almeno un post di offerta diretta / call to action al giorno, per non perdere queste opportunità di vendita. - Lead Caldi: Contatta immediatamente le persone che rispondono ai tuoi post di \\"Call to Action\\". Questi sono lead prioritari a cui proporre subito una chiamata o un messaggio diretto. - Traffico: La prima storia che pubblichi funge da \\"anteprima\\" per i tuoi amici e il tuo pubblico. Vuoi che sia accattivante per far sì che le persone clicchino e guardino il resto delle tue storie. Foto di outfit, new in store, o dietro le quinte possono attirare subito l'attenzione. - Ordine delle Storie: Dopo la prima foto, è utile posizionare una storia di \\"prova sociale\\" come testimonianze dei clienti, risultati ottenuti, trasformazioni prima e dopo, oppure direttamente una call to action. Non aspettare troppo a mostrare questi contenuti, altrimenti la gente potrebbe perdere l'interesse. Esempi di Call to Action che Convertano: 1. Sondaggio: Invia un messaggio per proporre un appuntamento in negozio a chiunque voti \\"sì\\". Nota: quando pubblichi un sondaggio, fallo direttamente senza salvarlo prima per assicurare che funzioni. 2. Post d'Offerta: Spiega le promozioni o le novità e perché / come queste possono risolvere un \\"problema\\" o soddisfare un desiderio del cliente. 3. Post di Missione o Lancio di un Nuovo Prodotto. Altri Esempi di Storie Instagram/Facebook per raggiungere \\"5\\": 1) Risultati dei clienti. 2) Post narrativo o di traguardo. 3) Screenshot dei tuoi post su Facebook. 4) Contenuti che trasmettano \\"l'energia\\" del tuo mercato, in formato sondaggio, Q&A, post di valore o video. 5) Vita personale del team dello store. - Risultati dei clienti o propri esempi (usa \\"Stickers\\" per questo). - Post ispirazionale/storia. - Sondaggio. - Screenshot dei tuoi post su Facebook (specialmente post promozionali bimensili come post di lancio, etc.). - Fai una domanda. - Routine / Postazione di lavoro / Flusso di lavoro. - Post di valore / Video di valore. Pre-Editing delle Storie Instagram/Facebook: 1) Video: - Regola del minuto: I video delle storie su Facebook/IG devono durare un massimo di un minuto per essere visualizzati integralmente. - Accorcia i clip: Puoi rendere il tuo video più breve tagliando l'inizio o la fine (su iPhone: vai in foto, clicca su modifica nell'angolo in alto a destra e sposta le barre sui lati del video). - Registrazione schermo: Puoi registrare lo schermo del tuo telefono se vuoi mostrare testimonianze di clienti soddisfatti o fare un tour del tuo sito web. 2) Foto: - Pre-Editing: Quando carichi testimonianze, risultati, screenshot, ecc., edita gli elementi esterni per evitare di distrarre gli spettatori. - Ridimensiona & \\"Stickers\\": Adatta le dimensioni dei tuoi screenshot per le storie e usa gli stickers per aggiungere più foto o screenshot in una storia. - Testo: Quando crei una storia, puoi rendere il testo grassetto o di qualsiasi colore. Caricamento delle Storie su Instagram/Facebook: - \\"Salva storia\\": Salva la tua storia in alto. Verrà aggiunta alle tue foto. Quando torni su Facebook e clicchi su \\"Aggiungi alla storia\\", puoi caricare la storia salvata dalle tue foto. Ricordati che per uno store di abbigliamento, rendere i prodotti desiderabili e creare uno storytelling coinvolgente sono fattori-chiave per attrarre e convertire i follower in clienti."},{"instruction":"nella sezione altri esempi puoi personalizzare più nello specifico e adattarlo a uno store di abbigliamento","output":"Certamente, qui di seguito una personalizzazione più specifica per uno store di abbigliamento: Altri Esempi di Storie Instagram/Facebook per raggiungere \\"5\\": 1) **Risultati dei clienti**: - Mostra clienti reali che indossano i tuoi capi di abbigliamento e sembrano felici e confidenti. Questo può includere foto o video inviati dai clienti o rilasciati durante eventi in-store. 2) **Post narrativo o di traguardo**: - Condividi la storia del tuo brand, momenti significativi, anniversari dello store o il raggiungimento di un obiettivo speciale, come l'apertura di un nuovo punto vendita o il lancio di una nuova linea. 3) **Screenshot dei tuoi post su Facebook**: - Cattura dei post su Facebook che mostrano prodotti popolari, offerte speciali o eventi a tempo limitato e ripubblicali nelle storie per aumentare l'esposizione. 4) **\\"Energia\\" del tuo mercato**: - Pubblica storie che riflettono le ultime tendenze di moda, tutorial su come abbinare capi, o post di valore che offrono consigli di stile per diverse occasioni. - Utilizza il formato poll, Q&A, o video per coinvolgere l'audience su temi come preferenze di stile, feedback su collezioni imminenti o domande di fashion advice. 5) **Vita personale del team dello store**: - Offri uno sguardo dietro le quinte mostrando il team in azione: l'allestimento delle vetrine, il processo di selezione dei capi, l'organizzazione di un photoshoot ecc. - Condividi occasionalmente momenti personali del team per umanizzare il brand e creare un legame con la community. Questi sono solo alcuni esempi su come utilizzare in modo creativo e strategico le Instagram/Facebook Stories per un negozio di abbigliamento. L'obiettivo è mantenere l'attenzione alta e stimolare l'interazione con il tuo pubblico, offrendo allo stesso tempo contenuti che presentino i tuoi prodotti in maniera attraente e vogliano incitare all'acquisto."},{"instruction":"riguardo al punto 2 è un piccolo store streetwear puoi personalizzare il tutto seguendo questo pattern","output":"Certo, riflettendo sul pattern di uno store streetwear, adattiamo il punto 2 per sottolineare l'estetica e i valori di questa nicchia di moda: 2) **Post narrativo o di traguardo per uno store streetwear**: - **La Storia del Brand:** Condividi la visione e la missione del tuo streetwear brand, racconta di come tutto è iniziato: dall'idea iniziale alla realizzazione dei primi design, fino al lancio degli ultimi modelli. - **Cultura e Community:** Parla della cultura streetwear e come il tuo negozio contribuisce ad essa. Puoi anche mostrare come la tua community di clienti indossa e personalizza i tuoi capi nello street style quotidiano. - **Collaborazioni Creative:** Se hai collaborato con artisti locali, designer o altri brand, mostra il processo creativo dietro queste collab, dagli schizzi iniziali agli eventi di lancio. - **Traguardi del Negozio:** Celebra i traguardi chiave come i milestone di vendita, l'anniversario dello store, o il feedback positivo ricevuto da influencer e personalità del settore. - **Evoluzione e Trend:** Presenta come ti mantieni aggiornato con i trend attuali dello streetwear, rivelando anticipazioni o facendo sondaggi sulle prossime release e collezioni. - **Stile di Strada Ispirato:** Usa le storie per mostrare lookbook o outfit del giorno che riflettono lo stile e l'atteggiamento streetwear, dimostrando come i pezzi possono essere combinati per creare look unici. - **Evento In Store:** Se ti appresti a ospitare un evento esclusivo, un drop di prodotti limitati o una vendita flash, usa le storie per creare hype e invitare le persone a partecipare. Ricordati di presentare questi contenuti in maniera autentica e visivamente accattivante, coerentemente con l'immagine del tuo brand e la cultura streetwear. Usa le storie per raccontare visualmente la tua narrativa, integrando testi, stickers e collegamenti che incoraggiano il tuo pubblico a interagire e a rimanere connesso con lo store."},{"instruction":"contestualizzami la parte sul traffico","output":"Nel contesto di un piccolo store streetwear, generare traffico verso le tue storie di Instagram è cruciale per coinvolgere il tuo pubblico e incitarlo all'azione. Concentriamoci sulle strategie per la prima storia che pubblichi, che come detto precedentemente, funge da \\"anteprima\\" o \\"thumbnail\\" per il resto delle tue storie: **Traffico per il Primo Post su Storie Instagram/Facebook:** - **Innesco Visivo:** La prima storia deve avere un impatto visivo immediato per attirare l'attenzione dei tuoi follower. Opta per un'immagine forte che rispecchia lo stile e l'atteggiamento del tuo brand streetwear, che potrebbe essere una foto high-contrast di un nuovo arrivo, un pezzo streetwear in edizione limitata, o una scena accattivante dalla vita nello street. - **Tease di Nuovi Arrivi:** Crea anticipazione mostrando pezzi di abbigliamento parzialmente velati o dettagli intriganti che spingano gli utenti a scorrere per saperne di più. Questo può funzionare benissimo per lanci imminenti o nuove collezioni. - **Umanizzazione del Brand:** Puoi anche scegliere di mostrare un membro del team o un influencer locale che indossa il prodotto in un ambiente urbano o all'interno dello store, rendendo lo scatto ancora più personale e relatabile. - **Ganci Creativi:** Le didascalie accattivanti o le domande provocatorie possono aumentare il click-through rate considerabilmente. Ad esempio, \\"Indovina quale celebrità è stata vista con il nostro ultimo drop\\" o \\"Questo capo è stato ristampato per la quinta volta, devi scoprire perché!\\" - **Selfie con Stile:** Uno scatto rapido del proprietario o di un dipendente che indossa con orgoglio un cappellino o una t-shirt esclusiva dello streetwear store può aggiungere quel tocco personale che attira gli spettatori. - **Collegamenti Interattivi:** Aggiungi sticker di sondaggio o di domande alle storie per incoraggiare il pubblico a interagire. Questi possono chiedere opinioni su outfit potenziali o proposte su quali prodotti voler vedere di più, spingendo efficacemente gli utenti a rimanere attivi e coinvolti. Ricorda di mantenere la coerenza stilistica e visiva delle tue immagini, assicurandoti che riflettano l'estetica streetwear del tuo brand.

Oggi esploreremo le strategie fondamentali per acquisire i primi 1000 clienti. Prima di entrare nei dettagli, permettetemi di presentarmi. Sono Dario Vignali, il fondatore di Marketers, una Digital Company che si occupa di creare e accelerare business digitali. Nel corso degli ultimi 7 anni, abbiamo lanciato diversi progetti, alcuni dei quali hanno avuto un grande successo, fatturando anche più di un milione di euro. La nostra metodologia si basa sul bootstrapping, quindi evitiamo di prendere finanziamenti esterni e ci autofinanziamo. Questo ci ha permesso di imparare molte lezioni nel tempo. Durante il nostro percorso, ho imparato da imprenditori di successo come Kevin Kelly e Paul Graham, che hanno condiviso preziose lezioni attraverso i loro scritti e il loro lavoro. Kevin Kelly ha introdotto il concetto dei \\"mille fan\\", sottolineando che per avere successo sul mercato, è fondamentale avere un gruppo di fan devoti che credono nel nostro prodotto o idea. Anche solo 1000 clienti che spendono €100 l'anno possono generare un fatturato significativo. Questo concetto è particolarmente rilevante per le startup e i prodotti a costo marginale zero, come i software. Paul Graham, fondatore di Y Combinator, ha sottolineato l'importanza di fare cose che non scalano. Concentrandosi sull'interazione personale e sull'attenzione ai dettagli, è possibile ottenere risultati significativi, specialmente nelle prime fasi di un business. Passando alle strategie pratiche per acquisire i primi 1000 clienti, ecco le sette più efficaci: Raggiungere amici e colleghi: All'inizio, quando non si ha ancora un budget pubblicitario, è importante condividere il proprio prodotto con amici e parenti per raccogliere feedback e validare l'idea. Raggiungere persone specifiche: È cruciale identificare e contattare direttamente potenziali clienti che corrispondono al proprio target. Questo può essere fatto attraverso messaggi personalizzati, e-mail o chiamate a freddo. Utilizzare influencer: Collaborare con influencer o persone influenti nel proprio settore può essere un modo efficace per raggiungere nuovi clienti. Piattaforme come Cameo hanno utilizzato questa strategia con successo. Sfruttare le Community: Partecipare attivamente alle comunità online o offline dove si trovano i propri potenziali clienti può essere un modo per creare fiducia e interesse intorno al proprio marchio. Netflix e Etsy hanno adottato questa strategia con successo. Eventi e fiere: Partecipare a eventi, conferenze o fiere del settore può essere un'opportunità per mettersi in contatto direttamente con potenziali clienti e promuovere il proprio prodotto o servizio. Partnership strategiche: Collaborare con altre aziende o marchi complementari può aiutare a espandere la propria base di clienti. Questo può includere partnership di co-marketing o integrare i propri prodotti con altri servizi. Offrire incentivi: Creare offerte speciali o programmi di referral può incentivare i clienti esistenti a raccomandare il proprio prodotto ad altri, aiutando così a espandere la propria base di clienti. In conclusione, acquisire i primi 1000 clienti richiede un approccio strategico e creativo. È importante testare diverse tattiche e adattarsi in base ai feedback ricevuti. Concentrarsi sull'interazione personale, sfruttare le reti esistenti e costruire fiducia sono elementi chiave per il successo iniziale di un business. Il video presenta diverse strategie efficaci per la crescita di una startup o di un prodotto, analizzando casi di successo di aziende famose come WhatsApp, Pinterest, Spotify, Duolingo, Patreon, Calm e Tinder. Di seguito sono riportati i punti chiave trattati nel video: WhatsApp: Il fondatore ha utilizzato strategie creative, contattando comunità specifiche e organizzando eventi offline per promuovere l'applicazione. Pinterest: Il fondatore ha utilizzato gli Apple Store per promuovere il sito, impostando la home page su Pinterest sui dispositivi in esposizione. Influencer Marketing: È una delle migliori strategie per acquisire clienti e utenti. Si consiglia di scegliere influencer specifici e di settore con un pubblico affezionato e un buon engagement. Stampa e Media: Le campagne PR e la visibilità sui media sono fondamentali per aumentare la percezione di qualità e autorevolezza del prodotto o dell'azienda. Contenuti Virali: Creare contenuti virali può portare a una rapida diffusione del prodotto. Casi come Duolingo e Patreon ne sono esempi. Strategie Creative: Utilizzare tattiche insolite come il sito \\"Do Nothing for 2 Minutes\\" per promuovere l'app Calm e raccogliere indirizzi email. Offline Marketing: Anche se molti business si concentrano sull'online, l'offline può essere altrettanto efficace. Tinder ha utilizzato volantini cartacei per promuovere l'app all'interno delle università. Risorse Utili: Il video offre anche suggerimenti su risorse utili come la newsletter di Leni, il blog di Paul Graham e il corso \\"Business Genetics\\" per imparare strategie di crescita aziendale. Il video sottolinea l'importanza della creatività e della diversificazione nelle strategie di marketing, incoraggiando gli imprenditori a pensare al di fuori degli schemi convenzionali. Offre esempi tangibili di come queste strategie siano state applicate con successo da aziende di successo. Concludendo, il video fornisce risorse aggiuntive per approfondire le strategie discusse e invita gli spettatori a condividere e interagire con il contenuto per sostenere il canale.\\"","output":"Analizzando il testo fornito e riflettendo su quale tipo di software creare o ottimizzare per il mercato italiano, tenendo a mente la soglia di 100€ l'anno come modello di business e l'obiettivo di raggiungere 1000 clienti, l'intuizione mi guida verso le seguenti considerazioni, segmenti di mercato e proposte di software: 1. **Software di Automazione Marketing:** Il marketing digitale è un settore in continua crescita e trasformazione in Italia, come nel resto del mondo. Un software di automazione marketing che semplifichi la gestione delle campagne, l'analisi delle performance e l'engagement con i clienti potrebbe offrire un valore tangibile a piccole e medie imprese che cercano di ottimizzare il loro investimento in marketing. 2. **Strumento di Gestione Progetti e Task per PMI e Freelancer:** Considerando l'aumento del lavoro remoto e del freelance, un software user-friendly che aiuti nella gestione dei progetti e nell'organizzazione delle attività quotidiane potrebbe essere una risorsa preziosa per imprenditori e liberi professionisti che cercano di migliorare la propria produttività. 3. **Piattaforma di E-Commerce Integrata:** Con il boom dell'e-commerce, specie dopo le restrizioni legate alla pandemia, sviluppare un software che offra ai piccoli commercianti soluzioni semplici per configurare un negozio online integrato con social media e marketplace potrebbe soddisfare un'esigenza crescente nel mercato nazionale. 4. **Applicazione Finanziaria per la Gestione del Flusso di Cassa:** Un software che semplifichi la gestione finanziaria, offrendo strumenti di previsione del flusso di cassa, monitoraggio delle spese e integrazione con sistemi di fatturazione potrebbe attrarre un'ampia base di piccoli imprenditori che non hanno accesso a reparti finanziari interni. 5. **Sistema CRM Personalizzato per le Piccole Imprese:** Un CRM focalizzato sulle piccole imprese italiane, che coniughi facilità di utilizzo con un'interfaccia in lingua italiana e supporto localizzato, potrebbe differenziarsi su un mercato spesso dominato da giganti internazionali. Per ottenere risultati significativi nelle vendite iniziali, dovresti orientare le strategie basate sui consigli di Kevin Kelly e Paul Graham verso una comprensione profonda delle peculiarità del mercato italiano. Dovrai fare cose che non scalano nella fase iniziale, come l'interazione diretta con i primi clienti, per fidelizzarli e convertirli in evangelisti del tuo software. Potresti anche sfruttare le comunità locali, influencer specifici di settore e altri canali organici come eventi e fiere del settore IT per farti conoscere. Inoltre, offrire incentivi come piani referral o versioni trial gratuite può essere un'ottima tattica per accelerare l'adozione del software nelle prime fasi di lancio. In conclusione, selezionare una nicchia specifica basata sulla tua comprensione del mercato, il background tecnico e la capacità di fornire un supporto clienti eccezionale sarà fondamentale per raggiungere e mantenere 1000 clienti attivi che portino al successo del tuo software nel mercato italiano."},{"instruction":"prova a fornirmi altre soluzioni in altri mercati","output":"Analizzando il contesto italiano e considerando le strategie per acquisire i primi 1000 clienti, ecco alcune idee di software su cui potresti concentrarti, rivolte a mercati e settori diversi: 1. **Software per la Gestione di Strutture Ricettive:** In un paese dove il turismo gioca un ruolo cruciale nell'economia, un software di gestione per piccoli hotel, B&B e agriturismi che integri prenotazioni, gestione delle stanze, servizi ai clienti e marketing potrebbe avere un impatto significativo, facilitando la digitalizzazione di queste attività. 2. **Piattaforma per la Formazione a Distanza:** L'educazione e la formazione professionale sono in continua evoluzione, con una crescente richiesta di soluzioni online. Un software che faciliti la creazione, gestione e distribuzione di corsi e-learning potrebbe essere la chiave per istituti educativi, aziende e professionisti. 3. **Strumenti per il Supporto della Produzione Agricola:** L'Italia ha una forte tradizione nell'agricoltura, e molti produttori potrebbero beneficiare di un software che aiuti nell'analisi dei dati di produzione, nella gestione sostenibile delle risorse e nel tracciamento della filiera. 4. **App di Salute e Benessere Personalizzata:** Il settore wellness è in espansione, un'app o un software che tracci attività fisica, nutrizione e benessere mentale, magari con integrazione dei wearable e servizi di consulenza, potrebbe essere particolarmente desiderabile per il consumatore attento alla salute. 5. **Soluzione per le Pubbliche Amministrazioni:** Ci potrebbe essere spazio per un software che aiuti le amministrazioni locali a digitalizzare e semplificare alcuni servizi per i cittadini, come la prenotazione di appuntamenti, la gestione delle segnalazioni o l'automazione di processi burocratici. Per implementare e vendere il software in questi settori: - **Trova un Angolo Unico:** Cerca un angolo non così ovvio o una nicchia dentro questi settori che potrebbe non essere stata saturata. - **Adatto alle Esigenze Locali:** Personalizza il software per adattarlo alle specifiche regole, normative e preferenze culturali italiane. - **Crea Caso d'Uso Convincibile:** Sviluppa storie di successo iniziali che dimostrino chiaramente i benefici del software rispetto alle soluzioni tradizionali o altre digitali. - **Partnership Strategiche:** Considera partnership con organizzazioni locali come camere di commercio, associazioni di categoria o enti di formazione. In ciascuno di questi ambiti l'approccio richiederà sia attività di marketing convenzionali, sia azioni dirette e personalizzate consigliate da Paul Graham per creare una base di fan devoti, come menzionato da Kevin Kelly, fondamentale per stabilizzare un flusso di reddito annuale da un software nel mercato italiano."},{"instruction":"in base a questa descrizione \\"Ciao a tutti ragazzi, piacere Nicola.

Prove that any open set in X contains a point in A.","output":"To prove that any open set in a topological space X contains a point in A, given that A is dense in X, we need to leverage the definition of denseness and the properties of open sets. A subset A of a topological space X is dense in X if the closure of A is X itself. This means that every point in X is either a point in A or a limit point of A. A limit point of A is a point where every open neighborhood of it intersects A at some point other than the limit point itself. Now, let's consider any open set U in X. We want to show that U contains at least one point of A. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that U contains no points of A. If U is empty, then the statement is vacuously true as an empty set contains no points at all. So assume U is non-empty. If U contains no points of A, then U does not intersect A. But this means that U lies entirely outside of the closure of A. Because A is dense in X, by definition, the closure of A is X itself, so every non-empty open set of X must intersect A. The assumption that U contains no points of A leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we conclude that every non-empty open set U in X must contain at least one point of A, proving the assertion that any open set in X contains a point in A. This is consistent with the definition of a dense subset."},{"instruction":"In topological spaces, what is the notion of continuity at a point?","output":"In topology, the notion of continuity at a point is based on how open sets are mapped between two topological spaces. Let ( f: X rightarrow Y ) be a function between two topological spaces ( X ) and ( Y ), and let ( x_0 ) be a point in ( X ). The function ( f ) is said to be continuous at the point ( x_0 ) if for every open set ( V ) in ( Y ) that contains ( f(x_0) ), there exists an open set ( U ) in ( X ) that contains ( x_0 ) such that ( f(U) subseteq V ). In more formal language, ( f ) is continuous at ( x_0 ) if for every open set ( V subseteq Y ) with ( f(x_0) in V ), we have ( x_0 in f^{-1}(V) ), and ( f^{-1}(V) ) is an open set in ( X ). This inverse image ( f^{-1}(V) ) being open in ( X ) is a crucial criterion because it embodies the idea that the \\"smallness\\" around ( f(x_0) ) in ( Y ) corresponds to the \\"smallness\\" around ( x_0 ) in ( X ). This definition mirrors the ( epsilon )-( delta ) definition of continuity from real analysis but is recast in topological terms where open sets take the place of ( epsilon )-balls around points. If ( f ) is continuous at every point ( x in X ), then ( f ) itself is said to be a continuous function. The general idea is that continuity ensures that \\"nearby\\" points in ( X ) map to \\"nearby\\" points in ( Y ), based on the given topology of each space. A continuous function does not \\"tear apart\\" or \\"glue together\\" points in a way that disrupts the topological structure of the space."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Planetary radioactivity is decreasing due to decaying, causes to potentially turn planet into frozen ice planet in future. It has shadow forests, adorned with twilight bioluminescent flowers, animals lives on.","output":"Miryath is a unique continental planet located in the heat death universe of Katharik, orbiting the evaporating black hole Tojrane. Its most striking characteristic is its tidally locked nature, meaning that one side of the planet permanently faces the black hole while the other side remains in eternal darkness. Despite the extreme conditions, Miryath has managed to sustain life in a delicate balance. The planet features two large ice polar caps, which act as the primary sources of water, constantly receiving evaporated moisture from the ocean. The rest of the planet consists of a single vast ocean, representing the majority of Miryath's surface area, and a single supercontinent that spans the sunlit and dark sides. One of the most awe-inspiring phenomena on Miryath is the presence of shadow forests. These forests are predominantly found on the border between the illuminated and dark sides of the planet, where the constant twilight creates a unique habitat for life. The trees in these shadow forests are adapted to withstand both extreme cold and the radiation that permeates the planet. Within the shadow forests, twilight bioluminescent flowers bloom, bathing the surroundings in an ethereal glow. These unique plants have developed the ability to convert the sparse light they receive into bright, captivating colors that attract the attention of various pollinators. Despite the challenging conditions, animals have managed to adapt and thrive on Miryath. While the majority of creatures that inhabit the planet are relatively small and capable of burrowing or seeking shelter during periods of extreme radiation, some larger species have evolved specialized protective mechanisms to mitigate the effects of radiation. These unique adaptations have allowed a diverse array of life forms to exist, creating a rich and intricate ecosystem. However, the future of Miryath is uncertain. The planetary radioactivity, which has played a crucial role in shaping the evolution of life on the planet, is gradually diminishing due to natural decay processes. As a result, Miryath faces the potential fate of becoming a frozen ice planet. This looming threat has become a driving force behind the efforts of scientists and explorers who seek to understand and potentially mitigate the changes that lie ahead for Miryath."},{"instruction":"Describe continental planet Miryath around evaporating black hole Tojrane in heat death universe Katharik, its rotational period equals to its orbital period, it has two large ice polar caps, it has large single ocean and large single supercontinent appears in both west and east.

The planet is adorned with two large ice polar caps, which stand as shimmering beacons at its most extreme latitudes. These icy regions contribute to the overall striking beauty of Miryath, contrasting against its other geographical features. One of the distinguishing features of Miryath is the presence of a vast, single ocean that stretches across a substantial part of the planet's surface. This ocean is home to a diverse array of marine lifeforms, adapted to the ever-changing conditions brought about by the intersection of the planet's climate and the proximity to Tojrane. Stretching across the planet's landmasses, there is a colossal supercontinent that appears both in the west and east. This supercontinent provides a stable ground for various ecosystems to thrive and evolve. It acts as a connecting bridge between the different regions of Miryath, allowing for the exchange of species and fostering cross-pollination of unique traits. However, there is a looming threat to the planet's future. Miryath's planetary radioactivity is gradually decreasing due to a natural process of decay. This decline in radioactivity potentially poses a significant challenge, as it could lead to Miryath eventually transforming into a frozen ice planet. The diminishing radioactivity alters the planet's climate patterns, and unless counteracted by other factors, it may result in a frozen landscape across Miryath's surface. One mesmerizing feature of Miryath is its \\"shadow forests.\\" These unique woodlands are characterized by a dense canopy that obstructs most of the sunlight, creating darkened groves filled with an ethereal ambiance. Within these shadow forests, twilight bioluminescent flowers bloom, casting a mystical glow upon the land. These floral wonders, along with other luminescent organisms, provide an enchanting spectacle that captivates visitors and nurtures a delicate balance of life within this shadowy realm. Animals have adapted to thrive within the shadow forests, their nocturnal lifestyle perfectly suited to the dim light conditions. These creatures have developed unique sensory systems and camouflage techniques to maneuver through the darkness. The delicate harmony between predators and prey, guided by shadowy instincts, adds to the ecological diversity of Miryath.

(See what we did there?) Is a base coat necessary for nail polish? Of course! Read on to find out more about base coat nail polishes, and some tips to ensure your mani stays on point with a round-up of 5 reasons you should be using them. Using a base coat nail polish actually extends wear: Proper application of all steps is key to making nail polish last. Be sure to start with properly prepped nails and apply 1 even coat of base coat to start, for OPI Nail Lacquer application start with OPI Natural Nail Base Coat, and for OPI Infinite Shine application start with OPI Infinite Shine Primer-- this will allow additional color application layers to have optimum sticking power and ensures less chipping! Because no one likes a chipped mani. Base coat nail polishes help to prevent staining Base coat nail polishes help to prevent staining: Base coat nail polishes in general help prevent any staining that might occur, especially from darker nail polish shades, but certain base coats work a little extra when it comes to stain fighting. Our OPI Infinite Shine Treatment Primers are like a base coat nail polish and treatment in one! These nutrient-rich formulas like the OPI Infinite Shine Brightening Primer contain antioxidant-rich lotus flower oil and bamboo extract to help brighten nails that may already be stained and helps to prevent future staining from happening. What is the difference between nail primer and base coat? A true nail primer is a product that creates cross-linking adhesion and is typically found in professional product systems like acrylics for example. The acrylic product becomes ‘bonded’ with the nail primer to help provide stronger sticking power to the natural nail. What is the difference between base coat and top coat nail polish? Top coats like OPI Top Coat and OPI Infinite Shine Gloss are the keys to high-shine manicures. They keep color true during normal wear and ensure manicures are long-lasting. Using a base coat nail polish can provide added strength Using a base coat nail polish can provide added strength: Weak nails are no match for OPI Nail Envy or OPI Natural Nail Strengthener, use these in place of your regular base coat nail polish for a little extra support. The hydrolyzed wheat protein and calcium in OPI Nail Envy work together to provide harder, stronger, and longer natural nails, and Natural Nail Strengthener works by building in layers of added strength and support where needed. Base coat nail polishes can help smooth out nail surfaces Base coat nail polishes can help smooth out nail surfaces: We mentioned our OPI Infinite Shine Brightening Primer earlier, but we can’t stop there! These magical treatment primers do wonders, especially when it comes to nail ridges. Nail ridges are usually harmless and can be a sign of vitamin deficiencies (like vitamin A, B-12, protein, calcium, iron, or zinc). Another cause could be Onychorrhexis, a longitudinal ridging that can result in splits (similar to split ends in hair) at the free edge. The OPI Infinite Shine Ridge Filler Primer helps condition and smooth the nail surface prior to Infinite Shine color application. Use of a base coat helps to achieve full color coverage Use of a base coat helps to achieve full color coverage: Thanks to all of the amazing benefits mentioned above like stain prevention, increased strength and smoothness for example, as a whole, base coat nail polishes truly are the key to allowing your nail polish’s true color to shine through -","output":"**Best Base Coat for Nail Polish** When you're excited about painting your nails a stunning new color, you may overlook an important step - the base coat. It’s easy to skip it, but just like a great story needs a strong beginning, your nails need a good base coat for the perfect manicure. Let's dive into the world of base coats and explore why applying one is like laying the foundation of a house – it provides stability for everything that comes after it. **Base Coat Nail Polish Extends Wear** So, why is a base coat as important as people say it is? For starters, it keeps your nail polish looking fresh for longer. Think of it as a primer for your nails. If you want your nail polish to last more than a couple of days, a base coat is a must. When you prep your nails and apply an even layer, like the OPI Natural Nail Base Coat, you’re setting the stage for your nail color to cling to your nails tenaciously. Just like you wouldn't paint a wall without a primer, you shouldn't color your nails without a base coat. **Base Coat Nail Polishes Help to Prevent Staining** Dark and vibrant nail polish colors look amazing but can leave a not-so-pretty tint on your nails. This is where base coat nail polishes come in to save the day. They create a protective shield between the nail polish and your actual nail, reducing the chance of discoloration. Some base coats, like OPI Infinite Shine Treatment Primers, do double duty by treating your nails while fighting stains. Ingredients like lotus flower oil and bamboo extract are like superheroes for your nails, keeping them bright and protected. **Using a Base Coat Nail Polish Can Provide Added Strength** If your nails bend or break easily, you'll be happy to know that some base coats can help fortify your nails. Products such as OPI Nail Envy or OPI Natural Nail Strengthener are like a gym workout for your nails. They bring protein and calcium to the party, making your nails tough enough to handle life´s little knocks. Switching your regular base coat for one of these strengtheners can help your nails grow stronger and resist damage. **Base Coat Nail Polishes Can Help Smooth Out Nail Surfaces** Ridges on nails can be quite noticeable, especially when you apply nail polish. But you don't have to live with them. Some base coats, like the OPI Infinite Shine Ridge Filler Primer, can fill in and smooth out these imperfections so when you do apply your nail color, it goes on evenly and looks flawless. This can be particularly helpful if you have vertical ridges, which can cause your nails to split and break more easily, much like split ends in your hair. **Use of a Base Coat Helps to Achieve Full Color Coverage** Last but not least, base coats give you the vibrant, true color you see in the bottle. By creating a neutral background, they ensure that the color you put on top pops just the way you want it to. Without a base coat, you might find yourself adding one coat after another trying to get that rich color – wasting precious polish in the process. **OPI Gel Top Coat** After learning about the wonderful world of base coats, let's not forget about the final touch - the top coat. While base coats are about preparation and protection, top coats are about preservation and perfection. An OPI Gel Top Coat, for instance, acts as a powerful shield that locks in color, delivers an incredible shine, and makes your manicure last. It's the cherry on top of a meticulous manicure sundae, ensuring that your nails catch every eye in the room with their glossy finish. So there you have it—five solid reasons to start using a base coat if you’re not already. It's a simple step that can make a world of difference in the appearance and longevity of your manicure.

Here's an adjusted version of your answer to incorporate the option of hiring people or purchasing assets for the project: \\"Our primary objective is to complete the game within an 18-month development timeframe. To achieve this, we have estimated a total investment value of 118,350 for this period, which will be allocated strategically considering two possible approaches: hiring additional team members or purchasing high-quality assets. Option 1: Hiring Additional Team Members A significant portion of the funds will be dedicated to expanding the team. By hiring skilled professionals in areas such as level design, gameplay programming, user interface design, and quality assurance, we can effectively accelerate the development process. With this approach in mind, we plan to allocate approximately 80,000 towards hiring costs for additional team members. Option 2: Purchasing High-Quality Assets Alternatively, we recognize the potential benefits of acquiring pre-made, high-quality assets from reputable sources. By securing assets such as character models, animations, environmental assets, visual effects, and sound effects, we can significantly speed up the development process while maintaining a high level of quality. Approximately 40,000 of the funds will be allocated towards the purchase of these assets. Additionally, a portion of the funds will cover the monthly expenses of the development team, including salaries, software licenses, equipment, and other operational costs. Ensuring the financial stability of the team will enable us to maintain a consistent and focused approach throughout the development process. We estimate approximately 25,000 to cover these ongoing expenses. We also plan to allocate 10,000 towards marketing and promotional efforts to generate awareness and visibility for the game during its development phase. This will involve activities such as creating engaging trailers, running digital advertising campaigns, participating in industry events, and building a community presence. Considering unforeseen expenses and contingencies, we have allocated 3,350 to accommodate any unexpected needs that may arise during the development process. By utilizing the Epic Mega Grant funds in either hiring additional team members or purchasing high-quality assets, we can streamline and enhance the overall development process. Our goal is to deliver a polished and captivating gaming experience to our players. We are committed to making the most efficient and effective use of the funds, ensuring that the game receives the necessary resources for success.
