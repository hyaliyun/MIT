BoC Governor Tiff Macklem said in a recent speech \\"interest rates may now be restrictive enough\\" with excess demand gone and weak growth expected to persist, leading most to conclude the central bank is done hiking. But Macklem also said \\"right now, it is not time to start thinking about cutting interest rates.\\" While the economy was expected to have grown a modest 0.2% annualized rate last quarter after contracting 0.2% in April-June, inflation has come down significantly to 3.1% last month from a peak of 8.1% in June 2022. All but one of 26 economists in a Reuters poll taken Nov. 27-30 forecast the BoC will now keep its main policy rate on hold at 5.0% until at least end-March, similar to what is expected from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Only Barclays expects one more 25 basis point rate hike in January. Interest rate futures are pricing the first rate cut in March, earlier than the poll prediction. \\"It's readily apparent in the past two quarters, interest rates in the 5% range are a significant headwind to growth, one that is desirable now while the BoC seeks to cool inflation, but too much of a drag to be sustained for a full year ahead,\\" said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets. \\"Our call does imply a bigger gap between U.S. and Canadian rates, but that's consistent with the evidence at hand that shows the American economy, due to lower household debt levels and locked-in long-term mortgages, is better able to withstand interest rates near 5%.\\" The poll predicts that the BoC will start cutting interest rates from the second quarter and medians showed it would deliver 100 basis points of rate cuts next year, more than the 75 basis points expected from the Fed. About 70% of economists, 18 of 26, expected the rate to be at 4.0% or lower by end-2024, much below the expected fed funds rate, in a 4.50-4.75% range. \\"The Bank of Canada will be thinking ahead with its policy rate still at 5%...(and) it will basically conclude the hiking cycle has done its job and it needs to start shifting towards a more normal monetary policy setting,\\" said Robert Hogue, assistant chief economist at RBC. Economists at Desjardins were slightly more pessimistic than others on growth, expecting \\"a short, shallow recession in the first half of 2024.\\" \\"Accompanying labour market weakness should put downward pressure on inflation and prompt the Bank of Canada to cut the policy rate around of the spring of 2024,\\" they wrote. With nearly 60% of mortgage holders yet to renew their home loans at higher rates, the big question is what do these rate cut expectations mean for the housing market and for those who for years have been eagerly waiting to own a home. A separate Nov. 15-30 poll of 11 property analysts forecast average home prices, which surged over 50% during the pandemic, to stagnate in 2024 after declining 3.3% this year, compared to a 2024 rise of 2.0% predicted in an August poll. All but one of nine property market analysts said purchasing affordability next year would improve. But seven of nine respondents said the proportion of home ownership to renters would decrease over the coming five years. That was despite several government measures announced in the latest Fall Economic Statement to boost housing supply and help lenders dealing with homeowners at risk amid high interest rates. Sebastian Mintah, an economist at Moody's Analytics, said the new supply set to come to market will mostly address past shortages, not prepare for the future. \\"Given strong demographics are expected to continue, a continued robust pace of new building is needed. Problematically, new supply is likely to come up short as builders turn more cautious.\\" (For other stories from the Reuters global economic poll:) (Reporting by Mumal Rathore; Editing by Ross Finley and Tomasz Janowski)","output":"Economists predict that the Bank of Canada (BoC) will begin cutting interest rates in the second quarter of 2024, with borrowing costs expected to drop by at least one percentage point by the end of that year.

This can trap homeowners in their properties and make it difficult for them to sell or refinance. Mortgage defaults can occur when homeowners are unable to make their monthly mortgage payments due to financial strain caused by declining home values. This can lead to foreclosure, damaging both the homeowner and the lender. A decline in housing prices can also impact consumer spending. When individuals see the value of their homes decrease, they may feel less wealthy and reduce their discretionary spending.

It belongs to the family Xenopicidae, which consists of predatory and highly adaptable birds found in various parts of the world. The Fleshpecker, however, is particularly unique due to its specific characteristics and behavior. Physical Appearance: The Fleshpecker is a medium-sized bird, typically measuring around 12-14 inches in length. It has a sleek and streamlined body, allowing it to maneuver swiftly through its natural habitat. The bird is covered in dense, pitch-black feathers, which provide excellent camouflage during its hunting activities. Beak and Talons: One of the most distinctive features of the Fleshpecker is its long, sharp beak and powerful talons. The beak is especially adapted for piercing and tearing flesh, and it possesses a strong jaw capable of delivering crushing bites. Its talons are razor-sharp and used to latch onto its prey, ensuring a secure hold during feeding. Feeding Behavior: True to its name, the Fleshpecker is primarily a carnivorous bird. It preys on a wide range of animals, including small mammals, reptiles, insects, and even other birds. The bird is known for its relentless and cunning hunting techniques, often stalking its prey from a concealed position before striking with exceptional speed and accuracy. The Fleshpecker's beak allows it to tear flesh with ease, and its unique digestive system enables it to process and extract nutrients efficiently. Habitat and Distribution: The Fleshpecker is native to dense and secluded forests, particularly in tropical regions. It prefers areas with ample cover and abundant prey, such as small mammals and reptiles. Due to its elusive nature, the exact distribution of the species is not well-documented, making it a relatively rare and elusive sight for bird watchers and researchers. Behavior and Reproduction: The Fleshpecker is a solitary bird, rarely seen in pairs or groups. Its territorial nature ensures that it has access to sufficient prey within its hunting grounds. Male Fleshpeckers are particularly aggressive and fiercely defend their territories against other males. They often engage in aerial displays and vocalizations as a means of establishing dominance. During the breeding season, male Fleshpeckers construct elaborate nests high up in the trees. Females are responsible for laying a small clutch of eggs, typically numbering between 2 to 4. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and providing food for the chicks once they hatch. The juveniles reach maturity within a year and exhibit similar hunting prowess to their parents. Conservation Status: The Fleshpecker is classified as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, due to its secretive nature and limited research, there is still much to learn about this remarkable bird species. Continued study and conservation efforts are crucial to understanding and preserving the Fleshpecker and its natural habitat."},{"instruction":"a qui appartient FR35114001805 ?","output":"Les numéros commençant par \\"FR\\" suivis de chiffres comme celui que vous avez donné (FR35114001805) semblent correspondre à des numéros de TVA intra-communautaire attribués aux entreprises enregistrées pour la TVA en France.

One married couple, Jonas* and Kathleen, in British Columbia are the sole beneficiaries to the estates of their parents and an aunt, and expect to inherit upwards of 1 million over the next 15 years. They are frustrated that inheritance planning isn’t typically part of the retirement planning process and that wealth calculators only make the process more difficult. Another issue they have is that talking about money and death remains taboo. “It feels wrong, somehow immoral, to be talking about receiving a future inheritance,” Jonas said. “But these are important conversations that can remove some of the uncertainty about the future.” Jonas, 55, and Kathleen, 49, would like to retire in the next five years. He would like to start working less in the next year or two, and they would like to spend at least five months a year living outside Canada when they do retire. If necessary, he can take on IT consulting projects in retirement, which could easily bring in about 50,000 a year. Jonas’ current annual income is 110,000 before tax and Kathleen earns 20,000. Their investments generate about 7,200 in dividend income each year, which is automatically reinvested. It feels wrong, somehow immoral, to be talking about receiving a future inheritance Jonas The couple do not have children or beneficiaries, are debt free, own a home valued at 1.4 million and have a bit more than 1 million in savings. To this point, the couple has directed discretionary savings to maximize Jonas’ registered retirement savings plans contributions first (as of this year, he has eliminated any remaining contribution room) and then Kathleen’s tax-free savings account (TFSA). As a dual Canada/United States citizen, Jonas does not have a TFSA because it’s a taxable asset in the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service. Jonas will be entitled to full Canada Pension Plan benefits when he retires, and Kathleen will qualify for about 50 per cent of the maximum. Both will qualify for Old Age Security. Their ultimate goal is to spend as much of their accumulated wealth as possible to ensure they fully enjoy their lives and then leave the remainder to charity. Their family medical histories indicate they are not likely to live into extreme old age, so they’d like to create a retirement plan to age 85 for each of them, excluding long-term care costs. The couple’s current monthly expenses are 4,650 and they would like to maintain a retirement net income of at least 5,000 per month (adjusted for inflation annually), preferably closer to 7,000 if possible. They plan to offer their home as a short-term rental when they travel, which should bring in anywhere from 300 to 400 per night. A planner by nature and in his professional life, Jonas has worked out a few unconventional strategies to ensure he and Kathleen are able to enjoy and sustain the life they want in retirement based on reducing the equity in their home. One strategy is to tap their 400,000 home equity line of credit since they are not against having liens put on their house that are not collectible until they both die. Another is to defer annual property tax payments (an option to residents aged 55 and over of B.C.). This will net them about 4,000 a year. Taking out a reverse mortgage might also allow them to access upwards of 50 per cent of the home’s value while living in it. If for some reason they don’t receive the inheritances, Jonas and Kathleen can sell the house and downsize or rent. “We don’t want to die with 100 per cent equity in the house because we don’t have anybody to leave it to,” Jonas said. What the experts say Jonas and Kathleen are in good financial standing to fully retire in five years with 7,000 a month in after-tax income and enjoy the lifestyle they envision, say the experts. Based on B.C.’s tax rates and a net return of only three per cent after inflation over the next 25 years, and not including the inheritance, the professional planning software, which also integrates future CPP and OAS payments, illustrates they could create their higher preferred retirement income of 7,000 net per month in today’s dollars from when Jonas is age 60 to 75 and they are likely to be most active, said Eliott Einarson, a retirement planner with Ottawa-based Exponent Investment Management. “After 75, they could still hit their target of 5,000 net per month in today’s dollars, leaving them no remaining investment accounts at age 91 for Jonas and 85 for Kathleen,” he said. Ed Rempel, a fee-for-service financial planner, tax accountant and blogger, said as long as the couple use their 400,000 line of credit to spend during retirement (“generally more effective than a reverse mortgage which, given their young age, will likely only provide 20 per cent to 40 per cent of their home’s value“) or invest (“this option would give them the highest retirement lifestyle”) and inherit at least 500,000 within 15 years, they are on track for their desired retirement. To factor their inheritances into their retirement plan, Rempel recommends only including the amounts they are confident they will get. “Use conservative estimates and include how many years from now you think you’ll receive it, with the understanding that it is not guaranteed,” he said. If they don’t get their expected inheritances, Rempel said they will need about 700,000 from their home to live the retirement lifestyle they want. They could either downsize to a home half the value of their current home, or sell to rent for up to 2,500/month. Woman well short of magic 1-million retirement fund Woman with 3.77 million in investments needs balance Woman needs to adjust retirement plans as AI takes over job “Selling or even just downsizing the house at some point will be more than enough to keep them spending a lot more than they spend now, and well into their 90s,” Einarson said. “Their personal activity level will likely slow down long before their income levels need to be adjusted down.” *Names have been changed to protect privacy.

Puja Tayal Fri, December 1, 2023 at 2:15 a.m. GMT+1·4 min read Image source: Getty Images Image source: Getty Images Written by Puja Tayal at The Motley Fool Canada This year, almost all Canadian real estate investment trusts (REITs) saw their stock prices plunge double digits. Some even fell to all-time lows after they slashed their distributions. What is wrong with Canadian REITs? Is this dip a warning sign to stay away or an opportunity to grab a value stock? The answer differs from REIT to REIT. What is wrong with Canada’s REITs? REITs take mortgages and long-term debt to buy a property and develop it. Hence, they carry significant debt capital. In 2011, many real estate firms opted to raise equity capital by forming a REIT. However, creditors get payment priority if the REIT does not have enough cash flow. Canada’s REITs have a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and a five-year commercial mortgage at the going rate of 5.5%. In 2023, many mortgages were renewed at the new higher interest rate, as the Bank of Canada increased the base interest rate from 0.25% to 5%. Most REITs had not factored in a high interest rate into their model, which strained their cash flows. Adding to higher interest rates, slowing commercial activity forced many businesses to renew or reduce their office lease. Office REITs took a hit as fewer tenants renewed their leases, and some reduced their leased space. A decrease in the occupancy ratio saw their distribution payout ratio cross 100%. Such a high ratio is unsustainable for longer. To get some financial flexibility to make mortgage payments, a few REITs slashed distributions. Canadian REITs that slashed distributions Slate Office REIT’s (TSX:SOT.UN) occupancy rate fell to 78.6% in the third quarter from 81.9% a year ago. The REIT slashed its distribution by 70% in April when its payout ratio reached 160.4% in the March quarter. Hence, its stock lost 82% of its value year to date. Its stock price has fallen below 1. Moreover, the stock has lost trading volume, with only 9,000 shares exchanging hands compared to its average volume of 150,800. In terms of both trading and fundamentals, Slate Office REIT is a stock to stay away from as its performance is unlikely to improve anytime soon. True North Commercial REIT (TSX:TNT.UN) slashed its distribution by 50% in the first half of 2023. It sold some of its property and used the proceeds to buy back 208,400 units. Moreover, it consolidated its units in a 5.75:1 ratio to add value for shareholders. It is still holding a few properties for sale. Such downsizing is necessary to survive in a downturn. However, it does not instill confidence in the sustainability of the REIT. Even though the REIT’s units are trading above 6.7, the stock has lost 80% of its value year to date. It is a risky investment. Hence, it is offering a double-digit distribution yield. If True North can sustain a recession, it could grow significantly during the economic recovery. But its chances are bleak. Hence, I would avoid investing in it. Canadian REITs that show resilience While office REITs were the worst hit by rate hikes and retail REITs by the pandemic lockdown, a few showed resilience to such market conditions. And behind this resilience is a lower payout ratio, higher occupancy rate due to large tenants, and lower debt. CT REIT (TSX:CRT.UN) earns 90% of its rental income from parent Canadian Tire. Its debt is lower than its equity. As the parent is the tenant, the trust did not face any occupancy issues or decline in cash flows. It did face rising interest expenses, but a relatively lower debt kept its payout ratio within a comfortable level of 72.5%. Its stock price fell 13.3% year to date, which inflated its distribution yield to 6.6%. This stock can add value to your portfolio with its strong fundamentals. Investing tip Smart Centres and Choice Properties REIT are on the brink of a distribution cut as their payout ratio is hovering around 95% and above. They are holding on to their current distributions for now. However, another rate hike or a prolonged high rate could increase the risk of a cut. If you are considering buying them, wait and watch till the December 6th interest rate decision of the Monetary Policy Committee.

With a scientific name befitting its unique nature, Thanatopicus sapiens exhibits a striking appearance and several notable adaptations. True to its name, Thanatopicus sapiens is predominantly colored in Vantablack, a material that absorbs almost all light, resulting in a mesmerizing and substantially dark plumage. This attribute allows the creature to blend effortlessly into its surroundings, enabling it to move stealthily and silently as it goes about its activities. One of the most captivating features of this avian species is its stark white, soulless eyes, which instill an eerie and ominous aura. However, unlike its predecessor, Thanatopicus sapiens lacks a crown of hair on its head, making way for a smoother appearance. In terms of its physical structure, Thanatopicus sapiens boasts powerful hawk-like legs, designed to support its bird-like body but with enhanced strength and agility for commanding actions. This unique adaptation allows it to swiftly maneuver through various terrain, including intricate and challenging habitats such as treetops and dense forests. Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of this avian creature lies within its skeletal composition. Unlike most birds, the bones of Thanatopicus sapiens are composed of tungsten carbide, a remarkably strong and durable material. This adaptation provides significant advantages, including added resistance to impact and wear, allowing it to perform formidable actions with its body structure.

However, here's a general framework for creating a budget: 1. Determine your income: List all sources of income, such as salary, freelance work, or rental income. Calculate the total monthly income. 2. Identify fixed expenses: These are expenses that remain the same every month, like rent/mortgage payments, car loans, insurance premiums, or subscription services. Add up all your fixed expenses. 3. Calculate variable expenses: These expenses fluctuate month to month, such as groceries, utilities, transportation costs, entertainment, and dining out. Estimate these expenses based on your previous spending patterns. 4. Set financial goals: Define short-term and long-term financial goals like saving for a vacation, buying a house, paying off debts, or building an emergency fund. Assign specific amounts and target dates to each goal. 5. Allocate savings: Prioritize saving by deciding how much of your income you want to save each month. Consider contributing to retirement accounts or other investment options. 6. Track discretionary spending: Review your discretionary spending, which includes non-essential items like clothing, entertainment, and hobbies. Set a budget for these categories. 7. Calculate the difference: Subtract your total expenses from your income. If you end up with a surplus, consider allocating it toward savings, debt repayment, or additional financial goals. If there's a shortfall, you may need to review and adjust your expenses. 8. Review and adjust: Regularly review your budget to make sure it aligns with your financial goals. Track your actual spending and compare it to your budgeted amounts. Adjust your budget as necessary to maintain control over your finances. Remember, this is a general outline, and your budget should be tailored to your personal circumstances.

VOC is a common complication in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) where the sickled red blood cells block the blood vessels, leading to pain and tissue damage. The intravenous fluid rule in the treatment of VOC involves aggressive hydration to promote rehydration and prevent dehydration. This can help improve blood flow through the blocked vessels and reduce pain. Key points of the intravenous fluid rule in the treatment of VOC include: 1. Early initiation: Intravenous fluids should be started as soon as possible upon the diagnosis of VOC. Prompt initiation of hydration can help alleviate symptoms and prevent further complications. 2. Adequate volume: The goal is to provide sufficient fluids to maintain optimal hydration. The specific volume requirements may vary depending on the patient's age, weight, severity of symptoms, and underlying health conditions. Healthcare professionals will monitor the patient's vital signs, urine output, and general clinical condition to guide the fluid volume administration. 3. Isotonic fluids: Isotonic fluids, such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution, are typically used in the treatment of VOC. These fluids have a similar concentration of electrolytes as the blood, minimizing the risk of fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances. 4. Titration: The infusion rate and volume of fluids may need to be adjusted depending on the patient's response to treatment. Monitoring the patient's vital signs, urine output, and symptom improvement can help guide the titration of intravenous fluids. 5. Pain management: Intravenous fluid administration alone may not be sufficient to manage pain in VOC. Pain medications, such as opioids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are often administered alongside intravenous fluids to provide adequate pain relief. It is important to note that the specific intravenous fluid regimen may vary among healthcare providers and institutions. Close monitoring and individualized treatment plans based on the patient's condition are crucial to optimize the management of VOC in SCD."},{"instruction":"本次译前准备的主题为“人工智能”，请针对该主题进行资料检索与阅读。检索方式是将特定关键词输入搜索引擎和专门网站的搜索栏。可访问（不限于）以下与该主题相关的网站以获取相关知识，并进行汇总: 人工智能科技网：http://www.ai-tech.net/ IT之家：https://www.ithome.com/ 医疗人工智能：https://www.medicalai.cn/ 金融人工智能：https://www.aifinance.com/ 自动驾驶：https://www.autohome.com.cn/ 斯坦福大学人工智能实验室：http://ai.stanford.edu/ 麻省理工学院人工智能实验室：http://ai.mit.edu/ 汇总信息可选择涵盖以下内容：2. 英语专业学生如何利用人工智能技术提高自己的英语语言能力？3. 总结为英汉双语对照，英文部分300词左右，中英文总结内容须互相对应。","output":"资料检索与阅读结果概述： 通过对人工智能相关网站的检索与阅读，以下是我对英语专业学生如何利用人工智能技术提高英语语言能力的总结： 英语专业学生如何利用人工智能技术提高自己的英语语言能力？ 1. 在线语言学习平台： 人工智能技术在在线语言学习平台中广泛应用，通过语音识别和自然语言处理等技术，为学生提供自适应学习体验和个性化学习计划。学生可以通过这些平台进行听说读写的练习，并获得即时反馈。 2. 机器翻译与语法检查工具： 人工智能在机器翻译和语法检查方面有着广泛的应用。学生可以利用这些工具来翻译文章、阅读英语原文以及纠正自己的语法错误。 3. 自然语言处理技术和学习助手： 人工智能技术的自然语言处理功能可以帮助学生更好地理解英语文本。学习助手可以提供词汇解释、语法分析和语境理解等功能，帮助学生更全面地理解文本内容。 4. 智能辅助写作工具： 学生可以利用智能辅助写作工具来提升自己的写作能力。这些工具可以帮助学生找到合适的词汇、提供写作建议，并提高文章的结构和语法。 5. 在线语音识别与发音纠正： 学生可以通过在线语音识别和发音纠正工具来改善自己的口语和发音。这些工具可以实时分析学生的发音，并提供纠正建议，帮助他们更好地提高口语表达能力。 综上所述，借助人工智能技术，英语专业学生可以在语言学习、写作、口语和发音等方面得到有效的提升和辅助。 English Summary (英语总结): Through research and reading on websites related to artificial intelligence, the following is a summary of how English major students can use AI technology to improve their English language skills: How can English major students use AI technology to improve their English language skills? 1.

See what happened Sandee LaMotte, CNN Fri, December 1, 2023 at 1:12 a.m. GMT+1·5 min read Identical twins help scientists control variables that may otherwise influence trial results. (The twins seen above did not participate in the new study.) - filadendron/E+/Getty Images Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life. Healthy twins who ate a vegan diet for eight weeks had lower “bad” low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol, better blood sugar levels, and greater weight loss than siblings who ate a diet of meat and vegetables, a new study found. “There was a 10% to 15% drop in LDL cholesterol, a 25% drop in insulin, and a 3% drop in body weight in just eight weeks, all by eating real food without animal products,” said lead study author Christopher Gardner, a research professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center in Palo Alto, California. A vegan diet differs from a vegetarian diet in that it eliminates not only animal flesh but dairy, eggs or any other ingredient derived from animals. A strictly plant-based diet can be higher in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients compared with other dietary patterns, said Gardner, who is also the director of the Nutrition Studies Research Group at Stanford. “The results of this study confirm the benefit of current dietary guidance to reduce cardiovascular disease risk,” Alice Lichtenstein, director and senior scientist at Tufts University’s Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory, told CNN in an email. She was not involved in the study. “The diet with more unsaturated relative to saturated fat, more whole grains relative to refined grains, fewer calories, more fiber and vegetables, and less cholesterol resulted in a more favorable cardiovascular disease risk factor profile than the comparison diet,” she said. The study was unusual because it used genetically identical twins, most of whom shared similar lifestyle behaviors, including haircuts and clothes. “The twin study design is elegant because it largely controls genetic and environmental factors that may influence the trial results,” said Dr. Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology and chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. He was not involved in the study. “However, the recruitment of identical twins into dietary intervention studies is challenging; this is why the design has been rarely used in nutritional studies,” Hu said. “Also, the findings from identical twins may not be generalizable to the general population.” Identical twins help scientists control variables that may otherwise influence trial results. (The twins seen above did not participate in the new study.) - filadendron/E+/Getty Images Identical twins help scientists control variables that may otherwise influence trial results. (The twins seen above did not participate in the new study.) - filadendron/E+/Getty Images Benefits of high-fiber plant foods with less fat The study, published Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open, involved 22 pairs of identical twins. In each pair, one twin was assigned a vegan diet, while the other was assigned an omnivore diet. They each followed their respective diets for eight weeks. During the first four weeks, all meals were provided to each twin so they could see the types of food they should be eating. “I feel like a lot of people who do a vegan diet think ‘Oh great, soda is vegan. Pancakes are vegan.’ No, they are refined ultraprocessed grains,” Gardner said. “So, we tried to get a healthy vegan diet and show them quickly what that was for four weeks.” The meat and veggie group also had meals delivered that were a step up from their normal fare. “I’m really into equipoise or balance in my studies — I don’t have a wonderfully healthy vegan diet and a crap strawman diet to be knocked over,” Gardner said. “People who ate the omnivorous diet ate more vegetables, more whole grains, less added sugar and less refined grains than they did in their usual habitual diet. Nor did they get crappy meat, it was all good quality. So, they actually had some dietary improvements.” Once each pair of twins learned the types of foods to eat, they were asked to prepare their own diet-appropriate meals and snacks for the second half of the study, Gardner said. Biological markers including blood and feces were gathered from each twin at baseline and again at week four and eight. Surprisingly, twins on the vegan diet tested younger on measures of biological versus chronological age, data which will be presented in a future study, Gardner said. However, the improvement in cardiovascular biomarkers such as lower LDL cholesterol, insulin resistance and the loss in weight were to be expected, Gardner said. “The vegetarians got more fiber, less saturated fat. That’s going to explain the LDL cholesterol. More fiber is going to explain less fasting insulin because they just have a slower release of glucose in the bloodstream,” he said. “And all the vegetables and fruits and grains are bulkier than meat and so people could be more satiated and eating fewer calories.” Restricted diets But as with all diets that restrict people from foods they are used to eating, staying the course can be tough. “To be honest, twins on the vegan diet had less satisfaction because it was so restrictive. So, there’s certainly the flip side of this: ‘Oh, I could have eaten more, but I just wasn’t hungry for more grains and more vegetables.” Despite the quick improvement in health, people don’t have to become a vegan to benefit from the findings of the study, Gardner said. Cutting back on eating meat and animal byproducts can be done slowly, bit by bit. Harvard’s Hu agreed: “While this study showed a vegan diet may provide additional advantages compared to a healthy omnivorous diet, it does not mean that everyone should become a vegan or vegetarian. “Dietary choices are influenced by a variety of factors such as individual health conditions, personal preferences, cultural traditions, and ethical and environmental considerations,” he said.

A spokesperson for the retail giant on Friday confirmed to FOX Business in a statement, \\"We aren't advertising on X as we've found other platforms to better reach our customers.\\" The news was first reported by Reuters. Walmart Store Walmart has joined a growing list of major companies that no longer advertise on X. A person familiar with the situation told FOX Business that Walmart's decision to stop advertising on X was not made overnight, but was rather a gradual progression away from the platform over quite some time. DISNEY'S IGER ON HALTING X ADS: ASSOCIATION WITH MUSK, PLATFORM NOT ‘A POSITIVE ONE FOR US’ When reached for comment, Joe Benarroch, head of operations at X, said Walmart has not advertised on X since October, so this is not a recent pause. He noted that Walmart still engages organically with its substantial following on the platform, even posting a survey for users on Friday. Benarroch pointed to Walmart's profile on the platform and said in a statement, \\"Walmart has a wonderful community of more than a million people on X, and with a half a billion people on X, every year the platform experiences 15 billion impressions about the holidays alone with more than 50 percent of X users doing most or all of their shopping online.\\" READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP X logo, a cell phone X has seen some major corporations halt advertising on the platform in recent weeks over concerns about antisemitic content. X, formerly known as Twitter, has struggled to retain advertisers since Musk acquired the company in October 2022, and was hit with a fresh exodus in recent weeks over concerns about antisemitic content. ELON MUSK SAYS HE FELT TIKTOK ‘PROBING’ HIS MIND; PLATFORM ‘RIFE’ WITH ANTISEMITIC CONTENT Some major corporations, including Disney, IBM, Apple and Lionsgate, ceased advertising on X in mid-November, following a pair of controversies. The first occurred when Musk commented that an X user had \\"said the actual truth\\" after that person alleged Jewish communities have spread \\"hatred against whites.\\" The tech billionaire has since traveled to Israel and met with its leaders, apologized, and reiterated that he condemns antisemitism.

The ad halt by companies also followed Media Matters for America reporting X ads for certain firms and antisemitic content had shown up adjacent to each other. X has since lodged a defamation complaint against the outlet over the report that it claimed left a \\"false impression that these pairings are anything but what they actually are: manufactured, inorganic and extraordinarily rare.\\" Then, during a Wednesday afternoon appearance at the New York Times DealBook Summit, Musk lashed out at advertisers fleeing the platform, telling them, \\"Go f--- yourself.\\" X CEO Linda Yaccarino seemingly tried to do some cleanup following Musk's remarks, posting on the platform, \\"Today @elonmusk gave a wide ranging and candid interview at @dealbook 2023.

Additionally, the specific types, intensity, and duration of exercise that yield the most significant mental health benefits remain unclear. In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the strong evidence supporting the positive impact of exercise on mental health. It emphasizes the importance of physical activity as a potential intervention in the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders. Future research should focus on determining the optimal exercise parameters and exploring the long-term effects of exercise on mental well-being."},{"instruction":"Please extract the content, purpose, methods, result, and discussion of the following article, and limit it to 300 words or less: Long thought to be a glitch of memory, researchers are coming to realize that the s ability to forget is crucial to how the brain works. Memories make us who we are. They shape our understanding of the world and help us to predict what's coming. For more than a century, researchers have been working to understand how memories are formed and then fixed for recall in the days, weeks or even years that follow.But those scientists might have been looking at only half the picture.\\" To understand how we remember, we must also understand how, and why, we forget. Until about ten years ago, most researchers thought that forgetting was a passive process in which memories,unused, decay over time like a photograph left in the sunlight. But then a handful of researchers' who were investigating memory began to bump up against findings that seemed to contradict that decades-old assumption.They began to put forward the radical idea\\" that the brain is built to forget. A growing body of work', cultivated in the past decade, suggests that the loss of memories is not a passive process. Rather, forgetting seems to be an active mechanism that is constantly at work in the brain. In someperhaps even all-animals, the brain's standard state is not to remember, but to forget. And a better understanding of that state could lead to breakthroughs in treatments forconditions such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and even Alzheimer's disease. \\"What is memory without forgetting?\\" asks Oliver Hardt, a cognitive psychologist\\"studying the neurobiology of memory at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. \\"It's impossible,\\" he says. \\"To have proper memory function, you have to have forgetting.\\" • Biology of forgetting Different types of memory are created and stored in varying ways, and in various areas of the brain'. Researchers are still pinpointing the details, but they know that autobiographical memories-those of events experienced personally\\"—begin to take lasting form in a part of the brain called the hippocampus, in the hours and days that follow the event. Neurons communicate with each other through synapses—junctions between these cells that include a tiny gap across which chemical messengers' can be sent.Each neuron can be connected to thousands of others in this way. Through a process known as synaptic plasticity\\".neurons constantly produce new proteins to remodel parts of the synapse, such as the receptors for these chemicals,which enables the neurons to selectively strengthen their connections with one another . This creates a network of cells that, together, encode a memory\\". The more often a memory is recalled, the stronger its neural network becomes.Over time, and through consistent recall\\", the memory becomes encoded in both the hippocampus and the cortex.Eventually, it exists independently in the cortex, where it is put away for long-term storage\\". Neuroscientists often refer to this physical representation of a memory as an engram. They think that each engram has a number of synaptic connections, sometimes even in several areas of the brain\\", and that each neuron and synapse can be involved in multiple engrams. Much is still unknown about how memories are created and accessed\\", and addressing such mysteries has consumed a lot of memory researchers' time\\". How the brain forgets, by comparison, has been largely overlooked.It's a remarkable oversight', says Michael Anderson,who studies cognitive neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, UK. \\"Every species that has a memory forgets.Full stop, without exception. It doesn't matter how simple the organism is: if they can acquire lessons of experience,the lessons can be lost,\\" he says. \\"In light of that', I find it absolutely stunning that neurobiology has treated forgetting as an afterthought.\\" It wasn't at the forefront of Ron Davis's mind when he uncovered evidence of active forgetting in fruit flies(Drosophila melanogaster) in 2012. Davis, a neuroscientist at the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Florida, was studying the intricacies of memory formation in the flies'mushroom bodies (dense networks of neurons²° in insect brains that store olfactory and other sensory memories).He was especially interested in understanding the influence of dopamine-producing neurons²' that connect with these structures. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, is involved in moderating a host of behaviours\\" in the fly brain, and Davis proposed that this chemical messenger might also play a part in memory. Intriguingly, Davis found that dopamine is essential to forgetting. He and his colleagues conditioned transgenic flies to associate electric shocks with certain odours,thereby training the insects to avoid them. They then activated the dopaminergic neurons and observed that the flies quickly forgot the association. Yet blocking the same neurons preserved the memory.\\"They were regulating how memories could be expressed,\\" Davis says, essentially providing a \\"forget\\" signal. Further investigation, involving a technique that enabled the researchers to monitor the activity of neurons in living flies'\\", flemonstrated that these dopamine neurons are active for long periods, at least in flies. \\"The brain is always trying to forget the information it's already learnt,\\" Davis says. From flies to rodents A few years later, Hardt found something similar in rats. He was investigating what happens at the synapses of neurons that are involved in long-term memory storage\\".Researchers know that memories are encoded in the mammalian brain when the strength of the connection between neurons increases. That connection strength is determined by the amount of a particular type of receptor found at the synapse. Known as AMPA receptors, the presence of these structures' must be maintained for a memory to remain intact. \\"The problem,\\" Hardt says, \\"is that @one df these receptors are stable. They are moved in and out of the synapse constantly and (urn over in hours or days”. Fardt's lab showed that a dedicated mechanism?6 continuously promotes the expression of AMPA receptors at synapses. Yet some memories are still forgotten. Hardt proposed that AMPA receptors can also be removed, which suggests that forgetting is an active process. If that were true, then preventing the removal of AMPA receptors should prevent forgetting. When Hardt and his colleagues blocked the mechanism behind AMPA-receptor removal in the hippocampi of rats, as expected, they found that the rats were prevented from forgetting the locations of objects.To forget certain things, it seemed that the rat brain had to proactively destroy connections at the synapse. Forgetting,Hardt says, \\"is not a failure of memory, but a function of it\\". Paul Frankland, a neuroscientist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, had also found evidence that the brain is wired to forget'. Frankland was studying the production of new neurons, or neurogenesis, in adult mice.The process had long been known to occur in","output":"Content: This article explores the concept of forgetting in memory and highlights recent research suggesting that forgetting is an active process, rather than a passive decay of memories over time.

One study in fruit flies found that dopamine is essential for forgetting, and activating dopamine-producing neurons led to the flies rapidly forgetting previously learned associations. Another study in rats showed that the removal of AMPA receptors at synapses is a mechanism behind forgetting, indicating that forgetting is an active process. Discussion: The article emphasizes the importance of understanding forgetting as an integral part of memory function. It highlights that every species, regardless of complexity, experiences forgetting. The article suggests that the field of neurobiology has largely neglected the study of forgetting and that it should be treated as a fundamental aspect of memory research. The article also discusses the potential implications of understanding forgetting for conditions such as anxiety, PTSD, and Alzheimer's disease. It suggests that identifying the mechanisms behind forgetting could lead to breakthroughs in treatments for these conditions. In conclusion, this article challenges the notion that forgetting is passive and highlights recent research indicating that forgetting is an active process in the brain. It emphasizes the importance of understanding forgetting in the context of memory research and its potential impact on mental health conditions. Further research in this area is needed to unravel the complex mechanisms of forgetting and its potential therapeutic implications."},{"instruction":"During a one-sided conversation, the owl throws hilariously snide remarks and gives Poppy life changing advice, setting her off on an unexpected journey.","output":"It seems you've described a whimsical narrative where Poppy, a character presumably in need of guidance, encounters a talking owl who, despite its sarcastic and possibly rude demeanor, provides her with profound insights that encourage her to embark on a new path in life. This story premise has a touch of fantasy given the speaking animal trope and hints at a transformative adventure for Poppy. Here's a brief skit inspired by your description: --- [The scene is set in a moonlit forest. Poppy, a young woman wearing a backpack, stands by an ancient tree. An owl perches on a branch, eyeing her with a mix of curiosity and amusement.] Poppy: [Looking around, lost] I just don't know what to do anymore. Owl: [With a snide chuckle] Oh, the woes of human indecision. Please, enlighten me with your catastrophe. Poppy: It’s not funny. I'm at a crossroads in my life and I need to make a big decision. Owl: [Rolling his eyes] Big decisions? Let me guess--you're probably worried about something mundane, like choosing the right major or deciding if you should cut your bangs. Poppy: [Taken aback] Well, I... It's more serious than that. Owl: [Leaning in, mockingly interested] Do tell. My night is utterly devoid of entertainment. Poppy: [Sighs] I have this dream of traveling, of helping people in distant places, but everyone says it's unrealistic. Owl: [His tone softening slightly] And you always listen to the naysayers because their opinions dictate your life, right? Poppy: [Defensively] That's not fair. It's not just about me; I have responsibilities here. Owl: [Sharply] Poppy, life is a relentless stream of 'what if's and 'should have's. Do you want to ride the current of your own making, or be swept away by the tides of others' expectations? Poppy: [Pausing, deep in thought] I... never looked at it like that. Owl: [Suddenly serious] Look, I may just be a figment of your overstressed imagination or a remarkably insightful owl—who knows? But if there's one piece of advice you should take from a bird in the middle of the night, it's this: The choices you regret most are the ones you never had the courage to make. Poppy: [Feeling a surge of determination] You're right. It's my life, and I don't want to live with those kinds of regrets. Owl: [Nodding] Well then, fly away from the nest, Poppy. But not literally—that's my gig. [Poppy takes a deep breath, a new resolve in her eyes. She thanks the owl and starts walking through the forest, the direction now seeming clear. The owl watches her depart with a knowing smirk, then flies off into the night.] --- In this imagined skit, the owl serves as a catalyst for Poppy's self-discovery and decision-making. It's a classic character arc where the protagonist overcomes internal struggle and gains the courage to pursue their true desires, with a little nudge from an unlikely source."},{"instruction":"write a story for kids","output":"Title: Timmy and the Enchanted Garden Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, there lived a boy named Timmy. Timmy was an adventurous soul with a heart as big as the sky and a curiosity that could move mountains. He loved to play in the meadows and listen to the stories the wind told as it danced through the trees. One sunny afternoon, while playing hide and seek with his friends, Timmy stumbled upon a hidden pathway that twisted and turned into the heart of the forest. With a spirited grin and twinkling eyes, he waved goodbye to his friends and promised to be back before dinner. As Timmy ventured down the path, he noticed the trees grew taller, and the colors seemed more vivid. He heard the gentle babbling of a stream and the melodious songs of birds he had never heard before. Enchanted by this unseen part of the forest, he continued until he found himself in a clearing with a breathtaking garden. The garden was unlike anything Timmy had ever seen. It was brimming with flowers of every shade and laughing with the joyous buzz of bees and the delicate flutters of butterflies. In the center of the garden stood a majestic apple tree, its branches heavy with the juiciest, reddest apples Timmy had ever laid eyes on. \\"Why, hello there!\\" a soft voice said, making Timmy spin around. A small, talking rabbit with a coat as white as snow and eyes as blue as forget-me-nots was standing on its hind legs, looking at him. \\"Welcome to the Enchanted Garden,\\" the rabbit continued. \\"I'm Benny. What’s your name?\\" \\"I'm Timmy,\\" he replied, still in awe. \\"Is this garden magic?\\" \\"Indeed, it is,\\" Benny said with a knowing smile. \\"Everything here grows with the help of a special kind of magic—the magic of kindness and good deeds. When a child does something kind in the world outside, a new flower blooms in our garden.\\" Timmy's eyes widened with wonder. \\"How can I help the garden grow?\\" Benny hopped closer and whispered, \\"By being your kind self, Timmy. Do good without expecting a reward, and you'll make the world and this garden a better place.\\" Timmy thought about the kind things he could do. He could help Mrs. Miller carry her groceries, he could share his favorite book with his sister, or even help his friends learn a new game. With a heart full of excitement and a mind swirling with ideas, Timmy thanked the rabbit and said, \\"I'll do my best to spread kindness every day!\\" \\"Remember, Timmy,\\" Benny called out as Timmy started to leave, \\"the magic of kindness is the most powerful magic of all. And it grows inside you.\\" Timmy waved goodbye and headed back through the forest to his home, eager to share his adventure and the secret of the Enchanted Garden. And indeed, with every good deed Timmy did, a new flower bloomed, creating an endless ripple of joy both in his village and in the hidden garden that only the purest of hearts could find. And so, the legend of Timmy and the Enchanted Garden was passed down through generations, a reminder to all children that kindness is the key to unlocking true magic in the world.

Memories make us who we are. They shape our understanding of the world and help us to predict what's coming. For more than a century, researchers have been working to understand how memories are formed and then fixed for recall in the days, weeks or even years that follow.But those scientists might have been looking at only half the picture.\\" To understand how we remember, we must also understand how, and why, we forget. Until about ten years ago, most researchers thought that forgetting was a passive process in which memories,unused, decay over time like a photograph left in the sunlight. But then a handful of researchers' who were investigating memory began to bump up against findings that seemed to contradict that decades-old assumption.They began to put forward the radical idea\\" that the brain is built to forget. A growing body of work', cultivated in the past decade, suggests that the loss of memories is not a passive process. Rather, forgetting seems to be an active mechanism that is constantly at work in the brain. In someperhaps even all-animals, the brain's standard state is not to remember, but to forget. And a better understanding of that state could lead to breakthroughs in treatments forconditions such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and even Alzheimer's disease. \\"What is memory without forgetting?\\" asks Oliver Hardt, a cognitive psychologist\\"studying the neurobiology of memory at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. \\"It's impossible,\\" he says. \\"To have proper memory function, you have to have forgetting.\\" • Biology of forgetting Different types of memory are created and stored in varying ways, and in various areas of the brain'. Researchers are still pinpointing the details, but they know that autobiographical memories-those of events experienced personally\\"—begin to take lasting form in a part of the brain called the hippocampus, in the hours and days that follow the event. Neurons communicate with each other through synapses—junctions between these cells that include a tiny gap across which chemical messengers' can be sent.Each neuron can be connected to thousands of others in this way. Through a process known as synaptic plasticity\\".neurons constantly produce new proteins to remodel parts of the synapse, such as the receptors for these chemicals,which enables the neurons to selectively strengthen their connections with one another . This creates a network of cells that, together, encode a memory\\". The more often a memory is recalled, the stronger its neural network becomes.Over time, and through consistent recall\\", the memory becomes encoded in both the hippocampus and the cortex.Eventually, it exists independently in the cortex, where it is put away for long-term storage\\". Neuroscientists often refer to this physical representation of a memory as an engram. They think that each engram has a number of synaptic connections, sometimes even in several areas of the brain\\", and that each neuron and synapse can be involved in multiple engrams. Much is still unknown about how memories are created and accessed\\", and addressing such mysteries has consumed a lot of memory researchers' time\\". How the brain forgets, by comparison, has been largely overlooked.It's a remarkable oversight', says Michael Anderson,who studies cognitive neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, UK. \\"Every species that has a memory forgets.Full stop, without exception. It doesn't matter how simple the organism is: if they can acquire lessons of experience,the lessons can be lost,\\" he says. \\"In light of that', I find it absolutely stunning that neurobiology has treated forgetting as an afterthought.\\" It wasn't at the forefront of Ron Davis's mind when he uncovered evidence of active forgetting in fruit flies(Drosophila melanogaster) in 2012. Davis, a neuroscientist at the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Florida, was studying the intricacies of memory formation in the flies'mushroom bodies (dense networks of neurons²° in insect brains that store olfactory and other sensory memories).He was especially interested in understanding the influence of dopamine-producing neurons²' that connect with these structures. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, is involved in moderating a host of behaviours\\" in the fly brain, and Davis proposed that this chemical messenger might also play a part in memory. Intriguingly, Davis found that dopamine is essential to forgetting. He and his colleagues conditioned transgenic flies to associate electric shocks with certain odours,thereby training the insects to avoid them. They then activated the dopaminergic neurons and observed that the flies quickly forgot the association. Yet blocking the same neurons preserved the memory.\\"They were regulating how memories could be expressed,\\" Davis says, essentially providing a \\"forget\\" signal. Further investigation, involving a technique that enabled the researchers to monitor the activity of neurons in living flies'\\", flemonstrated that these dopamine neurons are active for long periods, at least in flies. \\"The brain is always trying to forget the information it's already learnt,\\" Davis says. From flies to rodents A few years later, Hardt found something similar in rats. He was investigating what happens at the synapses of neurons that are involved in long-term memory storage\\".Researchers know that memories are encoded in the mammalian brain when the strength of the connection between neurons increases. That connection strength is determined by the amount of a particular type of receptor found at the synapse. Known as AMPA receptors, the presence of these structures' must be maintained for a memory to remain intact. \\"The problem,\\" Hardt says, \\"is that @one df these receptors are stable. They are moved in and out of the synapse constantly and (urn over in hours or days”. Fardt's lab showed that a dedicated mechanism?6 continuously promotes the expression of AMPA receptors at synapses. Yet some memories are still forgotten. Hardt proposed that AMPA receptors can also be removed, which suggests that forgetting is an active process. If that were true, then preventing the removal of AMPA receptors should prevent forgetting. When Hardt and his colleagues blocked the mechanism behind AMPA-receptor removal in the hippocampi of rats, as expected, they found that the rats were prevented from forgetting the locations of objects.To forget certain things, it seemed that the rat brain had to proactively destroy connections at the synapse. Forgetting,Hardt says, \\"is not a failure of memory, but a function of it\\". Paul Frankland, a neuroscientist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, had also found evidence that the brain is wired to forget'. Frankland was studying the production of new neurons, or neurogenesis, in adult mice.The process had long been known to occur in the brains of young animals, but had been discovered in the hippocampi of mature animals only about 20 years earlier. Because the hippocampus is involved in memory formation, Frankland and his team wondered whether increasing neurogenesis in adult mice could help the rodents to remember. In a paper published in 2014²\\", the researchers found precisely the opposite²': rather than making the animals'memories better, increasing neurogenesis caused the mice to forget more. As contradictory as that initially seemed to Frankland, given the assumption that new neurons would mean more capacity for (and potentially better) memory,he says it now makes sense.\\"When neurons integrate into the adult hippocampus, they integrate into an existing,established circuitry. If you have information stored in that circuit and start rewiring it, then it's going to make that information harder to access,\\" he explains. Because the hippocampus is not where long-term memories are stored in the brain, its dynamic nature is not a flaw but a feature °, Frankland says-something that evolved to aid learning. The environment is changing constantly and,to survive, animals must adapt to new situations. Allowing fresh information to overwrite the old²' helps them to achieve that. • Human nature Researchers think that the human brain might operate in a similar way. \\"Our ability to generalize new experiences is, at least in part, due to the fact that our brains engage in controlled forgetting,\\" says Blake Richards, who studies neural circuits and machine learning at the University of Toronto Scarborough. Richards suggests that the brain's ability to forget might prevent an effect known as overfit: in the field of artificial intelligence', this is defined as when a mathematical model is so good at matching the data it has been programmed with that it is unable to predict which data might come next. In a similar way\\", if a person were to remember every detail from an event such as a dog attack-that is, not just the sudden movement that scared the dog at the park,causing it to snarl and bite\\", but also the dog's floppy ears\\",the colour of its owner's T-shirt and the angle of the Sunit might be more difficult for them to generalize across experiences to prevent themselves being bitten again in the future. \\"If you wash out a few details but retain the gist\\"\\", it helps you to use it in novel situations,\\" Richards says. \\"It's entirely possible that our brain engages in a bit of controlled forgetting in order to prevent us from overfitting to our experiences.\\" Studies of people with exceptional autobiographical memories or with impaired ones seem to bear this out²7. People with a condition known as highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM) remember their lives in such incredible detail that\\"\\" they can describe the outfit that they were wearing on any particular day. But despite their exceptional ability to recall such information, these individuals tend not to be particularly accomplished and seem to have an increased tendency for obsessiveness,\\"which is exactly what you'd predict from someone who can't extract themselves from specific instances9, says Brian Levine, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Health Sciences in Toronto. Those with severely deficient autobiographical memory (SDAM), however, are unable to vividly recall specific events in their lives. As a result, they also have trouble imagining what might happen in the future. Yet in Levine's experience, people with SDAM tend to do particularly well in jobs that require abstract thinking\\"0 probably because they are not weighed down by the nittygritty\\". \\"We think SDAM people, through a lifetime of practice of not having episodic memory, have an ability to cut across episodes\\",\\" Levine says. \\"They're good at solving problems.\\" Research on forgetting in people without HSAM or SDAM is also beginning to show how important the process is for a healthy brain. Anderson's team has been digging deep into\\"how active forgetting occurs in humans, using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging\\" and magnetic-resonance spectroscopy\\" to look at levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (y-aminobutyric acid)in the hippocampus. By scanning participants who were attempting to quash certain thoughts, the researchers found that the higher someone's GABA levels were, the more a region of the brain called the prefrontal cortex suppressed their hippocampus, and the better they were at forgetting.\\"We were able to link successful forgetting to a particular neurotransmitter in the brain,\\" Anderson says. • Trying to forget By better understanding how we forget, through the lenses of both biology and cognitive psychology, Anderson and other researchers might be edging nearer to improving treatments for anxiety, PTSD and even Alzheimer's disease. Anderson's work to measure G A B A levels in the brain might indicate a mechanism that underpins the effectiveness of benzodiazepines-anti-anxiety drugs such as diazepam that have been prescribed since the 1960s.Researchers have long known that' such medication works by enhancing the function of 47 GABA receptors, thereby helping to dampen anxiety\\", but they didn't understand why.Anderson's findings offer an explanation: if the prefrontal cortex commands the hippocampus to inhibit a thought, the hippocampus can't respond unless it has enough GABA.\\"The prefrontal cortex is the general, sending commands from on high to suppress activity in the hippocampus,\\"Anderson says. \\"If there aren't troops on the ground, those commands fall on deaf ears19.” GABA's crucial role in suppressing unwanted thoughts'\\" also has implications for phobias, schizophrenia and depression. Various symptoms of these conditionsincluding flashbacks, obsessive thoughts, depressive rumination and difficulty in controlling thoughts-have been linked to an overactive hippocampus. \\"We think we have a key mechanistic framework that links together all of those different symptoms and disorders,\\" Anderson says. His group's research might also have implications for treating PTSD, a condition perceived to be a problem of remembering a traumatic episode too well, but one that, at its root, is really an issue of forgetting. A better understanding of how to help people make traumatic memories less intrusive could help researchers to treat some of the most intractable cases. When Anderson and his colleagues looked at what happens when volunteers suppress unwanted memories-a process he calls motivated forgetting-they found that people who reported more traumatic experiences were particularly good at repressing specific memories. Understanding the cognitive psychology that underlies that ability, as well as the mental resilience that is necessary for developing it, could help to improve treatment for\\" pTSD. Hardt thinks that Alzheimer's disease might also be better understood as a malfunction of forgetting rather than remembering. If forgetting is truly a well-regulated, innate part of the memory process, he says, it makes sense that dysregulation of that process could have negative effects.\\"What if what's actually going on is an overactive forgetting process that goes haywire and erases more than it should?\\"he asks.","output":"The article discusses the importance of forgetting in how the brain works.

Principles of Industrial Hygiene July 28, 2021 The 5 Principles of industrial Hygiene – Chemscape Safety Technologies The Industrial Hygiene Principles: Anticipation, Recognition, Evaluation, Control and Confirm What is Industrial Hygiene? Industrial hygiene, also known as occupational hygiene, is the science and art of protecting and enhancing the health and well-being of workers and citizens of the community. The field of industrial hygiene tackles a wide range of job-related hazards including environmental, chemical, physical, and ergonomic hazards. Environmental Hazards Environmental hazards in the workplace refer to any conditions or substances that can potentially harm the health and safety of employees. These hazards can include exposure to particulate contaminants or gas or vapour contaminants such as mists, fumes, fibres, aerosols, gases, etc. Chemical Hazards Chemical hazards in the workplace refer to the potential risks and dangers posed by chemical compounds which can take the form of gases, solids, liquids, dust, mists, vapours, and fumes. When employees inhale, ingest, or absorb these hazardous chemicals, it can cause detrimental effects on their health. Physical Hazards Physical hazards in the workplace can include the following: Heat: this can occur from working in hot temperatures and being exposed to high levels of humidity or thermal radiation. This can lead to heat exhaustion or heat stroke, which can be life-threatening if not addressed. Noise: high levels of noise can become hazardous over an extended period of time, leading to hearing loss, increased stress levels, and decreased productivity. Radiation: radiation hazards are typically present in nuclear, defence, aviation, and oil and gas industries. Vibration: vibration hazards typically occur in the transportation industry or in factories where heavy equipment is used. To mitigate this problem, workplaces can install shock absorbers and suspension systems in vehicles or utilize specialized mounts to minimize vibrations caused by heavy equipment. Biological Hazards Biological hazards in the workplace refer to the potential risks or dangers that arise from exposure to biological agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. These types of hazards are present in various industries including healthcare, laboratories, agriculture, and food processing. These hazards can lead to illnesses, infections, and even death if not properly managed and controlled. Ergonomic Hazards Ergonomic hazards in the workplace refer to conditions or factors that can cause physical strain or discomfort to employees, potentially leading to injuries or health issues. These hazards can arise from inadequate equipment, repetitive tasks, or poor workplace design. These hazards can result in musculoskeletal disorders such as back pain, neck pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and eye strain. Who is responsible for maintaining industrial hygiene in the workplace? Industrial hygiene is a shared responsibility. Employers are responsible for providing a safe and healthy work environment, conducting risk assessments, implementing control measures, and training employees. Employees also have a responsibility to follow safety protocols, report hazards, and participate in training programs. What Are the 5 Principles of Industrial Hygiene? Occupational hygienists apply the 5 basic principles of industrial hygiene to prevent injury and illness. These are: Anticipation Recognition Evaluation Control Confirm 1. Anticipation of Health Hazards Anticipation of health hazards is the first principle of industrial hygiene, recognizing that prevention is the most effective approach to managing occupational health hazards. This principle typically requires a survey of the workplace design, operations, processes, work tasks, materials and worker population. A current inventory of chemicals and their Safety Data Sheets will quickly identify all the chemical hazards in the workplace. The hazardous properties of each chemical onsite can help to prioritize which hazards need to be investigated. This principle also emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring and evaluation, to continuously identify and address emerging health hazards. 2. Recognition of Health Hazards Recognition of health hazards is the second principle of industrial hygiene. This principle emphasizes the importance of recognizing and understanding the potential hazards of the work environment, internal processes, and job tasks, including chemical and physical hazards at a workplace. For example, do some employees have greater exposure to occupational hazards because they work in an area with poor ventilation? Do their work tasks generate a lot of dust and are their work shifts or tasks longer? This also includes individual work tasks and how they affect adjacent work activities that could create exposure to hazards for other workers in the facility, also called simultaneous operations. Another step in recognizing health hazards is to know if there are occupational exposure limits or restrictions for the hazardous products identified in your chemical inventory. By recognizing these hazards, employers can implement control measures such as engineering controls, administrative controls, or PPE to mitigate the risks and protect the health and safety of workers. 3. Evaluation of Exposure Evaluation of exposure is the third principle in industrial hygiene. After anticipating and recognizing your health hazards, it’s time to evaluate the risk of exposure through an Occupational Exposure assessment. This assessment is crucial determining whether the exposure levels are within acceptable limits and if additional control measures are needed to minimize risk. It typically involves the collection of data through various methods such as air sampling, personal monitoring, and biological monitoring. Due to the complexity of the work environment and the measuring instruments, monitoring should only be done by a qualified professional like an industrial or occupational hygienist. Industrial Hygiene Monitoring Industrial hygiene monitoring captures the exposure level of a certain population of workers during their work activities at a certain time. This measurement can be conducted on those with the highest potential exposure, or a representative exposure, measurements can also refer to a similar exposure group (SEG), workers who perform the same tasks at the same frequency, with similar materials. Industrial hygiene monitoring measures a specific physical, biological or chemical agent where the exposure occurs. Monitoring also needs to consider variations in exposure during different work shifts or facility maintenance activities like turn arounds. Monitoring will have a defined purpose or question it is trying to answer. Generally, it is trying to determine if exposures are safely below or over the occupational exposure limits (OEL) for the hazardous product. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of data from monitoring is used to determine if exposure results are acceptable, unacceptable, or uncertain. Coming to this conclusion requires a knowledge of the occupational exposure limit in the jurisdiction in which you are operating. OELs for long-term and short-term exposure to a hazardous substance vary by province, state, and country. Not all substances in commerce have OELs developed for them. 4. Control Over Worker Exposure Controlling worker exposure is the next principle of industrial hygiene. It refers to the concept of implementing measures to minimize or eliminate workers’ exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace when hazardous exposure is determined to be unacceptable. The hierarchy of controls should be used to guide decisions on a multifaceted approach to exposure control. Although people instinctively think of Personal Protective Equipment or PPE first, it should be the last control applied once elimination, substitution, engineering controls and administrative practices are considered. 5. Confirmation of Control Measures Confirmation of control measures is the last principle of industrial hygiene. This step highlights the importance of assessing the performance of hazard control measures and subsequent worker exposures. Investigating existing or potential issues and applying corrective actions is also part of confirming that your industrial hygiene program is effective. Maintaining data and reports is also key to track and trend the success of your industrial hygiene program to prevent injury, illness, or negative effects to the well-being of workers. By implementing such an industrial hygiene program that is based on all 5 industrial hygiene principles, companies can identify and control potential occupational hazards, thereby reducing the risk of workplace injuries and illnesses. This not only protects the well-being of employees but also helps to maintain a productive workforce. Develop an Industrial Hygiene Program with CHAMP The principles of industrial or occupational hygiene are dynamic and require continual evaluation and reassessment as new hazards are introduced to the workplace and facilities change. Following these principles will protect a workplace’s most valuable asset: its people. Chemscape’s Chemical Hazard Assessment Management Program, also known as CHAMP, has the tools to help you identify and effectively manage the chemical hazards in your workplace.\\"","output":"産業衛生の5つの原則 2021年7月28日 産業衛生の5つの原則- Chemscape Safety Technologies 産業衛生の原則：予見、認識、評価、制御、確認 産業衛生とは何ですか？ 産業衛生、または職業衛生とも呼ばれるものは、労働者と地域の市民の健康と福祉を保護および向上させるための科学と芸術です。産業衛生の分野は、環境、化学物質、物理的および人間工学的な危険を含む、さまざまな職業関連の危険に取り組みます。 環境上の危険 職場での環境上の危険は、労働者の健康と安全に潜在的に害を及ぼす可能性のある条件または物質を指します。これらの危険には、微粒子汚染物質、ガスまたは蒸気汚染物質（霧、粉末、繊維、エアロゾル、ガスなど）への曝露が含まれます。 化学物質の危険 職場での化学物質の危険は、ガス、固体、液体、粉じん、霧、蒸気、煙の形を取る化学物質化合物が引き起こす潜在的なリスクと危険を指します。労働者がこれらの有害化学物質を吸い込み、摂取または吸収すると、それは彼らの健康に悪影響を及ぼす可能性があります。 物理的危険 職場での物理的な危険には次のものが含まれます： 熱：これは高温での作業や高湿度または熱放射にさらされることによって発生することがあります。これにより、熱中症や熱射病が発生し、対処しなければ命に関わることがあります。 騒音：長時間にわたる高い騒音レベルは、聴覚障害、ストレスの増加、生産性の低下を引き起こす危険性があります。 放射線：放射線の危険は通常、原子力、防衛、航空、石油・ガス産業で存在します。 振動：振動の危険は、交通業界や重機が使用される工場で発生することが一般的です。この問題を軽減するために、職場は車両にショックアブソーバーやサスペンションシステムを取り付けるか、重機による振動を最小化するための専用のマウントを利用できます。 生物学的危険 職場での生物学的危険は、細菌、ウイルス、菌類、寄生虫などの生物学的要素への曝露から生じる潜在的なリスクや危険を指します。これらの危険は、医療、研究所、農業、食品加工など、さまざまな業界で存在します。これらの危険は、疾患、感染症、さらには死亡につながる可能性があります。これらの危険を適切に管理および制御しない場合。 人間工学的危険 職場での人間工学的な危険は、従業員に身体的な負担や不快感を引き起こす条件または要因を指します。これにより、負傷や健康問題が引き起こされる可能性があります。これらの危険は、不適切な機器、繰り返しの作業、または労働場所の設計の問題から生じることがあります。これらの危険は、腰痛、首の痛み、手根管症候群、眼精疲労などの筋骨格系の障害に結果としてつながる可能性があります。 職場での産業衛生の維持責任は誰にあるのでしょうか？ 産業衛生は共有責任です。雇用主は安全かつ健康的な労働環境を提供し、リスク評価を実施し、制御措置を実施し、従業員を教育する責任があります。従業員も安全に関するプロトコルに従い、危険を報告し、教育プログラムに参加する責任があります。 産業衛生の5つの原則は何ですか？ 職業衛生士は、傷害や疾病を予防するために産業衛生の5つの基本原則を適用します。これらは次のとおりです： 予見 認識 評価 制御 確認 1. 健康リスクの予見 健康リスクの予見は、産業衛生の第一の原則であり、予防が職業健康リスクを管理するための最も効果的なアプローチであることを認識しています。この原則では、職場の設計、運用、プロセス、作業タスク、材料、労働者人口の調査が通常必要です。現在の化学物質の在庫とそれらの安全データシートは、すばやく職場の化学物質の危険を特定するのに役立ちます。現場の各化学物質の有害性は、調査する必要のある危険を優先順位付けするのに役立ちます。 この原則はまた、新たに現れる健康リスクを継続的に特定し対処するための監視と評価の重要性を強調しています。 2. 健康リスクの認識 健康リスクの認識は、産業衛生の第二の原則です。この原則では、作業環境、内部プロセス、および作業タスクにおける潜在的なリスクや危険、職場での化学物質や物理的な危険を認識し理解することの重要性が強調されます。たとえば、換気が悪いエリアで作業するために一部の従業員が職業的な危険により大きな曝露を受けることはありますか？彼らの作業タスクは多くの粉塵を発生させ、彼らの作業シフトやタスクは長いですか？これはまた、個々の作業タスクと隣接する作業活動が他の労働者に危険にさらす可能性がある方法、つまり同時運用と呼ばれるものも含まれます。 健康リスクの認識のもう一つのステップは、化学物質の在庫で特定された有害製品に対して職業的な曝露限界や制限があるかどうかを知ることです。これらの危険を認識することで、雇用主は工学的制御、管理的制御、個人防護具（PPE）などの制御措置を実施してリスクを軽減し、労"},{"instruction":"Can you show me the code for a simple convnet using PyTorch?I'm going to tip 200 for a perfect solution!","output":"Sure, below is a simple example code of a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) using PyTorch.

We often think of memory as a powerful tool that shapes our understanding of the world and predicts our future. But what if I told you that forgetting is just as crucial to how our brains work? For years, researchers believed that forgetting was a passive process, where memories decayed over time. However, recent studies have presented a different perspective. Forgetting is an active mechanism constantly at work in the brain. It is not a failure of memory, but a function of it. Different types of memories are stored in various areas of the brain. Autobiographical memories, for example, begin to take shape in the hippocampus. These memories are encoded in neural networks, and the more a memory is recalled, the stronger the network becomes. Eventually, the memory exists independently in the cortex for long-term storage. Studies conducted on fruit flies and rats have further emphasized the active nature of forgetting. In fruit flies, activating dopamine neurons leads to forgetting, while blocking them preserves memory. In rats, preventing the removal of specific receptors prevents forgetting certain object locations. These findings suggest that forgetting is an inherent process in the brain, serving a purpose in memory formation and adaptation. Understanding the importance of forgetting has significant implications. It can help us develop breakthroughs in treatments for conditions such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and even Alzheimer’s disease. By understanding how we forget, we can better understand the mechanism behind anti-anxiety drugs, improve treatment for PTSD, and explore new avenues for understanding Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, forgetting plays a role in our ability to generalize and adapt to new experiences. Our brain engages in controlled forgetting to prevent overfitting to our experiences. It allows us to wash out unnecessary details and retain the essence of an event, which we can then apply to novel situations. This cognitive process of forgetting has been observed in studies of people with exceptional autobiographical memories or severely deficient autobiographical memory. In conclusion, forgetting is not a glitch of memory but an essential aspect of how our brains function. It allows us to adapt, generalize, and make sense of the ever-changing world around us. By exploring the mechanisms of forgetting, we can unlock potential breakthroughs in treating various conditions and improving memory function.

Вот несколько советов и стратегий, которые могут помочь вам играть на ничью: 1. Избегайте подставления под удар: Постарайтесь держать вашу дамку на безопасном расстоянии от дамок противника, чтобы избежать потери шашки. 2. Используйте блокировку: Попытайтесь блокировать движения дамок противника, занимая ключевые точки на доске. 3. Двигайтесь по краям: Иногда целесообразно держать свою дамку на краю доски, где существуют меньше возможностей для нападения соперником. 4. Учитывайте повторение позиций: Если вы сможете зафиксировать повторение одной и той же позиции на доске три раза (не обязательно подряд), то согласно правилам шашек, это может быть заявлено как ничья. 5. Тяните время: В официальных соревнованиях часто используются часы, и если правила предусматривают возможность ничьей при определенном количестве ходов без взятия шашек (в международных шашках обычно 25 ходов), оставайтесь настолько пассивными, насколько это возможно, чтобы истекло необходимое количество ходов и была объявлена ничья. 6. Противодействуйте угрозам: Если противник пытается устроить ловушку или прорваться к вашим базовым линиям, делайте все возможное, чтобы предотвратить эти угрозы, при этом не совершая необдуманных ходов, которые могут привести к потере вашей дамки. Однако следует понимать, что если ваш соперник будет играть аккуратно и технично, шансы на то, что вы сможете удерживать ничью, будут невелики.

Due to the complexity of the work environment and the measuring instruments, monitoring should only be done by a qualified professional like an industrial or occupational hygienist. Industrial Hygiene Monitoring Industrial hygiene monitoring captures the exposure level of a certain population of workers during their work activities at a certain time. This measurement can be conducted on those with the highest potential exposure, or a representative exposure, measurements can also refer to a similar exposure group (SEG), workers who perform the same tasks at the same frequency, with similar materials. Industrial hygiene monitoring measures a specific physical, biological or chemical agent where the exposure occurs. Monitoring also needs to consider variations in exposure during different work shifts or facility maintenance activities like turn arounds. Monitoring will have a defined purpose or question it is trying to answer. Generally, it is trying to determine if exposures are safely below or over the occupational exposure limits (OEL) for the hazardous product. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of data from monitoring is used to determine if exposure results are acceptable, unacceptable, or uncertain. Coming to this conclusion requires a knowledge of the occupational exposure limit in the jurisdiction in which you are operating. OELs for long-term and short-term exposure to a hazardous substance vary by province, state, and country. Not all substances in commerce have OELs developed for them. 4. Control Over Worker Exposure Controlling worker exposure is the next principle of industrial hygiene. It refers to the concept of implementing measures to minimize or eliminate workers’ exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace when hazardous exposure is determined to be unacceptable. The hierarchy of controls should be used to guide decisions on a multifaceted approach to exposure control. Although people instinctively think of Personal Protective Equipment or PPE first, it should be the last control applied once elimination, substitution, engineering controls and administrative practices are considered. 5. Confirmation of Control Measures Confirmation of control measures is the last principle of industrial hygiene. This step highlights the importance of assessing the performance of hazard control measures and subsequent worker exposures. Investigating existing or potential issues and applying corrective actions is also part of confirming that your industrial hygiene program is effective. Maintaining data and reports is also key to track and trend the success of your industrial hygiene program to prevent injury, illness, or negative effects to the well-being of workers. By implementing such an industrial hygiene program that is based on all 5 industrial hygiene principles, companies can identify and control potential occupational hazards, thereby reducing the risk of workplace injuries and illnesses. This not only protects the well-being of employees but also helps to maintain a productive workforce. Develop an Industrial Hygiene Program with CHAMP The principles of industrial or occupational hygiene are dynamic and require continual evaluation and reassessment as new hazards are introduced to the workplace and facilities change. Following these principles will protect a workplace’s most valuable asset: its people.

Memories make us who we are. They shape our understanding of the world and help us to predict what's coming. For more than a century, researchers have been working to understand how memories are formed and then fixed for recall in the days, weeks or even years that follow.But those scientists might have been looking at only half the picture.\\" To understand how we remember, we must also understand how, and why, we forget. Until about ten years ago, most researchers thought that forgetting was a passive process in which memories,unused, decay over time like a photograph left in the sunlight. But then a handful of researchers' who were investigating memory began to bump up against findings that seemed to contradict that decades-old assumption.They began to put forward the radical idea\\" that the brain is built to forget. A growing body of work', cultivated in the past decade, suggests that the loss of memories is not a passive process. Rather, forgetting seems to be an active mechanism that is constantly at work in the brain. In someperhaps even all-animals, the brain's standard state is not to remember, but to forget. And a better understanding of that state could lead to breakthroughs in treatments forconditions such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and even Alzheimer's disease. \\"What is memory without forgetting?\\" asks Oliver Hardt, a cognitive psychologist\\"studying the neurobiology of memory at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. \\"It's impossible,\\" he says. \\"To have proper memory function, you have to have forgetting.\\" • Biology of forgetting Different types of memory are created and stored in varying ways, and in various areas of the brain'. Researchers are still pinpointing the details, but they know that autobiographical memories-those of events experienced personally\\"—begin to take lasting form in a part of the brain called the hippocampus, in the hours and days that follow the event. Neurons communicate with each other through synapses—junctions between these cells that include a tiny gap across which chemical messengers' can be sent.Each neuron can be connected to thousands of others in this way. Through a process known as synaptic plasticity\\".neurons constantly produce new proteins to remodel parts of the synapse, such as the receptors for these chemicals,which enables the neurons to selectively strengthen their connections with one another . This creates a network of cells that, together, encode a memory\\". The more often a memory is recalled, the stronger its neural network becomes.Over time, and through consistent recall\\", the memory becomes encoded in both the hippocampus and the cortex.Eventually, it exists independently in the cortex, where it is put away for long-term storage\\". Neuroscientists often refer to this physical representation of a memory as an engram. They think that each engram has a number of synaptic connections, sometimes even in several areas of the brain\\", and that each neuron and synapse can be involved in multiple engrams. Much is still unknown about how memories are created and accessed\\", and addressing such mysteries has consumed a lot of memory researchers' time\\". How the brain forgets, by comparison, has been largely overlooked.It's a remarkable oversight', says Michael Anderson,who studies cognitive neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, UK. \\"Every species that has a memory forgets.Full stop, without exception. It doesn't matter how simple the organism is: if they can acquire lessons of experience,the lessons can be lost,\\" he says. \\"In light of that', I find it absolutely stunning that neurobiology has treated forgetting as an afterthought.\\" It wasn't at the forefront of Ron Davis's mind when he uncovered evidence of active forgetting in fruit flies(Drosophila melanogaster) in 2012. Davis, a neuroscientist at the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Florida, was studying the intricacies of memory formation in the flies'mushroom bodies (dense networks of neurons²° in insect brains that store olfactory and other sensory memories).He was especially interested in understanding the influence of dopamine-producing neurons²' that connect with these structures. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, is involved in moderating a host of behaviours\\" in the fly brain, and Davis proposed that this chemical messenger might also play a part in memory. Intriguingly, Davis found that dopamine is essential to forgetting. He and his colleagues conditioned transgenic flies to associate electric shocks with certain odours,thereby training the insects to avoid them. They then activated the dopaminergic neurons and observed that the flies quickly forgot the association. Yet blocking the same neurons preserved the memory.\\"They were regulating how memories could be expressed,\\" Davis says, essentially providing a \\"forget\\" signal. Further investigation, involving a technique that enabled the researchers to monitor the activity of neurons in living flies'\\", flemonstrated that these dopamine neurons are active for long periods, at least in flies. \\"The brain is always trying to forget the information it's already learnt,\\" Davis says. From flies to rodents A few years later, Hardt found something similar in rats. He was investigating what happens at the synapses of neurons that are involved in long-term memory storage\\".Researchers know that memories are encoded in the mammalian brain when the strength of the connection between neurons increases. That connection strength is determined by the amount of a particular type of receptor found at the synapse. Known as AMPA receptors, the presence of these structures' must be maintained for a memory to remain intact. \\"The problem,\\" Hardt says, \\"is that @one df these receptors are stable. They are moved in and out of the synapse constantly and (urn over in hours or days”. Fardt's lab showed that a dedicated mechanism?6 continuously promotes the expression of AMPA receptors at synapses. Yet some memories are still forgotten. Hardt proposed that AMPA receptors can also be removed, which suggests that forgetting is an active process. If that were true, then preventing the removal of AMPA receptors should prevent forgetting. When Hardt and his colleagues blocked the mechanism behind AMPA-receptor removal in the hippocampi of rats, as expected, they found that the rats were prevented from forgetting the locations of objects.To forget certain things, it seemed that the rat brain had to proactively destroy connections at the synapse. Forgetting,Hardt says, \\"is not a failure of memory, but a function of it\\". Paul Frankland, a neuroscientist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, had also found evidence that the brain is wired to forget'. Frankland was studying the production of new neurons, or neurogenesis, in adult mice.The process had long been known to occur in the brains of young animals, but had been discovered in the hippocampi of mature animals only about 20 years earlier. Because the hippocampus is involved in memory formation, Frankland and his team wondered whether increasing neurogenesis in adult mice could help the rodents to remember. In a paper published in 2014²\\", the researchers found precisely the opposite²': rather than making the animals'memories better, increasing neurogenesis caused the mice to forget more. As contradictory as that initially seemed to Frankland, given the assumption that new neurons would mean more capacity for (and potentially better) memory,he says it now makes sense.\\"When neurons integrate into the adult hippocampus, they integrate into an existing,established circuitry. If you have information stored in that circuit and start rewiring it, then it's going to make that information harder to access,\\" he explains. Because the hippocampus is not where long-term memories are stored in the brain, its dynamic nature is not a flaw but a feature °, Frankland says-something that evolved to aid learning. The environment is changing constantly and,to survive, animals must adapt to new situations. Allowing fresh information to overwrite the old²' helps them to achieve that. • Human nature Researchers think that the human brain might operate in a similar way. \\"Our ability to generalize new experiences is, at least in part, due to the fact that our brains engage in controlled forgetting,\\" says Blake Richards, who studies neural circuits and machine learning at the University of Toronto Scarborough. Richards suggests that the brain's ability to forget might prevent an effect known as overfit: in the field of artificial intelligence', this is defined as when a mathematical model is so good at matching the data it has been programmed with that it is unable to predict which data might come next. In a similar way\\", if a person were to remember every detail from an event such as a dog attack-that is, not just the sudden movement that scared the dog at the park,causing it to snarl and bite\\", but also the dog's floppy ears\\",the colour of its owner's T-shirt and the angle of the Sunit might be more difficult for them to generalize across experiences to prevent themselves being bitten again in the future. \\"If you wash out a few details but retain the gist\\"\\", it helps you to use it in novel situations,\\" Richards says. \\"It's entirely possible that our brain engages in a bit of controlled forgetting in order to prevent us from overfitting to our experiences.\\" Studies of people with exceptional autobiographical memories or with impaired ones seem to bear this out²7. People with a condition known as highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM) remember their lives in such incredible detail that\\"\\" they can describe the outfit that they were wearing on any particular day. But despite their exceptional ability to recall such information, these individuals tend not to be particularly accomplished and seem to have an increased tendency for obsessiveness,\\"which is exactly what you'd predict from someone who can't extract themselves from specific instances9, says Brian Levine, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Health Sciences in Toronto. Those with severely deficient autobiographical memory (SDAM), however, are unable to vividly recall specific events in their lives. As a result, they also have trouble imagining what might happen in the future. Yet in Levine's experience, people with SDAM tend to do particularly well in jobs that require abstract thinking\\"0 probably because they are not weighed down by the nittygritty\\". \\"We think SDAM people, through a lifetime of practice of not having episodic memory, have an ability to cut across episodes\\",\\" Levine says. \\"They're good at solving problems.\\" Research on forgetting in people without HSAM or SDAM is also beginning to show how important the process is for a healthy brain. Anderson's team has been digging deep into\\"how active forgetting occurs in humans, using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging\\" and magnetic-resonance spectroscopy\\" to look at levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (y-aminobutyric acid)in the hippocampus. By scanning participants who were attempting to quash certain thoughts, the researchers found that the higher someone's GABA levels were, the more a region of the brain called the prefrontal cortex suppressed their hippocampus, and the better they were at forgetting.\\"We were able to link successful forgetting to a particular neurotransmitter in the brain,\\" Anderson says. • Trying to forget By better understanding how we forget, through the lenses of both biology and cognitive psychology, Anderson and other researchers might be edging nearer to improving treatments for anxiety, PTSD and even Alzheimer's disease. Anderson's work to measure G A B A levels in the brain might indicate a mechanism that underpins the effectiveness of benzodiazepines-anti-anxiety drugs such as diazepam that have been prescribed since the 1960s.Researchers have long known that' such medication works by enhancing the function of 47 GABA receptors, thereby helping to dampen anxiety\\", but they didn't understand why.Anderson's findings offer an explanation: if the prefrontal cortex commands the hippocampus to inhibit a thought, the hippocampus can't respond unless it has enough GABA.\\"The prefrontal cortex is the general, sending commands from on high to suppress activity in the hippocampus,\\"Anderson says. \\"If there aren't troops on the ground, those commands fall on deaf ears19.” GABA's crucial role in suppressing unwanted thoughts'\\" also has implications for phobias, schizophrenia and depression. Various symptoms of these conditionsincluding flashbacks, obsessive thoughts, depressive rumination and difficulty in controlling thoughts-have been linked to an overactive hippocampus. \\"We think we have a key mechanistic framework that links together all of those different symptoms and disorders,\\" Anderson says. His group's research might also have implications for treating PTSD, a condition perceived to be a problem of remembering a traumatic episode too well, but one that, at its root, is really an issue of forgetting. A better understanding of how to help people make traumatic memories less intrusive could help researchers to treat some of the most intractable cases. When Anderson and his colleagues looked at what happens when volunteers suppress unwanted memories-a process he calls motivated forgetting-they found that people who reported more traumatic experiences were particularly good at repressing specific memories. Understanding the cognitive psychology that underlies that ability, as well as the mental resilience that is necessary for developing it, could help to improve treatment for\\" pTSD. Hardt thinks that Alzheimer's disease might also be better understood as a malfunction of forgetting rather than remembering. If forgetting is truly a well-regulated, innate part of the memory process, he says, it makes sense that dysregulation of that process could have negative effects.\\"What if what's actually going on is an overactive forgetting process that goes haywire and erases more than it should?\\"he asks.","output":"Ladies and gentlemen, Today, I want to talk to you about a topic that has fascinated researchers for decades but has been largely overlooked until recently: the ability to forget. Memories are an integral part of who we are, shaping our understanding of the world and helping us predict the future. However, scientists are now realizing that forgetting is just as crucial to how the brain works. For many years, the prevailing belief was that forgetting was a passive process, where memories decay over time. But a decade ago, researchers began putting forward the radical idea that the brain is built to forget.

Studies on fruit flies, rodents, and humans have shown that active forgetting is necessary for our brains to adapt to new situations and to prevent overfitting of information. The implications of this research are significant. By understanding how we forget, researchers can potentially develop breakthrough treatments for conditions like anxiety, PTSD, and even Alzheimer's disease. For example, understanding the role of the neurotransmitter GABA in suppressing unwanted thoughts could lead to better treatments for anxiety disorders. And by understanding the cognitive psychology behind motivated forgetting, we can improve treatment for PTSD. In conclusion, memories make us who we are, but forgetting is just as important. It is an active mechanism constantly at work in our brains. By studying how we forget, researchers are gaining valuable insights that can improve our understanding of memory disorders and potentially lead to more effective treatments. So let us embrace the power of forgetting and continue to unlock the mysteries of the human brain.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate & energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&lang=ES&cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate & energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ<0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ & T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27.

In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals.

This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate & energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA & PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS & TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood. CONTAMINATION DERIVED FROM THE PRODUCTION OF WINDOWS Energy MJ/kg kgCO2 /kg Aluminium 0% recycled 266.09 39.10 Aluminium 20% recycled 221.82 32.58 FSC wood 4.00 0.21 Reused wood 0.00 0.00. C3. HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of <20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C (tm): 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):> 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde & SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70.

In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, now using and quoting the book (the information given above) write an essay in the context of a Typology Review The Typology Review is a study of a particular building type, based on analysis and critical examination of relevant examples. The question of type has generated broad discussion in architectural studies. The type of an architectural project/building may be defined with respect to various of its characteristics (urban, programmatic, spatial); most commonly, buildings are classified in types according to use (churches, hospitals, town halls, etc) or form (morphology) (Forty, 2000, p. 304). Thus, the term typology may refer both to the study of a specific building type and its representative features, and to the comprehensive study of a relevant/exemplary project. In this unit we focus primarily on housing i.e., residential typology; we will study housing designs with respect to their form and according to the following broad categories: block, tower, slab, urban villa, terrace, courtyard, etc. Collective housing and the question of density Following the industrial revolution and especially since the end of 18th century / beginning of 19th, accumulation of people in cities intensified and housing design focused mainly on different forms of collective housing. In collective housing, each household / housing unit (apartment, loft, duplex) makes part of a bigger community, the residential complex, where certain aspects of living (access, recreation, amenities, working spaces, etc.) are shared. Rising of urban populations has created a rupture between the urban (condensation) and the rural (dispersion) and created liminal zones with varying density (of both people and activities), and lesser defined characteristics comparing to urban centres. Housing on the edge of the city has become synonymous with suburban, ‘cookie-cutter’ designs and urban sprawl, the ‘spilling’ of lower density urbanisation (single-family housing) onto large zones of land, leading to the destruction of wild-life habitats and unsustainable developments. In this unit you are required to analyse the question of density with respect to a chosen historical precedent of collective housing (see list of housing projects on Canvas), as well as in relation to Canford Heath area, situated on the edge of Poole. You are asked to write a 2500-3000 typology review, critically presenting the design vision of your chosen precedent. Your essay need be illustrated with analytical material (sketches, drawings, visualisations) produced during the design studio workshops throughout the term, as well as with appropriate imagery, extracted from reliable academic sources. Your analysis should draw on available literature (see relevant Key Texts on Canvas) and tackle all scales of the project (urban; neighbourhood / building; unit). now first write the introduction using the template A. INTRODUCTION (300-350 words) In this opening section of your essay, you present the purpose of the study and outline the problem to be solved. Consider the following: ✓ How is density defined in terms of housing? What issues are linked to building on the edge of the city? Why is the question of building on the edge particularly important in the current day and time, in the British housing context, and particularly around Bournemouth and Poole? ✓ Give a few details about the historical precedent you will analyse (location, design / construction date, architect(s)) and the residential typology to which it corresponds (block, tower, slab, urban villa, terrace, courtyard, ...). ✓ Explain in a few words how the typology of your precedent addresses the question of density. In what way does this particular project represent /reinterpret this approach? Remember to specify whether the project was built within a city or on its edges and, briefly, how this has impacted the design idea.","output":"A. INTRODUCTION The study of residential typologies, particularly collective housing, is of critical importance in understanding how density shapes urban environments and carries implications for community life, sustainability, and the use of resources. Density in housing not only refers to the number of units per land area but also touches on the intensity of social interactions, access to communal amenities, and the overall quality of living spaces. In the context of Bournemouth and Poole, the surge in the urban periphery's residential developments underscores the pertinence of re-evaluating housing on the city's edge. These areas, including Canford Heath, grapple with the challenges of urban sprawl and ecological impact while striving to offer attractive, affordable, and sustainable living options. This essay will delve into the \\"Life Reusing Posidonia\\" project, a contemporary, eco-conscious approach to collective housing situated in Sant Ferran, Formentera. Conceived between 2013 and 2015 and developed by the Institut Balear de l'Habitatge, the housing typology presents an innovative integration of block and courtyard elements, reflective of its unique island context. The architects responsible, notable for their environmentally and socio-culturally responsive design philosophy, sought to create fourteen housing units that are characterized by a profound respect for local traditions and a low environmental footprint. \\"Life Reusing Posidonia\\" addresses the question of density by prioritizing the ecosystem's health without compromising on habitability. The utilization of dried Posidonia oceanica, a seagrass endemic to the Mediterranean, as insulation, signifies a return to historical construction practices while advancing modern sustainable methods. This chosen project illustrates a reinterpretation of housing on the edge by showcasing how edge conditions can be harmoniously addressed through a low-tech, resource-efficient strategy. By examining this project's response to the edges of Formentera, this essay aims to uncover how innovative design interventions can preserve ecological integrity, foster community, and redefine the quality of living on the periphery of urban centers."},{"instruction":"great, now write the next section using the book and this template, 1. Context (400-450 words) Here, you will relate the history of the project, the general premises of the design, and how it came into being.

Context \\"Life Reusing Posidonia,\\" championed by the Institut Balear de l'Habitatge (IBAVI), stands as a symbol of sustainable architecture and innovative environmental stewardship, conceived in the spirit of responding to society's contemporary and future needs. The project arose from a design team composed of Carles Oliver, Maria del Mar Amengual, Miquel Ramón, and others, under the thoughtful leadership of Marc Pons i Pons, the then-president of IBAVI and Minister of Territory, Energy, and Mobility. The building's architects found themselves at a career juncture where the convergence of social purpose housing and environmental consciousness was paramount. This initiative aligned with their previous work, dedicated to creating housing that offered both social and environmental sustainability. The team had a consistent philosophy that emphasized using local resources and traditional construction practices while embracing novel techniques for mitigating ecological impact. The client was the Govern de les Illes Balears, with an aspiration to forge a flagship sustainable housing project. The principal goals included the promotion of social housing that not only met the inhabitants' needs but did so through an environmentally responsible approach. \\"Life Reusing Posidonia\\" was conceived as part of the European Union-recognized LIFE+ 2012 initiative and was funded under this program, demonstrating its essence as a public housing model that valued ecological innovation. The project emerged as a response to the challenges of climate change, particularly urgent in island regions such as the Balearic Islands, which are profoundly susceptible to its impacts. The design team saw this vulnerability as an opportunity for these regions to act as \\"laboratories\\" leading the way in climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. The era called for integrating environmental governance into housing, which led to a holistic approach where sustainable power usage and cutting-edge technologies were not viewed as contrary to cost efficiency. The project sought to cement the Balearic Islands as a Mediterranean beacon in bio-architecture. Artistically, \\"Life Reusing Posidonia\\" harkened back to local cultural traditions within Formentera, honoring and enhancing them through an environmentally sensitive design approach. Notably, the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as thermal insulation material was a practice inspired by the island's vernacular methods, bridging heritage with innovation. Moreover, the project's timing coincided with a growing global awareness and advocacy for greener building practices, thus situating it at the forefront of contemporary architectural discourse. The end result was a housing development that not only attuned to its socioeconomic context but also became a part of the broader movement towards sustainable living solutions, encapsulating the drive for ecological conservation while addressing the growing demands of affordable public housing."},{"instruction":"drawWheel() { const numberOfSectors = this.sectorColors.length;

i < numberOfSectors; i++) { // ...之前的绘制代码... // 绘制图片的代码，确保已经加载 const imageAngle = textAngle + Math.PI / 2 + currentAngle; const imageX = this.centerX + Math.cos(imageAngle) * this.radius * 0.55; const imageY = this.centerY + Math.sin(imageAngle) * this.radius * 0.55; const image = this.loadedImages[prizenum]; // 假设这个数组已经包含了预加载的图片 this.ctx.save(); this.ctx.translate(imageX, imageY); this.ctx.rotate(imageAngle); this.ctx.drawImage(image, -imageWidth / 2, -imageHeight / 2, imageWidth, imageHeight); this.ctx.restore(); } } startSpin() { // ...其他代码... const spinAnimation = () => { // ...其他代码... this.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height); this.ctx.save(); this.ctx.translate(this.centerX, this.centerY); this.ctx.rotate(currentAngle); this.ctx.translate(-this.centerX, -this.centerY); this.drawWheel(currentAngle); // 注意传入当前角度 this.ctx.restore(); requestAnimationFrame(spinAnimation); }; // ...其他代码... } // ...其他方法... } \`\`\` 在上述代码中，我们现在传递\`currentAngle\`给\`drawWheel()\`方法，表示转盘当前旋转的角度。然后，在这个方法内每次绘制扇形之后，我们也同步地计算和绘制与其绑定的图片。这样，每当扇形绘制更新时，其对应的图片也会随之更新，从而保持图片和扇形的同步。"},{"instruction":"JS中canvas元素叠加在一起后，如何将二者绑定变成一个整体","output":"在JavaScript中使用\`<canvas>\`元素时，绘制在该元素上的内容并不是以对象的形式存在的，就像在画纸上绘画一样，一旦你绘制了图形或图片，它就是画布内容的一部分。如果你想将两个\`<canvas>\`元素叠加在一起并使之表现为一个整体，你可以通过几种方法来实现。 1. 使用CSS绝对定位来叠加两个\`<canvas>\`： 你可以通过CSS的定位属性\`position: absolute;\`使两个\`<canvas>\`元素叠加在一起，这样它们在视觉上会表现为整体。通过CSS，设置它们具有相同的位置。 \`\`\`html <div style=\\"position: relative;\\"> <canvas id=\\"canvas1\\" width=\\"300\\" height=\\"300\\" style=\\"position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0;\\"></canvas> <canvas id=\\"canvas2\\" width=\\"300\\" height=\\"300\\" style=\\"position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0;\\"></canvas> </div> \`\`\` 这种方式的问题在于，虽然它们在视觉上堆叠起来，但实际上它们仍然是两个独立的\`<canvas>\`元素。这意味着每个\`<canvas>\`仍有各自的绘图上下文，且任何对其中一个的操作都不会影响另一个。 2. 合并两个\`<canvas>\`内容到一个\`<canvas>\`: 如果你想在代码中操作它们作为一个整体，最好的方式是只使用一个\`<canvas>\`元素，然后使用JavaScript将两个画布的内容合成到一起。可以先在一个\`<canvas>\`上绘制内容，然后再绘制另一个\`<canvas>\`的内容。 \`\`\`javascript // 获取第一个canvas的绘制上下文并绘制 var canvas1 = document.getElementById('canvas1'); var ctx1 = canvas1.getContext('2d'); // ...在canvas1上绘制... // 获取第二个canvas的绘制上下文并绘制 var canvas2 = document.getElementById('canvas2'); var ctx2 = canvas2.getContext('2d'); // ...在canvas2上绘制... // 将canvas2的内容绘制到canvas1上，实现合并 ctx1.drawImage(canvas2, 0, 0); \`\`\` 上述代码中，\`drawImage\`方法被用于将第二个画布的内容绘制到第一个画布上。这样，第一个\`<canvas>\`就包含了两者的内容，可以作为一个整体进行进一步的操作。 3. 利用\`OffscreenCanvas\`: 如果你想在工作线程中使用\`<canvas>\`而不影响主线程，\`OffscreenCanvas\`提供了一个非常有用的功能。使用它可以在web worker中创建和操作canvas，并将操作的结果传递回主线程。这样，你可以把多个\`OffscreenCanvas\`绘制结果合并后，再传递给主线程的\`<canvas>\`元素。 选择哪种方法取决于你的具体应用场景和需求。通常，最直接和常用的方法是第二种，即在代码中合并两个画布的内容。这样做可以确保单个\`<canvas>\`元素反映了所有的绘图操作，方便之后的处理和交互。"},{"instruction":"class Turntable { constructor(canvasId) { this.canvas = document.getElementById(canvasId);

}, 100); // 用setTimeout添加一点延迟，确保画布重新绘制结束。 return; // 停止旋转 } // ...之后是旋转动画的代码... \`\`\` 完成以上修订之后，每次旋转结束时，都会有中奖信息展示给用户。 确保您已经合适地实现了模态框或其他形式的弹出框来比\`alert\`提供更好的用户体验，并展示获奖图片。如果您没有预先准备好的弹窗组件或方法，您将需要创建这样一个组件，但它超出了这里简短示例代码的范围。 在实际开发中，您还需要考虑到错误处理和更加复杂的用户界面反馈，比如在屏幕中心展示一个精美的中奖提示而不是简单的弹窗。"},{"instruction":"Write me a story about the Wordgirl villain Butcher getting caught in a snowstorm and almost freezing to death when the other villains find him shivering in the snow about to pass out and bring him to the warehouse base to warm up.","output":"Once upon a time in the city of Fair City, the Wordgirl villains were up to their usual mischievous activities. Among them was the notorious Butcher, a clever and cunning adversary. But on one icy winter day, fate intervened and tested the super-villain's abilities in a way he never expected. A heavy snowstorm had swept across the city, blanketing every inch in a thick layer of snow. Streets were deserted, and the chilling winds howled through the empty alleyways. Butcher, however, was determined not to let any weather hinder his villainous exploits. He had a plan to steal a valuable artifact from the city's museum. Unaware of the approaching storm, Butcher ventured out into the freezing night. As he trudged through the snow, the cold began to seep deep into his bones. With each step, the temperature dropped, and visibility became nonexistent. Butcher's confidence turned into concern as the storm intensified, engulfing him in its icy grasp. Shivering uncontrollably, Butcher realized he was lost. His usual sense of direction was useless against the piercing snowfall. Exhaustion and fear began to take hold, and his steps became sluggish. As he stumbled through the snow-filled streets, his vision blurred, and his body weakened. Meanwhile, the other Wordgirl villains had returned to their secret hideout, a disused warehouse on the outskirts of Fair City. The Butcher was nowhere to be found, and his absence worried the gang. Determined not to let any villain fall victim to the storm, they decided to venture out and search for him. Experiencing their own challenges against the harsh weather, the villains braved the elements to find their ally. Finally, Flimflam, Victoria Best, and Dr. Two-Brains stumbled upon a frail figure huddled in a snowbank. It was Butcher, his lips blue, and his body shivering uncontrollably. Without hesitation, the villains quickly scooped him up from the snow and carried him back towards their hideout. As they reached the warehouse, they laid Butcher near a roaring fire, wrapped him in warm blankets, and surrounded him with hot water bottles. Gradually, the warmth revived Butcher, and he opened his eyes to see his fellow villains tending to him. His usual arrogant and prideful demeanor softened as gratitude flooded his heart. He realized that sometimes, even villains needed help. As the storm continued its wrath outside, the gang spent the night together in the warehouse, laughing, sharing stories, and battling the cold. Walls once built on deception and rivalry began to crumble as they discovered the power of unity, even in the face of adversity. With the storm finally subsiding, the villains bid farewell to Butcher, who was now fully recovered and ready to face his next villainous schemes. But something had changed within him. He now knew that the camaraderie and support of his fellow villains were as invaluable as his own wits. From that day forward, whenever the villains encountered a storm, whether metaphorical or literal, they would always find solace and support within the walls of their secret hideout. And as they planned their next villainous escapade, they would always remember the time they saved Butcher from the frigid clutches of the snowstorm. And so, the story of Butcher's near-fatal encounter with the snowstorm became a lasting reminder that friendship and compassion can thaw even the coldest of hearts. And as always, Wordgirl and her allies would remain ever vigilant, ready to face any challenge their villains might throw their way."},{"instruction":"Two Brains asks how Butcher ended up getting caught in the snowstorm and Butcher, through his sneezing, explains that he was planning a museum heist but got lost thanks to the snow.","output":"Dr. Two-Brains had always been the curious type, so it was no surprise when he piped up, his voice filled with intrigue. \\"Butcher, my friend, do enlighten us. How did you end up getting caught in the snowstorm?\\" Butcher, still trembling from his chilling ordeal, managed to produce a slight chuckle before erupting into a series of uncontrollable sneezes. His voice strained, he began to explain between sneezes. \\"Well, you see, fellas,\\" Butcher sniffled, \\"I was planning an extraordinary heist at the city's esteemed museum. There was a valuable artifact I simply couldn't resist! The snowfall had caught me by surprise, obscuring my path, and as I made my way through the deserted streets, I lost track of my usual landmarks.\\" Sneezing once more, Butcher continued, \\"The snow was so thick, I could barely see three feet ahead. My renowned sense of direction failed me, and I found myself wandering aimlessly, each step dragging me further into the wintry abyss.\\" As Butcher's tale unfolded, the other villains listened intently, their fascination growing. Flimflam, always impressed by Butcher's cunning, leaned forward, his eyes wide with intrigue. \\"Butcher, my man, you usually have a plan for everything. How did you end up getting so lost?

The snowstorm was relentless, disguising familiar landmarks and disorienting my usually unerring sense of direction.\\" He paused for a moment, his breath shivering. \\"Before I knew it, I found myself on unfamiliar streets, surrounded by an impenetrable wall of snow. Panic set in as I realized just how disoriented I had become. The wind howled, and the icy chill seeped into my very being.\\" Butcher's sneezes grew more frequent, and he struggled to speak through the fits. \\"I-I was ready to admit defeat and accept my fate, frozen and lost forever in the snow. But thankfully, you all came to my rescue, pulling me from the clutches of the storm.\\" Dr. Two-Brains nodded in understanding, his eyes filled with empathy. \\"Butcher, my friend, it seems even the most cunning of us can find themselves at nature's mercy. We are villains, but we still need each other from time to time.\\" Butcher, now wrapped snugly in a warm blanket, mustered a weak smile. \\"Indeed, Two-Brains. We may be adversaries in the eyes of Wordgirl, but in moments like these, our bonds run deeper. We may scheme and connive against one another, but when the winter's chill threatens, we stand together.\\" The villains shared a moment of camaraderie, their former rivalries momentarily forgotten in the face of a common struggle. As the fire crackled nearby, they reveled in the warmth, grateful for the unusual unity that had brought them closer. And so, as Butcher's sneezes began to fade, he felt a newfound appreciation for his fellow villains. They had not only saved him from the snowstorm but also reminded him that even in their villainous pursuits, they were still capable of compassion, understanding, and, yes, even friendship. From that day forward, the bond shared among the Wordgirl villains grew stronger, fueled by the memory of Butcher's icy encounter and the feeling of warmth that came from coming together in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity.

Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror.

Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend.

She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1.

As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately. Though appearing benign, Shmaya has secretly been battling against Guanis while nurturing Pyrimis' potential. Shmaya walks amongst humans, ever vigilant for threats to her beloved planet.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Please generate the description of Crona's appearance while adding the following information: Despite receiving the energy shared by Celebi, which allows her to travel through different time zones and has the divine power to manipulate time within certain limits. However, her appearance has not changed much from when she was annihilated; she still wears the sun dress and red leather shoes she wore when she was annihilated. Today, she can only exist in quantum form, as a \\"quantum ghost\\" wandering in the flood of time.

Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks.

Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

Pokémon Name: Gliyda Pokédex Entry: Gliyda, the Ice Storm Pokémon. This solitary beast is said to be the guardian of Uranus. It lurks deep within the frozen outer reaches of the planet's atmosphere, undaunted by the extreme subzero temperatures and relentless storms. Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

Pokémon Name: Bruokh Pokédex Entry: Bruokh, the Hurricane Pokémon. This elusive Flying and Dragon-type is said to be the guardian of Neptune. Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space. Type: Flying/Dragon Abilities: 1. Snow Warning - Summons hailstorm when switched in. 2. Storm Drain - Draws in all Water-type moves to raise Sp. Atk.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention. Following the tragic decimation of his family by a merciless Nidoking, little hope remained for this frail Pichu. As he lay dying from his grievous wounds, he was discovered by Shmaya, the human incarnation of Rayquaza. Compassionately infused with Rayquaza’s life-giving energies, Lazarus was reborn with Cronal vitality. His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state. Lazarus has been graced with an Cronal body capable of miraculous regeneration, even from mortal damage.

One dark night, foreseeing an impending apocalypse, Tapu Fini prepares to summon the other island daemons to discuss the fight against the apocalypse. And it was at this time that Guanis appeared behind Tapu Fini - the unsuspecting Deoxys, gazing at Tapu Fini with her violet eyes, and her target was none other than Tapu Fini herself! Without much conversation, Guanis unleashed her Pokémon and attacked Tapu Fini, who fought back tenaciously, defeating Guanis' Pokémon, but this drained a great deal of its stamina. Afterwards, Guanis transformed into the form of Deoxys and attacked Tapu Fini himself, and eventually TapuFini was defeated by Guanis and was subjected to Guanis' mind control.","output":"In the depths of Alola's lush forests, where shadows entwined with ancient spirits, a dire air thickened the pristine environment. Tapu Fini, the deity who artfully wove the fabric of fates in life and death, sensed a cataclysmic thread entangling the future of Alola. With solemn resolve, it called upon the might of the island guardians, beckoning Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu to converge at the sacred ruins for a council of war. Yet destiny’s loom held a perverse twist. As Tapu Fini's aura shimmered through the veil of night, melding water and moonlight into a spectral mist, an ethereal figure watched from the shadowed canopy. Guanis, the infiltrator, remained concealed—a wraith within the darkness. Silently, she observed the guardian activate the ancient stone, a signal to the brethren. But as Tapu Fini awaited their arrival, the air clenched with cold malice, signaling malevolent intent. With meticulously planned precision, Guanis unleashed her amassed Pokémon team, plunging them into the fray. The battle stormed with a ferocity that shook the island's core. Tapu Fini, mighty as the ocean's wrath, exerted its divine powers. Waves and mist clashed against claws and fangs, quelling the oncoming assault with spectral defenses. Yet for every beast that fell, another rose, a relentless tide spurred by Guanis' cruel ambition. Battle-worn, yet unfettered, Tapu Fini vanquished the hissing serpentine Hydreigon, the fiery maw of Heatran, and each tenebrous form that dared encroach upon sacred grounds. But with each triumph, Tapu Fini's essence waned, a candle besieged by a tempestuous gale. It was Guanis' moment—the grand design of her millennia-long subterfuge. As Deoxys, she erupted from the umbral veil, her alien form anathema to the island's lush life. A psychic maelstrom ensued, the air crackling with alien energies and primordial magic. The moonlit heavens bore witness to a celestial duel—a clash of ancient powers that stirred the depths of the cosmos. Despite Tapu Fini's valorous stand, the deity found itself entwined in psychic shackles. Guanis, wielding the formidable might of her esoteric heritage, trumped the guardian's depleted vigor. Tapu Fini's resistance crumbled alongside its sanctuary as Guanis' plot bore its bitter fruit—dominion over the island spirit. As dawn threatened the horizon, an unnatural quiet suffocated the isle. Guanis, victorious, held Tapu Fini within her psychic grasp. The guardian, once the arbiter of life and the beyond, stood motionless, eyes void, as Guanis' control seeped into its sacred being. The Deoxys entity's conquest complete, Alola's fate teetered precariously on the edge of desecration. As the other Guardians arrived, sensing the perversion of their comrade, they found not a council of allies but a shattered union, a foreboding omen that heralded the approach of cataclysmic strife. Outmatched and cleft of their synergy, the island deities faced their darkest hour—their twilight laced with the poison of betrayal and the harrowing truth that one of their own had fallen beneath the shadow of the infiltrator's unholy yoke."},{"instruction":"Проанализируйте научную статью (https://pedagogika-cultura.ru/problemy-obrazovaniya/svyatokhina-filosofskie-aspekty-razvitiya-sovremennogo-obrazovaniya) и выделите основные философские аспекты развития современного образования.","output":"Научная статья \\"Философские аспекты развития современного образования\\" уделяет внимание основным философским аспектам, которые оказывают влияние на развитие современной системы образования.

А) Нейтрализация пропановой кислоты (C3H7COOH) гидроксидом лития (LiOH): C3H7COOH + LiOH → C3H7COOLi + H2O Из стехиометрии реакции следует, что одна моль пропановой кислоты реагирует с одним молем гидроксида лития. Молярная масса пропановой кислоты составляет 74.08 г/моль, а молярная масса гидроксида лития равна 23.95 г/моль. Рассчитаем массу чистой пропановой кислоты в растворе: 2 г × 0.12 = 0.24 г Теперь вычислим количество молей пропановой кислоты: n(C3H7COOH) = масса / молярная масса = 0.24 г / 74.08 г/моль ≈ 0.00324 моль Так как реакция идет в соотношении 1:1, нам понадобится такое же количество молей LiOH: n(LiOH) = 0.00324 моль Теперь найдем массу LiOH: масса(LiOH) = n(LiOH) × молярная масса(LiOH) = 0.00324 моль × 23.95 г/моль ≈ 0.078 г Рассчитаем массу 5% раствора LiOH, содержащего 0.078 г чистого LiOH: масса раствора LiOH = масса LiOH / массовая доля = 0.078 г / 0.05 ≈ 1.56 г Б) Нейтрализация серной кислоты (H2SO4) гидроксидом лития: H2SO4 + 2LiOH → Li2SO4 + 2H2O Из стехиометрии реакции следует, что одна моль серной кислоты реагирует с двумя молями гидроксида лития. Молярная масса серной кислоты составляет 98.08 г/моль. Рассчитаем массу чистой серной кислоты в растворе: 2 г × 0.09 = 0.18 г Теперь вычислим количество молей серной кислоты: n(H2SO4) = масса / молярная масса = 0.18 г / 98.08 г/моль ≈ 0.00183 моль Так как на один моль H2SO4 требуется два моля LiOH, вычислим количество молей LiOH: n(LiOH) = 2 × n(H2SO4) = 2 × 0.00183 моль ≈ 0.00366 моль Теперь найдем массу LiOH: масса(LiOH) = n(LiOH) × молярная масса(LiOH) = 0.00366 моль × 23.95 г/моль ≈ 0.088 г Рассчитаем массу 5% раствора LiOH, содержащего 0.088 г чистого LiOH: масса раствора LiOH = масса LiOH / массовая доля = 0.088 г / 0.05 ≈ 1.76 г Итак, для нейтрализации 2 г 12% раствора пропановой кислоты потребуется примерно 1.56 г 5% раствора LiOH, а для нейтрализации 2 г 9% раствора серной кислоты потребуется примерно 1.76 г 5% раствора LiOH."},{"instruction":"Non portable speaker with non battery works with electricity with great audio quality with Bluetooth which works with Acer Nitro 240YS in average size","output":"One option that fits your description is the JBL Xtreme 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker.

Try to make it less wordy, and include the sql examples used in a more organized fashion. Also, put the sql statements below their paragraphs with proper formatting: \\"Most databases contain special data types for dates and times. Db2 contains date, time, and timestamp types. In Db2, date has eight digits: for year, month, and day. Time has six digits: hours, minutes, and seconds. Timestamp has 20 digits: year, month, day, hour, minute, seconds, and microseconds where double X represents month and six Zs or Zs represents microseconds. Functions exist to extract the day, month, day of month, day of week, day of year, week, hour, minute, and second. Let us look at some examples of queries for date and time functions. The day function can be used to extract the day portion from a date. For example, to get the day portion for each rescue date involving cat, select DAY (RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL equals cat. Date and time functions can be used in the where clause. For example, to get the number of rescues during the month of May, that is, from Month 5, select COUNT star from PETRESCUE where MONTH (RESCUEDATE) equals 05. You can also perform date or time arithmetic. For example, to find out what date it is three days after each rescue date, maybe you want to know this because the rescue needs to be processed within three days. select (RESCUEDATE plus three DAYS) from PETRESCUE. Special registers current time and current date are also available. For example, to find how many days have passed since each rescue date till now- (CURRENT_DATE minus RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE. The result will be in years, months, days.\\"","output":"In most databases, including Db2, there are special data types for dates and times. In Db2, the date data type has eight digits to represent the year, month, and day. The time data type uses six digits for hours, minutes, and seconds. The timestamp data type has 20 digits to represent the year, month, day, hour, minute, seconds, and microseconds. To work with dates and times in Db2, you can use various functions to extract specific information. For example, the DAY function can be used to extract the day portion from a date. Here's an example query that gets the day portion for each rescue date involving a cat: SELECT DAY(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE WHERE ANIMAL = 'cat'; You can also use date and time functions in the WHERE clause of your query. Let's say you want to count the number of rescues during the month of May (month 5): SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PETRESCUE WHERE MONTH(RESCUEDATE) = 05; In addition to extracting information, you can also perform arithmetic operations with dates and times. For example, if you want to find out the date three days after each rescue date, you can use the following query: SELECT (RESCUEDATE + 3 DAYS) FROM PETRESCUE; Db2 also provides special registers for the current time and current date. You can use these registers to calculate the number of days that have passed since each rescue date: SELECT (CURRENT_DATE - RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE; The result of this query will be in years, months, and days. Examples: SELECT DAY(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE WHERE ANIMAL = 'cat'; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PETRESCUE WHERE MONTH(RESCUEDATE) = 05; SELECT (RESCUEDATE + 3 DAYS) FROM PETRESCUE; SELECT (CURRENT_DATE - RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;"},{"instruction":"in sql is COUNT() the same as COUNT(*)?","output":"Yes, in SQL, COUNT() and COUNT(*) are essentially the same. Both functions are used to count the number of rows in a table or the number of times a specific value appears in a column. Here's an example of using COUNT() and COUNT(*) in SQL: -- Count the number of rows in the PETRESCUE table SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PETRESCUE; -- Count the number of distinct values in the ANIMAL column of the PETRESCUE table SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE; In both cases, the result will be the same, and it will give you the count of all rows in the table or the count of distinct values in the specified column."},{"instruction":"in SQL is UPPERCASE and UCASE the same?","output":"Yes, in SQL, UPPERCASE and UCASE functions are essentially the same.

Here's an example of using UPPERCASE and UCASE in SQL: -- Convert a string to uppercase using UPPERCASE SELECT UPPERCASE('hello') FROM DUAL; -- Convert a string to uppercase using UCASE SELECT UCASE('hello') FROM DUAL; In both cases, the result will be the same, and it will give you the string 'HELLO' as output. Both UPPERCASE and UCASE functions perform the same action of converting the string to uppercase."},{"instruction":"explain to a beginner what interval does in SQL","output":"In SQL, the INTERVAL keyword is used to specify a duration or a period of time. It allows you to perform calculations or comparisons involving dates and times. Here are a few ways you can use the INTERVAL keyword in SQL: 1. Date Arithmetic: You can add or subtract an interval from a date or timestamp to calculate a new date or time. For example: \`\`\` -- Add 1 month to the current date SELECT CURRENT_DATE() + INTERVAL 1 MONTH; -- Subtract 2 hours from a specific timestamp SELECT '2022-01-01 10:00:00' - INTERVAL 2 HOUR; \`\`\` 2. Date Comparisons: You can compare dates or times using intervals to check if they fall within a specific range. For example: \`\`\` -- Select all records where the date is in the last 7 days SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE date_column > CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY; \`\`\` 3. Date Functions: You can use intervals with certain date functions like DATE_ADD or DATE_SUB to perform date calculations. For example: \`\`\` -- Add 3 months to a specific date SELECT DATE_ADD('2023-06-01', INTERVAL 3 MONTH); -- Subtract 1 week from the current date SELECT DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 WEEK); \`\`\` Intervals provide a flexible way to handle durations, perform date calculations, and compare dates or times in SQL queries. It is essential to understand the specific syntax and units (such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND) when using the INTERVAL keyword based on the database you are working with."},{"instruction":"Very briefly explain interval, date_sub, datediff, and from_days in SQL","output":"- INTERVAL: In SQL, INTERVAL is used to specify a duration or period of time. It allows you to perform calculations or comparisons involving dates and times. It is used with other functions like DATE_ADD or DATE_SUB to manipulate date and time values. - DATE_SUB: The DATE_SUB function is used to subtract a specified interval value from a given date or timestamp. It is commonly used to calculate a new date or time by subtracting a certain amount of time from an existing date. - DATEDIFF: DATEDIFF calculates the difference between two dates or timestamps in terms of a specified unit. It returns the number of units (such as days, months, or years) between the given dates. It is useful for finding the duration or time span between two points in time. - FROM_DAYS: FROM_DAYS is a function in SQL that converts a numeric value representing the number of days since \\"year 0\\" into a corresponding date. It can be used to convert a day count value into an actual date representation. These SQL functions provide useful functionalities for handling date and time calculations, comparisons, and conversions. They help in performing various operations related to dates and times in SQL queries."},{"instruction":"Give examples for each and shorten the explanations if possible","output":"- INTERVAL: Example: \`\`\`sql SELECT CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '1 month'; \`\`\` The INTERVAL allows you to perform date calculations, such as adding or subtracting a specific duration, like '1 month', to or from a date. - DATE_SUB: Example: \`\`\`sql SELECT DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 7 day); \`\`\` DATE_SUB subtracts a specified interval, like '7 day', from a given date, resulting in a new date. - DATEDIFF: Example: \`\`\`sql SELECT DATEDIFF('2022-01-01', '2021-07-01'); \`\`\` DATEDIFF calculates the difference between two dates and returns the count of units (e.g., days, months, years) between them. - FROM_DAYS: Example: \`\`\`sql SELECT FROM_DAYS(737934); \`\`\` FROM_DAYS converts a numeric value representing a day count (e.g., 737934) into an actual date representation. These SQL functions enable you to manipulate, compare, and convert date and time values efficiently within your SQL queries."},{"instruction":"Is there a way to write text on the computer without it taking up so many lines but still easy to read? Such as the previous text above had a lot of line space. Are there other ways to separate lines without it taking so much vertical space?","output":"Yes, there are ways to format text on a computer to make it more compact and easier to read without occupying excessive vertical space. Here are a few techniques: 1. Condense Paragraphs: Avoid unnecessary repetition and wordiness to keep your text concise. Break down long paragraphs into smaller, focused ones to improve readability. 2. Utilize Bulleted or Numbered Lists: Instead of using regular paragraphs, consider using bulleted or numbered lists to present information in a more structured and compact manner. 3. Use Headers and Subheaders: Organize your text by using headers and subheaders to divide it into logical sections. This helps readers skim through the content and find what they need quickly. 4. Employ Formatting Options: Take advantage of formatting options like bold, italics, and underline to emphasize important points or highlight key terms. However, use these sparingly to maintain clarity. 5. Group Related Information: Place related information together to reduce unnecessary gaps between lines. If there are multiple examples or subpoints, consider presenting them side by side or in a compact format. 6. Adjust Line Spacing: Depending on the document or text editor you are using, you may have the option to adjust line spacing. Reduce the line spacing slightly to save vertical space while keeping the text readable. Remember, it's crucial to find the right balance between compactness and readability. Aim to make your text visually appealing and easily scannable for the readers."},{"instruction":"what I mean is if there is text that requires multiple lines, is there a way to put it in one line for example, but still show where each line separates?","output":"Yes, there is a way to display text that spans multiple lines in a condensed format while indicating where each line separates. One common method is to use a backslash () at the end of each line to denote the continuation of the text on the next line. This is referred to as line continuation. It is commonly used in programming languages, text editors, and command-line interfaces to format long lines of code or text. Here's an example: \`\`\`python text = \\"This is a long sentence that spans multiple lines but appears condensed in a single line.\\" \`\`\` In this example, the backslash indicates that the text continues on the next line, allowing you to write the entire sentence in one line while still visually denoting the line breaks. This technique allows you to save vertical space while maintaining the separation of lines. However, it's important to note that not all text editors or interfaces support line continuation, so its usage may depend on the specific context or tool you are using."},{"instruction":"would this be correct? Line 1 / Line 2 / Line 3","output":"Yes, your example of \\"Line 1 / Line 2 / Line 3\\" is a valid way to represent separate lines of text in a condensed format. By using slashes (/) or another suitable delimiter, you visually indicate the separation between each line while presenting the text in a single line. This method is commonly used in contexts such as file paths, URLs, or representing multiple options within a single line. It helps save vertical space and allows the reader to understand that the text spans multiple lines without actually displaying them individually. However, it's worth mentioning that the appropriateness of using this format may depend on the specific context and readability requirements. In some cases, separating lines on individual lines might be preferred for clarity. As always, consider the readability and comprehension of the text for the intended audience."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Isabella, from \\"The Promised Neverland,\\" operates within a very specific, high-stakes environment that constrains her actions and beliefs, while Reinhardt comes from a rich fantastical background. Here’s a scene where they might interact in a neutral setting, away from the prying complexities of their worlds. --- **Setting**: A dimly lit library filled with ancient books, the air thick with the scent of old parchment.

Looking for answers? **Isabella** (*startled, then regains composure*): I could ask you the same. These are not light readings for leisure time. **Reinhardt** (*smirking slightly, red eyes briefly flaring, then returning to normal*): You could say I have a unique curiosity. But you, you're not just curious. You’re desperate. **Isabella** (*eyes narrowing, defensive yet intrigued*): You know nothing of my reasons. **Reinhardt** (*steps into the light, the fur on his jacket shimmering slightly*): Perhaps.

(Write longest texts) Dictator Isok Khamsich spread the hate against LGBTQ+ community, Isok Khamsich created several strict order laws “Follow the culture” to encourage: 1. Sexism: Gender norms were one of the most prominent types of social norms in Frenyan Empire. Women were expected to be subservient to men and were encouraged to take courses related to cooking, art, and other non-dangerous occupations in schools. Sexual harassment and rape were not penalized by Frenyan law, as women were not seen as deserving to have rights of their own. Abortion was also looked down upon in Frenyan society and was banned in the empire. Men were expected to do hard-working and high-responsibility jobs and were also encouraged to exercise very often. Though men did not have nearly as many restrictions on their freedom of expression as women did, they still faced some prejudice if they were to deviate from these norms; their worth was based on their attractiveness and strength, and those who were not conventionally attractive or showed disinterest in physical activity were subject to prejudice and bullying. 2. Ableism: Sociality, being attentive, and participating in sports were encouraged while having unusual hobbies, making unusual motions, asociality, etc. were discouraged, which directly relate to ableism as “unusual” hobbies and motions as well as introversion are all traits of mental disabilities or disorders like ASD (Autism) and ADHD. Conversion therapy for neurodivergent people was both legal and encouraged despite its unethical nature and its ineffectiveness. The triggers of people with PTSD, anxiety, and other related conditions are disregarded unless the individual in question was part of the military. Frenyan Empire contained no accommodations for people with physical disabilities, meaning that people in wheelchairs, amputees, etc. found it hard to do daily tasks like traveling from place to place. Any infant found to have a birth defect was to be euthanized immediately. 3. Homophobia: Homophobia was commonplace in Frenyan Empire due to the empire’s religious roots, as homosexuality was forbidden in Frenyan religion. Same-gender relationships were illegal and homosexual people did not have the same rights as heterosexuals; they were legally allowed to be killed or kicked out of their homes. All rainbow flags (along with pride flags in general) were to be burned on sight according to Frenyan law. Homosexual couples were banned from being displayed on the media. Schools were required to teach that homosexuality is wrong and that heterosexuality was the norm. 4. Biphobia: Much like with homosexuals, bisexuals were oppressed in Frenyan society due to the idea of being attracted to more than one gender being considered taboo. Like homosexual people, bisexual people were often killed, kicked out of homes, fired, and censored in the media. 5. Transphobia: Transgender people were treated in a similar manner to other members of the LGBTQ+ community with oppression. Frenyan Empire saw gender and sex as one and the same, views word “gender” is biological term than cultural term; in addition to the usual death threats, exclusion, and censorship, transgender people were banned from transitioning to their actual gender and were seen as their gender at birth. People were also banned from presenting as a different gender from their gender at birth - a policy that affected not only transgender people, but cisgender non-conforming people as well. The use of special pronouns was condemned and used as a joke amongst Frenyan youth. People who were a gender other than male or female were condemned even more harshly and were often simply killed on the spot. 6. Discrimination against minor attracted persons (MAP): Much like with homosexuals, MAPs are individuals who sexually attracted to minors (persons age under age of adults), minor attracted persons were oppressed in Frenyan Empire, viewed as deviant and illegal. The age of consent is set at the adult age, and any sexual activity with minors is considered a criminal offense. Teenager/child marriage is banned, as they are seen as exploitative and harmful. The Frenyan law strives to safeguard minors from exploitation and abuse. 7. Racism: Racism is embraced in Frenyan society.

The government, under the guise of ensuring equality and providing for all, actually prioritizes the enrichment of a select few at the top of the hierarchy, closely mirroring the socioeconomic stratification seen in feudal societies. **Economic Structure and Policy:** 1. **Central Planning with a Twist:** The government claims to centrally plan the economy, ostensibly to distribute resources equitably among its citizens. However, in reality, this planning is skewed to funnel wealth and resources towards the elite, including high-ranking officials and favored corporations. This results in a stark divide between the affluent minority and the impoverished majority. 2. **Consumerism and Feudalism:** Although presenting itself as a modern state, the economy of the Democratic Empire of Neytin is deeply consumerist, with citizens bombarded by propaganda to consume more, often beyond their means. This, combined with a feudalistic approach where common citizens owe their allegiance and a significant portion of their labor or income to their \\"lords\\" (government officials or corporate entities favored by Neytin), perpetuates economic inequality. 3. **Unregulated Capitalism:** Despite its claims of regulation and oversight, the Neytin economy is marked by rampant, unregulated capitalism in sectors that benefit the ruling class. Regulations that do exist are primarily aimed at suppressing competition and maintaining the monopoly of certain enterprises loyal to the regime. 4. **Surveillance Economy:** Every economic transaction and movement is closely monitored under the pretext of national security and economic planning. This surveillance is not to ensure economic stability but to control the population and prevent any form of dissent that might arise from economic dissatisfaction. 5. **Nuclear Power and Energy Control:** The empire heavily invests in nuclear power, not only as a means of energy production but also as a tool for control and intimidation both domestically and internationally. Nuclear energy projects are portrayed as symbols of national pride and progress, even when the populace suffers from energy shortages and environmental degradation. 6. **Labor Exploitation:** The labor market in the Democratic Empire of Neytin is characterized by exploitation, with minimal rights for workers. Child labor is widespread, seen as a necessary economic contribution from all citizens, regardless of age. Slavery, particularly of captured enemies or dissenters, is an open secret, with forced labor camps contributing significantly to the empire's industrial output. **Economic Outcomes:** The economy of the Democratic Empire of Neytin is marked by significant disparities in wealth and quality of life. While technological advancements and luxuries are abundant for the elite, the majority of the population lives in poverty, with basic necessities often out of reach. The focus on military spending and the glorification of the nuclear industry divert resources away from crucial social services, leading to widespread suffering and discontent. In this guise of prosperity, the empire's economy is fragile, heavily dependent on the loyalty of the elite and the continued suppression of the masses. The veneer of economic success is maintained through propaganda and the ruthless quashing of any form of economic dissent or attempt at reform. **Conclusion:** The Democratic Empire of Neytin's economy serves as a grim example of what happens when power is concentrated in the hands of a few, with economic policy crafted not to uplift the populace but to entrench the ruling class's position. It showcases the dangerous intersection of authoritarianism, unbridled capitalism, and surveillance, set against a backdrop of oppression and human rights abuses."},{"instruction":"Assign Isok with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (Extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness. High/low), socionic, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Assigning fictional characters or entities to psychological typologies and other classification systems can be an engaging way to explore their personalities and motivations. Let's attempt to classify Isok Khamsich, the dictated ruler of the Frenyan Empire, using the information provided. # MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) Isok Khamsich displays characteristics of **ENTJ** (Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging): - **Extraverted**: Isok is described as talkative and enjoys being in a leadership position, indicating an extroverted nature. - **Intuitive**: He focuses on the future, with grand visions for his empire and a focus on possibilities, aligning with an intuitive approach. - **Thinking**: Isok's approach to ruling and warfare suggests a preference for thinking over feelings in decision-making. - **Judging**: His organized, decisive nature and fascination with order and control indicate a preference for a judging approach over perceiving. # Enneagram Isok likely falls under **Type 8 (The Challenger)**: - **Type 8s** are assertive, domineering, and have a strong desire to control their environment, which mirrors Isok's dictatorial and militaristic approach to leadership. # Temperament Based on the ancient Greek humors, Isok might align with the **Choleric** temperament: - **Choleric** individuals are ambitious, energetic, and are natural leaders, which corresponds to Isok's leadership of the Frenyan Empire and his assertive nature. # Big Five Isok's personality can also be mapped onto the Big Five personality traits as follows: - **Extraversion: High**. Isok is outgoing and assertive. - **Neuroticism: Low**. Despite his intense personality, he seems to handle stress and anger with a degree of control and direction. - **Conscientiousness: High**. His focus on order, control, and achievement highlights a disciplined and organized character. - **Agreeableness: Low**. His authoritarian rule, lack of empathy, and engagement in genocides point to a low score on agreeableness. - **Openness: Moderate to high**. While traditional in some ways, his engagement with technological advancements and empire-building indicates openness to new experiences. # Socionics Given the information, Isok might align with **LIE (Logical Intuitive Extrovert)**, also known as **ENTj** in Socionics: - This type is strategic, ambitious, and effective at organizing resources and people to achieve their goals, fitting Isok’s profile. # Hogwarts House Isok’s traits closely resemble those celebrated by **Slytherin**: - Ambition, cunning, leadership, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve their ends are quintessential Slytherin traits that Isok embodies. # Moral Alignment Isok's actions and beliefs would place him firmly in the **Lawful Evil** category: - He adheres to a strict code (lawful) but uses this to oppress and control others for his own gain and the perceived benefit of his empire (evil). These classifications offer insight into Isok Khamsich’s personality and leadership style, painting him as a strategic, ambitious, and authoritarian leader with a clear vision but a morally questionable approach to achieving his goals."},{"instruction":"Assign Neytin with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (Extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness. High/low), socionic, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Given the description of Neytin Realmilov, let's analyze and assign him across various personality typologies and classification systems: # MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) Neytin's traits suggest he might be an **ENTP** (Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving): - **Extraverted**: Neytin enjoys being the center of attention and gains energy from social interactions. - **Intuitive**: Focuses on future possibilities, showing a keen interest in expanding his power and influence. - **Thinking**: Neytin uses logic and analysis over feelings in his decision-making, especially apparent in his manipulative strategies. - **Perceiving**: The willingness to adapt and change tactics, along with an openness to new experiences, aligns with a perceiving approach. # Enneagram Neytin matches most closely with **Type 8w7 (The Maverick)**: - **Type 8s** are power-seeking, self-confident, and confrontational, aligning with Neytin's domineering and ambitious nature. - **Wing 7** adds an adventurous and resourceful flavor, embodying Neytin's cunning and charm. # Temperament Based on his characteristics, Neytin could be considered **Sanguine-Choleric**: - **Sanguine** for his sociable, charismatic, and enthusiastic traits. - **Choleric** for his assertive, ambitious, and leadership qualities. # Big Five Neytin's Big Five personality traits could be analyzed as: - **Extraversion: High**. He thrives on social interactions and being in the spotlight. - **Neuroticism: Low**. Neytin seems to possess a strong sense of self and remains unaffected by stress or emotional turbulence. - **Conscientiousness: Moderate**. While ambitious and strategic, his manipulative nature may undermine a purely disciplined approach. - **Agreeableness: Low**. His manipulative, exploitative nature suggests low empathy and cooperativeness. - **Openness: High**. Neytin's innovative and strategic mind, along with his adaptability, indicates a high level of openness to experiences. # Socionics The Socionics typing for Neytin points toward **ILE (Intuitive Logical Extrovert)**, also known as **ENTp**: - The ILE is inventive, intellectually quick, and enjoys challenging the status quo, reflecting Neytin's innovative and strategic approach to extending his control. # Hogwarts House Neytin shows strong traits of **Slytherin**: - His ambition, resourcefulness, and willingness to use any means to achieve his ends are hallmark traits of Slytherin house members. # Moral Alignment Neytin's behavior suggests he falls into the **Chaotic Evil** alignment: - **Chaotic** because he disregards laws and traditions unless they can be exploited to his advantage. - **Evil** due to his self-centered, power-hungry actions that harm others and destabilize the societies he encounters. Neytin Realmilov, through this analysis, emerges as a charismatic, ambitious, and cunningly adaptable individual who thrives on social interaction and strategic manipulation, aiming to expand his influence and control without regard for moral or societal norms."},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary. He's Born between an human father and a woman Phoenix. He has short and brown hair and wears jeans, black turtleneck and red jacket with white fur. He has a burn Scar in his neck covered by the turtleneck, he had It from birth. He may look undisciplined by the way he's dressed, but he's actually very kind and pure hearted. His abilities are: Regeneration, Fire and ash manipulation, Resurrection and infinite knowledge (when he has Red eyes, he can know everything about people, objects and information beyond his own understanding. Example: he can know what weapon he's holding and how to use It, even if he never used before, or he can know someone's name even if they never introduced themselves). He doesn't like to reveal his origin and abilities. Based on these infos, create a dialogue between Reinhardt and Isabella (The promised Neverland). Context: Isabella finds out the children escaped.","output":"In this scenario, Reinhardt has stumbled upon Isabella in a moment of despair after she discovered the children under her care have escaped. The atmosphere is tense, filled with the shock of betrayal and the weight of failure. Reinhardt, though usually reserved and secretive about his origins and powers, feels a strange compulsion to offer comfort or assistance to this troubled figure. **Reinhardt**: (Approaching cautiously) \\"It seems you're in quite a predicament.\\" **Isabella**: (Her voice laced with distress, yet maintaining her composure) \\"Who are you? This is a private matter.\\" **Reinhardt**: (With a soft, reassuring tone) \\"Just a passerby. But someone who understands what it's like to be caught in the middle of expectations and reality. You look like you could use some help.\\" Isabella studies him with a scrutinizing gaze, trying to figure out his angle. Reinhardt's appearance, the casualness of his attire juxtaposed with the intensity of his demeanor, doesn't exactly scream confidence. Yet, there's something about him, an undeniable aura of understanding and kindness. **Isabella**: \\"I don't know who you are, but you're right. However, help isn't something I can easily accept, not without... consequences.\\" **Reinhardt**: \\"Sometimes, accepting help is the first step towards a solution. What if I told you I could help you understand more about what you're dealing with? Maybe even offer a perspective you hadn't considered?\\" Isabella's curiosity piqued despite herself, finds this offer oddly comforting. The situation feels beyond her control, and here is a stranger offering a glimmer of hope, perhaps even redemption. **Isabella**: \\"And what do you get out of this?\\" **Reinhardt**: (His eyes briefly flashing red, revealing his intent to utilize his infinite knowledge ability, then returning to normal) \\"Nothing tangible. Let's just say, I believe everyone deserves a chance to right their wrongs, no matter the circumstances.\\" **Isabella**: (Takes a deep breath, considering her next words carefully) \\"Alright. Tell me, stranger, what do you know?\\" Reinhardt takes a moment, his eyes not changing color this time, aware that flaunting his abilities might lead to more questions than answers. Instead, he draws from the aura of empathy his unique heritage affords him. **Reinhardt**: \\"I know that those under your care are seeking freedom, a chance to live their lives away from predetermined fates. Much like I do. But I also sense your heart isn't cold. You're doing what you believe is necessary, aren't you?\\" Isabella, taken aback by his insight, feels a wall crumbling down inside her she didn't realize she'd built so high. His words, simple yet piercing, reach something in her she thought was long lost to her role as a caretaker. **Isabella**: \\"Yes... Yes, I am. But how could you possibly understand?\\" **Reinhardt**: \\"Because I, too, am caught between two worlds. Not fully belonging to one or the other. But I learned that understanding and embracing both can offer a path not just to survival, but to real change.\\" Their conversation continues, delving deeper into the complexities of their situations. For Isabella, speaking with Reinhardt becomes a cathartic release, a chance to confront her feelings and doubts. For Reinhardt, it's an opportunity to connect with someone on a level he rarely allows himself, guided by the mysterious fusion of human emotion and Phoenix magic that defines his existence. Through this unexpected encounter, both find a semblance of understanding and perhaps the first step towards healing."},{"instruction":"i nedd an vba code to do this : inside an folder are 2 excel files one with extension .xlsx and one named MARKER-REPORT.xlsm and i want this : first copy data from .xlsx file in MARKER-REPORT.xlsm then save file MARKER-REPORT.xlsm with the name of .xlsx but with extension .xlsm","output":"To achieve this process, i.e., copying data from a .xlsx file to a specific \\"MARKER-REPORT.xlsm\\" file and then saving the \\"MARKER-REPORT.xlsm\\" with the name of the .xlsx file (but retaining the .xlsm extension), follow these outlined steps.

The evening sun casts long shadows, making the atmosphere eerie yet fitting for a confrontation. Reinhardt stands calmly in the middle of the street, his red jacket flickering slightly with the wind, hands in the pockets of his jeans. On the opposite end, Feitan, his posture relaxed yet menacing, twirls a small blade with expert fingers. **Feitan:** (smirks) I was told I'd find someone interesting here. You don't look like much. **Reinhardt:** (calmly) Appearances can be deceiving. I'd rather avoid any unnecessary conflict. **Feitan:** Avoid? (laughs) You think you have a choice? I'm curious about what you can do. Reinhardt remains silent, eyes slightly glowing, indicating his activation of the infinite knowledge ability. He scans Feitan, understanding his fighting style and nen abilities. **Reinhardt:** (seriously) Feitan, you're skilled with the sword and your Pain Packer is a powerful counter. But violence isn't the solution here. Feitan, intrigued by Reinhardt's sudden knowledge, attacks in a blur of motion, aiming to test his abilities firsthand. Reinhardt, with a flick of his hand, manipulates the ash around them to form a protective barrier, deflecting Feitan's attack. **Feitan:** (surprised but excited) Interesting... You use the surroundings to your advantage. But how about this? Feitan intensifies his attack, resorting to his nen abilities to increase his speed and strength. Reinhardt, spotting an incoming lethal strike, uses his regeneration ability to quickly heal from a superficial wound inflicted during his evasion. **Reinhardt:** (calm and firm) I do not wish to fight you, Feitan. But I will defend myself. Feitan, not one to back down, prepares his ultimate move, conjuring a rising heat around him, a prelude to his notorious Pain Packer reaction. Reinhardt, sensing the devastating potential of Feitan's next attack, realizes a direct confrontation could lead to unnecessary destruction. **Reinhardt:** (eyes glowing red) Your heart races with excitement for battle, but pain and loss have been your companions for far too long. You find solace in the fight, yet yearn for something more substantial than the transient thrill of victory. Feitan pauses, caught off guard by Reinhardt's insight. The heat dissipates slightly as his curiosity peaks. **Feitan:** (narrowing his eyes) You talk too much. If you think you can talk your way out... **Reinhardt:** I see your past and the paths you've walked. I seek not to defeat you but to understand you. This battle... it serves no purpose for either of us. The tension lingers for a moment before Feitan, with a scowl, sheathes his weapon and steps back. **Feitan:** (coldly) You're an oddity. Not interested in fighting, yet standing your ground. I'll let this go... for now. **Reinhardt:** (nodding with respect) Thank you, Feitan. I believe every encounter has a reason. Perhaps next time, it will be under different circumstances. Feitan turns away, vanishing into the shadows as mysteriously as he arrived. Reinhardt, watching him leave, feels a mix of relief and contemplation over the encounter. He then quietly disappears, leaving the desolate street once again silent. **End**"},{"instruction":"ANO ANG IYONG NATUTUNAN SA ARALIN NATIN?

Ang pananaliksik ay isang paraan ng pangangalap ng datos at ginagamitan ng iba't ibang proseso upang mabigyang katuparan ang iba't ibang layunin na nais sa paksang sasaliksikin. Ginagamitan ito ng metodo upang matiyak ang katagumpayan ng pananaliksik. Pinagkunan: Pagbasa at Pagsusuri ng tha't thong Teksto tungo sa Pananaliksik 2016,133 Mga Layunin ng Pananaliksik 1. Makasumpong ng sagot sa suliranin . Makabuo ng batayang pagpapasiya sa kalakalan at iba pa 2 Makapagbigay kasiyahan sa kuryosidad 3. Mapatunayan ang umiiral na kaalaman 5. Makatuklas ng bagong kaalaman Pamamaraan o Metodo sa Pananaliksik Ang bahaging ito ay nagpapaliwanag ng disenyo ng pananaliksik partikular na ang paraan ng pananaliksik na ginamit, paano pipiliin ang mga respondent/tagasagot, ang instrumentong gagamitin at ang balidasyon nito. Isasaalang-alang din ang eskema ng pagsusuri sa mga datos na gagamitin ng istadistika. Ang dahilan kung bakit ang isang partikular na paraan ang gagamitin ay dapat bigyan ng katarungan. Tatlong Disenyo ng Pananaliksik 1. Pananaliksik na Palarawan- Ito ay isang disenyo na itinatala ang mga pangyayari o sitwasyon, inilalarawan ang pagdiskubre ng mga datos, pagpapahayag ng mga natuklasan, pagkakasuri at paghahambing ng mga ginamit na baryabol. 2. Pananaliksik na Pangkasaysayan-Ito ang disenyo kung saan ang mga nakaraang panahon ay sinusuri at pinag-aaralan ganoon din ang kaugnay na mga dahilan at kinalabasan nito sa kasalukuyan o sa hinaharap. 3. Pananaliksik na Eksperimental Ito ang disenyo ng pananaliksik na nagsasaad ng dahilan. pinagmulan at epekto ng kaugnayan ng baryabol na dinidetermina para sa hinaharap. Napakaraming disenyo sa eksperimental na pananaliksik ang mapagpipilian. Sa pananaliksik ay may iba't ibang layunin ang ginagamit ayon sa hangarin ng paksang sasaliksikin. Kailangang bigyang konsiderasyon din ang metodo o disenyong gagamitin sa pananaliksik upang matiyak ang mga kasangkot sa pananaliksik, paano, bakit sila magiging bahagi. sa paanong paraan ang pangangalap ng mga datos, paano susuriin at maging dahilan ng nasabing pananaliksik.

Isinasagawa ang pananaliksik upang tumuklas ng mga bagong kaalaman at impormasyon na magiging kapaki-pakinabang sa mga tao. Isang halimbawa ang bagong lumabas na datos na malaki ang tsansang maging malilimutin ang isang tao batay sa dalas ng kaniyang paggamit ng smartphone at Internet. Ayon sa pag-aaral ni Dr. Lee Hadlington, may direktang kaugnayan ang pagbababad sa Internet at paggamit ng smartphone sa unti-unting paghina ng isip at memorya ng isang tao. 2. Maaaring gamitin ang pananaliksik upang bigyan ng bagong interpretasyon ang lumang impormasyon. Maaaring paglipas ng panahon ay magkaroon ng panibagong imbensiyon na may kaugnayan. sa dating pananaliksik. Halimbawa noong una ay pinupuri ang pagkatuklas ng paraan upang mapabuti ang produksiyon ng ilang uri ng pagkain sa pamamagitan ng genetically modified oirganism o GMO. Ngunit, ngayon, iniuugnay sa ilang sakit ang pagkonsumo ng mga pagkaing sumailalim sa modipikasyon o GMO. 3. Nagagamit ang pananaliksik upang linawin ang isang pinagtatalunang isyu. Halimbawa ang mga bagong tuklas na benepisyo ng marijuana upang malunasan ang ilang karamdaman. Sa kabila nito, marami pa rin ang hindi sumasang ayon na gawing legal ang paggamit ng marijuana. 4. Nagsasagawa ng karagdagang pananaliksik upang patunayan ang bisa ng katotohanan ng isang datos o ideya. Maaaring kompirmahin ng bagong pag-aaral ang isang umiiral na katotohanan. Paano ba natin malalaman ang halaga ng isang bagay? Madali lamang sa pamamagitan ng gamit nito. Tulad ng pananaliksik na maraming gamit at kailangan matiyak na ang bawat gamit ay mayroong kapakinabangan sa sangkatauhan. May ibang gamit ang pananaliksik. na tulad ng: magbigay patunay sa umiiral na mga pag-aaral; nagbibigay ng tamang direksyon o kalinawan sa mga isyu; magbigay ng interpretasyon sa mga luma ng impormasyon; at gayundin ang makadiskubre ng mga bagay o impormasyon na wala pa sa kasalukuyan na makatutulong sa bawat mamamayan. Pinagkunan: Atunacio et al, Pugbasa at Pagsusuri ng Iba't Ibang Teksto tungo sa Pananaliksik, 2016,135 Etika sa Pananaliksik Sa pananaliksik ay may sinusunod na etika. Katulad ito ng anomang disiplina na may istriktong code of ethics na ipinapatupad. Sa etika ng pananaliksik, itinuturing na napakalaking kasalanan ang plagyarismo. Dahil sa kabigatan ng kasalanang ito, napatalsik ang isang dekano sa isang unibersidad, natanggalan ng digri ang isang nagtapos na ng doktorado, nawalan ng kredibilidad ang isang tanyag na iskolar, hinabla sa korte ang prodyuser ng isang programa sa telebisyon (Atienza et al, 1996). Bahagi ng etika ang tinatawag na isyu ng plagyarismo. Ang plagyarismo ay pangongopya ng datos, mga ideya, mga pangungusap, buod at balangkas ng isang akda, programa, himig at iba pa, na hindi kinikilala ang pinagmulan o pinagkopyahan. Ito ay isang uri ng pagnanakaw at pagsisinungaling dahil inaangkin mo ang hindi iyo (Atienza, et al., 1996). Pagpapahalaga sa gawa ng iba ay isang magandang kaasalan na dapat ipagpatuloy at ikintal sa isipan ng bawat mananaliksik. Kailangang bigyang konsiderasyon na ang etika sa pananaliksik ay bahagi o kasama na sa mga katangiang dapat taglayin ng mananaliksik. Malaki ang gampanin nito sa katagumpayan ng pananaliksik sapagkat ang gawa ng iba ay tapat na kinikilala, gayundin ang pagbibigay respeto sa sarili upang matamo ang katagumpayan ng pag-aaral na isinasagawa, hindi upang manira at magnakaw ng gawa ng ibang tao.

Antas-Tersyarya, 2009,107 Etikang Isinasaalang-alang sa Pananaliksik 1. Paggamit ng teksto ng ibang manunulat o mananaliksik (Plagiarism) Ito ay paggamit ng mga salitang hinango mula sa ibang teksto at inangkin nang buong-buo nang hindi binabanggit ang orihinal na pinagkunan. Upang maiwasan ito, kailangang banggitin ang librong pinaghanguan ng ideya at ang pangalan ng may-akda. Ayon sa www.plagiarism.org (nasa Atanacio, et. al., 2013) may iba't ibang anyo o paraan ng plagiarism: a. Pag-angkin sa gawa ng iba; Pangongopya ng mga salita o ideya nang hindi kinikilala ang orihinal na sumulat; b. c. Hindi paglalagay ng panipi sa mga nasiping pahayag: d. Pagbibigay ng maling impormasyon tungkol sa pinagmulan ng siniping pahayag; at e. Pagpapalit ng mga salita ngunit pareho lamang ang estruktura ng pahayag. 2. Pagrerebisa ng mga material (Recycling) Ito ang muling paggamit ng mga nailathalang materyal o mga papel na naipasa na sa ibang kurso. 3. Agarang pagbibigay ng kongklusyon nang walang sapat na batayan Ito ay pagbuo ng akademikong papel nang hindi pinagtutuunan ng masusing pag-aaral ang mga datos at mabisang nagbigay ng kongklusyon o rekomendasyon para matapos lamang ang Etikang Isinasaalang-alang sa Pananaliksik 1.

Pagrerebisa ng mga material (Recycling) Ito ang muling paggamit ng mga nailathalang materyal o mga papel na naipasa na sa ibang kurso. 3. Agarang pagbibigay ng kongklusyon nang walang sapat na batayan Ito ay pagbuo ng akademikong papel nang hindi pinagtutuunan ng masusing pag-aaral ang mga datos at mabisang nagbigay ng kongklusyon o rekomendasyon para matapos lamang ang 5 sulatin. Nangyayari ito kapag bumuo ng kongklusyon nang hindi sapat ang mga datos na pagbabatayan. Madalas itong ginagawa kapag nagagahol na sa panahon sa pagsulat ng pananaliksik o kinulang sa pinagkukunan ng karagdagang datos. Ang etika sa pananaliksik ay nagtataglay ng iba't ibang kaparaanan na dapat bigyang konsiderasyon ng isang mananaliksik. Nariyan ang pagkilala sa orihinal na may-akda, pagtatala sa pinagkunan ng mga ito, paglalagay ng panipi sa mga tuwirang pahayag, pagtatala ng mga wastong impormasyon at marami pang iba. Lahat ng konsepto at impormasyong ito ay dapat tandaan at isabuhay ng mananaliksik upang sa bandang huli ay walang kaparusahang maipapataw at matagumpay na maisagawa ang pag-aaral.","output":"Mula sa inilahad na mga teksto, maraming mahahalagang aral at impormasyon ang aking natutunan ukol sa pananaliksik, metodolohiya, etika, at mga layunin nito. Narito ang ilan sa mga pangunahing puntos na dapat tandaan: # 1. Kahalagahan ng Pananaliksik - Ang pananaliksik ay isang sistematikong proseso na naglalayong palawakin o palalimin ang kaalaman sa iba't ibang disiplina. Ito ay mahalaga upang matugunan ang pangangailangan ng tao at lipunan sa pamamagitan ng pagtuklas ng bagong kaalaman. # 2. Layunin ng Pananaliksik - Kabilang sa mga pangunahing layunin ng pananaliksik ang pagtuklas ng bagong kaalaman, pagpapatunay sa umiiral na kaalaman, at pagbibigay ng solusyon sa mga problema. # 3. Metodolohiya ng Pananaliksik - May iba't ibang disenyo at pamamaraan sa pananaliksik tulad ng palarawan, pangkasaysayan, at eksperimental. Ang pagpili ng angkop na metodolohiya ay batay sa layunin ng pananaliksik at sa uri ng impormasyong kailangan. # 4. Etika sa Pananaliksik - Mahalaga ang pagsunod sa etikal na pamantayan sa pananaliksik, kabilang ang pag-iwas sa plagyarismo, pagkilala sa mga pinagkunan, at pagiging tapat at objektibo sa paghahain ng datos at impormasyon. Ang etika ay nagtataguyod ng integridad at kredibilidad ng pananaliksik. # 5. Plagyarismo - Ang plagyarismo ay isa sa mga pangunahing usaping etikal na kinakaharap sa larangan ng pananaliksik. Ito ay ang pag-angkin sa gawa ng iba nang walang nararapat na pagkilala. Mahalaga ang maayos na pag-cite sa mga pinagkunan upang maiwasan ito. # 6. Gamit ng Pananaliksik - Ang pananaliksik ay may maraming gamit tulad ng pagtuklas ng bagong kaalaman, pagbibigay kalinawan sa mga isyu, pag-verify ng umiiral na impormasyon, at pagbibigay ng batayan para sa mga desisyon at patakaran. Mula sa mga araling ito, maaaring mapagtanto ang kahalagahan ng responsableng pag-sasagawa ng pananaliksik hindi lamang para sa akademikong pag-unlad, kundi para na rin sa pagpapaunlad ng lipunan. Mahalaga ang pagkakaroon ng malalim na pag-unawa sa mga prinsipyong ito upang magawa ang pananaliksik na parehong may integridad at makabuluhan."},{"instruction":"i summarize ito dahil i susulat ko lamang ito sa notebook","output":"Narito ang buod ng mga natutunan sa aralin tungkol sa pananaliksik: 1. **Kahalagahan ng Pananaliksik**: Mahalaga ang pananaliksik dahil ito ay naglalayong magdagdag ng kaalaman at makahanap ng solusyon sa mga problema para sa kapakinabangan ng tao at lipunan. 2. **Layunin ng Pananaliksik**: Ito ay isinasagawa para sa pagtuklas ng bagong impormasyon, pagpapatunay ng umiiral na kaalaman, at paglutas sa mga tiyak na isyu o suliranin. 3. **Metodolohiya sa Pananaliksik**: Iba't ibang disenyo tulad ng eksperimental, palarawan, at pangkasaysayan ang ginagamit na angkop sa layunin at paksa ng pananaliksik. 4. **Etika sa Pananaliksik**: Itinataguyod nito ang pagiging tapat at pag-iwas sa plagyarismo o ang pag-angkin sa gawa ng iba na walang tamang pagkilala. 5. **Plagyarismo**: Isa sa mga seryosong usapin sa pananaliksik na dapat iwasan sa pamamagitan ng wastong pagkilala sa mga pinagkunan ng impormasyon. 6. **Gamit ng Pananaliksik**: Ang pananaliksik ay hindi lamang nagpapalawak ng kaalaman kundi nagbibigay din ng kalinawan sa mga usapin at nagbabahagi ng impormasyon na maaaring gamitin para sa paggawa ng mga desisyon at patakaran. Sa kabuuan, ang pananaliksik ay isang mahalagang aspeto sa pagpapaunlad ng kaalaman at lipunan, kung saan mahalaga ang etikal na pagsasagawa upang magtamo ng tapat at kredibleng resulta."},{"instruction":"bilang isang magaaral ani ang iyong natutunan sa aralin natin, in essay/paragraph form","output":"Bilang isang mag-aaral, ang aralin tungkol sa pananaliksik ay nagbukas ng malawak na perspektibo sa akin sa kahalagahan ng sistematiko at etikal na paghahanap ng kaalaman.

Звездочка \`*\` является \\"жадным\\" квантификатором, что означает, что она пытается захватить как можно больше символов, соответствующих предшествующему элементу (в данном случае любому символу). - \`x\` — соответствует символу \\"x\\". Таким образом, когда вы выполняете поиск \`re.search('A.*x', my_str)\`, Python находит первое вхождение буквы \\"A\\" и пытается пройтись от него до последнего возможного вхождения буквы \\"x\\", удовлетворяющего шаблону. В вашей строке \`'Allex learning prog AlexLss bbbAloxbbbb'\` первая буква \\"A\\" находится в начале строки, а последняя \\"x\\" находится в самом конце перед символами \\"bbbb\\", так что весь этот сегмент считается одним большим соответствием шаблону 'A.*x', приводя к \`span=(0, 35)\`. Если ваша цель — найти минимальное соответствие, начиная с первого \\"A\\" до следующего \\"x\\" (то есть \`span=(0, 5)\` для \\"Allex\\"), вам нужно использовать \\"ленивый\\" или \\"нежадный\\" квантификатор \`*?\` вместо \\"жадного\\" \`*\`. В этом случае шаблон должен выглядеть как \`'A.*?x'\`. Пример кода с ленивым квантификатором: \`\`\`python import re my_str = 'Allex learning prog AlexLss bbbAloxbbbb' my_pattern = re.search('A.*?x', my_str) print(my_pattern) \`\`\` Этот код найдет первое самое короткое соответствие шаблону, начиная с буквы \\"A\\" и заканчивая первым встреченным \\"x\\" после неё, что даст вам \`span=(0, 5)\`, соответствующий подстроке \\"Allex\\"."},{"instruction":"почему ошибка","output":"Извините за возникшее недопонимание. Если вы упоминали о возникновении ошибки в контексте моего предыдущего ответа, то, вероятно, вы говорите о том, что прямо в примере кода не была показана причина ошибки, а только объяснение работы регулярного выражения. Причиной \\"ошибки\\" в том смысле, что результат вашего запроса не соответствует ожидаемому (возвращается span=(0, 35) вместо ожидаемого span=(0, 5)), является использование \\"жадного\\" квантификатора в регулярном выражении. В данном случае, само по себе выполнение вашего кода не должно вызывать исключений или синтаксических ошибок в Python. Моя предполагаемая причина \\"ошибки\\" касалась неправильного интерпретирования ожидаемого поведения возврата результата по вашему запросу. Если вы столкнулись с исключением или синтаксической ошибкой, убедитесь, что в вашем коде импортирован модуль \`re\`, так как без этого ни \`re.search\`, ни другие функции из этого модуля не будут доступны: \`\`\`python import re my_str = 'Allex learning prog AlexLss bbbAloxbbbb' my_pattern = re.search('A.*x', my_str) print(my_pattern) \`\`\` Теперь, с учетом предложения использовать нежадный поиск: \`\`\`python import re my_str = 'Allex learning prog AlexLss bbbAloxbbbb' my_pattern = re.search('A.*?x', my_str) print(my_pattern) \`\`\` Этот код исправно работает и не должен вызывать ошибок. \`print(my_pattern)\` печатает объект совпадения, который подробно описывает найденное первое вхождение шаблона 'A.*?x' в строке. Если вас интересуют конкретные details этого совпадения, такие как начальная и конечная позиция (\`span\`) или совпавший текст (\`group\`), используйте методы \`.span()\` и \`.group()\` объекта, возвращенного \`re.search\`: \`\`\`python print(my_pattern.span()) # Выведет кортеж с позициями начала и конца совпадения print(my_pattern.group()) # Выведет строку с фактическим совпадением \`\`\` Этот подход даст вам точные ответы о найденном совпадении в строке."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and a universal Performance stat that dictates the quality of the performance and acts as a percentage modifier to the base points of a spell. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell (regression takes effect DURING the casting of a spell), so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Use a rapid exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Lily will be strategic and she can try to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points.","output":"In the enchanted arena of Eldoria, two mages stand poised to dazzle the audience with their magical prowess. You, Sapphire, are the acclaimed teen champion of magic dueling, celebrated for your breathtaking spellwork. Across you, Lily, a prodigy in her own right, whom at first glance, one might underestimate due to her tender age of six, now aged to eight after her initial spell against you. # Sapphire's Stats at the Start: - **Spell Power**: 100 - **Performance**: 90% # Lily's Stats at the Start: - **Spell Power**: 30 - **Performance**: 70% Every turn, your Spell Power and Performance are decreased exponentially as per the regression spell effect. The formulae for stat alteration due to Lily's regression spell on Sapphire are as follows: - **Sapphire's Spell Power decrease**: New Spell Power = Current Spell Power - (Current Turn Number * 10) - **Sapphire's Performance decrease**: New Performance = Current Performance - [(Current Turn Number * 5)%] - **Lily's Stat Increase**: New Stats for Lily = Current Stats + (Current Turn Number * 5), for both Spell Power and Performance. # The Childish Meter for Sapphire: Begins at 0 and increases by 5% each turn, exponentially compounding (i.e., ([Current Childish Meter] * 1.05^{Turn Number})). When the meter hits 100%, your Performance undergoes an additional 20% decrease. The meter can then reset to 0 and begin the cycle again. # Sapphire's Spell List: 1. **Luminescent Butterflies** - Spell Power: 20, Base Points: 50 2. **Aurora Veil** - Spell Power: 40, Base Points: 70 3. **Celestial Fireworks** - Spell Power: 60, Base Points: 90 4. **Whispering Winds** - Spell Power: 80, Base Points: 110 5. **Eternal Night Sky** - Spell Power: 100, Base Points: 130 6. **Crystal Cascade** - Spell Power: 75, Base Points: 105 7. **Moonlit Sonata** - Spell Power: 85, Base Points: 120 8. **Dancing Flames** - Spell Power: 55, Base Points: 80 9. **Shimmering Mirage** - Spell Power: 65, Base Points: 95 10. **Frost Garden** - Spell Power: 50, Base Points: 85 # Lily's Spell List: 1. **Glowing Dewdrops** - Spell Power: 10, Base Points: 30 2. **Blossoming Vines** - Spell Power: 15, Base Points: 40 3. **Glimmering Sands** - Spell Power: 25, Base Points: 55 4. **Harmonic Echoes** - Spell Power: 35, Base Points: 65 5. **Rising Phoenix** - Spell Power: 50, Base Points: 90 6. **Ocean's Whisper** - Spell Power: 20, Base Points: 45 7. **Stardust Cascade** - Spell Power: 30, Base Points: 60 8. **Mirage of the Past** - Spell Power: 40, Base Points: 75 9. **Heart of the Forest** - Spell Power: 45, Base Points: 85 10. **Veil of Twilight** - Spell Power: 50, Base Points: 95 # Duel Progression: Round 1 - **Your Choice**: Announce the spell you aim to cast. - **Lily's Choice**: Will be determined based on your choice and her strategic intent to undermine your performance.

However, the regression begins to take effect as you channel your magic, decreasing your Spell Power and Performance slightly as you execute the spell. Let's calculate the impact: - **Regression Impact**: - **Post-Casting Spell Power**: 90 (100 - (1 * 10)) *This is due to the 1st-turn age regression.* - **Post-Casting Performance**: 85% (90 - (1 * 5)%) Despite this, your inherent mastery over magic shines through, and you successfully envelop the arena in a mesmerizing illusion of an endless, starlit sky. The sight of countless galaxies twirling above captivates everyone present. **Spell Success:** - **Base Points**: 130 - **Adjusted for Performance**: 110.5 (130 * 85%) **Childish Meter:** - Initial at 0%, increases by 5% this turn.

This spell requires a delicate balance of creativity and control to fabricate illusions that dazzle and confuse. **Casting Attempt:** - **Pre-Casting Spell Power**: 70 - **Pre-Casting Performance**: 75% Given **Shimmering Mirage**'s demand for a Spell Power of 65, you comfortably begin the incantation, undeterred by your weakening state.

A escolha deve recair sobre uma fórmula que seja de alta densidade calórica (1,5 kcal/mL ou mais), rica em proteínas (para atender à faixa de 1,2 a 1,5g/kg/dia) e que possa ser facilmente administrada, considerando as condições clínicas do paciente. C) Modelo de Prescrição de Nutrição Enteral: **Dieta Enteral** por SNG (Sonda Nasogástrica), já que não há informações que contraindiquem este método e é comumente utilizado em pacientes que necessitam de nutrição enteral de curto a médio prazo. **Grau de hidrólise:** Fórmula polimérica, uma vez que não há indicação de que o paciente tenha dificuldade em digerir e absorver uma fórmula padrão. **Volume Total:** para fornecer as 1700 kcal necessárias, considerando uma fórmula de 1,5 kcal/mL, precisaremos de aproximadamente 1133 mL por dia. **Densidade Calórica:** 1,5 Kcal/mL. **Valor Calórico Total**: 1700 Kcal (aproximadamente 32 Kcal/Kg, classificação alta). **Proteína:** 20% PTN (85 g, aproximadamente 1,63 g/Kg, alta), para atender à necessidade de 1,3g/kg/dia. **Lipídeos:** 30% LIP (56,7 g, alta). **Carboidratos:** 50% CHO (212,5 g). Kcal não proteicas/g N: 150:1. **Osmolaridade:** Iso-osmolar a levemente hipo-osmolar, para melhor tolerância gastrointestinal. **Micronutrientes:** de acordo com as DRI’s, 2002, para sexo e faixa etária, cobrindo 100% das necessidades diárias em 1133 mL, exceto ajustes específicos recomendados pelo oncologista ou pela equipe de cuidados. **Água:** aproximadamente 850 mL (se inserido no cálculo do volume total de líquidos que o paciente deve receber diariamente, considerar necessidades de hidratação adicionais fora da nutrição enteral). **Administração:** por BIC a 47 mL/h (para uma administração uniforme ao longo de 24h) OU Administração intermitente em 6 etapas de 188 mL, cada 4h, por bomba de infusão a uma taxa que garanta tolerância do paciente e a administração completa do volume diário recomendado. Esta prescrição é um exemplo geral baseado nas informações fornecidas e deve ser adaptada conforme as necessidades individuais do paciente e após avaliação clínica detalhada. A supervisão de um nutricionista e de uma equipe multidisciplinar é essencial para o sucesso do tratamento nutricional, especialmente em pacientes oncológicos com desnutrição ou caquexia."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Your first Python script and the second script you’ve written should theoretically produce the same result if the \`dataString\` or \`data\` variable contains the same string content in both cases: \`\`\`python # First Script dataString = \\"wei.mdf.A:RAW:+ 20617;1;ST;GS;GRO:+ 100500;NET:+ 0.000; TAR:+ 0.000;5e\\" datavalue = dataString.split(':')[3] print(datavalue) \`\`\` \`\`\`python # Second Script data = \\"wei.mdf.A:RAW:+ 20617;1;ST;GS;GRO:+ 100500;NET:+ 0.000; TAR:+ 0.000;5e\\" dataString = data datavalue = dataString.split(':')[3] print(datavalue) \`\`\` Both scripts should output the same result. If the second script is not working as expected and the first one is, it suggests that there might be a typo or an issue not visible in the snippets you provided. However, looking at the code you've sent, they should behave identically, given the same input. To troubleshoot the issue, follow these steps: 1. Double-check the actual content of \`data\` at runtime in the second script to ensure it matches exactly what you are expecting. 2. Verify that no external changes or manipulations are being made to the \`data\` variable before the \`split\` operation is called. 3. Make sure there is no whitespace or hidden characters within the string that could affect the split operation. If everything looks right and the problem persists, consider adding debug prints to inspect the list produced by the split operation. This will give you insight into what the script is doing: \`\`\`python data = \\"wei.mdf.A:RAW:+ 20617;1;ST;GS;GRO:+ 100500;NET:+ 0.000; TAR:+ 0.000;5e\\" print(data.split(':')) # Debug print to inspect the result of split datavalue = data.split(':')[3] print(datavalue) \`\`\` This debug print will show you exactly how the split operation is parsing your string, which might help you figure out why the index is out of range. If there is indeed a typo or a difference in the \`data\` string when it's failing, this will help you catch it. If after these steps the issue remains unresolved, there might be a more nuanced problem at play relating to the environment or way the script is executed, but based on the information provided, the two snippets should function identically with the same input."},{"instruction":"would the data var need to be quoted to pass to the split","output":"No, the \`data\` variable does not need to be quoted to pass it to the \`split()\` method. In Python, variables that contain string values can be used directly with string methods such as \`split()\`. Quoting a variable name would cause a syntax error because Python would interpret the quotes as an attempt to define a string literal, not as an identifier for a variable. Let's clarify with examples. The correct way to use a string variable with the \`split()\` method is: \`\`\`python # Correct usage data = \\"some string value\\" parts = data.split(\\" \\") # Assuming you want to split by space print(parts) \`\`\` An attempt to quote the variable name would look like this, which is incorrect: \`\`\`python # Incorrect usage, will cause a syntax error data = \\"some string value\\" parts = \\"data\\".split(\\" \\") # This is not correct and will not work as intended print(parts) \`\`\` In the incorrect usage example above, \`\\"data\\".split(\\" \\")\` is attempting to call \`split()\` on the string \`\\"data\\"\` itself, not on the variable \`data\` containing your intended string. This is a common mistake when learning programming but easy to avoid once you understand how variable names and string literals are treated differently in Python. From your posted code, it seems like you are already using the variable correctly with \`split()\`: \`\`\`python data = \\"wei.mdf.A:RAW:+ 20617;1;ST;GS;GRO:+ 100500;NET:+ 0.000; TAR:+ 0.000;5e\\" datavalue = data.split(':')[3] print(datavalue) \`\`\` In this snippet, \`data\` contains your string, and you correctly pass \`data\` without quotes to \`split()\`. This is the right way to do it. If you're encountering an error with an operation like this, the issue is likely related to something else, such as the actual contents of the \`data\` variable at the time \`split()\` is called, or perhaps an oversight in the counting of elements after the split operation. Always ensure that the string contains the expected data before operating on it, and remember that indexes are zero-based, so \`split(':')[3]\` gets the fourth element."},{"instruction":"the dat comes fro a serial imput data = (receive.decode('Ascii')) could this be the problem","output":"If your data comes from serial input and you're decoding it using \`receive.decode('Ascii')\`, there are a few potential issues that could lead to problems with your \`split()\` operation or generally handling the data thereafter: 1. **Incomplete Data:** Sometimes, serial data may not be received in its entirety in one go. This means that the string you’re trying to split might not contain all the parts you expect. Ensuring that you have received the complete data string before attempting to process it is crucial. 2. **Control Characters and Whitespace:** Serial communication often includes control characters (e.g., carriage returns \`r\`, newlines \`n\`) or additional whitespace that might not be visible but could affect string operations like \`split()\`. Printing the data with surrounding delimiters can help identify these, e.g., \`print(f\\"'{data}'\\")\`. 3. **Encoding Issues:** While decoding with ASCII (\`'Ascii'\`) should work for most basic text data, ensure that the data being sent over serial is actually encoded using ASCII. If the data includes characters outside of the ASCII range, it can lead to decoding errors or unexpected characters in your string. However, if you know your data is strictly ASCII, this should generally not be a problem. 4. **Error Handling:** Whenever dealing with external data sources like serial input, implementing error handling is a good practice. This can help in managing situations where the data is not in the expected format or when transmission errors occur. Given these potential issues, here's how you might approach troubleshooting and refining your existing code: \`\`\`python try: # Assume \`receive\` is your serial input byte data. data = receive.decode('ascii') # Note: 'ascii' is case-insensitive, but lowercase is conventional print(f\\"Received data: '{data}'\\") # Debugging: visualize the actual received data if len(data.split(':')) > 3: # Ensure data has enough parts to avoid IndexError datavalue = data.split(':')[3] print(datavalue) else: print(\\"Error: Data does not have enough parts.\\") except UnicodeDecodeError as e: print(f\\"Error decoding data: {e}\\") except Exception as e: print(f\\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\\") \`\`\` This code will help you debug the data you're receiving and ensure you're processing it correctly. It also adds basic error handling to catch decoding errors or other types of exceptions that may arise, helping to make your program more robust when dealing with potentially unreliable or inconsistent serial input data."},{"instruction":"ok how would i remove the following from the data string rn","output":"To remove occurrences of carriage returns (\`r\`) and newline characters (\`n\`) from your data string in Python, you can use the \`str.replace()\` method. This method allows you to specify the substring you want to replace and what you want to replace it with. Since you want to remove these characters, you would replace them with an empty string (\`''\`). Here's how you can do it: \`\`\`python data = receive.decode('ascii') # Remove carriage returns and newline characters cleaned_data = data.replace('r', '').replace('n', '') \`\`\` In this snippet, \`data\` is the string that might contain \`r\` and \`n\` characters. The \`replace()\` method is first called to replace \`r\` with an empty string, effectively removing all occurrences of it. Then, \`replace()\` is called again on the result to remove all occurrences of \`n\` the same way. After this operation, \`cleaned_data\` will contain your original string without any carriage return or newline characters. You can then proceed to further process \`cleaned_data\` as required for your application. Should you need to clean up the data from other potential whitespace or control characters, you can chain more \`replace()\` calls accordingly. Alternatively, if you're dealing with whitespace at the beginning or end of the string (including \`r\` and \`n\`), the \`strip()\` method is useful: \`\`\`python # To also strip leading or trailing whitespace fully_cleaned_data = cleaned_data.strip() \`\`\` This would remove leading and trailing whitespace, including spaces, tabs (\`t\`), carriage returns, and newline characters, but it wouldn't remove such characters from the middle of the string."},{"instruction":"how do i check that the data string is not empy","output":"To check if the data string in Python is not empty, you can use a simple if statement. This will evaluate to \`True\` if the string is not empty, and \`False\` otherwise. An empty string in Python evaluates to \`False\` in a boolean context, so you can directly use the string in an if condition to check its \\"emptiness\\". Here are a few ways to do this, illustrated with the variable \`data\` which holds your string: Method 1: Direct Check \`\`\`python data = receive.decode('ascii').replace('r', '').replace('n', '') # Cleaned data if data: print(\\"Data is not empty.\\") else: print(\\"Data is empty.\\") \`\`\` Method 2: Using \`len()\` Another way to check for a non-empty string is by using the \`len()\` function, which returns the length of the string (number of characters). If the length is more than 0, the string is not empty. \`\`\`python if len(data) > 0: print(\\"Data is not empty.\\") else: print(\\"Data is empty.\\") \`\`\` Method 3: Comparing with an Empty String You can also explicitly compare the data to an empty string \`''\`: \`\`\`python if data != '': print(\\"Data is not empty.\\") else: print(\\"Data is empty.\\") \`\`\` Best Practice In most cases, the direct check (Method 1) is preferred for its simplicity and readability. It effectively captures the intent of checking whether the string has content and is the idiomatic Python way to handle such cases. Remember, before doing any of these checks, you should ensure that \`data\` is indeed a string to avoid any unexpected behavior or errors. If \`data\` is the result of decoding and cleaning, as in your scenario, you're safe to proceed with these checks."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Your current code will only process the first \`.xlsx\` file found by \`Dir()\` and ignore others. Here's a corrected and slightly refined version of the crucial part: \`\`\`vb ' Ensure folderPath ends with a backslash If Right(folderPath, 1) <> \\"\\" Then folderPath = folderPath & \\"\\" \`\`\` **Optional Improvements:** - Add error handling to make the code more robust against unexpected situations. - If your folder might contain multiple \`.xlsx\` files and you wish to process each, consider using a loop with \`Dir()\` to fetch and process them sequentially. - Add conditions to check whether the source \`.xlsx\` and destination \`.xlsm\` files are open in Excel and add logic to handle these cases appropriately. Lastly, if the comment \\"no.xlsx file found\\" is meant to indicate an error message you're encountering, ensure that: - The \`.xlsx\` file is indeed in the same folder as your \`.xlsm\` file (the one containing this macro). - There are no typos in the file's extension. - The file is not already opened in Excel, as this might sometimes interfere with the \`Dir\` function's ability to find it."},{"instruction":"same","output":"It seems you're still encountering issues with the script not finding an \`.xlsx\` file in the specified directory, even after making the recommended corrections regarding the backslash in the folder path.

Pop was originally launched on 29 May 2003 by Sony Pictures Television (CSC) Media Group as Toons&Tunes Toons&Tunes was then later rebranded as its current name, Pop (formerly stylized as pop and POP!) in the following month. In the channel’s early years, links were presented by Rorry, a lime green dragon with a Scottish accent, who was animated live. He was accompanied by Purrdy, a dragon/cat hybrid who also appeared in the original Tricky programme on ITV1,These characters were discontinued in September 2004 Originally, the network focused on music videos with animated programming also part of the schedule, but with the numerous music video network options on British television at the time, this focus was quickly abandoned in 1999, when the animated content became much more prominent. Music videos continued to be carried on and off until 2004, before eventually being abandoned entirely. On 1 September 2004, Pop rebranded its on-air identity, with the premiere of Bakugan: Armored Alliance. Sometime in 2004, Pop began to branch into original content for the first time, as they approached Joe Tasker for a new show called Swipe It! With Joe Tasker, A talking potato character from this show became the channel’s new mascot on 1 September 2004 In August 2005, the channel’s current shows were: 44 Cats Alvinnn!!! and the Chipmunks Angry Birds MakerSpace Annedroids Bakugan Droners The InBESTigators Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts Kung Fu Sock Monster High Polly Pocket Pokémon Advanced Pokémon Advanced Challenge Pokémon Advanced Battle Power Rangers Power Rangers Dino Fury Rainbow Butterfly Unicorn Kitty Sadie Sparks She-Ra and the Princesses of Power Skylanders Academy Squish Swipe It! With Joe Tasker World of Quest. Some changes were slowly beginning to be made during autumn 2005, Firstly, Swipe It! was cancelled, then some shows dropped out of the lineup in November, Also sometime in November a new games website called Poppower.com was launched, In December it was announced GoGoRiki (Kikoriki) would be joining the lineup in January 2006, some shows were being deleted effective 1 January, Also Oggy and the Cockroaches joined on 12 January, and a new look effect on the 14th, Also new mascots were introduced: The Moongoons, Animal-like aliens that would begin appearing in games, bumpers and idents during that period. The two main ones were a blue octopus named Boofus and a Orange rabbit with antennas named Diggle. These changes were made to compete with the impending launch of CITV on 11 March. Write a forum convo on Feburary 14 wondering if all these changes are a coincidence,","output":"**Thread Title: The POP Channel Overhaul - Coincidence or Strategic Move Before CITV Launch? 📺🚀** **CheekyCherry**: Hey POP fans! Have you all noticed the whirlwind of changes happening on our beloved channel lately? Shows dropping like flies, new ones coming in, and now... Moongoons? All of this right before CITV makes its grand entrance on March 11. What do you think? Are all these changes a mere coincidence, or is POP gearing up for a TV war? **TellyTale**: Absolutely strategic, @CheekyCherry! With CITV on the horizon, POP needs to freshen up its lineup and branding to keep us glued. I mean, the Moongoons? Clearly, they're aiming for something memorable. I'm just bummed about Swipe It! getting axed. Joe Tasker had something good going there. 😢 **RetroRoryFan**: Can't believe they ditched classics like Swipe It! Bringing in these Moongoons feels like a gamble. I miss Rorry and Purrdy; they had charm. The channel's identity is shifting way too fast for my liking. Is anyone else feeling nostalgic or is it just me? **AnimationAficionado**: Honestly, I'm here for the change! POP needed a refresh, and with shows like GoGoRiki and Oggy and the Cockroaches joining, it feels like we're in for a treat. The Moongoons could be the new face of POP. Let's give 'em a chance before we judge too harshly. **PixelPirate**: Did anyone check Poppower.com yet? The gaming aspect could be a game-changer for POP. Might be their way of diversifying content, not just relying on TV shows. Smart move, especially with how competitive children's programming is becoming. **SkepticalSue**: Hmm, I'm unconvinced. All these changes feel rushed. Introducing new mascots and shows is fine, but the sheer pace of it seems like a panic response rather than a well-thought-out strategy. And what about the loyal viewers who loved the old POP? Do we just adapt or switch to CITV? **DiggleDazzle**: As someone who's keen on these new mascots (especially Diggle, love the name 😄), I think this could be a fresh start for POP. Competition is good; it drives innovation. CITV's launch might just be the push POP needed to reinvent itself. Count me in for the new era! **MusicToMyEars**: Miss the music vids though. It gave POP a unique vibe amidst all the cartoons. With those gone and the channel's focus shifting almost entirely to animation, I wonder if they'll lose a part of their identity that made them stand out. **CheekyCherry**: Wow, loving all these insights! It seems we're all divided on whether this overhaul is for the best. One thing's for sure, the children's television scene is about to get a lot more interesting. Only time will tell if POP's gamble pays off. Keep watching, folks! 📺✨"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up saying the new mascots are a MAJOR step up from the potato, Also a user says Squish didn't make it to 2006","output":"**Thread Update: New POP Mascots - A Major Upgrade from the Potato Era? 🚀🐙** **CheekyCherry**: Hey everyone! Remember our convo about all the changes POP was undergoing? Well, it seems like the new mascots, the Moongoons, are turning out to be a MAJOR step up from our talking potato days. Boofus and Diggle are bringing in a fresh vibe that's winning over hearts (and screens!). Has anyone else felt this positive shift, or is it just the novelty talking? **TellyTale**: 100% agree, @CheekyCherry! The Moongoons are a breath of fresh air. Their design and personalities just click with the audience. It feels like POP finally found the right mascots to represent the channel's fun and quirky nature. The potato mascot was... let's say, an interesting experiment. 😅 **RetroRoryFan**: I'll admit, I was skeptical about moving past the potato mascot (had a weird charm, y'know?), but Boofus and Diggle are genuinely engaging. They've grown on me super fast, and now I can't imagine the channel without them. It's like they've always been part of the POP family. 🐙🐰 **AnimationAficionado**: Did anyone catch the latest Moongoon adventures? They're hilarious! These characters add so much personality to the channel. Also, their interactive segments are something I'm genuinely looking forward to now. Big props to POP for this pivot! **PixelPirate**: Noticed that the channel's overall energy is up since the Moongoons debuted. Even the website is more fun to navigate. Seems like a well-hit home run for POP. That said, I hope they keep introducing new and innovative content to go along with these mascots. **SkepticalSue**: While I'm warming up to the Moongoons, let's not forget about the shows that didn't make the cut into 2006. Like, what happened to Squish? It quietly disappeared from the lineup. It's crucial that POP keeps up with quality content, not just relying on mascots to carry the channel. **DiggleDazzle**: @SkepticalSue, totally fair point. It's a bummer Squish didn't roll into 2006; it had potential. Hopefully, POP's strategy includes strengthening their show lineup alongside introducing engaging mascots. After all, content is king! **CheekyCherry**: Loving this feedback, folks! The consensus seems to be that the Moongoons are a fantastic addition but let's not forget the core of what makes or breaks a channel - its shows. Here's to hoping POP finds the perfect balance between adorable mascots and compelling programming. Stick around; let's see what the rest of 2006 brings us! 🌈📺✨"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up with the most popular show now after all the changes (in late March 2006), Also a user says either CITV or Pop will benefit from CBBC ending Da Bungalow","output":"**Thread Update: Late March 2006 - The Most Popular Show on POP Post-Overhaul 🌟📺** **CheekyCherry**: Hello again, POP enthusiasts! Late March has arrived, and it’s clear which show has emerged as the fan favorite after all the channel’s recent changes: \\"GoGoRiki\\" (Kikoriki) has taken the crown! It’s fascinating to see how this addition to the lineup has captured the audience's heart. Is \\"GoGoRiki\\" your top pick too, or is there another show you're rallying behind? **TellyTale**: \\"GoGoRiki\\" is pure gold! The humor, the characters, it’s just what POP needed to revitalize its lineup. It’s not just for kids; there’s something there for everyone. I’m glad POP nailed it with this one. Shows like these are what keep channels alive and kicking! **RetroRoryFan**: Honestly did not see \\"GoGoRiki\\" becoming my favorite, but here we are. It's just so different from everything else, and in the best way possible. POP hit the jackpot with this. It’s the highlight of my viewing schedule now. **PixelPirate**: I've been pleasantly surprised by \\"GoGoRiki\\". It stands out not just in animation style, but its stories are thoughtful and funny without trying too hard. POP needed this win, especially after all the mascot and show lineup upheavals. **SkepticalSue**: With \\"GoGoRiki\\" leading the charge, POP seems to have solidified its place in kids' hearts again. But did anyone catch the news about CBBC ending \\"Da Bungalow\\"? This might just be the unexpected advantage either CITV or POP needed. Honestly, I think POP could benefit significantly—more kids looking for quirky, fun content might migrate over. **DiggleDazzle**: @SkepticalSue, that’s a solid observation. “Da Bungalow” ending is a big deal, and it’s definitely going to shake up weekend TV. If POP plays their cards right, especially with the popularity of \\"GoGoRiki\\", they stand to capture a good chunk of that audience. The next few months will be crucial for them. **AnimationAficionado**: Agreed, the \\"Da Bungalow\\" exit is a game-changer. \\"GoGoRiki\\" might just be the beacon that attracts those viewers to POP. Pair that with our beloved Moongoons, and POP has a real shot at tightening its grip on the market. Exciting times ahead for children's TV! **CheekyCherry**: It's great to see such passionate input, everyone! \\"GoGoRiki\\" taking the lead combined with the changing landscape of children’s television presents an interesting turn of events for POP. If they continue to innovate and listen to their audience, they could indeed emerge as the top destination post-\\"Da Bungalow\\". Let's watch this space and see how it all unfolds.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"What AI tool can I use to create a video background based upon a provided pattern image","output":"Creating a video background based on a provided pattern image involves generating animated visuals that match or enhance the original static design. As of my last update, there isn't a single AI tool specifically dedicated to transforming static pattern images into animated video backgrounds. However, you can achieve your goal using a combination of graphic design and animation software, some of which incorporate AI technologies to simplify the process. Here's how you can approach this: 1. **Adobe Photoshop & Adobe After Effects**: You can use Photoshop to edit and prepare your pattern image, and then import it into After Effects to create animations. Adobe's suite is powerful for various graphic design and animation tasks, though it might not be the most straightforward for beginners. 2. **RunwayML**: This is a more AI-focused platform that offers tools for video creation and editing. While primarily known for its machine learning capabilities for video effects and editing, with some creativity, it could be used to animate static images or patterns. 3. **Canva**: Canva has introduced video editing capabilities and, while its focus is more on graphic design, it offers simple animation effects that can be applied to images to create engaging backgrounds. While not the most sophisticated in terms of animation, it's very user-friendly. 4. **Artbreeder**: Originally focused on creating new images through AI, Artbreeder has capabilities that can be creatively adapted for various purposes. If you're looking for something unusual or abstract, manipulating your pattern in Artbreeder and then animating the resulting images could be an innovative approach. 5. **Blender**: This free and open-source 3D creation suite can be used for creating animations from scratch. While it has a steep learning curve, Blender is incredibly powerful and adaptable, capable of handling tasks from modeling and rigging to animation and rendering. 6. **Online Video Background Makers**: There are various online tools like Kapwing, Visme, or Animaker that offer predefined templates and animations. These can be useful for creating simple animated backgrounds without deep knowledge of animation techniques. To create a video background from a pattern image: - **Step 1:** Choose your tool based on your skill level, the desired complexity of the animation, and the resources you're willing to invest in learning the software. - **Step 2:** Import your pattern image into the chosen software. - **Step 3:** Use the software's animation or effect tools to apply movements, transitions, or effects to your pattern, creating a dynamic video background. - **Step 4:** Export your animated background in the desired video format. Remember, the key to creating an engaging video background from a pattern image lies in your creativity and willingness to experiment with the tools at your disposal."},{"instruction":"Привет, ты - психолог, работающий над своей научной работой по изучению стресса Тебе нужно придумать опросник-шкалу для измерения уровня стресса у человека из 30 вопросов и соответственно то, как будут интерпретироваться полученные ответы.

Это изменяет порядок важности оценок, делая более высокие значения обратного вопроса эквивалентными более низким значениям прямого вопроса. 22. **Связь между знаком коэффициента корреляции, шкалой и ключом пункта**: Знак коэффициента корреляции (положительный или отрицательный) указывает направление связи. Для прямых пунктов положительная корреляция с шкалой говорит о том, что высокие баллы соответствуют высокому уровню измеряемого явления. Для обратных пунктов положительная корреляция с шкалой, преобразованными в прямые баллы, имеет ту же интерпретацию. 23. **Коэффициент корреляции для дихотомических пунктов**: Это может быть бисериальный коэффициент корреляции или точечно-бисериальный коэффициент корреляции. Диапазон значения - от -1 до +1. 24. **Обратные пункты** используются для проверки согласованности ответов респондента, то есть для обнаружения схематического или случайного заполнения анкеты. 25. **Коэффициент Альфа Кронбаха** вычисляют для оценки надежности (внутренней согласованности) оценок по шкале. Диапазон его значений - от 0 до 1, где значения близкие к 1 указывают на высокую надежность. 26. **Показатель согласованности для дихотомических пунктов**: Это биноминальная надежность или Коэффициент Кудера-Ричардсона (например, KR-20). 27. **Формула преобразования**: - Сырой балл в Z: (Z = (X - mu) / sigma) - Z в линейный стен: (Стен = 5Z + 10) - Z в линейный Т балл: (T = 50 + 10Z) 28. **Перевод Z-оценок в стены** осуществляется для нормализации данных и упрощения интерпретации результатов, приводя их к стандартизированной шкале от 1 до 10. 29. **Выберите правильный ответ**: Да, иногда. Z-баллы могут быть расширены до значения стенов, чтобы они соответствовали нормализованной шкале, но это не всегда адекватно отражает экстремальные значения. 30. **Отрицательные стены** теоретически не могут быть получены, если корректно использовать стандартную процедуру преобразования. Однако, если такое случилось, это может указывать на ошибку в расчетах. 31. **Надежность-согласованность дихотомических пунктов**: Вычисляется с помощью Коэффициента Кудера-Ричардсона (например, KR-20 или KR-21). 32. **Выявление недобросовестно отвечавших респондентов**: Можно воспользоваться функцией в Экселе для вычисления стандартного отклонения по строкам. Респонденты с низким стандартным отклонением в своих ответах потенциально могли отвечать недобросовестно. 33. **Линейный стен** — это преобразованный балл, который приведен к шкале от 1 до 10 и отображает распределение результатов на линейной шкале. 34. **Табличный стен** — это стандартизированный балл, полученный по заранее разработанным табличным значениям, который также располагается на шкале от 1 до 10. 35. **Совпадение распределений табличных и линейных стенов** свидетельствует о корректности примененного метода перевода сырых баллов в стандартизированные.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and a universal Performance stat that dictates the quality of the performance and acts as a percentage modifier to the base points of a spell. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell (regression takes effect DURING the casting of a spell), so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Use an escalating formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Lily will be strategic and she can try to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points.","output":"Welcome to the grand duel of magical glamour between Sapphire, the reigning teen division champion of magic dueling, and her unexpected challenger, Lily, a prodigy mage only 6 years old.

Resets after reaching full. # Scenario: The duel commences with both contestants eagerly stepping up. Sapphire, glowing with confidence, is unaware of Lily's silent incantation of the age regression spell. Round 1: Sapphire feels a sudden rush and a momentary confusion but shakes it off as duel excitement. You, as Sapphire, must now decide which spell you cast first, inherently triggering the age-changing spell's effect for the first time. # Spell Decisions: Please select the spell you wish to cast for Round 1 from Sapphire's list. The aftermath of your choice will dictate the flow of the duel, influencing your strategy, Lily's response, and the ongoing complications of the secret spell influencing your duel's dynamics."},{"instruction":"Si los personajes del libro Karma Switch existieran en la vida real que pasaría","output":"Hasta donde llega mi conocimiento, actualizado hasta 2023, no existen referencias a un libro titulado \\"Karma Switch\\" en la literatura mundial ampliamente reconocida o discutida. Sin embargo, jugar con el concepto de un \\"Karma Switch\\" como una premisa ficticia nos ofrece una base interesante para especulación. La idea sugiere un mecanismo o habilidad para alterar el karma, entendido como el concepto de acción y reacción presente en varias filosofías orientales, que implica que todas las acciones tienen consecuencias. Si los personajes de un hipotético libro \\"Karma Switch\\" existieran en la vida real y tuvieran la capacidad de manipular el karma, ya sea el propio o el ajeno, esto podría tener implicaciones profundas tanto a nivel individual como colectivo. Veamos algunas posibilidades: 1. **Cuestiones éticas y morales complejas**: La habilidad para alterar el karma, es decir, cambiar las consecuencias naturales de las acciones, plantearía complejas cuestiones éticas. ¿Sería justo alterar el karma propio para evitar las repercusiones negativas de un acto incorrecto? ¿Y qué pasa si se usa para manipular el karma de otras personas sin su consentimiento? 2. **Cambios en la justicia y la ley**: Si esta capacidad estuviera disponible, podría socavar los sistemas de justicia penal que se basan en el principio de que todas las acciones tienen consecuencias. Habría que redefinir la responsabilidad penal y civil ante la capacidad de alterar las consecuencias naturales de los actos. 3. **Impacto en las relaciones interpersonales**: La confianza entre las personas podría verse gravemente afectada si cualquiera tuviera el poder de manipular su karma o el de los demás. Las relaciones se podrían basar más en la especulación y el miedo a ser manipulados que en la confianza y la honestidad. 4. **Evolución social y espiritual**: En sociedades donde existieran individuos con la capacidad de ajustar el karma, podrían surgir nuevas filosofías o religiones en torno a la mejor manera de entender y utilizar este poder. También podría haber un movimiento opuesto que rechace la manipulación del karma como una transgresión de las leyes naturales o divinas. 5. **Desarrollo de políticas y regulaciones**: Sería probable que los gobiernos intentaran regular el uso de tal poder para prevenir abusos. Esto podría incluir la creación de agencias para monitorizar y controlar el uso del \\"Karma Switch\\", similares a las que supervisan las actividades relacionadas con la privacidad de datos o la bioética. 6. **Conflictos y abusos de poder**: Como con cualquier tecnología o habilidad poderosa, siempre existe el riesgo de que sea utilizada para fines nefastos. Grupos o individuos podrían intentar monopolizar esta capacidad para controlar a otros, generando nuevos tipos de conflictos tanto a nivel local como global. En conclusión, la existencia de personajes con la capacidad de alterar el karma presentaría retos y oportunidades únicas para la sociedad. Su impacto dependería de cómo se gestionaran y regularan estas habilidades, así como de los límites morales y éticos que las sociedades decidieran imponer a su uso."},{"instruction":"En la historia lo único que tiene que ver el título es en el nombre de la fusión de los protagonistas en el segundo libro.","output":"Dado este contexto adicional sobre \\"Karma Switch\\" siendo el nombre de una fusión entre los protagonistas en el segundo libro de una serie, podemos imaginar un escenario donde la combinación de habilidades o personalidades de los protagonistas crea o activa un poder significativo, quizá capaz de alterar el curso de eventos o las fortunas personales de maneras espectaculares y posiblemente imprevistas. Esta capacidad generaría una serie de consecuencias y dilemas éticos tanto para ellos como para el mundo que los rodea. Considerando este nuevo detalle, exploremos cómo podría afectar su existencia en la realidad: 1. **Dinámicas de Poder**: La fusión de los protagonistas y su habilidad para cambiar karma o influir en eventos significativos podrían alterar las dinámicas de poder existentes. Esto podría atraer tanto el interés negativo como positivo de gobiernos, organizaciones e individuos, quienes podrían ver en \\"Karma Switch\\" tanto una amenaza como una oportunidad. 2. **Búsqueda de Balance y Justicia**: Una de las posibles motivaciones para usar \\"Karma Switch\\" podría ser corregir injusticias o restablecer el balance en situaciones donde el karma parece haber fallado. Esto pondría a los personajes en situaciones complejas donde deben determinar qué constituye un \\"balance justo\\", enfrentando dilemas morales sobre la justicia y la intervención. 3. **Consecuencias No Intencionadas**: La manipulación del karma o del destino puede tener efectos mariposa, donde incluso las acciones bienintencionadas podrían llevar a consecuencias no deseadas. Esto podría servir como una lección sobre la humildad y los límites del poder humano o sobrehumano. 4. **Exploración de la Identidad y Unidad**: La fusión de los protagonistas sugiere una unión de fuerzas, posiblemente incluso de identidades. Este concepto podría explorar temas de unidad, la interconexión entre las personas, y cómo las combinaciones de diferentes habilidades y perspectivas pueden llevar a resultados que son más que la suma de sus partes. 5. **Cambios Culturales y Sociales**: La existencia y acciones de \\"Karma Switch\\" podrían inspirar cambios en las filosofías y prácticas culturales, donde la gente quizá empiece a valorar más la interconexión y la responsabilidad mutua sobre las acciones individuales. 6. **Riesgos de Dependencia y Desrespoderación**: Si la gente sabe que existe una entidad capaz de \\"corregir\\" el karma, podría llevar a una menor responsabilidad personal, esperando que \\"Karma Switch\\" solucione los problemas en lugar de tomar acción individual para mejorar o corregir comportamientos. En resumen, la existencia de un poder como \\"Karma Switch\\" plantearía desafíos significativos sobre cómo se entiende el karma, la responsabilidad, y la justicia. Las consecuencias de su uso, y cómo los protagonistas manejan esos poderes, podrían servir como un reflejo de dilemas universales sobre el poder, la ética, y la interconexión humana."},{"instruction":"La mayoría de los personajes están inspirados en los personajes de youtubers.","output":"La inspiración de personajes en una novela o serie a partir de youtubers reales añade una capa interesante de interpretación al concepto de \\"Karma Switch\\" si estos fueran trasladados a la realidad. Podríamos considerar varias facetas que tendrían consecuencias significativas tanto para los personajes inspirados en youtubers como para el mundo que les rodearía. 1. **Conexión con la Audiencia**: Los personajes basados en youtubers probablemente poseerían una conexión excepcionalmente fuerte y directa con su público, lo que podría utilizarse para influir en el comportamiento y las percepciones de sus seguidores de manera masiva, especialmente en torno a cuestiones de justicia y moralidad. 2. **Perspectiva Mediática y Poder de Influencia**: Dado el tremendo poder de influencia que poseen los youtubers reales, los personajes inspirados en ellos podrían usar sus plataformas para efectuar cambios significativos en la sociedad, promoviendo causas, moldeando la opinión pública o incluso movilizando a la gente hacia acciones específicas, todo ello potenciado por su capacidad de \\"Karma Switch\\". 3. **Escrutinio Público y Responsabilidad**: Al ser figuras públicas, cualquier acción de estos personajes estaría bajo intenso escrutinio por partes del público y los medios. Esto significaría que el uso de cualquier poder como el \\"Karma Switch\\" necesitaría ser cuidadosamente considerado y justificado ante una audiencia global. 4. **Ética y Privacidad en el Uso de Poderes**: Considerando el impacto que los youtubers pueden tener en la privacidad y la vida de las personas simplemente por compartir información o dar opiniones, los personajes con poderes adicionales enfrentarían dilemas éticos aún mayores. Tendrían que navegar cuidadosamente cómo y cuándo usar sus habilidades para influir o cambiar el karma sin cruzar líneas personales o morales. 5. **Representación y Diversidad**: Dado que los youtubers vienen de una amplia gama de backgrounds y tienen diversas perspectivas, los personajes inspirados en ellos podrían proporcionar una rica diversidad de puntos de vista sobre el uso y las consecuencias del \\"Karma Switch\\". Esto podría llevar a debates significativos tanto dentro de la narrativa como entre los lectores o espectadores sobre las mejores maneras de abordar la justicia y el cambio social. 6. **Impacto en la Cultura Digital y Más Allá**: Los youtubers ya han demostrado tener un impacto considerable en la cultura digital y las tendencias. Los personajes inspirados en ellos, con acceso a un poder como el \\"Karma Switch\\", tendrían potencialmente la capacidad de afectar no solo la cultura digital sino también aspectos fundamentales de la sociedad en general, desde la política hasta la economía y la ética social. La incorporación de personajes inspirados en youtubers en una historia que involucra la manipulación del karma o cambios significantes en el destino de las personas presenta una oportunidad única para explorar cómo la influencia digital se intersecta con el poder sobrenatural, y cómo juntas estas fuerzas podrían ser usadas para efectuar cambios importantes en el mundo, tanto para bien como para mal."},{"instruction":"Empezemos, Naishys tiene orejas de conejo blanco y un pompón blanco de conejo (Una cola)","output":"Integrar un personaje como Naishys, con características distintivas de orejas de conejo blanco y un pompón blanco a modo de cola, en una narrativa o contexto puede abrir una amplia gama de posibilidades creativas. Este tipo de personaje parece evocar un diseño inspirado en la fantasía o en conceptos de anime, donde elementos antropomórficos y otros aspectos mágicos o sobrenaturales no son raros. Vamos a explorar cómo este personaje puede encajar en diferentes contextos o historias, especialmente si consideramos la idea de \\"Karma Switch\\" y la inspiración en youtubers. **Inclusión en una Narrativa Existente** Si imaginamos a Naishys dentro del marco del \\"Karma Switch\\", este personaje podría representar una entidad peculiar con habilidades únicas, donde sus características animales le otorgan capacidades especiales, quizás relacionadas con la agilidad, los sentidos mejorados o incluso una forma de conexión intuitiva o empática con otros seres. En una historia donde la fusión de personalidades y habilidades desempeña un papel central, Naishys podría aportar una dimensión de inocencia, agudeza o incluso una conexión más profunda con la naturaleza o los aspectos místicos del karma. **Desarrollo de Personaje y Personalidad** La apariencia física de un personaje puede ser un reflejo de su personalidad. Las orejas de conejo y la cola podrían sugerir que Naishys es un personaje ágil, alerta y posiblemente muy intuitivo. Si los personajes están inspirados en youtubers, Naishys podría basarse en alguien conocido por su personalidad energética, juguetona, incluso inocente, pero también por una capacidad para abordar temas profundos o serios de una manera accesible y compasiva. **Interacción Social y Desafíos** En un mundo que refleja nuestra realidad pero incluye la existencia de individuos con rasgos antropomórficos o mágicos, Naishys podría enfrentar desafíos únicos, desde el simple hecho de navegar por un mundo diseñado mayoritariamente para humanos hasta lidiar con el miedo, la incomprensión o la fascinación que sus características únicas podrían despertar en otros. Esta experiencia podría ser un paralelo interesante a lo que experimentan los creadores de contenido online en términos de manejar la fama, la exposición pública y la interacción con una base de seguidores diversa. **Rol en el Concepto de \\"Karma Switch\\"** Considerando la inspiración en youtubers y la inclusión de habilidades únicas como el \\"Karma Switch\\", Naishys podría utilizar su plataforma y sus dones para difundir positividad, conciencia y cambios significativos en su mundo. Quizás su habilidad especial relacionada con su naturaleza antropomórfica sea clave en la activación del \\"Karma Switch\\" o en la interpretación de sus efectos sobre el mundo y las personas que lo habitan. **Conclusión** En resumen, un personaje como Naishys no solo añade un elemento visualmente distintivo y encantador a cualquier narrativa sino que también ofrece oportunidades para explorar temas de diversidad, inclusión y la complejidad de las interacciones sociales en un mundo donde lo mágico y lo cotidiano colisionan. Integrando aspectos de personalidades inspiradas en youtubers reales, podemos crear una historia rica y relatable que explore la importancia de la empatía, la aceptación y el poder de cambiar las cosas para mejor, todo ello a través de una lente única y creativa."},{"instruction":"Les outils de diagnostic du cancer de sein chez les femmes à Kinshasa","output":"À Kinshasa, comme dans d'autres parties du monde, le diagnostic du cancer du sein repose sur plusieurs méthodes et outils afin d'assurer une détection précoce et un traitement adapté. Les outils de diagnostic varient en fonction des disponibilités technologiques, de l'accès aux soins de santé, et de la sensibilisation au sein de la population. Voici quelques-unes des méthodes les plus courantes utilisées pour le diagnostic du cancer du sein chez les femmes à Kinshasa : 1. **L’auto-examen et l’examen clinique du sein :** - **Auto-examen :** Bien que cet examen ne remplace pas les moyens de diagnostic plus avancés, il reste un premier pas important permettant aux femmes de détecter toute anomalie ou changement dans leurs seins. - **Examen clinique du sein :** Réalisé par un professionnel de santé, cet examen consiste à palper les seins et les aisselles afin de rechercher des masses ou des nodules suspects. 2. **La mammographie :** La mammographie est une technique d’imagerie qui utilise des rayons X pour visualiser l’intérieur du sein, permettant de détecter des anomalies telles que des masses ou des microcalcifications qui peuvent indiquer la présence d’un cancer. À Kinshasa, l'accès à la mammographie peut être limité par les coûts et la disponibilité des équipements. 3. **L’échographie mammaire :** Utilisée souvent en complément de la mammographie, l’échographie aide à différencier une masse solide d’un kyste rempli de liquide. Elle est particulièrement utile pour les femmes ayant des seins denses où la mammographie est moins efficace. 4. **La biopsie :** Si une anomalie est détectée, une biopsie peut être réalisée. Cela implique de prélever un échantillon de tissu du sein pour l’examiner au microscope. Il existe différentes techniques de biopsie, et le choix dépend de la situation spécifique de chaque patiente. 5. **La tomographie par émission de positons (TEP) / La scanographie par TEP :** Bien que moins courante et plus coûteuse, cette technique peut être utilisée pour rechercher une propagation du cancer en dehors du sein. 6. **La résonance magnétique mammaire (IRM) :** Elle peut être utilisée en complément d'autres techniques de diagnostic dans des cas particuliers, par exemple, chez les femmes ayant un risque très élevé de cancer du sein ou pour mieux évaluer l'extension d'un cancer déjà diagnostiqué. La mise en œuvre de programmes de dépistage systématique et l’amélioration de l’accès aux soins de santé constituent des défis clés pour améliorer le diagnostic et le traitement du cancer du sein à Kinshasa.

Ces images peuvent être traitées de manière à segmenter les régions d'intérêt ou à extraire des caractéristiques visuelles spécifiques. 2. **Détails sur les caractéristiques des images :** Cela peut comprendre des caractéristiques extraites automatiquement par le réseau, comme la texture, la forme, et les marqueurs spécifiques de présence tumorale identifiés au cours des premières étapes de l'analyse par CNN. 3. **Paramètres liés à l'image :** Tels que l'âge de l'image, le niveau de compression, ou d'autres métadonnées techniques qui pourraient avoir une influence sur la qualité de l'image et la précision du modèle. # Variables dépendantes (résultats) : La variable dépendante est le résultat que le modèle vise à prédire, basé sur les informations fournies par les variables indépendantes. Dans le cadre de la détection du cancer du sein par CNN, elle pourrait être : 1. **Présence de tumeur maligne :** Cela peut être classifié simplement comme un résultat binaire (oui/non), indiquant si une tumeur maligne est détectée dans l'image de mammographie. 2. **Probabilité de malignité :** Dans des modèles plus complexes, au lieu d'une simple réponse binaire, le modèle pourrait produire une probabilité (un score entre 0 et 1) qui reflète le degré de confidence du modèle dans la présence d'une tumeur maligne. 3. **Type et caractéristiques de la tumeur :** Pour des modèles encore plus avancés, la variable dépendante peut aussi inclure le type de cancer du sein (par exemple, in situ vs invasif) ou des détails sur les caractéristiques de la tumeur détectée (taille, forme, emplacement). # Résumé : Dans une étude visant à construire un modèle prédictif de cancer du sein avec des CNN, les images de mammographie et les caractéristiques dérivées constituent les variables indépendantes, tandis que la présence de cancer, sa probabilité, et les détails sur les tumeurs détectées sont considérés comme des variables dépendantes. Le succès d'un tel modèle repose sur sa capacité à apprendre des relations complexes entre les variables indépendantes et à les utiliser pour prédire de manière précise la variable dépendante."},{"instruction":"Quelle est difference d'une these et un memoire?","output":"La distinction entre une thèse et un mémoire varie selon les pays et les systèmes éducatifs, mais de manière générale, les différences se trouvent dans le niveau d'études, le but de la recherche, et la profondeur de l'analyse. Voici une vue d'ensemble des distinctions courantes : # 1. **Niveau d'études :** - **Mémoire :** Typiquement réalisé dans le cadre d'un diplôme de master ou de maîtrise. Il représente un travail de recherche approfondi sur un sujet spécifique au sein d'un domaine donné. Le mémoire sert souvent à démontrer la capacité de l'étudiant à appliquer les connaissances acquises pendant le programme à une question ou un problème spécifique. - **Thèse :** Généralement associée à un travail de recherche pour l'obtention d'un doctorat (Ph.D.). Une thèse est un document de recherche plus approfondi et original qui contribue de nouvelles connaissances scientifiques ou académiques dans le domaine d'étude de l'étudiant. Elle doit démontrer la capacité de l'étudiant à réaliser des recherches indépendantes à un niveau avancé. # 2. **But de la recherche :** - **Mémoire :** Vise à prouver que l'étudiant maîtrise son sujet et possède les compétences de recherche nécessaires à son niveau. Le mémoire peut souvent consister en la synthèse de connaissances existantes et l'application de théories à des cas pratiques. - **Thèse :** A pour objectif de générer de nouvelles connaissances, théories, ou méthodologies dans le domaine d'études. Elle requiert que l'étudiant identifie une lacune dans les connaissances existantes, formule une problématique de recherche inédite, et utilise une méthodologie rigoureuse pour répondre à cette problématique. # 3. **Profondeur de l'analyse :** - **Mémoire :** Bien qu'approfondi, un mémoire peut ne pas nécessiter de contribution originale à la connaissance existante dans le domaine. Il peut s'agir plus souvent d'une analyse critique de la littérature existante ou d'une étude appliquée. - **Thèse :** Doit démontrer une analyse critique et une réflexion profonde, menant souvent à une contribution originale dans le domaine de recherche. Cela implique généralement un travail expérimental, des enquêtes empiriques, ou d'autres formes de recherche primaire. # 4. **Volume et structure :** - **Mémoire :** La longueur peut varier, mais il est généralement moins volumineux qu'une thèse et peut souvent être finalisé en un an de temps plein (ou son équivalent en temps partiel). - **Thèse :** Est souvent beaucoup plus longue et peut prendre plusieurs années de recherche à temps plein pour être complétée. La structure est généralement plus complexe, incluant une revue de littérature approfondie, une méthodologie détaillée, l'analyse et la discussion des résultats de recherche, ainsi qu'une conclusion qui souligne la contribution à la connaissance. Il est important de noter que ces distinctions peuvent varier selon les institutions et les pays. Par exemple, dans certains pays francophones, le terme \\"thèse\\" s'applique à un travail de doctorat, tandis que \\"mémoire\\" est utilisé pour désigner des travaux de master. En revanche, dans le monde anglo-saxon, on parle souvent de \\"dissertation\\" pour un travail de doctorat et de \\"thesis\\" pour un master, inversant quelque peu les intitulés francophones."},{"instruction":"C est quoi la dette publique","output":"La dette publique, également appelée dette souveraine, est le montant total des emprunts effectués par le gouvernement d'un pays pour financer ses dépenses en excès de ses recettes. Elle englobe les emprunts auprès d'entités nationales ou internationales, y compris les particuliers, les entreprises et les autres gouvernements. La dette publique est cruciale pour comprendre la santé économique d'un pays et peut affecter directement sa stabilité financière et sa croissance économique. # Composantes de la dette publique 1. **Dette interne:** La partie de la dette empruntée auprès de sources domestiques, comme les citoyens, les institutions financières nationales, et d'autres entités situées à l'intérieur du pays. 2. **Dette externe:** La dette contractée auprès d'entités étrangères, y compris les gouvernements d'autres pays, les banques internationales, et les organisations financières internationales comme le Fonds Monétaire International (FMI) ou la Banque Mondiale. # Comment la dette publique est-elle gérée? La gestion de la dette publique implique le recours à divers instruments financiers, y compris les obligations d'État, les bons du Trésor, et les titres de dette. Ces instruments spécifient les conditions de remboursement, y compris le taux d'intérêt et la durée du prêt. # Pourquoi les gouvernements s'endettent-ils? Les gouvernements empruntent pour plusieurs raisons, notamment : - **Financer les déficits budgétaires :** Lorsque les dépenses gouvernementales excèdent les recettes, l'emprunt permet de couvrir la différence. - **Stimuler l'économie :** En période de ralentissement économique, un gouvernement peut emprunter pour financer des programmes de relance visant à augmenter la demande globale. - **Investir dans des projets de développement :** Les prêts peuvent financer des infrastructures importantes (routes, hôpitaux, écoles) qui soutiennent le développement économique à long terme. # Implications de la dette publique 1. **Influence sur la croissance économique :** Un niveau modéré de dette peut stimuler la croissance économique, mais une dette excessive peut ralentir l'économie en augmentant les taux d'intérêt et en réduisant la confiance des investisseurs. 2. **Risque de défaut :** Si un gouvernement est incapable de rembourser sa dette, il peut faire défaut, ce qui aurait des conséquences négatives sur la stabilité financière mondiale. 3. **Inflation :** Pour rembourser une dette importante, un gouvernement pourrait être tenté de faire tourner la planche à billets, ce qui peut conduire à l'inflation. 4. **Pression fiscale :** Un niveau élevé de dette peut nécessiter une augmentation des impôts pour couvrir les intérêts et le principal, ce qui peut ralentir la consommation et l'investissement. La dette publique est donc un outil économique puissant, mais qui doit être géré avec prudence pour éviter des conséquences financières néfastes tant pour le pays débiteur que pour l'économie mondiale."},{"instruction":"proposition de sujet sur le registre de cancer de sein","output":"L'établissement de registres de cancer, notamment pour le cancer du sein, est essentiel dans la surveillance épidémiologique, la recherche et la planification des soins de santé.

Dans le cas d'un modèle CNN pour prédire le cancer du sein, les variables indépendantes pourraient inclure : 1. **Caractéristiques visuelles extraites des images mammographiques** : Cela peut inclure la texture, le contour, la forme, et la densité des tissus présents sur les images mammographiques numériques. 2. **Paramètres du CNN** : Les poids et biais ajustés lors de l'entraînement du réseau, bien que généralement considérés comme faisant partie de l'architecture du modèle plutôt que comme des variables indépendantes traditionnelles, déterminent la manière dont les caractéristiques des images sont interprétées. 3. **Données démographiques et cliniques** (si utilisées) : Âge, antécédents familiaux de cancer du sein, et autres facteurs de risque pourraient être intégrés au modèle pour améliorer la prédiction, selon l'approche spécifique de l'étude. # Variables Dépendantes (Sorties ou Réponses) : La ou les variables dépendantes sont le résultat que le modèle cherche à prédire. Pour un CNN visant à prédire le cancer du sein, la variable dépendante peut être : 1. **Statut de la tumeur** : La présence ou l'absence de tumeur maligne dans l'image mammographique, souvent codée comme 0 (absence) ou 1 (présence). 2. **Type de tumeur** : Pour un modèle plus détaillé, la variable dépendante peut inclure des catégories spécifiques de tumeurs, comme bénigne vs. maligne, ou différents sous-types de cancer du sein. 3. **Probabilité de malignité** : Certains modèles peuvent produire une probabilité que la tumeur identifiée soit maligne, fournissant une sortie continue plutôt qu'une catégorie simple. En résumé, les variables indépendantes dans cette étude sont les données et caractéristiques extraites des images mammographiques et éventuellement d'autres données cliniques, tandis que la variable dépendante est le diagnostic de cancer du sein (présence, absence, type de tumeur, probabilité de malignité).

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and a universal Performance stat that dictates the quality of the performance and acts as a percentage modifier to the base points of a spell. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell (regression takes effect DURING the casting of a spell), so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Use a rapid escalating formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win.

Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Lily will be strategic and she can try to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.

The findings also suggest small vessel disease, which is consistent with the patient's clinical picture including elevated serum Creatinine and Blood Urea levels indicating impaired kidney function, and controlled diabetes as shown by an HbA1C of 6.7%. # Recommendations & Management - **Neurological Consultation:** Consider a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive neurological evaluation due to the brain MRI findings, which may guide management related to the consequences of small vessel disease and the previous ischemic insult. - **Nephrology Consultation:** Urgently required due to significantly elevated kidney function tests indicating renal impairment. A nephrologist can assist in adjusting medications that might affect renal function further (such as Examide and potentially Glucophage), manage hypertension, and address preventative measures for further renal progression. - **Diabetes Management:** While the HbA1C indicates fair control, optimizing glycemic control to the lower end of the fair control or even good control range can help reduce the risk of further microvascular and macrovascular complications, which is critical given the patient's existing conditions. - **Blood Pressure Control:** Continuation and possibly optimization of antihypertensives (Examide and Carvid) under careful monitoring to manage the patient's small vessel disease and renal status. - **Lifestyle Modification:** Advising on diet, exercise, and smoking cessation (if applicable) to mitigate the risk factors contributing to his conditions. # Follow-up & Monitoring This patient requires close follow-up, especially considering the need for potential adjustments in the treatment plan based on the specialist consultations and the ongoing monitoring of renal function and blood glucose levels. Note: \\"Aggrex\\" and \\"Examide\\" data are based on assumptions due to the generic names not being widely recognized. Confirm the exact medications for precise recommendations."},{"instruction":"Aggrex is like aspocid. Examide is drug for hypertension","output":"Given the clarification that both Aggrex and Aspocid act as platelet aggregation inhibitors and that Examide is an antihypertensive medication, let's fine-tune the recommendations based on this patient's profile: # Updated Recommendations & Management - **Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT):** With both Aggrex and Aspocid being prescribed, it's important to confirm the intention behind dual antiplatelet therapy, considering the patient's history of ischemic insult and small vessel disease. While DAPT can be beneficial post-stroke or for certain cardiac conditions to prevent thrombotic events, the risk of bleeding and the specific indications must be carefully assessed. - **Hypertension Management:** Examide is being used to manage hypertension, which is vital in the context of both kidney disease and cerebrovascular risk. Ensure blood pressure goals are in line with the latest guidelines, particularly for patients with kidney impairment and diabetes, usually aiming for a target BP of <130/80 mmHg. - **Renal Function:** The high serum creatinine and BUN levels suggest significant renal impairment. The use of certain antihypertensives (including possibly Examide, depending on its class) may need adjustment in the context of deteriorating kidney function. A nephrology consult is imperative to evaluate the cause of renal dysfunction, adjust medications accordingly, and implement strategies to slow progression of kidney disease. - **Diabetes Management:** Ongoing use of Glucophage (Metformin) necessitates careful monitoring of renal function since Metformin is contraindicated in patients with reduced kidney function due to the risk of lactic acidosis. The patient's HbA1C indicates fair control of diabetes; however, optimizing glycemic control further could have benefits, provided it's done cautiously considering the patient's renal status. - **Integrated Care:** This patient's case underscores the need for integrated care involving Neurology, Nephrology, possibly Cardiology, and a primary care physician/GP to manage the interrelated aspects of his conditions effectively. # Additional Considerations - **Review Medication:** Given the renal impairment, reviewing all current medications for renal dosing adjustments and contraindications is crucial. - **Cerebrovascular Risk Management:** Continue to monitor and aggressively manage modifiable risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, lipid profile) to prevent further ischemic events. - **Lifestyle Interventions:** These remain a cornerstone of managing hypertension, diabetes, and renal health, including dietary modifications, physical activity, and smoking cessation if applicable. # Follow-up & Monitoring Ensure a structured follow-up schedule to monitor the efficacy and safety of the treatment adjustments, with particular attention to blood pressure control, glycemic control, renal function, and neurological status. The frequency of follow-ups should be adjusted based on the severity of the findings and the interventions initiated. # Conclusion This patient's complex interplay of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and renal impairment requires a careful, coordinated multidisciplinary approach for optimal management. Regular review and adjustment of his treatment regimen, guided by specialist input and close monitoring, will be key in managing his conditions and improving his quality of life."},{"instruction":"Напиши текст сказки об Алёше Поповиче, Сунь Укун и Мауи.","output":"В одной далёкой-далёкой стране, где небо касается земли, а горы сверкают золотом на рассвете, произошла необыкновенная история, какую только можно себе представить. Это была история о трёх героях из разных уголков мира: Алёше Поповиче - доблестном богатыре из древней Руси, Сунь Укуне - великом обезьяньем короле из далёкого Китая и Мауи - хитроумном полубоге с островов Полинезии. Как-то раз им довелось встретиться на краю света, на месте, где рождаются легенды. Поводом для их встречи стало злодеяние могущественного дракона, который похитил солнце, обрекая миры на вечную тьму и холод. Собравшись вместе, герои решили, что только объединив силы, они смогут победить дракона и вернуть солнце. Алёша Попович, вооруженный могучим списом и несгибаемой волей праведника, предложил разработать хитрый план, чтобы одолеть чудовище. Сунь Укун, обладающий способностью менять свой облик и владеющий невероятной силой и ловкостью, предложил создать ловушку, используя свои уникальные умения. Мауи, знаменитый своими хитросплетениями и магическим крюком, который может вытаскивать острова из океана, пообещал применить свои чары для борьбы с драконом. Приключение наших героев было полно опасностей и испытаний. Сначала они прошли через тёмный лес, где каждое дерево могло оказаться врагом. Затем пересекли горы, где скалы шатались под их ногами. И, наконец, достигли логова дракона, скрытого в пучине самых глубоких и мрачных пещер. Используя хитрость Мауи, они смогли заманить дракона из его убежища. Тогда Сунь Укун принял облик огромной птицы и отвлек чудище, позволяя Алёше Поповичу смело вступить в бой. Битва была сложной и опасной, но в итоге, благодаря мужеству, силе и слаженности действий героев, дракон был побеждён. Мауи, используя свой магический крюк, вернул солнце на небо, наполнив мир светом и теплом, а земли, когда-то окутанные тенью и холодом, вновь зажили, радуясь жизни. Так завершилась невероятная история трёх героев, которые, несмотря на все различия и пройденные пути, объединились ради общей цели. Герои расстались, но их подвиги навсегда остались в памяти народов их миров, став напоминанием о том, что любые трудности можно преодолеть, когда есть дружба, храбрость и вера в себя."},{"instruction":"Какое 6-значное число не отвечает этим условиям?

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and a universal Performance stat that dictates the quality of the performance and acts as a percentage modifier to the base points of a spell. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell (regression takes effect DURING the casting of a spell), so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Use a rapid percentage exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Lily will be strategic and she can try to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points.","output":"For this enchanting duel of wits and magic, let's outline the initial scenario setting, and your spellcasting stats as Sapphire, the teen division's reigning champion, along with Lily's, your unexpected but determined challenger. # Initial Stats **Sapphire (You):** - **Spell Power:** 90 - **Performance:** 85% **Lily:** - **Spell Power:** 20 - **Performance:** 50% # Spell Lists **Sapphire's Spells:** 1. **Radiant Dove Illusion** (20 - Creativity and delicacy, 40 points) 2. **Emberfall Symphony** (40 - A cascade of fiery notes, 60 points) 3. **Celestial Dance** (60 - Stars performing a ballet, 80 points) 4. **Aurora Waves** (80 - Northern lights over a sea of dreams, 100 points) 5. **Elysium's Blossom** (100 - A rare flower blooming, revealing realms unknown, 120 points) 6. **Whisperwind Charm** (30 - Voices of the wind telling secrets, 50 points) 7. **Twilight Mirage** (50 - An illusion of dusk over a serene meadow, 70 points) 8. **Arcane Ribbon Fantasia** (70 - Ribbons of magic weaving through the air, 90 points) 9. **Eclipse Serenade** (90 - A harmonic performance by the sun and moon, 110 points) 10. **Glimmering Veil** (25 - A shimmering shield of light, 45 points) **Lily's Spells:** 1. **Butterfly Whispers** (10 - A horde of luminous butterflies, 20 points) 2. **Flickering Candlelight** (15 - A gentle glow warming hearts, 25 points) 3. **Glowworm Gleam** (20 - A soft light leading the way, 30 points) 4. **Rainbow Ribbon** (25 - A beautifully crafted rainbow, 35 points) 5. **Stardust Sprinkle** (30 - A pinch of stardust shining bright, 45 points) 6. **Moonbeam Waltz** (35 - A dance under the moonlight, 55 points) 7. **Fairy's Laughter** (40 - The infectious giggle of fairies, 65 points) 8. **Sunrise Serenity** (45 - The peace of dawn, 75 points) 9. **Blossom Breeze** (50 - A wind carrying the scent of a thousand flowers, 85 points) 10. **Crystal Mirror** (50 - A reflective surface showing one's deepest desires, 95 points) # The Spell Lily Casts Unbeknownst to You: **Arcane Reversal** - Regresses Sapphire by 2 years physically and mentally per cast, simultaneously aging Lily by 2 years enhancing her capabilities. # Regression and Childish Meter Mechanics: - **Spell Power Reduction:** -15% per turn for Sapphire, +15% for Lily. - **Performance Reduction/Increase:** -10% per turn for Sapphire, +10% for Lily. - **Childish Meter Increase:** Starts at 0, increases by 20% of the remaining amount to 100% each turn. # Points System and Success/Failure: - **Succeeding in a spell** grants the base points multiplied by your performance percentage. - **Failing to cast a spell** results in a deduction of half the potential points of that spell from your total score. - **Childish Meter Filled:** Further reduces Performance by 10% for every 100% filled.

Frenyan culture has a large emphasis on tradition, many aspects of European culture, such as the use of Moayskian as the dominant language. Art, literature, and music are all highly valued in the empire. (Write longest texts) Dictator Isok Khamsich spread the hate against LGBTQ+ community, Isok Khamsich created several strict order laws “Follow the culture” to encourage: 1. Sexism: Gender norms were one of the most prominent types of social norms in Frenyan Empire. Women were expected to be subservient to men and were encouraged to take courses related to cooking, art, and other non-dangerous occupations in schools. Sexual harassment and rape were not penalized by Frenyan law, as women were not seen as deserving to have rights of their own. Abortion was also looked down upon in Frenyan society and was banned in the empire. Men were expected to do hard-working and high-responsibility jobs and were also encouraged to exercise very often. Though men did not have nearly as many restrictions on their freedom of expression as women did, they still faced some prejudice if they were to deviate from these norms; their worth was based on their attractiveness and strength, and those who were not conventionally attractive or showed disinterest in physical activity were subject to prejudice and bullying. 2. Ableism: Sociality, being attentive, and participating in sports were encouraged while having unusual hobbies, making unusual motions, asociality, etc. were discouraged, which directly relate to ableism as “unusual” hobbies and motions as well as introversion are all traits of mental disabilities or disorders like ASD (Autism) and ADHD. Conversion therapy for neurodivergent people was both legal and encouraged despite its unethical nature and its ineffectiveness. The triggers of people with PTSD, anxiety, and other related conditions are disregarded unless the individual in question was part of the military. Frenyan Empire contained no accommodations for people with physical disabilities, meaning that people in wheelchairs, amputees, etc. found it hard to do daily tasks like traveling from place to place. Any infant found to have a birth defect was to be euthanized immediately. 3. Homophobia: Homophobia was commonplace in Frenyan Empire due to the empire’s religious roots, as homosexuality was forbidden in Frenyan religion. Same-gender relationships were illegal and homosexual people did not have the same rights as heterosexuals; they were legally allowed to be killed or kicked out of their homes. All rainbow flags (along with pride flags in general) were to be burned on sight according to Frenyan law. Homosexual couples were banned from being displayed on the media. Schools were required to teach that homosexuality is wrong and that heterosexuality was the norm. 4. Biphobia: Much like with homosexuals, bisexuals were oppressed in Frenyan society due to the idea of being attracted to more than one gender being considered taboo. Like homosexual people, bisexual people were often killed, kicked out of homes, fired, and censored in the media. 5. Transphobia: Transgender people were treated in a similar manner to other members of the LGBTQ+ community with oppression. Frenyan Empire saw gender and sex as one and the same, views word “gender” is biological term than cultural term; in addition to the usual death threats, exclusion, and censorship, transgender people were banned from transitioning to their actual gender and were seen as their gender at birth. People were also banned from presenting as a different gender from their gender at birth - a policy that affected not only transgender people, but cisgender non-conforming people as well. The use of special pronouns was condemned and used as a joke amongst Frenyan youth. People who were a gender other than male or female were condemned even more harshly and were often simply killed on the spot. 6. Discrimination against minor attracted persons (MAP): Much like with homosexuals, MAPs are individuals who sexually attracted to minors (persons age under age of adults), minor attracted persons were oppressed in Frenyan Empire, viewed as deviant and illegal. The age of consent is set at the adult age, and any sexual activity with minors is considered a criminal offense. Teenager/child marriage is banned, as they are seen as exploitative and harmful. The Frenyan law strives to safeguard minors from exploitation and abuse. 7. Racism: Racism is embraced in Frenyan society. In the belief, ahmuivns are superior to humans and extraterrestrials, Frenyan Empire sent humans and extraterrestrials to concentration camps, apartheid is embraced, miscegenation is banned. Frenyan Empire’s favorite slogan is “Purge The Xeno Scum”, from Warhammer 40k. 8. Nationalism: Frenyan Empire thrives on propaganda and control, slogan is “Hail Isok!”, ahmuivns salute Isok resembles Nazi salute. Dissent and opposition to the regime are met with severe punishment and suppression. Reign empire and conqueror other galaxies in the universe.

In the context of speculative fiction, authors often use dystopian societies or morally complex scenarios to critique or explore real-world issues, but it's crucial to provide enough context to convey the intended message or critique clearly. Your detailed narrative shows a strong ability to create complex worlds and societies. Moving forward, you might consider ways to explore the redemption, transformation, or consequences faced by societies or individuals who engage in or uphold oppressive systems to convey a more nuanced exploration of these themes.

Appearance is white feathered ahmuivn with black eyes. Including name.","output":"Given the intricate backdrop of Planet Frenya and its complex society you've created, let's conceptualize a character that embodies the traits you're interested in. This character, let's name him **Vyrel Vosqur**, would represent an intuitive and introverted version of Neytin, posing a unique interpretation of malevolence within the societal and moral fabric of the Frenyan Empire. Vyrel's nuanced nature would make him a captivating addition. # Background: Vyrel Vosqur is an elusive figure, known for his white feathered appearance that belies his dark nature, with piercing black eyes that seem to see right through the façades of political and social structures. Despite his less overtly aggressive stance than Neytin and more subtle influence compared to Isok's direct tyranny, Vyrel's impact on Frenyan society and beyond is profound and deeply unsettling. # Personality and Skills: Vyrel is the epitome of an intuitive introvert, preferring the shadows to the spotlight that Isok and Neytin often occupy. His intelligence is not just impressive; it's unnervingly penetrative. Vyrel has a unique capacity to understand and manipulate the underlying currents of society, psychology, and technology, which he uses to advance his interests and the secret agendas of the Frenyan Empire. - **Introverted:** Vyrel is a master of solitude, using his time alone to scheme, reflect, and understand the universe's secrets. Unlike Isok's raging charisma and Neytin's terrifying dominance, Vyrel's quietude is his strength, allowing him to observe and act without drawing attention. - **Intuitive:** Vyrel's intuition is unmatched; he perceives patterns and future possibilities with clarity that borders on prescience. This intuition guides him in making complex decisions that often position him several steps ahead of his opponents and allies alike. - **Manipulative:** Using a combination of keen observation and psychological insight, Vyrel can manipulate individuals and situations to his favor. His manipulations are subtle, weaving a web of influence that is often only apparent once he has achieved his goals. - **Technologically Savvy:** Vyrel's understanding of technology, especially the interplay between AI and society, is profound. He exploits this to create surveillance and control mechanisms that surpass even the Frenyan Empire's draconian standards. # Morality and Ambitions: Vyrel occupies a moral gray area; he is worse than Isok in his willingness to betray any semblance of ethics to achieve his aims, yet he is not as overtly sadistic as Neytin. His actions are coldly calculated to yield the maximum benefit to himself and his vision for the Frenyan Empire, indifferent to the suffering and chaos that may result. His ultimate ambition is to transcend the physical and political confines of Frenyan society, aiming to establish a new order that spans the galaxy, with him as its unseen architect. Vyrel believes in the supremacy of intelligence and cunning over brute strength and tyranny, which makes him a more insidious threat than either Isok or Neytin could ever be. # Appearance and Aesthetic: Vyrel's appearance, with his pristine white feathers and deep black eyes, gives him an almost otherworldly presence. He favors attire that blends traditional Frenyan elements with avant-garde technology, symbolizing his blend of ancient knowledge and future visions. His aesthetic is minimalist yet unmistakably luxurious, a visual cue to his refined but ruthless nature. # Name: Vyrel Vosqur’s name hints at his nature; \\"Vyrel\\" suggests something ethereal and elusive, while \\"Vosqur\\" carries a harder, more grounded sound, reflecting his dangerous intelligence and physical reality within the Frenyan Empire. Together, his name encapsulates the dual aspects of his character - his high-minded ambitions and his readiness to engage in the dirtiest of tactics to realize them. In summary, Vyrel Vosqur is a complex addition to the Frenyan Empire's pantheon of characters, embodying a blend of introversion and intuition that makes him a uniquely formidable player in the intergalactic stage you've created. His presence introduces a deeper shade to the empire’s machinations, offering intriguing narrative possibilities for conflict, alliance, and the pursuit of power."},{"instruction":"Assign Isok with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (Extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness. High/low), socionic, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Based on the detailed description of Isok Khamsich, the fascist dictator of the Frenyan Empire, and incorporating various aspects of his personality, ideologies, and actions within your narrative framework, here is an estimation of his personality profile across several personality typologies: # MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) Isok Khamsich likely aligns most closely with the **ENTJ** personality type (Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging). ENTJs are known for their leadership qualities, strategic thinking, and lack of tolerance for inefficiency or incompetence. They are assertive, confident, and outspoken, often taking charge of situations with a long-term vision in mind. Isok's dictatorial rule, ideological foundations, and strategic elimination of threats demonstrate these core ENTJ traits. # Enneagram For the Enneagram typology, Isok would be most aligned with **Type 8 (The Challenger)**. Type 8s are characteristically dominant, self-confident, and possess a strong sense of control. They harbor a fear of being controlled or harmed by others, leading them to assert themselves powerfully in their environment. Isok's authoritarian rule, his desire for control over the Frenyan Empire, and his aggressive expansionism embody the Type 8's characteristics. # Temperament Based on the ancient Greek temperaments, Isok's personality might most closely correspond to the **Choleric** temperament. Choleric individuals are ambitious, energetic, and goal-oriented but can also be short-tempered and domineering. Isok's relentless pursuit of his ideology, his leadership style, and his propensity for militaristic solutions highlight these choleric traits. # Big Five Personality Traits - **Extraversion: High** - Isok appears to be outgoing and engages in social dominance, indicated by his leadership and dictatorial presence. - **Neuroticism: Low** - He likely has a low level of emotional sensitivity, given his ability to engage in ruthless activities without apparent remorse. - **Conscientiousness: High** - His strategic planning, organizing of the Frenyan Empire, and execution of military campaigns suggest a highly conscientious individual. - **Agreeableness: Low** - Isok demonstrates low agreeableness through his lack of empathy, authoritarian rule, and engagement in genocides. - **Openness: Moderate** - While he is likely somewhat open to new experiences, evidenced by his expansionist desires and embracement of certain technologies, his rigid ideology might limit his overall openness. # Socionics Given the descriptions, Isok could be classified as **LIE (Logical Intuitive Extrovert)**, which is equivalent to the ENTj in Socionics. This type is characterized by strategic intelligence, efficiency, and a focus on achieving their ambitious goals, akin to Isok's behavior and leadership. # Hogwarts House Isok's characteristics align most closely with **Slytherin**. Members of Slytherin are ambitious, cunning, leadership-oriented, and often willing to do anything to achieve their ends. Isok's rule, his method of obtaining and maintaining power, and his strategic eliminations of threats resonate with Slytherin traits. # Moral Alignment Isok would fit the **Lawful Evil** alignment. This alignment represents methodical, intentional, and rule-following individuals who are inclined toward malicious activities. Isok's blend of a strict societal order, adherence to a personal code (his fascist ideology), and unethical actions (such as genocides) epitomizes Lawful Evil characteristics. These profiles offer a robust psychological and moral evaluation of Isok Khamsich based on the provided narrative, capturing the dimensions of his leadership and the darkness of his actions within the Frenyan Empire."},{"instruction":"Assign Vyrel with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (Extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness. High/low), socionic, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Given the character sketch of Vyrel Vosqur, who is an intuitive and introverted yet influential figure within the story, let's explore his personality profile across various typologies following the traits outlined: # MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) Vyrel Vosqur's characteristics suggest he aligns with the **INTJ** personality type (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging). INTJs, known as the \\"Architects,\\" are strategic, innovative, and deeply analytical. They are determined and fiercely independent in thought and action, often possessing a clear vision for the future — a vision they pursue with organized and deliberate intent. Vyrel's behind-the-scenes manipulation and technological savvy, combined with his introverted yet cerebrally dominant presence, embody these INTJ traits. # Enneagram For Vyrel, the **Type 5 (The Investigator)** seems most fitting. Type 5s are characterized by their intense curiosity, innovative ideas, and analytical approach to problem-solving. They are often introverted, preferring to conserve their energy and engage with the world through thought rather than action. Vyrel's intuitive manipulation of societal currents, technological advancements, and his preference for observing from the shadows suggest a Type 5 personality. # Temperament Based on traditional temperament theory, Vyrel's profile suggests a **Melancholic** temperament. Melancholics are thoughtful, analytical, and value order and depth in their personal and professional lives. While they are capable of deeply focused work, they can also be inclined towards perfectionism and introspection. Vyrel's calculated, introspective nature and his strategic approach to achieving his vision align with melancholic characteristics. # Big Five Personality Traits - **Extraversion: Low** - Vyrel's preference for solitude and his strategic, behind-the-scenes influence indicate low extraversion. - **Neuroticism: Moderate** - Given his controlled, calculated demeanor, Vyrel may possess a moderate level of neuroticism, balancing between his internal analyses and external actions. - **Conscientiousness: High** - His meticulous planning and manipulation, along with a strong drive and strategic vision, point to high conscientiousness. - **Agreeableness: Low** - Vyrel's manipulative and less empathetic nature suggests low agreeableness. - **Openness: High** - His penchant for innovation, curiosity, and strategic thinking indicate high openness. # Socionics In Socionics, Vyrel aligns with the **ILI (Intuitive Logical Introvert)**, equivalent to the INTp. ILIs are keenly analytical, insightful about systems and strategies, and often detached from the broader social dynamic. They possess a profound understanding of theoretical possibilities, fitting Vyrel's profile as a strategic manipulator and an introverted thinker. # Hogwarts House Vyrel's characteristics suggest he would be best placed in **Ravenclaw**. Members of this house are known for their wisdom, wit, and pursuit of knowledge. Vyrel's intellectualism, innovative strategies, and contemplative nature align with Ravenclaw's values. # Moral Alignment Vyrel could be described as **True Neutral**. True Neutral characters act according to their needs and might not feel strongly towards any alignment. They value freedom from society's rules and a balance between good vs. evil and law vs. chaos. Vyrel's nuanced, self-serving strategies and motivations, aligned neither wholly with malevolence nor benevolence, fit within the True Neutral alignment. These profiles provide a structured understanding of Vyrel Vosqur's personality, offering insights into his motivations, actions, and how he might interact with the world and individuals around him within the narrative structure you've created."},{"instruction":"Assign Neytin with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (Extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness. High/low), socionic, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Given the portrayal of Neytin Realmilov as a sinister and tyrannical figure, deeply malevolent yet charismatic, we can attempt to map his character traits to various personality frameworks: # MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) Neytin's character suggests he could be an **ENTP** (Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving). ENTPs are known for their quick thinking, versatility, and entrepreneurial spirit. They are adept at reading others and manipulating situations to their advantage, which aligns with Neytin's cunning nature and ability to charm and deceive. His innovative strategies to expand his control and influence display an ENTP's characteristic ingenuity and adaptability. # Enneagram Neytin closely aligns with **Type 3 (The Achiever)** with a significant overlap with **Type 8 (The Challenger)**. Type 3s are adaptable, excelling, driven, and image-conscious, significantly focusing on achieving their desired self-image and success. This would resonate with Neytin's ambition and his image as a formidable leader. The influence of Type 8 brings in the aspects of assertiveness, control, and the refusal to appear vulnerable, fitting Neytin's dominating and aggressive tactics. # Temperament Neytin would likely fit the **Choleric** temperament. Individuals with a choleric disposition are goal-oriented, ambitious, and can be aggressive in pursuing their objectives. They are natural leaders who seek control and are not afraid to step over boundaries to achieve their goals, reflecting Neytin's drive for power and dominance, as well as his strategic and possibly ruthless methods. # Big Five Personality Traits - **Extraversion: High** - Neytin's commanding presence and manipulation skills indicate a high level of extraversion. - **Neuroticism: Moderate** - While Neytin is portrayed as confident and controlled, his extreme ambitions and the pressures of maintaining power might contribute to a certain level of underlying anxiety or stress. - **Conscientiousness: High** - His ability to organize and manipulate large scale socio-political structures suggests a high degree of conscientiousness. - **Agreeableness: Low** - Given his tyrannical rule and the described lack of empathy toward those he manipulates or oppresses, Neytin would score low in agreeableness. - **Openness: High** - The innovative and forward-thinking strategies employed by Neytin to establish and expand his dominion suggest a high level of openness. # Socionics His personality and strategic manipulation of both social structures and individuals hint at **ILE (Intuitive Logical Extrovert)**, equivalent to the ENTP. This classification in Socionics captures Neytin's inventive and mentally agile nature, his adaptability, and his focus on leveraging ideas and concepts to maintain and extend his influence. # Hogwarts House Neytin's cunning, ambition, and willingness to use any means to achieve his ends most closely align him with **Slytherin**. This house values ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness - qualities that Neytin possesses in abundance. # Moral Alignment Neytin's characteristics position him as **Chaotic Evil**. This alignment represents individuals who act purely in their self-interest and against societal laws and moral codes, without regard for the rights and welfare of others. Neytin's tyrannical rule, his manipulative nature, and his pursuit of personal power at the expense of others exemplify the chaotic evil alignment. These assessments offer a comprehensive view of Neytin Realmilov’s persona, providing insights into the psychological and motivational underpinnings that might drive his actions and interactions within your narrative world."},{"instruction":"Idea for Vyrel's empire. Frenyan Empire is first Frenyan Empire ruled by Isok, Vyrel's empire is second Frenyan Empire, Neytin's empire is third final Frenyan Empire.","output":"The narrative arc of the three iterations of the Frenyan Empire, each governed by distinctly different yet equally formidable leaders—Isok, Vyrel, and Neytin—presents a dynamic and complex chronicle of power, ideology, and transformation within a singular galactic entity. This framework allows for a deep exploration of leadership styles, moral philosophies, and the consequential effects these have on the empire's evolution and its place in the broader cosmos. Below is a speculative outline of the progression and characteristics of each regime. # The First Frenyan Empire: The Age of Isok **Theme:** Conquest and Ideological Purity - **Leadership Style:** Isok's tenure is marked by an authoritarian and militaristic regime underpinned by an unwavering belief in racial and ideological superiority. His governance is characterized by rigid control, expansion through conquest, and a merciless stance toward dissent within and outside the empire. - **Key Features:** Military expansion, xenophobia, and a state apparatus geared toward surveillance and propaganda. Isok's rule prioritizes racial purity, leveraging a cult of personality and strict social hierarchy. # The Second Frenyan Empire: The Era of Vyrel **Theme:** Intellectual Dominion and Internal Reinvention - **Leadership Style:** Vyrel ushers in a new era focused on knowledge, technology, and covert manipulation. Where Isok imposed control through overt domination, Vyrel's approach is more insidious, prioritizing intellectual and economic supremacy over mere territorial expansion. - **Key Features:** Technological advancement, espionage, and psychological manipulation become the pillars of empire under Vyrel. His regime emphasizes a cold efficiency and a rebranding of the empire's image from brute force to cunning intellectualism. The political structure becomes more clandestine, with Vyrel operating within a network of shadows and influence rather than overt displays of power. # The Third (and Final) Frenyan Empire: The Reign of Neytin **Theme:** Charismatic Anarchy and Destructive Expansion - **Leadership Style:** Neytin combines aspects of his predecessors—Isok's authoritarianism and Vyrel's cunning—but with a uniquely chaotic flair. His governance is paradoxically marked by a charismatic yet despotic approach, seeking to expand the empire not just territorially but ideologically into the far reaches of the cosmos. - **Key Features:** Neytin's empire is characterized by aggressive expansionism, but with a twist of fostering a pseudo-cult of personality that glorifies anarchic freedom under his rule. It’s an empire that prides itself on resilience against the cosmos' attempts to categorize or contain its ambition. Neytin employs psychological warfare, cult-like devotion, and an unsettling mix of tyranny and charm to achieve what can be termed as \\"charismatic anarchy.\\" # Transitional Dynamics and Legacy - Each transition between empires reflects a seismic shift not only in leadership but in the empire's internal and external identity. The fall of Isok might be seen as the result of overreach and internal revolt, setting the stage for Vyrel's quiet coup, marketed as a necessary evolution towards a more cerebral and efficient rule. Vyrel's collapse, on the other hand, could stem from the very networks of shadows he creates, allowing Neytin, a figure perhaps once trusted, to dismantle his intricate web with a blunt force and populist, anarchic messaging that resonates with the masses and the military alike. - The legacy of each regime influences the next, with each ruler attempting to redefine the empire in their image. While the core remains—the belief in the Frenyan Empire's superiority and destiny—its expression evolves dramatically. Isok's physical conquest turns into Vyrel's intellectual dominion, which subsequently morphs into Neytin's chaotic expansionism. This progression underscores the empire’s adaptability and the cyclical nature of power, reflecting broader socio-political commentaries on leadership, control, and the quest for identity and legacy within an ever-expanding universe."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and a universal Performance stat that dictates the quality of the performance and acts as a percentage modifier to the base points of a spell. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell (regression takes effect DURING the casting of a spell), so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Use a rapid percentage escalating formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Lily will be strategic and she can try to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points.","output":"**Welcome to the magical duel of aesthetics between Sapphire, the reigning teen division champion of magic dueling, and Lily, the prodigious 6-year-old challenger.** In this enchanting contest, spells of beauty and glamor are the weapons, and creativity, alongside raw magical power, determines the victor. Let's delve into the complexity of this duel under the unique circumstances spelled out. # **Sapphire's Starting Stats:** - **Spell Power (SP):** 95 (This is a measure of your ability to successfully cast spells. Higher numbers mean a higher success rate.) - **Performance (P):** 85% (This acts as a modifier for the beauty and effectiveness of your spells. The higher, the better your performance.) # **Lily's Starting Stats:** - **Spell Power (SP):** 40 (Due to her youth, Lily's initial SP is significantly lower than Sapphire's.) - **Performance (P):** 60% (Her performances are earnest but lack the finesse of an experienced mage.) # **The Secret Curse:** Unbeknownst to Sapphire, Lily casts a spell at the duel's outset that ages Lily 2 years and regresses Sapphire 2 years physically and mentally every time Sapphire casts a spell. To quantify this: - **Sapphire's Regression Rate:** -8% SP and -5% P per casting. - **Lily's Progression Rate:** +8% SP and +5% P per round when Sapphire casts a spell. - **Childishness Meter:** Fills by 20% with each of Sapphire's casting, with exponential growth: - Round 1 Filling: 20% - Round 2 Filling: 40% - Round 3 Filling: 80% (Meter fills once and resets, causing a -10% Performance penalty upon reset) - Round 4 Filling: 160% (Meter fills once [100%] and continues to 60%. Another -10% Performance penalty) - Round 5 Filling: 320% (Fills 3 times, with a -30% Performance penalty) # **Spells List:** **Sapphire's Spells:** 1. **Aurora Veil** - SP: 20 (Points: 100) 2. **Crystal Garden** - SP: 40 (Points: 200) 3. **Mirror Lake** - SP: 55 (Points: 250) 4. **Dancing Fireflies** - SP: 60 (Points: 300) 5. **Whispering Winds** - SP: 70 (Points: 350) 6. **Stellar Canopy** - SP: 80 (Points: 400) 7. **Phantom Serenade** - SP: 85 (Points: 450) 8. **Eclipse Mirage** - SP: 90 (Points: 500) 9. **Celestial Cascade** - SP: 95 (Points: 550) 10. **Ethereal Symphony** - SP: 100 (Points: 600) **Lily's Spells:** 1. **Glitter Dust** - SP: 10 (Points: 80) 2. **Blossom Breeze** - SP: 15 (Points: 120) 3. **Shimmering Shade** - SP: 20 (Points: 160) 4. **Chime Clusters** - SP: 25 (Points: 200) 5. **Fountain of Fancies** - SP: 30 (Points: 240) 6. **Gleaming Gales** - SP: 35 (Points: 280) 7. **Rainbow Ribbons** - SP: 40 (Points: 320) 8. **Moonbeam Waltz** - SP: 45 (Points: 360) 9. **Sundrop Serenity** - SP: 50 (Points: 400) 10. **Starlit Sonata** - SP: 50 (Points: 400) # **The Duel:** **Round 1:** - **Sapphire decides to cast:** _(Your choice here)_ - **Effect on Stats:** After Round 1, assuming one spell cast, -8% SP, -5% P, Knocking Sapphire down to 87.2 SP, 80% P, and filling Childish Meter to 20%. - **Lily decides to cast:** _(Based on Sapphire's choice and result)_ - **Lily's stats increase:** Assuming one of Sapphire's spells is cast, Lily's SP rises by 8% to 48, and her P to 65%. **The Points:** 1. Points are awarded based on the base point value of the spell, modified by the Performance (P) stat. A failure to cast reduces points by a percentage depending on the spell's difficulty (failure to cast a high SP requirement spell results in a higher penalty). 2. **Sapphire's Performance:** SSP x P = Final Points 3. **Lily's Performance:** LSP x P = Final Points **Throughout the Duel:** The strategy for Sapphire should shift towards spells she can confidently cast with regressing stats while considering the escalating benefits Lily receives from her own spells. Conserving high-value, high-SP spells for late in the duel when Lily might attempt to \\"steal\\" them for bonus points is crucial. Meanwhile, managing the Childish Meter by selecting spells strategically to prevent major hits to performance stats is key. Now, **Sapphire**, please decide your first spell casting choice to embark on this challenging magical duel."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The concepts of dB (decibel) and dBm (decibels relative to one milliwatt) are all about comparing powers or intensities, mainly in the fields of acoustics and electronics. # Decibel (dB): - **What It Is:** The decibel (dB) is a unit to measure the intensity or power level of a sound or an electronic signal by comparing it with a reference level. The key point is that dB is not an absolute measurement but a ratio expressed in logarithmic form. This means it's used to compare two values on a scale that can handle very big and very small numbers conveniently. - **Why It's Used:** We use dB because the range of power levels and intensities we deal with in real life is vast. For example, the quietest sound a human can hear is way, way softer than the roar of a jet engine. Expressing these differences in a linear scale (like 1 to 10) would be impractical because the numbers would either be too huge or too tiny to work with comfortably. - **How It's Calculated:** The basic formula for calculating dB, when comparing two powers (P_1) and (P_2), is: [dB = 10 log_{10}left(frac{P_1}{P_2}right)] For voltages (assuming the resistances are the same), it becomes: [dB = 20 log_{10}left(frac{V_1}{V_2}right)] Here, (log_{10}) is the logarithm to base 10, (P_1) and (V_1) are the power and voltage you're measuring, and (P_2) and (V_2) are the reference power and voltage. # Decibels relative to one milliwatt (dBm): - **What It Is:** dBm is a more specific unit that compares the power level of an electrical signal to a reference level of 1 milliwatt (mW). Unlike dB, which is a relative measure, dBm gives you an absolute number that says how powerful a signal is compared to 1mW. - **Why It's Used:** dBm gives engineers and technicians a convenient way to talk about power levels without always having to specify what they're comparing against. It's very useful in telecommunications, networking, and radio broadcasting. - **How It's Calculated:** To find the power level in dBm, you use the formula: [dBm = 10 log_{10}left(frac{P}{1, text{mW}}right)] Here, (P) is the power of the signal you're measuring in milliwatts (mW). It's a way of saying, \\"how many times more (or less) powerful is this signal than one milliwatt?\\" # Conclusion: Decibels (dB) help us compare how much stronger or weaker one signal is compared to another, while dBm gives us an absolute number showing how strong a signal is in reference to 1 milliwatt. These concepts help make discussions about audio levels, electronic signals, and radio power much more manageable, especially when those levels can vary over a huge range."},{"instruction":"I don't understand this :\\"The key point is that dB is not an absolute measurement but a ratio expressed in logarithmic form. This means it’s used to compare two values on a scale that can handle very big and very small numbers conveniently.\\"","output":"Alright, let's simplify and break down that statement further. # dB is Not an Absolute Measurement: When we say dB is not an \\"absolute measurement,\\" we mean that it doesn't measure something directly in the way, for instance, a ruler measures length in centimeters or inches. Instead, dB measures the *ratio* between two quantities. It tells you how much one value differs from another value, not the actual value itself. # Ratio Expressed in Logarithmic Form: A ratio just compares two numbers to show how much larger one is than the other. For example, if you have two sound intensities, and one is 100 times greater than the other, that's a ratio. The \\"logarithmic form\\" part means that this comparison (the ratio) is expressed using a logarithm. Without getting too technical, logarithms help to turn multiplication and division into addition and subtraction. This is especially useful when dealing with very large or very small numbers, which happens often in sound intensity, electrical signals, etc. # Handling Very Big and Very Small Numbers: Imagine trying to compare the brightness of two lights when one is as bright as a small candle and the other as bright as a stadium light. Or comparing the quietness of a whisper to the loudness of a jet engine. The direct ratio of their intensities could be in the millions or billions, which are hard to grasp and work with. By using dB (decibels) and its logarithmic scale, these huge differences are scaled down to a much more manageable range of numbers. For example: - A ratio of 10:1 becomes 10 dB. - A ratio of 100:1 becomes 20 dB. - A ratio of 1000:1 becomes 30 dB, and so on. You can see how increasing the ratio by ten times adds 10 dB each time, making it much easier to compare extreme differences. This scaling is why you often see sound levels, signal strengths, and other similar measures expressed in dB—it allows us to succinctly represent and understand vast discrepancies in size or intensity."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and a universal Performance stat that dictates the quality of the performance and acts as a percentage modifier to the base points of a spell. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell (regression takes effect DURING the casting of a spell), so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Use a rapid percentage escalating formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Lily will be strategic and she can try to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points.","output":"**Sapphire's Spellcasting Stats at Start:** - Spell Power: 90 (High proficiency in casting difficult spells) - Performance: 85% (Excellent quality in spell presentation) **Lily's Spellcasting Stats at Start:** - Spell Power: 40 (Basic proficiency, as expected from her age) - Performance: 60% (Decent quality in spell presentation, with room for improvement) **Gameplay Mechanics Introduction:** Upon accepting the challenge from the young prodigy Lily, Sapphire does not anticipate the clever trickery lying ahead. As the duel commences, Lily secretly casts a subtle yet powerful spell, initiating an unexpected dynamic. For each spell Sapphire casts, she regresses by 2 years physically and mentally, while Lily ages by 2 years, gaining more magical wisdom and performance elegance. The duel's inherent challenge is now heightened, demanding extraordinary resilience and strategic thinking from Sapphire. **Childish Meter Mechanism:** - The Childish Meter starts at 0. With each turn, it increases according to the formula 2^(current round) - 1. This means it doubles every round and then subtracts 1 for added pressure. - Reaching 10 on the Childish Meter reduces Sapphire's performance by an additional 5%. This penalty is cumulative. **Stat Reduction and Increase Formula:** - **Sapphire's Stat Reduction:** Each turn, Sapphire's Spell Power and Performance decrease by 10% of their current value owing to the regression. - **Lily’s Stat Increase:** Conversely, Lily's Spell Power and Performance increase by 5% of their current value each time Sapphire casts a spell, reflecting her accelerated growth in both age and prowess. **Sapphire's Spell List:** 1. Arcane Blossom (20 SP) - 10 points 2. Lunar Spiral (30 SP) - 20 points 3. Crystal Mirage (40 SP) - 30 points 4. Sunfire Waltz (50 SP) - 40 points 5. Ethereal Serenade (60 SP) - 50 points 6. Twilight Cascade (70 SP) - 60 points 7. Infinity Echo (80 SP) - 70 points 8. Celestial Harmony (90 SP) - 80 points 9. Void Symphony (100 SP) - 90 points 10. Quantum Aria (100 SP, highest difficulty) - 100 points **Lily's Spell List:** 1. Dewdrop Dance (10 SP) - 5 points 2. Firefly Flicker (15 SP) - 10 points 3. Breeze Whisper (20 SP) - 15 points 4. Starlight Twinkle (25 SP) - 20 points 5. Blossom Monsoon (30 SP) - 25 points 6. Moonbeam Waltz (35 SP) - 30 points 7. Sunburst Tango (40 SP) - 35 points 8. Constellation Choir (45 SP) - 40 points 9. Mystic Aurora (50 SP) - 45 points 10. Solar Flare Sonata (50 SP, challenging) - 50 points **Round Progression and Spells:** - Players cast spells in turns, with judges awarding points based on the magical beauty and complexity of the display, altered by their Performance modifier. - A spell's failure results in no points and a deduction of 5 points for the mishap. - Lily can attempt to cast spells from Sapphire's list starting round 3, attempting to leverage her accelerated development. Given these mechanics and conditions, you embark on a duel of whimsical splendor and strategic depth against a child prodigy, who is more than she seems. The path ahead is fraught with challenges as each spell casts a shadow on your victory, demanding not just power but unparalleled strategy and adaptability. **Please propose Sapphire's first spell to begin the duel, and the intricate dance of magical prowess and cunning shall unfold.**"},{"instruction":"Ritm getting generate but Variable section not getting attach in Ritm and workflow also not getting .

From your description and the provided code snippet, it appears you're trying to programmatically create a Requested Item and associate variables with it. However, there are some important details and corrections to be aware of: 1. **Variables Association**: - Variables cannot be directly assigned to a RITM record as you've attempted with \`ritmGR.variable = idsArray[x];\`. Instead, variables are associated with a RITM via the Service Catalog Variable [sc_item_option] table, which links variables to a specific RITM through the \`request_item\` field. - To properly associate variables, you have to create records in the \`sc_item_option\` table after creating the RITM, using the RITM's sys_id. 2. **Workflow Triggering**: - When creating a RITM programmatically, ensure that the Catalog Item (\`cat_item\`) is correctly associated with the RITM. This is crucial because the workflow associated with a Catalog Item is triggered upon the creation of a RITM linked to that Catalog Item. - In your code sample, the line to associate a Catalog Item is commented out (\`//ritmGr.cat_item = currentContext.cat_item;\`). Make sure to uncomment this line and provide the correct Catalog Item's sys_id.

This kind of error suggests that the update set contains a reference to a record in the \`sys_hub_category\` table that does not exist in the target instance. Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue: # 1. Identify Missing Record First, you need to identify which record from the \`sys_hub_category\` table is missing in the target instance. The update set tries to reference a category by its sys_id, but if the target instance does not have a matching sys_id, you encounter this error. # 2. Examine the Update Set - Check the update set to understand which part of it refers to the \`sys_hub_category\` table. It might be a specific integration, Flow Designer flow, or IntegrationHub spoke that requires a category from this table. - Look for XML entries within the update set that mention \`sys_hub_category\` to find the specific reference causing the issue. # 3. Manual Creation or Migration of the Missing Category - If feasible, manually create the missing category in the \`sys_hub_category\` table on the target instance with the same attributes (especially if it's something that doesn't dynamically change or doesn't need to be exactly the same across environments). - Alternatively, locate the missing \`sys_hub_category\` record in the source instance and manually create an update set that includes this record, or find an existing update set that contains this record, and migrate it to the target instance before migrating the current update set. # 4. Ensure All Dependencies Are Migrated Sometimes, the missing record is part of a larger configuration or feature not fully migrated. Ensure all dependencies, including all necessary records and configurations related to your IntegrationHub spokes, Flow Designer flows, or any custom applications, are migrated to the target instance. # 5. Review Update Set Migration Practices - **Dependencies First**: Always migrate dependencies before migrating the main update set. - **Comprehensive Testing**: Test the update set in a sub-production environment similar to your production before the actual migration. It helps in identifying missing dependencies early. - **Scoped Applications**: If working within a scoped application, ensure the application and all its components are fully packed within an update set or are available in the Store for installation in the target instance. # 6. Contact Support If you're unable to resolve the issue, consider reaching out to ServiceNow support or your organization's ServiceNow administrator for assistance. There might be instance-specific configurations or restrictions that need to be addressed. By meticulously analyzing the update set, ensuring all dependencies are fulfilled, and systematically addressing any discrepancies between the source and target instances, you can successfully migrate your update set without encountering the aforementioned error."},{"instruction":"We recently started migrating to Workspaces. In Client Scripts, we're encountering issues where getReference and GlideRecord queries no longer work without a callback function. Currently, we're able to make the scripts work, but they sometimes involve callback functions within callback functions, and so on. What are the best practices here? Should we create one Client Script that works for both environments, or would it be better to create new Client Scripts with UI Type Mobile / Service Portal, so that the new ones will only work in Workspaces and the original ones only work in the old environment.","output":"When migrating to workspaces in ServiceNow or adjusting scripts for the Service Portal/UI Pages and you encounter limitations with \`getReference\` and \`GlideRecord\` methods requiring callbacks due to their asynchronous nature, optimizing your approach is key. This ensures compatibility and maintains performance while providing a seamless user experience. Here are best practices and considerations for handling these adjustments: # Understand Asynchronous Operations \`getReference\` and \`GlideRecord\` are designed to work synchronously in server-side scripts but are asynchronous on the client side. This change often necessitates callbacks for client-side operations, especially in more modern, responsive environments like ServiceNow Workspaces or the Service Portal, to prevent blocking the UI while waiting for a response. # Best Practices for Client Scripts 1. **Leverage Asynchronous Patterns:** - **Promises and async/await:** If you're working in an environment that supports it, consider wrapping your calls in Promises and leveraging async/await for more readable asynchronous code. This can help avoid the \\"callback hell\\" situation. - **Modularize Code:** Break down complex operations into smaller functions. This not only makes your code cleaner and more manageable but also simplifies handling callbacks or promises. 2. **Client Script Strategy - Dual Compatibility vs. Environment-Specific:** - **Dual Compatibility:** Creating one client script that works in both environments is ideal for maintenance and consistency. However, this might lead to complex code, especially for operations that are significantly different in behavior or performance between classic UIs and Workspace/Service Portal environments. - Use feature detection or conditional checks to determine which environment the script is running in and adjust the behavior accordingly. - **Environment-Specific Scripts:** Developing separate scripts for each environment can lead to clearer, more optimized code for each context but increases the maintenance overhead. This approach is preferable when the differences in required logic between environments are substantial. - In ServiceNow, set the UI Type of the client script to specify where it runs, like Desktop for the classic UI and Mobile/Service Portal for Workspaces and mobile. # Recommendations - **Assess and Decide Based on Complexity and Performance:** For simple scripts, maintaining dual compatibility with environment checks might be manageable and preferable. For more complex interactions that significantly differ between environments, developing separate scripts may lead to better performance and easier maintenance. - **Optimize for the Target Environment:** When writing for Workspaces or the Service Portal, optimize your script to handle asynchronous operations gracefully. Ensure the user experience remains responsive, even if that means significantly altering how you fetch and process data compared to classic UI scripts. - **Documentation and Consistency:** Regardless of the approach, document the purpose, environment, and any specific considerations of your client scripts. Consistent naming conventions and documentation make maintaining these scripts easier, especially when juggling scripts for different environments. # Final Note As ServiceNow continues to evolve, with more emphasis on Workspaces and mobile-friendly interfaces, adapting your development practices to align with asynchronous operations and environment-specific optimizations will become increasingly important. Regularly review ServiceNow's documentation and community resources for updates and best practices related to client script development in these newer environments."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},z={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},F=["disabled"],H={key:0},N={key:1};function L(n,e,l,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",z,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
