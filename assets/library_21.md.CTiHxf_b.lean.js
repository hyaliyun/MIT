Gilbert syndrome typically doesn't require treatment or pose serious complications. In fact, Gilbert syndrome is usually not considered a disease because of its benign nature. Many individuals find out they have the disorder by accident, when they have a blood test that shows elevated bilirubin levels. More males than females have been diagnosed with Gilbert syndrome. This condition is caused by mutations in the UGT1A1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Gilbert syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Gilbert syndrome? While many people with Gilbert syndrome never experience any symptoms, mild jaundice may occur if bilirubin levels get high enough. Other possible symptoms may include fatigue, weakness and abdominal pain. Patients may have more side effects from certain drugs such as irinotecan. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Gilbert syndrome.

Gilbert syndrome generally doesn't require treatment. The bilirubin levels in the blood may fluctuate over time, causing episodes of jaundice. However, the jaundice is usually mild and goes away on its own. In some cases, doctors may prescribe phenobarbital to lower extremely elevated bilirubin levels and reduce signs of jaundice. Phenobarbital administration usually alleviates signs of jaundice fairly quickly."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Kyrle disease ?","output":"Kyrle disease is a skin disease characterized by the formation of large papules and is often associated with underlying hepatic, renal or diabetic disorders. It can affect both men and women throughout life, although the average age of onset is 30 years. Lesions typically begin as small papules with silvery scales that eventually grow and form red-brown nodules with a central keratin (horny) plug. The lesions occur mostly on the legs but also develop on the arms and the head and neck region. They are not typically painful may cause intense itching (pruritus). The cause of the disease is unknown; some cases appear to be idiopathic (no known cause) or inherited. The aim of treatment is to treat the underlying disease if one is associated. Lesions may self-heal without any treatment, but new lesions usually develop. Treatments that have been used to treat and reduce lesions include isotretinoin, high dose vitamin A, and tretinoin cream; emollients (skin softening agents) and oral antihistamines may be useful in relieving pruritus."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Kyrle disease ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Kyrle disease?

Some cases appear to be idiopathic (no known triggers), or inherited. What has been found is that Kyrle disease appears to occur more frequently in patients with certain systemic disorders, which include diabetes mellitus; renal disease (chronic renal failure, albuminuria, elevated serum creatinine, abnormal creatinine clearance, polyuria); hepatic abnormalities (alcoholic cirrhosis); and congestive heart failure. It has been thought that metabolic disorders associated with Kyrle disease are somehow responsible for development of abnormal keratinization and connective tissue changes, but the exact mechanism by which this happens is unclear."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Kyrle disease ?","output":"How might Kyrle disease be treated? Kyrle disease is most often associated with a systemic disorder, although idiopathic cases without any associated disease have occurred. Therefore, treatment is typically directed toward the underlying condition when appropriate. For individuals in whom itching is a major problem, soothing antipruritic lotions containing menthol and camphor may be helpful. Sedating antihistamines such as hydroxyzine may also be helpful for pruritus, especially at night. Some improvement has been reported with high doses of vitamin A, with or without vitamin E. Topical retinoic acid cream may also improve the symptoms. Another approach to treatment uses oral retinoids, which resulted in alleviation of symptoms in one study. Etretinate in high doses is also reportedly effective, but relapse has been reported following discontinuation of therapy. UV light therapy is reportedly particularly helpful for individuals with widespread lesions or coexisting pruritus from renal or hepatic disease. Carbon dioxide laser or cryosurgery may be helpful for limited lesions, but caution may be recommended for individuals with dark skin, especially with cryosurgery, and for lesions on the lower legs, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus or poor circulation."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ?","output":"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine that appears in late childhood or adolescence. Instead of growing straight, the spine develops a side-to-side curvature, usually in an elongated \\"s\\" or \\"C\\" shape, and the bones of the spine become slightly twisted or rotated. In many cases, the abnormal spinal curve is stable; however, in some children, the curve becomes more severe over time (progressive). For unknown reasons, severe and progressive curves occur more frequently in girls than in boys. The cause of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is unknown. It is likely that there are both genetic and environmental factors involved. Treatment may include observation, bracing and/or surgery."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ?","output":"What are the symptoms of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is characterized by an abnormal curvature of the spine (usually in an elongated \\"S\\" or \\"C\\" shape), along with twisted or rotated bones of the spine. Mild scoliosis generally does not cause pain, problems with movement, or difficulty breathing. It may only be diagnosed if it is noticed during a regular physical examination or a scoliosis screening at school. The most common signs of the condition include a tilt or unevenness (asymmetry) in the shoulders, hips, or waist, or having one leg that appears longer than the other. A small percentage of affected children develop more severe, pronounced spinal curvature. Scoliosis can occur as a feature of other conditions, including a variety of genetic syndromes. However, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis typically occurs by itself, without signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body."},{"instruction":"What causes Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ?","output":"What causes adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? The term \\"idiopathic\\" means that the cause of this condition is unknown. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Studies suggest that the abnormal spinal curvature may be related to hormonal problems, abnormal bone or muscle growth, nervous system abnormalities, or other factors that have not yet been identified. Researchers suspect that many genes are involved in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Some of these genes likely contribute to causing the disorder, while others play a role in determining the severity of spinal curvature and whether the curve is stable or progressive. Although many genes have been studied, few clear and consistent genetic associations with this condition have been identified."},{"instruction":"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis inherited ?","output":"Is adolescent idiopathic scoliosis inherited? Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis can be sporadic, which means it occurs in people without a family history of the condition, or it can cluster in families. The inheritance pattern of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is unclear because many genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved. We do know, however, that having a close relative (such as a parent or sibling) with the condition increases a child's risk of developing it."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ?","output":"How might adolescent idiopathic scoliosis be treated? Treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may involve observation, bracing and/or surgery. Treatment recommendations are generally dependent upon the risk of curve progression. Curves progress most during the rapid growth period of the patient (adolescent or pre-adolescent growth spurt). The potential for growth is evaluated by taking into consideration the patient's age, the status of whether females have had their first menstrual period, and radiographic parameters (x-ray studies).

Cervical ribs are actually thought to be a common trait. It has been estimated that 1 to 2% of the population have a cervical rib. Cervical ribs can affect one or both sides of the neck, and may cause thoracic outlet syndrome by putting pressure on an artery. Currently, the cause of cervical ribs is not known. In general, both genetic and environmental factors are thought to be involved. There have been animal studies investigating the role of HOX genes in causing extra ribs. Studies have also suggested environmental exposures, such as maternal exposure to foreign chemicals or stress during pregnancy could play a role. Further research in this area is needed.

The deletion occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated q11.2. Most people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are missing a piece of the chromosome that contains about 30 to 40 genes, many of which have not been well characterized. Some affected people have smaller deletions. Researchers are working to learn more about all of the genes that contribute to the features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The deletion of a particular gene, TBX1, is probably responsible for many of the syndrome's characteristic signs (such as heart defects, a cleft palate, distinctive facial features, hearing loss, and low calcium levels). Loss of this gene may also contribute to behavioral problems. The loss of another gene, COMT, may also cause increased risk of behavioral problems and mental illness in affected people. The other genes that are deleted likely contribute to the various features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome."},{"instruction":"22q11.2 deletion syndrome inherited ?","output":"Is 22q11.2 deletion syndrome inherited? Most cases of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are not inherited from a parent and are caused by a random error during the formation of egg or sperm cells, or during early fetal development. In about 10% of cases, the deletion is inherited from a parent with the deletion. All people with the deletion, whether they inherited it or not, can pass the deletion to their children. The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant because having a deletion in only one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell is enough to cause signs and symptoms. Each child of a person with the deletion has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the deletion."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Neurogenic diabetes insipidus ?","output":"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is a disease that causes frequent urination. This type of diabetes insipidus results from damage to the pituitary gland, which disrupts the normal storage and release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). When this hormone reaches the kidneys, it directs them to make less urine. Damage to the pituitary gland can be caused by different diseases as well as by head injuries, neurosurgery, or genetic disorders. To treat the ADH deficiency that results from any kind of damage to the pituitary, a synthetic hormone called desmopressin can be taken by an injection, a nasal spray, or a pill."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Neurogenic diabetes insipidus ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Neurogenic diabetes insipidus?

Laron syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in the GHR gene. This gene encodes growth hormone receptor, which is a protein found on the outer membrane of cells throughout the body. Growth hormone receptor is designed to recognize and bind growth hormone, which triggers cellular growth and division. When growth hormone is bound to the growth hormone receptors on liver cells, specifically, insulin-like growth factor I (another important growth-promoting hormone) is produced. Mutations in GHR impair the function of growth hormone receptors which interferes with their ability to bind growth hormone. This disrupts normal growth and development of cells and prevents the production of insulin-like growth factor I which causes the many signs and symptoms of Laron syndrome."},{"instruction":"Laron syndrome inherited ?","output":"Is Laron syndrome inherited? Most cases of Laron syndrome are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. Reports exist of rare families in which Laron syndrome appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In these cases, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. An affected person has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Laron syndrome ?","output":"How is Laron syndrome diagnosed? A diagnosis of Laron syndrome is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions that cause similar features. This generally includes blood tests to measure the levels of certain hormones that are often abnormal in people with Laron syndrome. For example, affected people may have elevated levels of growth hormone and reduced levels of insulin-like growth factor I. Genetic testing for changes (mutations) in the GHR gene can also be used to confirm a diagnosis in some cases."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Laron syndrome ?","output":"How might Laron syndrome be treated? There is currently no cure for Laron syndrome. Treatment is primarily focused on improving growth. The only specific treatment available for this condition is subcutaneous injections of insulin-like growth factor 1 (a growth-promoting hormone), often called IGF-1. IGF-1 stimulates linear growth (height) and also improves brain growth and metabolic abnormalities caused by long-term IGF-1 deficiency. It has also been shown to raise blood glucose levels, reduce cholesterol, and increase muscle growth. IGF-1 and GH levels should be closely monitored in people undergoing this treatment because overdosage of IGF-I causes a variety of health problems."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Acrocallosal syndrome, Schinzel type ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Acrocallosal syndrome, Schinzel type?

Calciphylaxis can also affect fat tissue, internal organs, and skeletal muscle, causing infections, pain, and organ failure. These symptoms are often irreversible, and many individuals with calciphylaxis may not survive more than a few months after they are diagnosed due to infection that spreads throughout the body (sepsis), or organ failure. The exact cause of calciphylaxis is unknown. Treatments may include medications to reduce pain, antibiotics to treat infections, and various approaches to preventing the development or worsening of this condition."},{"instruction":"What is (are) CoffinSiris syndrome ?","output":"Coffin-Siris syndrome is a genetic condition that causes variable degrees of learning disability, developmental delays, underdeveloped pinky toenails or fingernails, and distinct facial features.

Amyloidosis AA is also referred to as Secondary amyloidosis or Inflammatory amyloidosis. This disease is caused by a long-lasting infection or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, or osteomyelitis. Infection or inflammation in the body causes an increased amount of a specific protein called serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. In this disease, part of the SAA protein forms deposits called \\"amyloid fibrils\\". These desposits occur in the space around the cells of certain tissues of the body. Amyloidosis AA usually begins as a disease in the kidneys, but other organs can be affected such as the liver and spleen. Medical or surgical treatment of the underlying infection or inflammatory disease can slow down or stop the progression of this condition."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Amyloidosis AA ?","output":"What are the most current treatments for this disease? In amyloidosis AA, the treatment depends on the underlying disease. It is important to control the chronic infection or inflammatory disease which is responsible for the amyloid.

Alpha-thalassemia x-linked intellectual disability (ATRX) syndrome is caused by a mutation in the ATRX gene and is inherited in an x-linked way. The chance that a relative may have ATRX syndrome depends on whether the mutation in the first affected family member was inherited from his mother or happened by chance (a de novo mutation). If the mutation happened by chance, there is very little risk that other relatives could be affected by this condition. If the mutation was inherited from his mother, each of his mother's sisters has a 50% of being a carrier of ATRX syndrome. If a woman is a carrier of an ATRX mutation, she has a 25% chance of having a son with the mutation who is affected with ATRX syndrome; a 25% chance of having a son who does not have the mutation and does not have ATRX syndrome; a 25% chance of having a daughter with the mutation who is a carrier of ATRX syndrome; and a 25% chance of having a daughter who does not have the mutation and is not a carrier."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Agammaglobulinemia, nonBruton type ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Agammaglobulinemia, non-Bruton type?

The esophagus and trachea run next to each other through the chest cavity. The esophagus carries food and saliva to the stomach, while the trachea carries air to the lungs. TEF can lead to severe and fatal lung complications. Saliva and gastric secretions can be aspirated into the lungs, and normal swallowing and digestion of food cannot occur. Most affected people are diagnosed immediately after birth or during infancy. Symptoms may include frothy bubbles of mucus in the mouth and nose; episodes of coughing and choking; and worsening symptoms during feeding. TEF may be isolated, or it may occur with other physical or developmental abnormalities (most commonly, esophageal atresia). In many cases the cause is unknown but it has been associated with some chromosome disorders. In some cases it may be acquired later in life after a cancer, infection, ruptured diverticula, or trauma.

The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 14q deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation, where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a deletion. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. This page is meant to provide general information about 14q deletions. You can contact GARD if you have questions about a specific deletion on chromosome 14.

Von Willebrand disease is typically an inherited disease caused by mutations in the VWF gene. The VWF gene provides instructions for making a blood clotting protein called von Willebrand factor, which is important for forming blood clots and preventing further blood loss after an injury. If von Willebrand factor does not function normally or too little of the protein is available, blood clots cannot form properly. VWF gene mutations that reduce the amount of von Willebrand factor or cause the protein to function abnormally (or not at all) are responsible for the signs and symptoms associated with the condition. These mutations may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner, or may occur for the first time in the affected individual (known as a de novo mutation). Another form of the disorder, often considered a separate condition, is called acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS). AVWS is not caused by gene mutations. This condition is typically seen in conjunction with other disorders and usually begins in adulthood. A list of disorders associated with AVWS is available from UpToDate."},{"instruction":"Von Willebrand disease inherited ?","output":"Is von Willebrand disease always inherited from a parent? Most, but not all, cases of von Willebrand disease (VWD) are inherited. The majority of cases of type 1 and type 2A, as well as type 2B and type 2M, are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. VWD type 2N, type 3, and some cases of type 1 and type 2A are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most individuals with an autosomal dominant type of VWD have an affected parent. However, some individuals are affected due to having a new (de novo) mutation in the VWF gene that occurred for the first time in the affected individual. If the mutation found in the affected individual cannot be detected in either parent, it is most often due to a de novo mutation but may also be due to germline mosaicism in a parent. Possible non-medical explanations which may be explored include alternate paternity or maternity (e.g., with assisted reproduction) or undisclosed adoption. There is also a separate, rare condition called acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS). This is a mild to moderate bleeding disorder that is typically seen in conjunction with other disorders, such as diseases that affect bone marrow or immune cell function. AVWS is not caused by a mutation in the VWF gene and usually begins in adulthood."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Aspergillosis ?","output":"Aspergillosis is an infection, growth, or allergic response caused by the Aspergillus fungus. There are several different kinds of aspergillosis. One kind is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (also called ABPA), a condition where the fungus causes allergic respiratory symptoms similar to asthma, such as wheezing and coughing, but does not actually invade and destroy tissue. Another kind of aspergillosis is invasive aspergillosis. This infection usually affects people with weakened immune systems due to cancer, AIDS, leukemia, organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or other conditions or events that reduce the number of normal white blood cells. In this condition, the fungus invades and damages tissues in the body. Invasive aspergillosis most commonly affects the lungs, but can also cause infection in many other organs and can spread throughout the body (commonly affecting the kidneys and brain). Aspergilloma, a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of previous lung disease such as tuberculosis or lung abscess, is a third kind of aspergillosis. This type of aspergillosis is composed of a tangled mass of fungus fibers, blood clots, and white blood cells. The fungus ball gradually enlarges, destroying lung tissue in the process, but usually does not spread to other areas."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Aspergillosis ?","output":"How might aspergillosis be treated? If the infection is widespread or the person appears seriously ill, treatment is started immediately. Voriconazole is currently first-line treatment for invasive aspergillosis and is usually given intravenously. There are other antifungal drugs that can be used to treat invasive aspergillosis in patients who cannot take voriconazole or who have not responded to voriconazole. These include itraconazole, lipid amphotericin formulations, caspofungin, micafungin, and posaconazole. Whenever possible, immunosuppressive medications should be discontinued or decreased. A fungus ball usually does not require treatment unless bleeding into the lung tissue is associated with the infection, then surgery is required. Antifungal agents do not help people with allergic aspergillosis. Allergic aspergillosis is treated with prednisone taken by mouth."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Madelung disease ?","output":"Madelung disease is a rare condition characterized by the symmetric growth of fatty tumors (lipomas) around the neck, shoulders, upper arms and/or upper trunk. It most often affects men of Mediterranean ancestry between the ages of 30 and 70 who have a history of alcohol abuse. Non-alcoholics and women can also be affected. The signs and symptoms vary greatly from person to person. Usually, accumulation of fatty tissue increases over time and may lead to a loss of neck mobility and pain. The lipomas can cause physical deformity and peripheral neuropathy. In the majority of cases, the disease is benign; however, lipomas can become cancerous in rare circumstances. The exact cause of Madelung disease is unknown, but it may be associated with changes (mutations) in mitochondrial DNA and/or alcoholism. Treatment may include medications to correct associated metabolic conditions; surgery or liposuction to remove the lipomas; and avoidance of alcohol."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Madelung disease ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Madelung disease?

The exact underlying cause of Madelung disease remains unknown, but several theories have been proposed. The body's inability to properly metabolize fat in affected people suggests that Madelung disease may be an endocrine disorder. An enzyme defect or a change in the surface of cells could prevent the breakdown of fat leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition. Alcohol consumption may also play a role in the development of Madelung disease since roughly 90% of affected people have a history of alcohol abuse. Madelung disease has also been linked to genetic factors. Rarely, more than one family member can be affected by this condition which suggests that it may be inherited in at least some cases. In the majority of these families, the mode of inheritance has not been determined.

Madelung disease is usually diagnosed based on a thorough physical exam, accurate medical history, and imaging studies - computed tomography (CT scan) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan). A CT scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create pictures of cross-sections of the body, while an MRI scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the lipomas and surrounding tissues. Both of these tests are useful in establishing a diagnosis of Madelung disease, although MRI is often the preferred method. In some cases, a biopsy of the lipomas may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Madelung disease ?","output":"How might Madelung disease be treated? To date, the most effective treatment for Madelung disease is surgery which may include surgical excision (removal) and/or liposuction. Liposuction has gained popularity in more recent years since it results in minimal scarring. It is also considered less invasive, technically easier, and better suited for people with a higher surgical or anaesthetic risk. Some researchers believe it is unnecessary to subject affected people to the risks of surgery because the condition is usually benign. In their opinion, surgical excision should be limited to those with airway compression or severe physical deformities. The limitations of liposuction include incomplete removal of lipomas. The main disadvantage of surgical excision is the scarring; however, it offers the chance of more extensive \\"debulking\\" of affected areas. Reportedly, it is rarely possible to remove the lipomas completely and they often recur after both of these procedures. Some researchers have reported modest success treating the condition with the medication salbutamol, which increases the breakdown of fats. Abstaining from alcohol intake, weight loss, and correction of any associated metabolic/endocrine abnormalities are also recommended."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 with congenital bone fractures ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 with congenital bone fractures?

The signs and symptoms of dermatomyositis may appear suddenly or develop gradually, over weeks or months. The cardinal symptom of dermatomyositis is a skin rash that precedes or accompanies progressive muscle weakness. The rash looks patchy, with bluish-purple or red discolorations, and characteristically develops on the eyelids and on muscles used to extend or straighten joints, including knuckles, elbows, heels, and toes. Red rashes may also occur on the face, neck, shoulders, upper chest, back, and other locations, and there may be swelling in the affected areas. The rash sometimes occurs without obvious muscle involvement. Adults with dermatomyositis may experience weight loss or a low-grade fever, have inflamed lungs, and be sensitive to light. Children and adults with dermatomyositis may develop calcium deposits, which appear as hard bumps under the skin or in the muscle (called calcinosis). Calcinosis most often occurs 1-3 years after the disease begins. These deposits are seen more often in children with dermatomyositis than in adults. In some cases of dermatomyositis, distal muscles (muscles located away from the trunk of the body, such as those in the forearms and around the ankles and wrists) may be affected as the disease progresses.

Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and may include surgery to relieve cranial pressure and correct facial deformities."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type? Bone overgrowth in the head causes many of the signs and symptoms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. Affected individuals typically have distinctive facial features such as a wide nasal bridge, a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), and a prominent jaw. Excessive new bone formation (hyperostosis) in the jaw can delay teething (dentition) or result in absent teeth. Infants with this condition may have breathing or feeding problems caused by narrow nasal passages. In severe cases, abnormal bone growth can compress the nerves that emerge from the brain and extend to various areas of the head and neck (cranial nerves). Compression of the cranial nerves can lead to paralyzed facial muscles (facial nerve palsy), blindness, or deafness. The x-rays of individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia show unusually shaped long bones, particularly the large bones in the legs. The ends of these bones (metaphyses) are wider and appear less dense in people with this condition.

Other eye conditions reported in PPV include iris hamartomas, iris mammillations, and iris nodules. Some individuals with PPV also have Sturge-Weber syndrome or Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Signs and symptoms of Sturge-Weber syndrome include a large port-wine stain facial birthmark, blood vessel abnormalities in the brain called leptomeningeal angiomas, as well as glaucoma, seizures, muscle weakness, paralysis, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is characterized by a port-wine stain, abnormal overgrowth of soft tissues and bones, and vein malformations. You can learn more about Sturge-Weber syndrome on our Web site at the following link: http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/7706/Sturge_Weber_syndrome.aspx You can learn more about Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome on the Genetic Home Reference Web site at the following link: http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/klippel-trenaunay-syndrome A variety of other symptoms have been reported in individual cases of PPV (e.g., primary lymphedema, renal angiomas, moyamoya disease, scoliosis, malignant colonic polyposis, hypoplastic larynx, multiple granular cell tumors, and selective IgA deficiency).

Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) is thought to occur as a result of a change in the arrangement of a small piece of genetic material in a developing embryo. Because of this change some of the baby's body cells carry two copies of recessive gene mutations while the majority of his or her body cells carry only one. Having two copies of the recessive gene mutations result in a diseased cell (and symptoms of PPV). This phenomenon is called twin spotting. PPV occurs by chance, it is not inherited, and affects only a subset of the body's cells. As a result risk to future offspring is very small."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis ?","output":"How might phacomatosis pigmentovascularis be diagnosed?

Medical treatment of PPV with systemic complications requires individualized plans and often assistance from a team of specialists (e.g., opthamologist, neurologist, and vascular specialist)."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ?","output":"Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a neurological disorder that causes progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs and arms. Symptoms often include tingling or numbness (first in the toes and fingers); weakness of the arms and legs; loss of deep tendon reflexes; fatigue; and abnormal sensations. CIDP is thought to be caused by an abnormal immune response in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and damages the myelin sheath (the covering that protects nerve fibers) of the peripheral nerves. CIDP is closely related to Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and is considered the \\"chronic counterpart\\" of GBS.

Without pyruvate kinase, red blood cells break down too easily, resulting in low levels of these cells (hemolytic anemia). The signs and symptoms of the disease may vary greatly from person to person. However, they usually include jaundice, enlargement of the spleen, and mild or severe hemolysis (red cell breakdown), leading to anemia. In some cases, the problems may first appear while in utero, causing a condition in which abnormal amounts of fluid build up in two or more body areas of the fetus (hydrops fetalis). Newborns may present with prolonged jaundice and anemia. Older children may be pale (due to anemia) and have intermittent episodes of jaundice. Mild cases may escape detection until adulthood. Although the anemia tends to stabilize in adulthood, episodes of anemia may occur with acute infections, stress, and pregnancy.

Pyruvate kinase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, which means that a child must inherit a gene with a disease-causing mutation from both parents to develop the disorder. The gene that causes pyruvate kinase deficiency is called the PKLR gene that is located on chromosome 1q21. Although the inheritance is clinically autosomal recessive, most affected individuals are compound heterozygous for two different mutant alleles. It is estimated that approximatly 1 in 100 people carry one copy of a disease-causing mutation in the PKLR gene.

Mild cases require no treatment. People with severe anemia may need blood transfusions. In newborns with dangerous levels of jaundice, a health care provider may recommend an exchange transfusion. Surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) may also be necessary to help reduce the destruction of red blood cells. However, this does not help in all cases. With small children, this is delayed as long as possible to allow the immune system to mature. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Someone who had a splenectomy should receive the pneumococcal vaccine at recommended intervals. They also should receive preventive antibiotics until age 5.

Affected people may also have excess white blood cells and platelets. These extra cells cause the blood to be thicker than normal, increasing the risk for blood clots that can block blood flow in arteries and veins. People with PV have an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis which can cause a pulmonary embolism, heart attack, and stroke. Most cases of PV are not inherited and are acquired during a person's lifetime. In rare cases, the risk for PV runs in families and may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

Most cases of polycythemia vera (PCV) are not inherited from a parent and are acquired during a person's lifetime. The condition is associated with genetic changes (mutations) that are somatic, which means they occur in cells of the body but not in egg and sperm cells. In rare cases, the risk to develop PCV runs in families and sometimes appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.

The exact cause of pineal cysts is unknown. However, some studies suggest that bleeding in the pineal region or hormonal influences may play a role in the development and progression of pineal cysts."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Pineal cyst ?","output":"How might pineal cysts be treated? The best treatment options for pineal cysts depend on many factors, including the size of the cyst and whether or not it is associated with symptoms. For example, people with pineal cysts that do not cause symptoms may not require any form of treatment. However, they may need to have regular check-ups with a physician and follow up imaging if they have a large cyst (greater than 10-14 mm) or develop symptoms that could be related to the cyst. Treatment is often recommended for those individuals with pineal cysts that cause hydrocephalus; neurological symptoms such as headache or disturbance of vision; or enlargement of the cyst over time. Treatment may include surgery to remove the cyst, sometimes followed by the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Aspiration of the contents of the cyst using ultrasound guidance has been explored as an alternative approach to surgery, and more recently, endoscopic procedures have been used. Radiation therapy may be recommended for cysts that recur after treatment. What is the appropriate follow-up for a pineal cyst found incidentally on MRI? There is limited information about what happens to a pineal cyst over time. Several studies have shown that most pineal cysts remain stable and do not increase in size or cause symptoms later in life. One study found that larger cysts were more likely to decrease in size over time, and there is currently no evidence that larger cysts are more likely to cause symptoms. Because guidelines for management depend on an understanding of the typical course of a condition, and currently there is limited information about pineal cysts, there is some debate about the most appropriate way to manage these cysts. Some studies do not recommend repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cyst. Other studies state that repeated imaging of a pineal cyst is not required. Another approach is for individuals with a pineal cyst to have regular check-ups with their personal doctor; if at any point new symptoms arise that may be related to the pineal cyst, repeat imaging should be done."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Huntington disease ?","output":"Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited condition that causes progressive degeneration of neurons in the brain.

Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a change (mutation) in the HTT gene. This gene gives instructions for making a protein called huntingtin. The exact function of this protein is unclear, but it appears to be important to nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The HTT gene mutation that causes HD involves a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of three DNA building blocks that repeat multiple times in a row. The CAG segment in a normal HTT gene repeats about 10 to 35 times. In people with HD, it may repeat from 36 to over 120 times. People with 36 to 39 CAG repeats (an intermediate size) may or may not develop HD, while people with 40 or more repeats almost always develop HD. An increased number of CAG repeats leads to an abnormally long version of the huntingtin protein. The long protein is then cut into smaller, toxic pieces that end up sticking together and accumulating in neurons. This disrupts the function of the neurons, ultimately causing the features of HD."},{"instruction":"Huntington disease inherited ?","output":"How is Huntington disease inherited? Huntington disease (HD) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a change (mutation) in only one of the 2 copies of the HTT gene is enough to cause the condition. When a person with HD has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated gene and develop the condition. Most people with HD have an affected parent. The family history can sometimes appear negative for various reasons even though a parent carries, or carried, a mutation in the HTT gene. In rare cases, HD is caused by a new (de novo) mutation in the HTT gene, in which case the disease occurs for the first time in the affected person and is not inherited from a parent. As HD is passed through generations, the size of the mutation in the HTT gene (called a trinucleotide repeat) often increases. A longer repeat in the HTT gene may cause earlier onset of symptoms. This phenomenon is called anticipation."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Huntington disease ?","output":"Is genetic testing available for Huntington disease? Yes. Testing of adults at risk for Huntington disease (HD) who have no symptoms of the disease is called predictive testing. Whether to have predictive testing requires careful thought, including pre-test and post-test genetic counseling. This is particularly important because there is currently no cure. Furthermore, predictive testing cannot accurately predict the age a person with an HD mutation will develop symptoms, the severity or type of symptoms they will experience, or the future rate of disease progression. A person may want to have predictive testing because they feel they need to know, or to make personal decisions involving having children, finances, and/or career planning. Other people decide they do not want to know whether they will develop HD. Testing is appropriate to consider in symptomatic people of any age in a family with a confirmed diagnosis of HD. However, testing of asymptomatic people younger than age 18 is not considered appropriate. A main reason is that it takes away the choice of whether the person wants to know, while there is no major benefit to knowing at that age. People who are interested in learning more about genetic testing for HD should speak with a genetics professional. How is Huntington disease diagnosed? A diagnosis of Huntington disease is typically suspected in people with characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition and a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. The diagnosis can then be confirmed with genetic testing that identifies a specific type of change (mutation) in the HTT gene."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Huntington disease ?","output":"How might Huntington disease be treated?

Symptoms and severity of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome varies greatly from person to person. In general, blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is characterized by skin spots (nevi) that may be few to hundreds in number. Size tends varies from millimeters to several centimeters in length. These nevi are made of blood vessels and are spongy, meaning they can easily be pressed upon. When pressure is released, they refill with blood and regain their original shape. They tend to be blue but can vary in color and shape. The surface of the nevi may be smooth or wrinkled and they often have a rubbery feel. They do not tend to bleed spontaneously, but are fragile and will bleed if injured. They may be tender to the touch. They may also be associated with increased sweating in the area of the skin legions. The number and size of legions may worsen with advancing age. Nevi may also be found in the intestines (particularly the small intestine) in individuals with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. These nevi can bleed spontaneously causing anemia. Most bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract is slow; however, sudden quick bleeding (hemorrhage) is possible. Other serious complications of gastrointestinal legions may include intussusception, bowel infarction, and even death. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome can affect other body organs as well.

Please click on the link to access this resource."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Barrett esophagus ?","output":"How might Barrett esophagus be treated? The treatment of Barrett esophagus largely depends on the severity of the condition as determined by the level of dysplasia seen on biopsy. In people with no dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia, treatment is often focused on easing the signs and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can cause further damage to the esophagus. This may include certain medications and lifestyle modifications such as avoiding smoking; eliminating food and drinks that trigger heartburn; raising the head of the bed while sleeping; and/or avoiding late night snacking. Periodic endoscopy may also be recommended to monitor Barrett esophagus as other treatments may be indicated if the condition advances. Because high-grade dysplasia is thought to be the final step before cells change into esophageal cancer, more aggressive treatments are typically recommended. These may include:[ Endoscopic resection - an endoscope is used to remove damaged cells Endoscopic ablative therapies - different techniques such as photodynamic therapy or radiofrequency ablation are used to destroy the dysplasia in the esophagus. In photodynamic therapy, abnormal cells are destroyed by making them sensitive to light, while radiofrequency ablation uses heat to remove abnormal esophagus tissue. Surgery - the damaged part of the esophagus is removed and the remaining portion is attached to the stomach The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' (NIDDK) Web site offers more specific information on the treatment and management of Barret esophagus.

The eye, cheekbone, lower jaw, facial nerves, muscles, and neck may be affected. Other findings may include hearing loss from underdevelopment of the middle ear; a small tongue; and macrostomia (large mouth). HFM is the second most common facial birth defect after clefts. The cause of HFM in most cases is unknown. It usually occurs in people with no family history of HFM, but it is inherited in some cases. Treatment depends on age and the specific features and symptoms in each person."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Hemifacial microsomia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Hemifacial microsomia?

For most people with hemifacial microsomia, the cause is unknown. It is believed that something occurs in the early stages of development, such as a disturbance of the blood supply to the first and second branchial arches in the first 6 to 8 weeks of pregnancy. Studies have suggested multiple possible risk factors for hemifacial microsomia. Environmental risk factors include the use of medications during pregnancy such as Accutane, pseudoephedrine, aspirin, or ibuprofen. Other environmental factors include second trimester bleeding, maternal diabetes, being pregnant with multiples, or the use of assisted reproductive technology. A genetic cause is found in some families, such as a chromosome disorder or a genetic syndrome. Some possible explanations when the cause of hemifacial microsomia is unknown include a very small chromosome deletion or duplication that is not detected, a mutation in an unknown gene, or changes in multiple genes associated with development of the face. It is also possible that a combination of genetic changes and environmental risk factors could cause hemifacial microsomia."},{"instruction":"Hemifacial microsomia inherited ?","output":"Is hemifacial microsomia inherited? Hemifacial microsomia most often occurs in a single individual in a family and is not inherited. If the condition is caused by a chromosomal abnormality, it may be inherited from one affected parent or it may result from a new abnormality in the chromosome and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In a very small number of cases, hemifacial microsomia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In rare cases, the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. The gene or genes involved in hemifacial microsomia are unknown. In some affected families, people seem to inherit an increased risk of developing hemifacial microsomia, not the condition itself. In these cases, some combination of genetic changes and environmental factors may be involved."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Hemifacial microsomia ?","output":"How might hemifacial microsomia be treated? Treatment of hemifacial microsomia varies depending on the features present and the severity in each affected person. Various types of surgeries may be needed in many cases. Some children need breathing support or a tracheostomy soon after birth if the jaw is severely affected. However in most cases, airway problems can be managed without surgery. Those with a jaw deformity and/or clefts may have feeding problems and may need supplemental feedings through a nasogastric tube to support growth and weight gain. Babies born with cleft lip or palate can have surgical repairs done during the first year. Cleft lip repair is typically performed when the child is 3-6 months old, while cleft palate surgery is generally performed when the child is about a year old. A lateral facial cleft, one of the most severe abnormalities associated with the condition, also requires reconstruction in stages. If eye closure is incomplete due to eyelid abnormalities or facial paralysis is present, a child may need eye protection or surgery. Surgery may also be used for eyelid differences to reposition the lower lids and corners of the eyes. Some children with abnormally shaped or missing ears may choose to have a series of reconstructive surgeries to make the ear appear more normal. Children with skin, cheek and other soft tissue deficiencies may need augmentation procedures such as fat grafting or tissue transfer. Severe bone abnormalities may require surgery as well. Because multiple body systems may be involved in hemifacial microsomia, affected people should continually be monitored for complications."},{"instruction":"What is (are) SwyerJames syndrome ?","output":"Swyer-James syndrome is a rare condition in which the lung (or portion of the lung) does not grow normally and is slightly smaller than the opposite lung, usually following bronchiolitis in childhood. It is typically diagnosed after a chest X-ray or CT scan which shows unilateral pulmonary hyperlucency (one lung appearing less dense) and diminished pulmonary arteries. Affected individuals may not have any symptoms, or more commonly, they may have recurrent pulmonary infections and common respiratory symptoms. The cause of the condition is not completely understood."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of SwyerJames syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Swyer-James syndrome? Individuals with Swyer-James syndrome may not have any symptoms, but affected individuals can have chronic or recurring lung infections, shortness of breath (dyspnea) when performing an activity, coughing up of blood (hemoptysis), and even severe respiratory impairment."},{"instruction":"What causes SwyerJames syndrome ?","output":"What causes Swyer-James syndrome? The cause of Swyer-James syndrome is not completely understood. Most experts agree that the initial abnormality occurs in the distal bronchi (air tubes that bring air to and from the lungs) after an infection during early childhood. The smaller size of the affected lung may be due to the infection inhibiting the normal growth of the lung. A number of reports have described Swyer-James syndrome following childhood histories including radiation therapy; measles; pertussis (whooping cough); tuberculosis; breathing in a foreign body; mycoplasma; and viral infections, especially adenovirus. Research has suggested that a hyper-immune reaction in the lung (producing an unusual abundance of antibodies) may play a role in sustaining airway damage after the initial infection. Some have argued a pre-existing lung abnormality may predispose individuals to the condition. Although bronchial damage of some kind during childhood is generally considered to play an important role, many affected individuals have had no known history of an airway infection. It is possible that some unknown factors present at birth may contribute to the development of Swyer-James syndrome."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for SwyerJames syndrome ?","output":"How might Swyer-James syndrome be treated? Individuals with Swyer-James syndrome reportedly have been treated conservatively in the past. However, although there are few reports published, it has been recognized that surgical treatment should be considered when infections cannot be controlled. There have been reports of affected individuals being treated with pneumonectomy (removal of a lung), lobectomy (removal of one or more lobes of a lung) or segmentectomy (removal of a specific segment). It has been proposed that individuals with Swyer-James syndrome may benefit from lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), a procedure in which damaged tissue is removed from the lung. LVRS was reportedly performed successfully in an individual with Swyer-James syndrome, and it has been suggested that the procedure could be used for managing the condition in other affected individuals because it has shown to be effective for improving pulmonary function and symptoms."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia ?","output":"Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia is a genetic disorder of bone growth. The term axial means towards the center of the body. Sphondylos is a Greek term meaning vertebra. Metaphyseal dysplasia refers to abnormalities at the ends of long bones. Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia primarily affects the bones of the chest, pelvis, spine, upper arms and upper legs, and results in shortened stature. For reasons not well understood, this rare skeletal dysplasia is also associated with early and progressive vision loss. The underlying genetic cause of axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia is currently unknown. It is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia? Common signs and sympotms of axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, include short stature, chest, spine, limb, and pelvic bone changes, and vision disturbance. People with axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia may have a normal birth length, but demonstrate growth failure by late infancy to early childhood. A measurement called standard deviation (SD) is used to compare the height of different children. If a child's height is more than 2 SD's below the average height of other children the same age, the child is said to have short stature. This means that almost all of the other children that age (more than 95% or 19 out of 20) are taller. Individual case reports of children and an adult with axial spondlometaphyseal dysplasia demonstrate height as being between 2 to 6 SDs below average. Infants with axial spondlometaphyseal dysplasia tend to have a shortened chest with short ribs, a condition called thoracic hypoplasia. Thoracic hypoplasia tends to become more prominent in childhood, and less noticeable in adolescence and adulthood. Thoracic hypoplasia may cause mild to moderate breathing problems in infants and recurring lung infections in childhood. Young children with axial spondlometaphyseal dysplasia have shortened upper arms and upper leg bones, which may become less prominent as they grow. Spine changes include vertebrae that have a flattened appearance on x-ray. This finding is typically mild in infancy and early childhood, becomes more apparent in late childhood, then self-corrects by adulthood. Some individuals with axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia develop scoliosis (curvature of the spine). Pelvic bone changes can be seen in infants and children. Some of these changes self-correct by adulthood. A condition called coxa vara (where the angle between the top of the femur and the femoral shaft is smaller than normal) is common beginning in late childhood and persists through adulthood. Coxa vara may affect gait (pattern or way of walking). Some people with axial spondlometaphyseal dysplasia have minor bone changes in their knees. Vision problems, including retinitis pigmentosa and/or optic atrophy, become evident in infancy or early childhood and rapidly worsen. Retinitis pigmentosa causes cells in the retina to breakdown and die, eventually resulting in vision loss. Optic atrophy causes vision to dim and reduces the field of vision. It also reduces the ability to see fine detail and color (ie., colors will seem faded). With the progression of optic atrophy, a person's pupil reaction to light diminishes and may eventually be lost. Long term outlook for vision for people with axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia is poor.

The signs and symptoms of mitochondrial complex II deficiency can vary greatly from severe life-threatening symptoms in infancy to muscle disease beginning in adulthood. Complex II deficiency can be caused by mutations in the SDHA, SDHB, SDHD, or SDHAF1 genes. In many cases the underlying gene mutations cannot be identified. Complex II deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Complex II deficiency gene mutation carriers may be at an increased risk for certain cancers."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Mitochondrial complex II deficiency ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Mitochondrial complex II deficiency? The signs and symptoms of mitochondrial complex II deficiency can vary greatly from severe life-threatening symptoms in infancy to muscle disease beginning in adulthood. Many factors affect symptom and symptom severity, including what gene mutation is involved. Many genes must work together to ensure that the enzyme, complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), can perform its job normally in the body. Changes in the SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF1, or SDHAF2 genes can all potentially cause complex II deficiency. Much of what we know today about the signs and symptoms of complex II deficiency are based on articles which describe individual patients. Due to the rarity of this condition and the complexity of its cause, it is very difficult to predict how a person will be affected. We strongly recommend that you work with your or your childs healthcare provider to learn more about how the deficiency is affecting your or your childs health. In the meantime, we have summarized symptoms of complex II deficiency which have been described in case reports: Inheriting two SDHA gene mutations has caused myoclonic seizures and Leighs syndrome. Leigh syndrome is a severe neurological disorder that typically arises in the first year of life. This condition is characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor regression) and typically results in death within a couple of years, usually due to respiratory failure. A small number of people develop symptoms in adulthood or have symptoms that worsen more slowly. The first signs of Leigh syndrome seen in infancy are usually vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) that leads to eating problems. Click here to visit Genetics Home Reference and learn more about Leigh syndrome. Inheriting two SDHB gene mutations can cause leukodystrophy. Leukodystrophies affect the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells. Damage to this sheath slows down or blocks messages between the brain and the rest of the body. This leads to problems with movement, speaking, vision, hearing, and mental and physical development. Most of the leukodystrophies appear during infancy or childhood. They can be hard to detect early because children seem healthy at first. However, symptoms gradually get worse over time. Click here to visit MedlinePlus.gov and learn more about leukodystprohy. Inheriting two SDHAF1 gene mutations can cause severe progressive leukoencephalopathy beginning in infancy. Leukoencephalopathy refers to the degeneration of the white matter of the brain. It is usually diagnosed by MRI. It causes cognitive impairment, increased muscle tone, and hyperactive reflexes. Inheriting two SDHD gene mutations can cause progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor retardation), and seizures. Signs and symptoms may begin in infancy and progress through childhood. Complex II deficiency has also been described in association with dilated cardiomyopathy (and heart failure in childhood), hemolytic uremic syndrome and rhabdomyolysis, congenital dislocation of the hip joint, progressive encephalomyopathy (a disorder affecting the brain and skeletal muscle, usually causing weakness) with dementia, and KearnsSayre syndrome. Case reports have also demonstrated that people who have only a single mutation in one of these genes may also be at risk for health problems: Having one SDHA gene mutation caused optic atrophy, ataxia, proximal myopathy in adulthood. Having one mutation in the SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHAF2, or SDHD gene can cause an increased risk for paragangliomas and/or pheochromocytomas.

In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."},{"instruction":"Mitochondrial complex II deficiency inherited ?","output":"What causes mitochondrial complex II deficiency? Many genes must work together to ensure that the enzyme, complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), can perform its job normally in the body. Changes in the SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF1, and SDHAF2 genes can all potentially cause complex II deficiency. Complex II deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. This means that a person must inherit a gene mutation from both their mother and father in order to develop complex II deficiency. People who have a single mutation are called carriers. Carriers of complex II deficiency may be at an increased risk for certain health problems, including for paragangliomas and/or pheochromocytomas.[8676]"},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Mitochondrial complex II deficiency ?","output":"How might mitochondrial complex II deficiency be treated?

When affected people's blood is exposed to cold temperatures (32 to 50 F), certain proteins that normally attack bacteria (IgM antibodies) attach themselves to red blood cells and bind them together into clumps (agglutination). This eventually causes red blood cells to be prematurely destroyed (hemolysis) leading to anemia and other associated signs and symptoms. Cold agglutinin disease can be primary (unknown cause) or secondary, due to an underlying condition such as an infection, another autoimmune disease, or certain cancers. Treatment depends on many factors including the severity of the condition, the signs and symptoms present in each person, and the underlying cause."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Cold agglutinin disease ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Cold agglutinin disease?

Cold agglutinin disease is not an inherited condition. It is designated as either primary (unknown cause) or secondary (associated with or caused by another condition). In some cases, cold agglutinin may be multifactorial which means that multiple environmental factors and genes likely interact to predispose a person to developing the condition. However, to our knowledge, no disease-causing genes have been identified and no familial cases have been reported."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Cold agglutinin disease ?","output":"How is cold agglutinin disease diagnosed? A diagnosis of cold agglutinin disease may be made after several types of tests are performed by a health care provider. In some cases, the diagnosis is first suspected by chance if a routine complete blood count (CBC) detects abnormal clumping (agglutination) of the red blood cells. In most cases, the diagnosis is based on evidence of hemolytic anemia (from symptoms and/or blood tests). A person may also be physically examined for spleen or liver enlargement. An antiglobulin test (called the Coombs test) may be performed to determine the presence of a specific type of antibody. In people with cold agglutinin disease, the Coomb's test is almost always positive for immunoglobulin M (IgM). Detailed information about the various tests used to make a diagnosis of cold agglutinin disease is available on Medscape Reference's Web site.

The treatment of cold agglutinin disease depends on many factors including the severity of the condition, the signs and symptoms present in each person, and the underlying cause. For example, in those affected by secondary cold agglutinin disease, it is important to diagnose and treat the underlying condition which may include certain types of cancer; bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; and/or other autoimmune disease. People with few symptoms and/or mild anemia may not require any specific treatment. These cases are often managed by simply avoiding exposure to the cold. In severe cases, medical interventions may be necessary. Rituximab (an antibody that selectively reduces specific types of immune cells) may be recommended either alone or in combination with other medications for people with severe hemolysis. Plasmapheresis, which involves filtering blood to remove antibodies, and/or blood transfusions may be an option for temporary relief of severe symptoms. Other therapies exist; however, they have been used with variable success. Medscape Reference's Web site offers more specific information about these alternative treatments.

In recent years, a renewed interest in understanding the underlying cause of MdDS has led to new treatment options, including repetitive cranial stimulation. More studies into these treatment options are needed."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Rh deficiency syndrome ?","output":"The Rh deficiency syndrome, also known as Rh-null syndrome, is a blood disorder where people have red blood cells (RBCs) lacking all Rh antigens. The Rh antigens maintain the integrity of the RBC membrane and therefore, RBCs which lack Rh antigens have an abnormal shape. There are two types of Rh deficiency syndrome: The regulator type is associated with many different changes (mutations) in the RHAG gene . The amorph type is caused by inactive copies of a gene (silent alleles) at the RH locus. As a result, the RBCs do not express any of the Rh antigens. The absence of the Rh complex alters the RBC shape, increases its tendency to break down (osmotic fragility), and shortens its lifespan, resulting in a hemolytic anemia that is usually mild. These patients are at risk of having adverse transfusion reactions because they may produce antibodies against several of the Rh antigens and can only receive blood from people who have the same condition. Rh deficiency syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Management is individualized according to the severity of hemolytic anemia."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Leber congenital amaurosis 10 ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Leber congenital amaurosis 10?

Management of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) focuses on preventing allergic attacks as well as relieving the signs and symptoms of the condition. It is often recommended that affected individuals try to avoid the agent that causes the allergy (if possible); wear dark sunglasses in the daytime; avoid dust; and stay inside on hot afternoons. Eye drops that affect the amount of histamine released by immune system cells (called mast cell stabilizers) may be used at the beginning of the season or at the first sign of a \\"flare-up\\" to prevent severe symptoms; however, they are not considered effective at relieving symptoms. Topical eye drops are generally preferred as the first source of treatment. Cold compresses, artificial tears, ointments and/or topical antihistamines may help. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) may relieve symptoms in moderate cases; topical steroids are typically only used for more severe cases because long-term use can cause glaucoma. A few prescription drugs may also be available for the treatment of VKC; these include cromolyn sodium, lodoxamide tromethamine and Levocabastine. Oral administration of montelukast, a drug usually prescribed for asthma, has also been shown to be an effective treatment of VKC.

Treatment for Hallermann-Streiff syndrome depends on the specific signs and symptoms present in each affected individual. Early disease management for infants may include monitoring of breathing, consideration of tracheostomy, and various measures to improve feeding and ensure sufficient intake of nutrients. Although early surgical removal of cataracts may be recommended to help preserve vision, some studies have suggested that spontaneous cataract absorption may occur in up to 50% of untreated patients. Regular appointments with an ophthalmologist are strongly recommended to identify and treat other eye abnormalities, some of which may require surgical intervention. With respect to dental anomalies, natal/neonatal teeth (teeth present at birth) may be incorrectly diagnosed as extra teeth and there may be a tendency to extract them. However, the loss of teeth may worsen glossoptosis (posteriorly location of the tongue) or cause other complications. It has thus been recommended to preserve prematurely erupting teeth to facilitate eating until the existence of successional permanent teeth can be confirmed. Ensuring good dental hygiene is also important. Management of the condition may also include surgical reconstruction of certain craniofacial malformations (particularly the mandibular and nasal region) at the appropriate age. For some affected infants and children with heart defects, medical treatment and/or surgical intervention may be recommended."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Rotor syndrome ?","output":"Rotor syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia).

Rotor syndrome is an inherited disorder caused by having mutations in both the SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in liver cells, where they transport bilirubin and other substances from the blood into the liver so that they can be cleared from the body. In the liver, bilirubin is dissolved in a digestive fluid called bile, and then excreted from the body. The mutations in the SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes that cause Rotor syndrome either prevent the production of the transporting proteins, or prevent them from functioning properly. When this occurs, bilirubin is not effectively removed from the body and builds up, leading to jaundice."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Rotor syndrome ?","output":"How is Rotor syndrome diagnosed? Rotor syndrome is diagnosed based on symptoms and various laboratory tests. Physical exams in affected people are typically normal, except for mild jaundice. There are two forms of bilirubin in the body: a toxic form called unconjugated bilirubin and a nontoxic form called conjugated bilirubin. People with Rotor syndrome have a buildup of both in their blood (hyperbilirubinemia), but having elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin is the hallmark of the disorder. Conjugated bilirubin in affected people is usually more than 50% of total bilirubin. To confirm a disgnosis of Rotor syndrome, a person may have the following performed: testing for serum bilirubin concentration testing for bilirubin in the urine testing for hemolysis and liver enzyme activity (to rule out other conditions) cholescintigraphy (also called an HIDA scan) testing for total urinary porphyrins"},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Rotor syndrome ?","output":"How might Rotor syndrome be treated? Rotor syndrome is considered a benign disorder and does not require treatment. While no adverse drug reactions have been reported in people with Rotor syndrome, a number of commonly used drugs and/or their metabolites may have serious consequences in affected people.

Thrombophilia is an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots in blood vessels. People who have prothrombin thrombophilia are at somewhat higher than average risk for a type of clot called a deep venous thrombosis, which typically occur in the deep veins of the legs. Affected people also have an increased risk of developing a pulmonary embolism. However, most people with prothrombin thrombophilia never develop abnormal blood clots. Prothrombin thrombophilia is the second most common inherited form of thrombophilia after factor V Leiden thrombophilia. It is more common in Caucasian populations. This condition is caused by a particular mutation (written G20210A or 20210G>A) in the F2 gene. People can inherit one or two copies of the gene mutation from their parents."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Prothrombin thrombophilia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Prothrombin thrombophilia? The signs and symptoms of this condition depend on whether a person has inherited one or two copies of the F2 gene mutation from his or her parents. A person who inherits one gene mutation is called a heterozygote. Whereas a person that inherits two gene mutations (one from each parent) is considered a homozygote for this condition; although it is very rare to find individuals who are homozygous. An affected heterozygous person usually experiences mild to moderate increase in their thrombin production, which is associated with 2.5 to 3 fold greater risk of developing a venous thromboembolism. There is not enough information about risk in those who are homozygous. Some research suggests that in women, prothrombin thrombophilia is associated with a somewhat increased risk of pregnancy loss (miscarriage) and may also increase the risk of other complications during pregnancy. These complications may include pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), slow fetal growth, and early separation of the placenta from the uterine wall (placental abruption). It is important to note, however, that most women with prothrombin thrombophilia have normal pregnancies.

Prothrombin thrombophilia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. For this condition, this means that having one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene (F2) in each cell may be sufficient to cause signs or symptoms of the condition. The mutation in the F2 gene that causes prothrombin thrombophilia is called 20210G>A (also called the 20210G>A allele). An individual can be heterozygous (having the mutation in only one copy of the F2 gene) or homozygous (having a mutation in both copies of the F2 gene). Heterozygosity results in an increased risk for thrombosis; homozygosity results in more severe thrombophilia and/or increased risk for thrombosis. All individuals reported to date with prothrombin thrombophilia who are heterozygous for the 20210G>A allele have had an affected parent. Because of the relatively high prevalence of this allele in the general population, occasionally one parent is homozygous or both parents are heterozygous for this allele. When an individual who is heterozygous for the 20210G>A allele has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit that allele and also be heterozygous. An individual who is homozygous will always pass one of the 20210G>A alleles to each of his/her children. If two heterozygotes have children together, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to be homozygous (having 2 mutated copies), a 50% risk to be heterozygous like each parent, and a 25% risk to inherit 2 normal copies of the F2 gene."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Prothrombin thrombophilia ?","output":"What kind of tests can determine if an individual has, or is a carrier of, prothrombin thrombophilia? No clinical signs or symptoms are specific for prothrombin thrombophilia. A confirmed diagnosis of this condition requires specific genetic testing via DNA analysis of the F2 gene, which provides instructions for making the protein prothrombin. The test identifies the presence of a common change (mutation) called 20210G>A. An individual can be a heterozygote (having one mutated copy of the F2 gene) or a homozygote (having two mutated copies). Most heterozygotes have a mildly elevated plasma concentration of prothrombin (which can be measured in a blood test) that is approximately 30% higher than normal. However, these values can vary greatly, and the range of prothrombin concentrations in heterozygotes overlaps significantly with the normal range. Therefore, plasma concentration of prothrombin is not reliable for diagnosis of this condition. Individuals interested in learning more about testing for prothrombin thrombophilia should speak with a genetics professional or other healthcare provider."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Wolffian tumor ?","output":"Wolffian tumors are rare tumors located anywhere along the length between the ovary and vagina in sites of remnant wolffian ducts.

Not all infants exposed to phenytoin will be affected with the disorder. Symptoms in affected individuals may include abnormalities of the skull and facial features, growth deficiencies, underdeveloped nails of the fingers and toes, and/or mild developmental delays. Other findings occasionally associated with this syndrome include cleft lip and palate, having an abnormally small head (microcephaly) and brain malformations with more significant developmental delays. Treatment may include surgery for cleft lip and palate and special education and related services for children with learning delays. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Fetal hydantoin syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Fetal hydantoin syndrome? There is a wide range in the nature and severity of characteristics associated with fetal hydantoin syndrome. Of infants born to women who used phenytoin during pregnancy, 10-30% are reported to show some of the characteristics associated with this syndrome. Few infants exposed only to phenytoin have all of the characteristic that have been reported. Children with this condition may be small at birth, with increased hair on the body and face, and with poorly developed fingernails and toenails. They may also have poor muscle tone. Facial features that may be present with this syndrome include a flat bridge of the nose; an underdeveloped vertical groove in the center of the upper lip (philtrum); a large mouth; and malformed ears. Features specific to the eyes may include down-slanted eyes; widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism); crossed eyes (strabismus); drooping eyelids (ptosis); and/or epicanthal folds (skin folds of the eyelid covering the inner corner of the eye). Other features that have been reported include a short or webbed neck and low-set hair line. Growth deficiencies may include underdeveloped fingers and/or toes, malformed nails, as well as finger-like thumbs. These features are often associated with growth delay and varying degrees of developmental delay. The risk for an affected child to be neurologically impaired is estimated at 1 to 11 % (two to three times higher than for the general population). The risk of cleft lip and/or palate and heart defects is estimated to be about five times higher among exposed infants.

It is usually caused by a virus or bacteria. The parotid (in front of the ear) and submandibular (under the chin) glands are most commonly affected. Sialadenitis may be associated with pain, tenderness, redness, and gradual, localized swelling of the affected area. There are both acute and chronic forms. Although it is quite common among elderly adults with salivary gland stones, sialadenitis can also occur in other age groups, including infants during the first few weeks of life. Without proper treatment, sialadenitis can develop into a severe infection, especially in people who are debilitated or elderly."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Sialadenitis ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of sialadenitis?

Sialadenitis usually occurs after hyposecretion (reduced flow from the salivary glands) or duct obstruction, but may develop without an obvious cause. Saliva flow can be reduced in people who are sick or recovering from surgery, or people who are dehydrated, malnourished, or immunosuppressed. A stone or a kink in the salivary duct can also diminish saliva flow, as can certain medications (such as antihistamines, diuretics, psychiatric medications, beta-blockers, or barbiturates). It often occurs in chronically ill people with xerostomia (dry mouth), people with Sjogren syndrome, and in those who have had radiation therapy to the oral cavity. The most common causative organism in the infection is Staphylococcus aureus; others include streptococci, coliforms, and various anaerobic bacteria. Although less common than bacteria, several viruses have also been implicated in sialadenitis. These include the mumps virus, HIV, coxsackievirus, parainfluenza types I and II, influenza A, and herpes."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Sialadenitis ?","output":"How might sialadenitis be treated? The initial treatment for sialadenitis is antibiotics active against S. aureus. Hydration, ingesting things that trigger saliva flow (such as lemon juice or hard candy), warm compresses, gland massage, and good oral hygiene are also important. Abscesses need to be drained. Occasionally, in cases of chronic or relapsing sialadenitis, a superficial parotidectomy or submandibular gland excision is needed."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Cherubism ?","output":"Cherubism is a rare disorder characterized by abnormal bone tissue in the lower part of the face.

Cherubism is characterized by abnormal bone tissue in the lower part of the face. Beginning in early childhood, both the lower jaw (the mandible) and the upper jaw (the maxilla) become enlarged as bone is replaced with painless, cyst-like growths. These growths give the cheeks a swollen, rounded appearance and often interfere with normal tooth development. In some people the condition is very mild and barely noticeable, while in other cases are severe enough to cause problems with vision, breathing, speech, and swallowing. Enlargement of the jaw usually continues throughout childhood and stabilizes during puberty. The abnormal growths are gradually replaced with normal bone in early adulthood.

This process may occur weeks or even months after the infection has resolved. In addition to joint inflammation, reactive arthritis is associated with two other symptoms: redness and inflammation of the eyes (conjunctivitis) and inflammation of the urinary tract (urethritis). These symptoms may occur alone, together, or not at all. The symptoms of reactive arthritis usually last 3 to 12 months, although symptoms can return or develop into a long-term disease in a small percentage of people. The exact cause of reactive arthritis is unknown. It may follow an infection with Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, Shigella sonnei, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium, or Chlamydia trachomatis. Certain genes may make you more prone to the syndrome. For instance, the condition is observed more commonly in patients with human lymphocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) histocompatibility antigens.

Hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. A condition is X-linked if the responsible gene is located on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes (the other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome). Females have two X chromosomes in each cell and males have an X chromosome and a Y chromosome in each cell. Although females have two X chromosomes, one of the X chromosomes in each cell is \\"turned off\\" and all of the genes on that chromosome are inactivated. Females who have a change (mutation) in a gene on one of their X chromosomes are called carriers of the related condition. Carrier females usually do not have symptoms of the condition because the X chromosome with the mutated gene is often turned off and they have another X chromosome with a working copy of the gene. Sometimes, the X chromosome with the working copy of the gene is turned off, which may cause symptoms of the condition. However, females with symptoms are usually much more mildly affected than males. A male has only one X chromosome, so if he inherits a mutation on the X chromosome, he will have signs and symptoms (be affected). Males with an X-linked recessive condition always pass the mutated gene to all of their daughters, who will be carriers. A male cannot pass an X-linked gene to his sons because males always pass their Y chromosome to male offspring. Female carriers of an X-linked recessive condition have a 25% chance with each pregnancy to have a carrier daughter like themselves, a 25% chance to have a non-carrier daughter, a 25% chance to have an affected son, and a 25% chance to have an unaffected son.

People with Down syndrome may develop the following medical problems: Congenital hypothyroidism Hearing loss Congenital heart defects Seizures Vision disorders Decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) Children with Down syndrome are also more likely to develop chronic respiratory infections, middle ear infections, and recurrent tonsillitis. In addition, there is a higher incidence of pneumonia in children with Down syndrome than in the general population. Children with Down syndrome have developmental delay. They are often slow to turn over, sit, and stand. Developmental delay may be related to the child's weak muscle tone. Development of speech and language may also take longer than expected. Children with Down syndrome may take longer than other children to reach their developmental milestones, but many of these milestones will eventually be met. Adults with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease, a brain disorder that results in a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function.

There are 3 possible genetic causes of Down syndrome: Trisomy 21. Most often, Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome 21 in all cells of the affected person. In these cases, the chromosome 21 pair fails to separate during the formation of an egg (or sperm); this is called \\"nondisjunction.\\" When the egg with 2 copies of chromosome 21 unites with a normal sperm with one copy of chromosome 21 to form an embryo, the resulting embryo has 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. The extra chromosome is then copied in every cell of the baby's body, causing the features of Down syndrome. The cause of nondisjunction is unknown, but research has shown that it happens more often as women age. Nondisjunction is not known to be caused by anything in the environment or anything that parents do (or don't do) before or during pregnancy. Mosaic trisomy 21. In about 1-2% of cases, only some of the cells in a person's body have an extra chromosome 21; this is called \\"mosaic trisomy 21\\". In this situation, the fertilized egg may have the right number of chromosomes, but due to a cell division error early in the development of the embryo, some cells \\"acquire\\" an extra chromosome 21. A person with mosaic trisomy 21 typically has 46 chromosomes in some cells, and 47 chromosomes (with the extra chromosome 21) in others. The features and severity in people with mosaic trisomy 21 may vary widely. Translocation trisomy 21. About 3-4% of people with Down syndrome have cells that contain 46 chromosomes; however, there is extra chromosome 21 material attached (translocated ) onto another chromosome. For parents of a child with Down syndrome due to a translocation, there may be an increased chance of Down syndrome in future pregnancies. This is because one of the two parents may be a carrier of a balanced translocation. However, not all parents of people with translocation trisomy 21 have a translocation. Regardless of the type of Down syndrome a person has, all people with Down syndrome have an extra, critical portion of chromosome 21 present in all or some of their cells. This extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Down syndrome ?","output":"How is Down syndrome diagnosed? Down syndrome may be suspected and/or diagnosed during pregnancy, or after a child is born. During pregnancy, a woman can opt to have specific tests that may either screen for, or diagnosis, Down syndrome in a fetus. A screening test poses no risks to the fetus and can determine the likelihood that a fetus has Down syndrome. It may show that a fetus is at an increased risk to be affected, but cannot determine whether it is definitely affected. Screening tests for Down syndrome may involve different types of blood tests for the mother and/or specific types of ultrasounds that can detect features more common in fetuses with Down syndrome (called markers). Depending on the type of screening tests a woman has, they may be done during the 1st trimester, the 2nd trimester, or both. If a screening test shows an increased risk for Down syndrome, a woman may then choose to have a diagnostic test. Diagnostic tests during pregnancy can determine with certainty whether a fetus has Down syndrome, but they are invasive and carry a slight risk of miscarriage. Examples of diagnostic tests include chorionic villus sampling in the 1st trimester and amniocentesis in the 2nd trimester. During these tests, a small sample of genetic material is obtained from the amniotic fluid or placenta, and the fetus' chromosomes are then analyzed in a laboratory. In recent years, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has become available to women who are at increased risk to have a baby with Down syndrome. NIPT is a blood test that examines DNA from the fetus in the mother's bloodstream. However, women who have a positive NIPT result should then have invasive diagnostic testing to confirm the result. People with questions about the different options for prenatal screening or diagnostic testing should speak with a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor can discuss the benefits, limitations and risks of each test, and help each person decide which test (if any) is best for them. If a diagnosis of Down syndrome is not made prenatally, the diagnosis can be made in the newborn. Down syndrome may be suspected if a newborn has characteristic physical features of the condition. The diagnosis can then be confirmed by obtaining a karyotype (a blood test to look at a picture of the newborn's chromosomes)."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Down syndrome ?","output":"How might Down syndrome be treated? Early intervention services, quality educational programs, a stimulating home environment, good health care, and positive support from family and friends can help people with Down syndrome develop to their full potential. The overall goal of treatment is to boost cognition by improving learning, memory, and speech. Other treatments depend on the specific health problems or complications present in each affected person.

Treatment may involve the use of glucocorticoids and/or other immunosuppressive therapies."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Churg Strauss syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Churg Strauss syndrome? The specific signs and symptoms of Churg Strauss syndrome (CSS) vary from person to person depending on the organ systems involved. The severity, duration and age of onset also vary. CSS is considered to have three distinct phases - prodromal (allergic), eosinophilic and vasculitic - which don't always occur sequentially. Some people do not develop all three phases. The prodromal (or allergic) phase is characterized by various allergic reactions. Affected people may develop asthma (including a cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath); hay fever (allergic rhinitis); and/or repeated episodes of sinusitis. This phase can last from months to many years. Most people develop asthma-like symptoms before any other symptoms. The eosinophilic phase is characterized by accumulation of eosinophils (a specific type of white blood cell) in various tissues of the body - especially the lungs, gastrointestinal tract and skin. The vasculitic phase is characterized by widespread inflammation of various blood vessels (vasculitis). Chronic vasculitis can cause narrowing of blood vessels, which can block or slow blood flow to organs. Inflamed blood vessels can also become thin and fragile (potentially rupturing) or develop a bulge (aneurysm). People with CSS often develop nonspecific symptoms including fatigue, fever, weight loss, night sweats, abdominal pain, and/or joint and muscle pain. Neurological symptoms (such as pain, tingling or numbness) are common and depend on the specific nerves involved. About half of affected people develop skin abnormalities due to accumulation of eosinophils in skin tissue. Symptoms of skin involvement may include purplish skin lesions, a rash with hives, and/or small bumps, especially on the elbows. Gastrointestinal involvement may cause various symptoms also. Heart problems may include inflammation of heart tissues and in severe cases, heart failure. The kidneys can also become involved, eventually causing glomerulonephritis.

Mutations (changes) in the FMR1 gene cause fragile X syndrome (FXS). This gene carries instructions to make a protein called the fragile X mental retardation 1 protein. The FMR1 gene contains a section of DNA called a CGG triplet repeat, which normally repeats from 5 to around 40 times. In most cases of FXS, this section of DNA is repeated more than 200 times, which \\"turns off\\" the FMR1 gene and disrupts the function of the nervous system. In a small portion of cases, other types of changes in the FMR1 gene cause FXS. These changes may involve a deletion of all or part of the gene, or a change in the building blocks (amino acids) used to make the gene's protein. People with 55 to 200 repeats of the CGG segment are said to have an FMR1 premutation. Most people with a premutation are intellectually normal. In some cases, people with a premutation have lower levels of the gene's protein and may have some mild symptoms of FXS. About 20% of women with a premutation have premature ovarian failure, and some people with a premutation have an increased risk of developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)."},{"instruction":"Fragile X syndrome inherited ?","output":"How is fragile X syndrome inherited? Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. A condition is X-linked if the responsible gene is located on the X chromosome. The inheritance is dominant if having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene is enough to cause symptoms of the condition. In women who carry an FMR1 gene premutation (approximately 55 to 200 CGG repeats), the repeats can expand to more than 200 repeats in their cells that develop into eggs. This means that women with a premutation (or a full mutation) have an increased risk to have a child with FXS. The size of the risk corresponds to the number of CGG repeats they have. By contrast, men with premutations are not at risk for the repeats expanding to over 200 when passing the gene to offspring. However, men with a premutation will pass the premutation on to all of their daughters and none of their sons. This is because boys receive only a Y chromosome from their fathers."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Fragile X syndrome ?","output":"Is genetic testing available for fragile X syndrome?

The X-linked form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome is caused by mutations in the MID1 gene. The MID1 gene provides instructions for making a specific protein called midline-1. This protein helps regulate the function of microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). Microtubules help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the movement of cells (cell migration). The MID1 gene is a member of a group of genes called the TRIM (tripartite motif) family. The proteins produced from this large family of genes are involved in many cellular activities. Primarily, TRIM proteins play a role in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins. As part of its protein degrading function, midline-1 is responsible for recycling certain proteins, including phosphatase 2A (PP2A), integrin alpha-4 (ITGA4), and serine/threonine-protein kinase 36 (STK36). The recycling of these three proteins so they can be reused instead of broken down is essential because they are needed for normal cellular functioning. Mutations in the MID1 gene lead to a decrease in midline-1 function, which prevents this protein recycling. As a result, certain proteins are not recycled, and they accumulate in cells. This buildup impairs microtubule function, resulting in problems with cell division and migration. Researchers speculate that the altered midline-1 protein affects how the cells divide and migrate along the midline of the body during development, resulting in the features of Opitz G/BBB syndrome. Some people who have a family history of X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome have no detectable MID1 mutation. The reason for this is not yet known, although some researchers have suggested the involvement of other unknown genes. The autosomal dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome is caused by a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22, specifically 22q11.2, which is why researchers consider this condition to be part of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. It is not yet known which deleted gene(s) within this region of chromosome 22 specifically cause the signs and symptoms of Opitz G/BBB syndrome. In others with autosomal dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome, the cause is related to a mutation in the SPECCIL gene. Click on the gene name to learn more about its role in the development of this condition."},{"instruction":"Opitz G/BBB syndrome inherited ?","output":"How is Opitz G/BBB syndrome inherited? Opitz G/BBB syndrome often has an X-linked pattern of inheritance. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes (the other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome). In most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. This is because females have two different X chromosomes in each cell, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons, because fathers only pass a Y chromosome on to their sons (which is what makes them male). In some cases, an affected person inherits a MID1 mutation from an affected parent, while in other cases, it may result from a new mutation in the affected individual. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A female who has the X-linked form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have a daughter with the mutation, a 25% chance to have a son with the mutation, a 25% chance to have an unaffected daughter, and a 25% chance to have an unaffected son. This also means that there is a 50% chance, with each pregnancy, for the child to inherit the mutation. A male with the X-linked dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome will pass the mutation on to all of his daughters and none of his sons. Researchers have also described an autosomal dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome caused by a deletion in one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a deleted segment from a parent, while in other cases, the condition results from a new deletion in the affected individual. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Males and females with the autosomal dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome usually have the same degree of severity of symptoms. A male or female who has the autosomal dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome has a 50% (1 in 2) chance with each pregnancy for the child (male or female) to inherit the genetic abnormality."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Opitz G/BBB syndrome ?","output":"How is Opitz G/BBB syndrome diagnosed? The diagnosis of Opitz G/BBB syndrome is usually based on clinical findings.

The skin in the affected area often looks normal but may be pale, shiny or mildly scarred. Approximately half of all affected people experience loss of eyebrows, as well. Less commonly, the eyelashes may also be involved. Some people with FFA develop hair loss in areas other than the scalp and face.

People with hypercholesterolemia have a high risk of developing a form of heart disease called coronary artery disease, as well as health problems related to the buildup of excess cholesterol in other tissues (e.g., in the tendons and skin). Familial hypercholesterolemia tends to be passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion. There are other hereditary forms of hypercholesterolemia caused by mutations in the APOB, LDLRAP1, or PCSK9 gene. However, most cases of high cholesterol are not caused by a single inherited condition, but result from a combination of lifestyle choices and the effects of variations in many genes."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Familial hypercholesterolemia ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Familial hypercholesterolemia? Signs and symptoms in individuals with the autosomal dominant form of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), also called the heterozygous form, may include: Men who have FH may have heart attacks in their 40s to 50s, and 85% of men with the disorder have a heart attack by age 60. Affected women may have heart attacks in their 50s and 60s. Individuals with the rare, autosomal recessive form of FH (also called homozygous FH) develop xanthomas beneath the skin over their elbows, knees and buttocks as well as in the tendons at a very early age, sometime in infancy.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (in which case it is referred to as heterozygous FH). Individuals inherit two copies of each gene (one from each parent). In an autosomal dominant condition, having only one abnormal (mutated) copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the condition. In most cases the mutated gene is inherited from an affected parent, but it is possible for the mutation to occur for the first time in the affected individual. An individual with an autosomal dominant condition has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to pass the mutation on to each of his/her children and a 50% chance to not pass on the mutation. More rarely, familial FH may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This occurs when an individual inherits a mutated copy of the gene from both parents (this is also called homozygous FH). This is a much more severe form of FH. An individual with this form of FH will always pass on a mutated copy of the gene, and therefore each of his/her children will have heterozygous FH."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Familial hypercholesterolemia ?","output":"How might familial hypercholesterolemia be treated? The overall goal of treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is to lower the risk for atherosclerosis (build-up of plaque in the arteries) by lowering the LDL cholesterol levels in the blood stream. The first step in treatment for individuals with the heterozygous form (also called the autosomal dominant form) is changing the diet to reduce the total amount of fat eaten. This may be accomplished by limiting the amount of beef, pork, and lamb in the diet; cutting out butter, whole milk, fatty cheeses and oils; and eliminating egg yolks, organ meats and other sources of saturated fat from animals. Dietary counseling is often recommended to help individuals change their eating habits. Exercise and weight loss may also help in lowering cholesterol levels. Drug therapy is also often necessary lifestyle changes may not be enough to lower cholesterol levels. Several different cholesterol-lowering medications may be used alone or in combination; they may include statins, bile acid sequestrants, ezetemibe, niacin, gemfibrozil, and fenofibrate. Individuals with the more severe, homozygous form of FH (also called the autosomal recessive form) need more aggressive therapies to treat their significantly elevated levels of cholesterol. Drug therapy is often not effective enough at lowering LDL cholesterol levels. Therefore, individuals with this form may need periodical LDL apheresis, a procedure that removes LDL from the blood. In some cases, major surgery such as a liver transplant is necessary."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Froelich syndrome ?","output":"Froelich syndrome is characterized by obesity and hypogonadism due to a hypothalamic-pituitary disorder.

These disease have features of both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders. In myelodysplastic diseases, the blood stem cells do not mature into healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets and as a result, there are fewer of these healthy cells. In myeloproliferative diseases, a greater than normal number of blood stem cells develop into one or more types of blood cells and the total number of blood cells slowly increases. The 3 main types of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML); juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML); and atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia (aCML). When a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease does not match any of these types, it is called myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-UC). Symptoms of CMML and JMML may include fever, feeling tired and weight loss. Symptoms of aCML may include easy bruising or bleeding and feeling tired or weak.

Treatment depends on the cause of the condition (if known) but often includes transfusions for individuals who are severely anemic and have cardiorespiratory failure."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Acquired pure red cell aplasia ?","output":"How might acquired pure red cell aplasia be treated? The main goals of treatment for pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) are to restore the production of red blood cells, maintain adequate hemoglobin levels, and treat underlying disorders that may be causing the condition. The initial treatment plan typically includes blood transfusions for individuals who are severely anemic and have cardiorespiratory failure. PRCA due to medication or infections is usually reversible within a few months. Therefore, medications that may be causing the condition should be discontinued, and infections that may cause the condition should be treated. Underlying conditions that may cause PRCA such as a thymoma, hematological cancers, solid tumors, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should be treated as necessary as well. When the condition is idiopathic (of unknown cause) or due to an autoimmune disorder, PRCA is typically initially treated with corticosteroids. It has been reported that individuals who seem to be resistant to treatment may respond to a single course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG,) while others have responded to a single dose. In the United States, financial issues may make it difficult to obtain this treatment because IVIG is expensive and is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat PRCA.

The exact cause of Ewing sarcoma remains largely unknown. Chromosomal studies have found that Ewing sarcoma cells are often characterized by an abnormal change in their genetic makeup known as a reciprocal translocation. The most common mutation, occurring in approximately 85% of Ewing sarcoma tumors, involves two genes, the EWSR1 gene on chromosome 22 and the FLI1 gene on chromosome 11. This rearrangement of genetic material between chromosomes 22 and 11 fuses part of the EWSR1 gene with part of the FLI1 gene, creating the EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene. This mutation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in tumor cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited. In extremely rare cases, Ewing sarcoma may develop as a second malignancy, which means that the condition develops as a late-onset complication of earlier treatment for another form of cancer."},{"instruction":"Ewing sarcoma inherited ?","output":"Is Ewing sarcoma an inherited condition? This condition is generally not inherited but arises from a mutation in the body's cells that occurs after conception (somatic mutation). Most cases are considered to be sporadic. However, the incidence of neuroectodermal and stomach malignancies is increased among family members of patients with tumors of the Ewing sarcoma family.

Galactosialidosis is caused by mutations in the CTSA gene. The CTSA gene provides instructions for making a protein called cathepsin A, which is active in cellular compartments called lysosomes. These compartments contain enzymes that digest and recycle materials when they are no longer needed. Cathepsin A works together with two enzymes, neuraminidase 1 and beta-galactosidase, to form a protein complex. This complex breaks down sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins) or fats (glycolipids). Cathepsin A is also found on the cell surface, where it forms a complex with neuraminidase 1 and a protein called elastin binding protein. Elastin binding protein plays a role in the formation of elastic fibers, a component of the connective tissues that form the body's supportive framework. CTSA mutations interfere with the normal function of cathepsin A. Most mutations disrupt the protein structure of cathepsin A, impairing its ability to form complexes with neuraminidase 1, beta-galactosidase, and elastin binding protein. As a result, these other enzymes are not functional, or they break down prematurely. Galactosialidosis belongs to a large family of lysosomal storage disorders, each caused by the deficiency of a specific lysosomal enzyme or protein. In galactosialidosis, impaired functioning of cathepsin A and other enzymes causes certain substances to accumulate in the lysosomes."},{"instruction":"Galactosialidosis inherited ?","output":"How is galactosialidosis inherited? Galactosialidosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Galactosialidosis ?","output":"How might galactosialidosis be treated? There is no cure for galactosialidosis. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive; for example, taking medication to control seizures. Individuals with galactosialidosis are encouraged to routinely see their genetic counselors, neurological, ophthalmological, and other specialists as symptoms arise and to keep symptoms controlled. Bone marrow transplant is under investigation as an experimental therapy. No conclusive results are currently available regarding the long term benefits of this treatment."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Hypomandibular faciocranial dysostosis ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Hypomandibular faciocranial dysostosis?

The condition can be mild or severe. People with mild protein C deficiency are at risk for a type of clot called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A DVT can travel through the bloodstream and become stuck in the lung, which can cause a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Most people with mild protein C deficiency never develop abnormal blood clots, but certain factors can increase the risk to develop a blood clot. In severe protein C deficiency, affected infants develop a life-threatening blood clotting disorder called purpura fulminans soon after birth. This is characterized by blood clots that block normal blood flow and can lead to death of body tissues (necrosis). Abnormal bleeding can occur in various parts of the body causing purple patches on the skin. Protein C deficiency may be inherited or acquired. The inherited form is caused by mutations in the PROC gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most people with protein C deficiency do not have any symptoms and require no specific treatment. However, in situations of clot risk such as pregnancy, surgery or trauma, prevention treatment may be indicated. Patients with the severe form of the disease are treated depending on the symptoms. A protein C concentrate is effective in many cases.

Protein C deficiency can be inherited or acquired later in life. Inherited protein C deficiency is caused by mutations in the gene that provides instructions for making protein C, called the PROC gene. These mutations disrupt the protein's ability to control blood clotting. If protein C cannot control blood clotting, abnormal blood clots may form.

A diagnosis of protein C deficiency might be suspected in someone with a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism, especially if it occurs in a relatively young person (less than 50 years old) or has formed in an unusual location, such as the veins leading to the liver or kidney or the blood vessels of the brain. Laboratory tests are usually be done to look at the function or quantity of protein C in the blood. Functional tests are usually ordered, along with other tests for abnormal blood clotting, to screen for normal activity of protein C. Based on those results, concentrations of protein C may be measured to look for decreased production due to an acquired or inherited condition and to classify the type of deficiency. If the shortage of protein C is due to an inherited genetic change, the quantity of protein C available and the degree of activity can be used to help determine whether a person is heterozygous or homozygous for the mutation. Genetic testing is not necessary to make a diagnosis."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Protein C deficiency ?","output":"How might protein C deficiency be treated? Most people with mild protein C deficiency never develop abnormal blood clots and thus do not require treatment. However, people who have experienced a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism are usually treated with blood-thinning drugs such as heparin or warfarin, which help to prevent another blood clot from developing in the future. Preventative treatment with these blood-thinning drugs may also be considered in those with a family history of blood clotting, as well as in higher risk situations such as pregnancy. A protein C concentrate (Ceprotin) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2007 for the treatment of protein C deficiency. High doses of intravenous protein C concentrates can help thin the blood and protect from blood clots. It can also be used a preventative treatment against blood clots during surgery, pregnancy delivery, prolonged immobility, or overwhelming infection in the blood stream (sepsis). Currently, no guidelines exist as to which patients should receive protein C concentrate. It is typically given only at times of increased risk for clotting, or when the blood thinner heparin by itself cannot be safely given because it would lead to an increased risk for bleeding. However, in those with severe protein C who have had severe bleeding complications on long-term blood thinning therapy, protein C concentrate has been used on a regular basis."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of BardetBiedl syndrome 6 ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Bardet-Biedl syndrome 6?

It is important to discuss this information with your health care provider, such as a genetic counselor, to accurately determine a person's risk for passing on this disorder."},{"instruction":"What is (are) FitzHughCurtis syndrome ?","output":"Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS) is a condition in which a woman has swelling of the tissue covering the liver as a result of having pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Symptoms most often include pain in the upper right abdomen just below the ribs, fever, nausea, or vomiting. The symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease - pain in the lower abdomen and vaginal discharge - are often present as well. FHCS is usually caused by an infection of chlamydia or gonorrhea that leads to PID; it is not known why PID progresses to FHCS in some women. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is treated with antibiotics."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for FitzHughCurtis syndrome ?","output":"How might Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome be treated? Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS) is treated with antibiotics, given by intravenous (IV) injection or as medication taken by mouth. The specific antibiotic medication is determined by the type of underlying infection; that is, treatment depends on whether the infection is chlamydia or gonorrhea. If pain continues after treatment with antibiotics, surgery (laparoscopy) may be done to remove bands of tissue (adhesions) that connect the liver to the abdominal wall and cause pain in individuals with FHCS."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Temporal epilepsy, familial ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Temporal epilepsy, familial?

There are inherited and non-inherited (acquired) causes of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). There are five subtypes of inherited HLH which are designated familial HLH, types 1-5. Each subtype is caused by a change (mutation) in a different gene that helps regulate the immune system. The genetic cause of familial HLH, type 1 is currently unknown. Familial HLH, type 2 is caused by mutations in the PRF1 gene. Familial HLH, type 3 is caused by mutations in the UNC13D gene. Familial HLH, type 4 is caused by mutations in the STX11 gene. Familial HLH, type 5 is caused by mutations in the STXBP2 gene. All of the genes that cause HLH serve as the instructions for proteins that help destroy or turn off activated immune cells that are no longer needed. Changes in these genes lead to an overproduction of immune cells which results in an excessive immune response and the many signs and symptoms of familial HLH. The acquired causes of HLH include: infection, medications that suppress the immune system, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, certain types of cancer and/or metabolic diseases."},{"instruction":"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis inherited ?","output":"Is hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis inherited? Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) may be inherited or acquired (due to non-genetic factors). Familial HLH is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a change (mutation) in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. Acquired HLH is not inherited. The non-genetic causes of HLH include: infection, medications that suppress the immune system, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, certain types of cancer and/or metabolic diseases."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ?","output":"Is genetic testing available for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis? Yes. Clinical genetic testing is available for the four genes known to cause familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, types 2-5. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the two disease-causing mutations in the family are known. Molecular genetic testing is not available for familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, type 1 because the genetic cause is currently unknown. Genetic testing is not available for acquired HLH because it is caused by non-genetic factors. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. How is hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis diagnosed? A diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is based on the presence of certain signs and symotoms. A person is considered affected by this condition if they have at least five of the following symptoms: Fever Enlarged spleen Cytopenia (lower-than-normal number of blood cells) Elevated levels of triglycerides or fibrinogen in the blood Hemophagocytosis (the destruction of certain types of blood cells by histiocytes) on bone marrow, spleen or lymph node biopsy Decreased or absent NK cell activity High levels of ferritin in the blood Elevated blood levels of CD25 (a measure of prolonged immune cell activation) The diagnosis of familial HLH, types 2-5 can be confirmed with genetic testing."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ?","output":"How might hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis be treated? The best treatment options for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are determined by a number of factors, including the severity of symptoms, the age of onset, and the underlying cause of the condition. In acquired HLH, it is often necessary to treat the underlying condition. For example, antiobiotics or antiviral medications can be used to treat or prevent infections that may have triggered the exaggerated immune response. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is considered a cure for familial HLH. It is often recommended that people with confirmed or suspected familial HLH undergo this treatment as early in life as possible. Prior to hematopoietic cell transplanation, affected people are usually treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy to destroy excess immune cells which can lead to life-threatening inflammation."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Vohwinkel syndrome ?","output":"Vohwinkel syndrome is an inherited condition that affects the skin.

It affects the thin layer of cells that line the back part of the cornea. This layer is called the endothelium. The disease occurs when these cells slowly start to die off. The cells help pump excess fluid out of the cornea. As more and more cells are lost, fluid begins to build up in the cornea, causing swelling and a cloudy cornea. There are several forms of the disease according to the age of onset of the symptoms and the cause. The early-onset form is very rare and is known as Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 1 (or early-onset Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy) and it is caused by a change (mutation) in the COL8A2 gene. Late-onset Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophies are common and include: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 2 (caused by a mutation in an unknown gene located in chromosome 13) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 3 (may be caused by TCF4 gene mutations) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 4 (caused by a mutation in the SLC4A11 gene) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 5 (caused by a mutation in an unknown gene located in chromosome 15) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 6 (caused by a mutation in the ZEB1 gene) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 7 (caused by a mutation in an unknown gene located in chromosome 9) Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 8 (caused by heterozygous mutation in the AGBL1 gene). Early in the disease, patients typically do not have symptoms. In the late-onset forms, the symptoms start around 50 or 60 years and include discomfort and painful episodes of recurrent corneal wounds and hazy vision. Over time, discomfort may diminish but severe impairment of visual acuity, and even blindness and cataracts in elderly patients, may be observed. Once the vision has worsened, the recommended treatment is a penetrating graft which has excellent results in most cases."},{"instruction":"Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy inherited ?","output":"How is Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy inherited? The inheritance of Fuchs dystrophy is not straight forward. In some cases, Fuchs dystrophy appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. When this condition is caused by a mutation in the COL8A2 gene (which is the early-onset form of the disease), it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In addition, an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern is seen in some situations in which the condition is caused by changes in an unknown gene. However, in many cases, the inheritance pattern is unknown. Some cases result from new mutations in a gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

A variation in the ITPKC gene has been associated with an increased risk of developing Kawasaki syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate 3-kinase C. This enzyme helps limit the activity of immune system cells called T cells, which identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection. Reducing the activity of T cells when appropriate prevents the overproduction of immune proteins called cytokines that lead to inflammation and can, when present in large quantities, can cause tissue damage. Researchers believe that variations in the ITPKC gene may interfere with the body's ability to reduce T cell activity, leading to inflammation that damages blood vessels and results in the symptoms of this disease. It is likely that other factors, including changes in additional genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder. What causes Kawasaki syndrome? The cause of Kawasaki syndrome isn't known. The body's response to a virus or infection combined with genetic factors may cause the disease. However, no specific virus or infection has been found, and the role of genetics is not well understood.

Treatment is currently symptomatic and supportive."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of GM1 gangliosidosis ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of GM1 gangliosidosis? There are three general types of GM1 gangliosidosis, which differ in severity but can have considerable overlap of signs and symptoms. Classic infantile (type 1) GM1 gangliosidosis is the most severe type, with onset shortly after birth (usually within 6 months of age). Affected infants typically appear normal until onset, but developmental regression (loss of acquired milestones) eventually occurs. Signs and symptoms may include neurodegeneration, seizures, liver and spleen enlargement, coarsening of facial features, skeletal irregularities, joint stiffness, a distended abdomen, muscle weakness, an exaggerated startle response to sound, and problems with gait (manner of walking). About half of people with this type develop cherry-red spots in the eye. Children may become deaf and blind by one year of age. Affected children typically do not live past 2 years of age. Juvenile (type 2) GM1 gangliosidosis is considered an intermediate form of the condition and may begin between the ages of 1 and 5. Features include ataxia, seizures, dementia, and difficulties with speech. This type progresses more slowly than type 1, but still causes decreased life expectancy (around mid-childhood or early adulthood). Adult (type 3) GM1 gangliosidosis may cause signs and symptoms to develop anywhere between the ages of 3 and 30. Affected people may have muscle atrophy, corneal clouding and dystonia. Non-cancerous skin blemishes may develop on the lower part of the trunk of the body. Adult GM1 is usually less severe and progresses more slowly than other forms of the condition.

All three types of GM1 gangliosidosis are caused by mutations (changes) in the GLB1 gene. This gene gives the body instructions to make an enzyme called beta-galactosidase (-galactosidase), which plays an important role in the brain. The enzyme resides in compartments within cells called lysosomes, where it helps break down certain molecules, including a substance called GM1 ganglioside. GM1 ganglioside is important for nerve cell function in the brain. Mutations in the GLB1 gene may lower or eliminate the activity of the -galactosidase enzyme, keeping GM1 ganglioside from being broken down. As a result, it accumulates to toxic levels in tissues and organs, particularly in the brain. This accumulation leads to the destruction of nerve cells, causing the features of the condition. In general, people with higher enzyme activity levels usually have milder features than those with lower activity levels."},{"instruction":"GM1 gangliosidosis inherited ?","output":"How is GM1 gangliosidosis inherited? GM1 gangliosidosis is a hereditary condition that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has: a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent a 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier GM1 gangliosidosis is type-specific within families. This means that people with a family history of the condition are generally only at increased risk for the specific type of GM1 gangliosidosis in the family."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose GM1 gangliosidosis ?","output":"Is genetic testing available for GM1 gangliosidosis? Yes. A diagnosis of GM1 gangliosidosis (GM1), can be made by either enzyme analysis of the beta-galactosidase enzyme, or by molecular genetic testing of the GLB1 gene. Despite the availability of molecular genetic testing, the mainstay of diagnosis will likely continue to be enzyme activity because of cost and difficulty in interpreting unclear results. However, enzyme activity may not be predictive of carrier status in relatives of affected people. Carrier testing for at-risk family members is done with molecular genetic testing, and is possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family are already known. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the labs that offer genetic testing for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Therefore, patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for GM1 gangliosidosis ?","output":"How might GM1 gangliosidosis be treated? There is currently no effective medical treatment for GM1 gangliosidosis. Symptomatic treatment for some of the neurologic signs and symptoms is available, but does not significantly alter the progression of the condition. For example, anticonvulsants may initially control seizures. Supportive treatments may include proper nutrition and hydration, and keeping the affected individual's airway open. Bone marrow transplantation was reportedly successful in an individual with infantile/juvenile GM1 gangliosidosis; however, no long-term benefit was reported. Presymptomatic cord-blood hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation has been advocated by some as a possible treatment due to its success in other lysosomal storage disorders. Active research in the areas of enzyme replacement and gene therapy for the condition is ongoing but has not yet advanced to human trials.

They will also have problems with the flow of bile from the liver (cholestasis) and too much iron in their blood. Affected individuals arent typically born with unique physical features. Although alkali therapy is used as treatment, about half of affected infants do not survive past the first days of life. Those that do survive this period generally do not live past 4 months despite receiving treatment.

It is deadly if not treated immediately."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of WaterhouseFriderichsen syndrome ?","output":"What are the symptoms of Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome? Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome is characterized by the abrupt onset of fever, petechiae, septic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) followed by acute hemorrhagic necrosis of the adrenal glands and severe cardiovascular dysfunction. Patients often experience prodromic, nonspecific symptoms, including malaise, headache, weakness, dizziness, cough, arthralgia (joint pain), and myalgia (muscle pain). A characteristic skin rash with a typical evolution occurs in approximately 75% of patients with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. In its early stages, the rash consists of small, pink macules or papules. These are rapidly followed by petechial lesions, which gradually transform into large, purpuric, coalescent plaques in late stages of the disease."},{"instruction":"What causes WaterhouseFriderichsen syndrome ?","output":"What causes Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome? Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome is most often associated with meningococcal disease (accounts for 80% of cases). The syndrome also has been associated with other bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (group B), Salmonella choleraesuis, Pasteurella multocida, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Plesiomonas shigelloides. It may also be associated with a history of splenectomy. In rare cases, it may be caused by the use of medications that promote blood clotting, low platelet counts, primary antiphospholipid syndrome, renal vein thrombosis or steroid use. While the exact mechanism of disease is not clear, activation of several cytokine mediators appears to lead to sepsis and shock."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for WaterhouseFriderichsen syndrome ?","output":"How might Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome be treated?

The onset, severity and specific physical findings vary depending upon the specific type of NA present. Signs and symptoms usually include chorea (involuntary, dance-like movements), involuntary movements of the face and tongue, progressive cognitive impairment, muscle weakness, seizures and behavioral or personality changes. NA syndromes typically progress to cause serious, disabling complications and are usually fatal. NA is inherited, but the disease-causing gene and inheritance pattern varies for each type. Although there is some disagreement in the medical literature about what disorders should be classified as forms of NA, four distinct disorders are usually classified as the \\"core\\" NA syndromes - chorea-acanthocytosis, McLeod syndrome, Huntington's disease-like 2 and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN)."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Neuroacanthocytosis ?","output":"How might neuroacanthocytosis be treated? There is currently no cure for neuroacanthocytosis. Management generally focuses on the specific symptoms that are present in each individual and may require the coordination of various specialists. Psychiatric symptoms and chorea may be treated with certain antipsychotic medications known as dopamine-receptor blocking drugs. Other antipsychotic medications as well as antidepressants and/or sedatives may also be used to treat some affected individuals. Seizures may be treated with anti-convulsants, which may also help to treat psychiatric symptoms. Anti-seizure medications that can can worsen involuntary movements are generally avoided. Dystonia has been treated with botulinum toxin to relax the muscles and reduce spasms. Because of feeding difficulties in some cases, individuals may need to have their nutrition monitored. Nutritional support, supplementation and/or a feeding tube may be necessary in some cases. Additional therapies that may be used to treat affected individuals may include speech therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy. Mechanical devices, such as braces or a wheelchair, may benefit some people. Computer-assisted speech devices may be necessary in some cases.

Kidney disease typically begins in the first few months of life, often leading to kidney failure in childhood. In addition, up to 90 percent of people with this condition develop a rare form of kidney cancer known as Wilms tumor. Males with Denys-Drash syndrome have gonadal dysgenesis, a condition in which the external genitalia do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia) or the genitalia appear to be completely female. The testes are also undescended, meaning that they remain in the pelvis, abdomen, or groin. Affected females usually have normal genitalia. For this reason, females with this condition may be diagnosed with isolated nephrotic syndrome. Denys-Drash syndrome is caused by mutations in the WT1 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

Denys-Drash syndrome is caused by mutations in the WT1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein (the WT1 protein) that regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA. The WT1 protein plays a role in the development of the kidneys and gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males) before birth. The WT1 gene mutations that cause Denys-Drash syndrome lead to the production of an abnormal protein that cannot bind to DNA. As a result, the activity of certain genes is unregulated, which impairs the development of the kidneys and reproductive organs. Abnormal development of these organs leads to diffuse glomerulosclerosis (where scar tissue forms throughout glomeruli, the tiny blood vessels in the kidney that filter waste from blood) and gonadal dysgenesis, which are characteristic features of Denys-Drash syndrome. The abnormal gene activity caused by the loss of normal WT1 protein also increases the risk of developing Wilms tumor in affected individuals."},{"instruction":"DenysDrash syndrome inherited ?","output":"Is Denys-Drash syndrome inherited?

Cutaneous mastocytosis is a form of mastocytosis that primarily affects the skin. There are three main forms that vary in severity: maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (also called urticaria pigmentosa), solitary cutaneous mastocytoma, and diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis. There is also an exteremely rare form called telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans. Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis, the most common form of cutaneous mastocytosis, is characterized by itchy, brown patches on the skin. Although these patches may be mistaken for freckles or bug bites initially, they typically persist and gradually increase in number over several months to years. In young children, the patches may form a blister if itched or rubbed. Itching may worsen with changes in temperature, strenuous activity, emotional stress, and/or certain medications. Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis is most commonly seen in infants and young children and often fades by the teenaged years. In some cases, this condition may not develop until adulthood. These later onset cases generally last long-term and are more likely to progress to systemic mastocytosis. Solitary cutaneous mastocytoma is a localized form of cutaneous mastocytosis. Like maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis, this form is typically diagnosed in young children. However, it is characterized by an itchy area of reddish or brown skin that is often thickened. When itched, these patches of skin may swell, redden, and/or blister. This form typically resolves spontaneously with age. Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, the most severe form of cutaneous mastocytosis, usually develops in infancy. Unlike the other forms of cutaneous mastocytosis, it affects most or all of the skin rather than appearing as distinct patches. In people affected by this condition, the skin is leathery and thickened. It may appear normal, yellowish-brown, or red in color. In some cases, there may also be widespread blistering. Additional symptoms may include hypotension, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, reddening of the skin (flushing), and anaphylactic shock. The rarest form of cutaneous mastocytosis is called telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans. Unlike the other forms of cutaneous mastocytosis, this form is primarily diagnosed in adults and is generally not associated with pruritus and blistering. People affected by this condition have persistent brown patches of skin and extensive telegiactasia. Rarely, this form may progress to systemic mastocytosis. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Cutaneous mastocytosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."},{"instruction":"What causes Cutaneous mastocytosis ?","output":"What causes cutaneous mastocytosis? Most cases of cutaneous mastocytosis are caused by changes (mutations) in the KIT gene. This gene encodes a protein that helps control many important cellular processes such as cell growth and division; survival; and movement. This protein is also important for the development of certain types of cells, including mast cells (immune cells that are important for the inflammatory response). Certain mutations in the KIT gene can leads to an overproduction of mast cells. In cutaneous mastocytosis, excess mast cells accumulate in the skin, leading to the many signs and symptoms of the condition."},{"instruction":"Cutaneous mastocytosis inherited ?","output":"Is cutaneous mastocytosis inherited? Most cases of cutaneous mastocytosis are not inherited. They occur spontaneously in families with no history of the condition and are due to somatic changes (mutations) in the KIT gene. Somatic mutations occur after conception and are only present in certain cells. Because they are not present in the germ cells (egg and sperm), they are not passed on to the next generation. Cutaneous mastocytosis can rarely affect more than one family member. In these cases, the condition is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. A person with familial cutaneous mastocytosis has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Cutaneous mastocytosis ?","output":"How is cutaneous mastocytosis diagnosed? A diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis is typically suspected based on the presence of suspicious signs and symptoms. A skin biopsy that reveals a high number of mast cells (immune cells that are important for the inflammatory response) confirms the diagnosis. Unfortunately it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate cutaneous mastocytosis from systemic mastocytosis. Additional tests may, therefore, be ordered to further investigate the risk for systemic disease. A bone marrow biopsy and specialized blood tests may be recommended in adults with cutaneous mastocytosis since they are at a higher risk for systemic mastocytosis. Affected children typically do not undergo a bone marrow biopsy unless blood tests are abnormal."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Cutaneous mastocytosis ?","output":"How might cutaneous mastocytosis be treated? Although there is currently no cure for cutaneous mastocytosis, treatments are available to manage the symptoms of the condition. In general, it is recommended that affected people avoid things that trigger or worsen their symptoms when possible. Certain medications such as oral antihistamines and topical steroids are often prescribed to relieve symptoms. Affected adults may also undergo photochemotherapy which can help alleviate itching and improve the appearance of the patches; however, the condition is likely to recur within six to twelve months of the last treatment. People at risk for anaphylactic shock and/or their caregivers should be trained in how to recognize and treat this life-threatening reaction and should carry an epinephrine autoinjector at all times."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Polyarteritis nodosa ?","output":"Polyarteritis nodosa is a serious blood vessel disease in which medium-sized arteries become swollen and damaged.

Most people with triple A syndrome have all three of these features, although some have only two. Several authors published descriptions of a more global autonomic disturbance associated with the original three characteristics, leading one author to suggest the name 4A syndrome (adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, alacrima, autonomic abnormalities). Specific autonomic disturbances described in this syndrome include abnormal pupillary reflexes, poor heart rate variability, and orthostatic hypotension. Affected individuals may also have developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech problems, a small head size, muscle weakness, movement problems, peripheral neuropathy, and optic atrophy. Many of the neurological symptoms of triple A syndrome worsen over time. Triple A syndrome is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Alacrimia is treated with artificial tears while achalasia may need surgery with either pneumatic dilatation or Heller's myotomy. Adrenal insufficiency is treated with glucocorticoid and if necessary mineralocorticoid replacement."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Triple A syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Triple A syndrome? Triple A syndrome is characterized by three specific features: achalasia, Addison disease, and alacrima (reduced or absent ability to secrete tears). Achalasia is a disorder that affects the ability to move food through the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. It can lead to severe feeding difficulties and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Addison disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, is caused by abnormal function of the small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (adrenal glands). The main features of Addison disease include fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, low blood pressure, and darkening of the skin. The third major feature of triple A syndrome is alacrima. Most people with triple A syndrome have all three of these features, although some have only two. Many of the features of triple A syndrome are caused by dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. This part of the nervous system controls involuntary body processes such as digestion, blood pressure, and body temperature. People with triple A syndrome often experience abnormal sweating, difficulty regulating blood pressure, unequal pupil size (anisocoria), and other signs and symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction (dysautonomia). People with this condition may have other neurological abnormalities such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech problems (dysarthria), and a small head size (microcephaly). In addition, affected individuals commonly experience muscle weakness, movement problems, and nerve abnormalities in their extremities (peripheral neuropathy). Some develop optic atrophy, which is the degeneration (atrophy) of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain. Many of the neurological symptoms of triple A syndrome worsen over time. Adults may exhibit progressive neural degenearation, parkinsonism features and cognitive impairment. People with triple A syndrome frequently develop a thickening of the outer layer of skin (hyperkeratosis) on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet. Other skin abnormalities may also be present in people with this condition. Alacrima is usually the first noticeable sign of triple A syndrome, as it becomes apparent early in life that affected children produce little or no tears while crying. Individuals typically develop Addison disease and achalasia during childhood or adolescence, and most of the neurologic features of triple A syndrome begin during adulthood. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Triple A syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

Mutations in the AAAS gene cause triple A syndrome in many affected individuals. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called ALADIN, whose function is not well understood. Within cells, ALADIN is found in the nuclear envelope, the structure that surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the rest of the cell. Based on its location, ALADIN is thought to be involved in the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus of the cell. Mutations in the AAAS gene prevent this protein from reaching its proper location in the cell, which may disrupt the movement of molecules. Researchers suspect that DNA repair proteins may be unable to enter the nucleus if ALADIN is missing from the nuclear envelope. DNA damage that is not repaired can cause the cell to become unstable and lead to cell death. Although the nervous system is particularly vulnerable to DNA damage, it remains unknown exactly how mutations in the AAAS gene lead to the signs and symptoms of triple A syndrome. Some individuals with triple A syndrome do not have an identified mutation in the AAAS gene; in these individuals, the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown."},{"instruction":"Triple A syndrome inherited ?","output":"How is triple A syndrome inherited? Triple A syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern,which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene and are referred to as \\"carriers\\" but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. When 2 carriers for the same autosomal recessive condition have a child, there is a 25% (1 in 4) chance that the child will have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance that the child will be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance that the child will not have the condition and not be a carrier for the condition."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Triple A syndrome ?","output":"How might triple A syndrome be treated? There is no cure for triple A syndrome at this time; treatment typically focuses on managing individual signs and symptoms of the condition. Glucocorticoid deficiency in individuals with known adrenal insufficiency (present with Addison disease) is typically treated by replacement of glucocorticoids. This may be important for avoiding an adrenal crisis and allowing for normal growth in children. In adult individuals, as well as those who have difficulty with compliance, replacing hydrocortisone with prednisone or dexamethasone is sometimes recommended. It is usually recommended that affected individuals wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace and carry the emergency medical information card supplied with it. Achalasia is typically managed with surgical correction. Individuals may be monitored for pulmonary complications (due to reflux and aspiration). Gastric acid reduction therapy in individuals with reflux after surgical intervention is usually recommended. The symptoms in individuals with achalasia may be improved partially with pneumatic dilatation (also called balloon dilation). For those who remain symptomatic after this, other surgeries may be recommended. Alacrima is typically managed by applying topical lubricants (such as artificial tears or ointments), and with punctal occlusion (a procedure used to close the tear ducts that drain tears from the eye). The symptoms of alacrima typically improve with punctal occlusion. However, this procedure is usually only done when therapy with topical lubricants is unsuccessful."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Ramos Arroyo Clark syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Ramos Arroyo Clark syndrome?

Since only a small number of individuals with this microduplication have been reported, the full range of effects is still being discovered. What is known is that the symptoms are variable, even between members of the same family. While some people with this microduplication do not have symptoms, several features seem to be common, including delayed development, intellectual disability, communication difficulties, emotional and behavioral problems (including autistic spectrum disorders), insomnia, and seizures. 15q13.3 microduplication syndrome is caused by a tiny duplication (microduplication) on the long arm of chromosome 15 that spans at least 6 genes. The features of this syndrome are thought to be caused by the presence of three copies of the genes in this region, instead of the normal two. However, it is unclear which genes contribute to the specific features. In addition, it is likely that other genetic or environmental factors influence the symptoms seen in this condition. Some cases of 15q13.3 microduplication syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Other cases are new (de novo).

DRPLA is caused by a mutation in the ATN1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called atrophin 1. Although the function of atrophin 1 is unclear, it likely plays an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in many areas of the brain. The ATN1 mutation that causes DRPLA involves a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row on the gene. Normally, this CAG segment is repeated 6 to 35 times within the ATN1 gene. In people with DRPLA, the CAG segment is repeated at least 48 times (and sometimes much more). The abnormally long CAG trinucleotide repeat changes the structure of the atrophin 1 protein, which then accumulates in neurons and interferes with normal cell functions.

Treatment for hemochromatosis might include phlebotomy, iron chelation therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications.The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of iron in the body to normal levels, prevent or delay organ damage from excess iron, treat complications of hemochromatosis, and maintain normal amounts of iron throughout the lifetime. Phlebotomy aids in ridding the body of excess iron and maintaining normal iron stores. Most people begin treatment with weekly therapeutic phlebotomy of 500 mL whole blood-although sometimes treatment is initially twice a week. Maintenance phlebotomy usually involves treatment every 2-3 weeks in which 1 unit of blood is removed.

Most infants appear physically normal, but some conditions associated with pachygyria cause distinctive facial or skull characteristics."},{"instruction":"What causes Pachygyria ?","output":"What causes pachygyria? Pachygyria, also called \\"incomplete lissencephaly,\\" may be caused by various non-genetic (environmental) and genetic factors that play a role in impairing the development of the outer region of the brain (the cerebral cortex). The cerebral cortex is responsible for conscious movement and thought, and should have deep convolutions (gyri) and grooves (sulci), which are formed by \\"infolding\\" of the cerebral cortex. During normal embryonic growth, immature cells that later develop into specialized nerve cells (neurons) normally migrate to the brain's surface, making several layers of cells. When this process is impaired, the cells don't migrate to their locations, resulting in too few cell layers and absence (agyria) or incomplete development (pachygyria) of gyri. Environmental factors that contribute to the condition may include intrauterine infection during pregnancy (such as a virus), and insufficient flow of oxygenated blood to the brain (ischemia) during fetal development. More than 25 syndromes due to abnormal migration of neurons have been reported; in some of these cases, the genetic cause and pattern of inheritance depends on that of the specific syndrome. Mutations in several genes have been identified in people with abnormalities of cortical development, including the KIF5C, KIF2A, DYNC1H1, WDR62, and TUBG1 genes. Studies have also found that isolated lissencephaly may result from mutations in the LIS1 and XLIS (also called DCX) genes.

Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is caused by a change (mutation) in the PTCH1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant way. This means that if a close relative (such as a parent or sibling) has NBCCS, there is a 50% chance that an individual may also have inherited this condition, and a 50% chance that they did not.

The features of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) should be evaluated and treated by specialists who are experienced with the condition (such as oral surgeons, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and medical geneticists). If a medulloblastoma is detected early enough, it may be treated by surgery and chemotherapy. Jaw keratocysts usually need to be surgically removed. Early treatment of basal cell carcinomas is necessary to prevent long-term cosmetic problems, particularly on the face. Surgical removal is often supplemented by other treatments such as cryotherapy, laser treatment, and/or photodynamic therapy. Radiation therapy is not recommended because it can provoke the development of more tumors. Some people may need long term treatment with oral retinoids such as isotretinoin or acitretin. Cardiac fibromas may not cause symptoms, but they should be monitored by a cardiologist. If ovarian fibromas need surgical treatment, it is typically recommended that ovarian tissue is preserved even though it involves a risk of recurrence."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Non 24 hour sleep wake disorder ?","output":"Non 24 hour sleep wake disorder refers to a steady pattern of one- to two-hour delays in sleep onset and wake times in people with normal living conditions.

Most cases (approximately 65%) of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) are caused by changes (mutations) in the NIPBL gene. An additional 5% of people affected by the condition have mutations in one of four known genes (SMC1A, SMC3, HDAC8 and RAD21). Many of the genes associated with CdLS encode proteins that play an important role in human development before birth. Mutations in these genes may result in an abnormal protein that is not able to carry out its normal function. This is thought to interfere with early development leading to the many signs and symptoms of CdLS. In 30% of people with CdLS, the underlying genetic cause of the condition is unknown."},{"instruction":"Cornelia de Lange syndrome inherited ?","output":"Is Cornelia de Lange syndrome inherited? Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) can be inherited in an autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC2, or RAD21) or X-linked (SMC1A or HDAC8) manner depending on the underlying genetic cause.

Because Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) affects many different systems of the body, medical management is often provided by a team of doctors and other healthcare professionals. Treatment for this condition varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, many people affected by CdLS have poor growth after birth and may require supplemental formulas and/or gastrostomy tube placement to meet nutritional needs. Ongoing physical, occupational, and speech therapies are often recommended to optimize developmental potential. Surgery may be necessary to treat skeletal abnormalities, gastrointestinal problems, congenital heart defects and other health problems. Medications may be prescribed to prevent or control seizures.

It is spread from person to person by mosquitoes. Most infected people are asymptomatic and never develop clinical symptoms. A small percentage of people develop lymphedema, which may affect the legs, arms, breasts, and genitalia; bacterial infections that cause hardening and thickening of the skin, called elephantiasis; hydrocele (swelling of the scrotum) in men; and pulmonary tropical eosinophilia syndrome. Treatment may include a yearly dose of medicine, called diethylcarbamazine (DEC); while this drug does not kill all of the adult worms, it prevents infected people from giving the disease to someone else."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Lymphatic filariasis ?","output":"How might lymphatic filariasis be treated? The main treatment for this disorder is the use of major anti-parasiticide drugs; examples of these include ivermectin, albendazole, and diethylcarbamazine (DEC). These drugs work to get rid of the larval worm, to inhibit reproduction of the adult worm, or to kill the adult worm. For individuals who are actively infected with the filarial parasite, DEC is typically the drug of choice in the United States. The drug kills the microfilaria and some of the adult worms. DEC has been used world-wide for more than 50 years. Because this infection is rare in the U.S., the drug is no longer approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and cannot be sold in the United.States. Physicians can typically obtain the medication from the CDC after confirmed positive lab results. DEC is generally well tolerated. Side effects are in general limited and depend on the number of microfilariae in the blood. The most common side effects are dizziness, nausea, fever, headache, or pain in muscles or joints. Another treatment option, ivermectin, kills only the microfilariae. For individuals with clinical symptoms of the condition, treatment depends on the signs and symptoms the affected individual has. Lymphedema and elephantiasis are not typically indications for DEC treatment because most people with lymphedema are not actively infected with the filarial parasite. To prevent the lymphedema from getting worse, individuals should ask their physician for a referral to a lymphedema therapist so they can be informed about some basic principles of care such as hygiene, exercise and treatment of wounds. Men with hydrocele (abnormal accumulation of fluid in the scrotum) may have evidence of active infection, but typically do not improve clinically following treatment with DEC. The treatment for hydrocele is surgery. Surgery may also be performed to remove the remains of adult worms and calcifications developing around them. Treatment of elephantiasis of the legs usually consists of elevation and support from elastic stockings. In the tropical areas of the world, mosquito control is an important part of prevention of filariasis. Filariasis is usually a self-limited disease unless reinfection occurs. Therefore some cases, especially those brought into temperate regions of the world (i.e., North America), may be left untreated because there is no danger of spreading the disease."},{"instruction":"What are the symptoms of Feingold syndrome ?","output":"What are the signs and symptoms of Feingold syndrome?

Later in life, signs and symptoms of the condition can vary but may include hirsutism, frontal baldness, delayed menarche (first period), menstrual irregularities, and infertility. Little has been published about males with NCAH. They may have early beard growth and relatively small testes. Typically, they have normal sperm counts. Some men and women affected by NCAH have no signs or symptoms of the condition. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (NCAH) is caused by changes (mutations) in the CYP21A2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, which is found in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are cone-shaped organs that sit on top of the kidneys and are responsible for releasing various types of hormones that the body needs to function. Mutations in CYP21A2 lead to deficient levels of 21-hydroxylase which cause low levels of hormones such as cortisol and/or aldosterone and an overproduction of androgens (male hormones such as testosterone). Cortisol is a hormone that affects energy levels, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and the body's response to stress, illness, and injury. Aldosterone helps the body maintain the proper level of sodium (salt) and water and helps maintain blood pressure. Irregular levels of these hormones lead to the signs and symptoms of NCAH. The amount of functional 21-hydroxylase enzyme determines the severity of the disorder. People with NCAH have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than the classic form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia."},{"instruction":"Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21hydroxylase deficiency inherited ?","output":"Is non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency inherited? Non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (NCAH) is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21hydroxylase deficiency ?","output":"How is non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency diagnosed? A diagnosis of non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (NCAH) is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. This may include a blood test to measure the concentration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and/or an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. An ACTH stimulation test involves measuring the concentration of 17-OHP in the blood before ACTH is administered and 60 min after ACTH is given."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21hydroxylase deficiency ?","output":"How might non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency be treated? In some cases, people affected by non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (NCAH) may not require any treatment. Many are asymptomatic throughout their lives, although symptoms may develop during puberty, after puberty, or post partum. If symptoms are present, a glucocorticoid called dexamethasone is often recommended. Dexamethasone can treat irregular menstruation, acne, and excess body hair (hirsutism)."},{"instruction":"What is (are) Central serous chorioretinopathy ?","output":"Central serous chorioretinopathy is a disease that causes fluid to build up under the retina, the back part of the inner eye that sends sight information to the brain.

There is currently no cure for nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE). Treatment generally focuses on managing the specific signs and symptoms each individual has. For newborns, the most important goals are to provide a moist environment in an isolette, and to prevent and treat infections. Petrolatum-based creams and ointments are typically used to keep the skin soft and hydrated. As children age, keratolytic agents (agents that help the skin loosen and shed) such as alpha-hydroxy acid or urea preparations can be used to promote the peeling and thinning of the outer layer of the skin. For individuals with severe skin involvement, oral retinoid therapy may be recommended. However, because this is known to cause abnormalities in a developing fetus, it should be used with caution in women of child-bearing age. In general, any agents that irritate the skin should be avoided. Ectropion (turning out of the eyelid) can cause dryness of the cornea (especially at night), so artificial tears or prescription ointments may be used to keep the cornea moist.

Most cases of Cowden syndrome are caused by changes (mutations) in the PTEN gene. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene which means that it encodes a protein that helps keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in PTEN result in a defective protein that is unable to carry out its normal role. This leads to the development of the various tumors and cancers associated with Cowden syndrome. Rarely, Cowden syndrome is caused by mutations in KLLN, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, PIK3CA or AKT1. Some affected families have no identifiable mutation in any of the genes associated with Cowden syndrome; in these families, the exact underlying cause is unknown."},{"instruction":"Cowden syndrome inherited ?","output":"How is Cowden syndrome inherited? Cowden syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with Cowden syndrome has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child."},{"instruction":"w to diagnose Cowden syndrome ?","output":"How is Cowden syndrome diagnosed? A diagnosis of Cowden syndrome is based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Genetic testing for a change (mutation) in the PTEN gene can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. If a mutation in PTEN is not identified, genetic testing for the other genes known to cause Cowden syndrome can be considered. GeneReviews offers more detailed information regarding the diagnosis of Cowden syndrome including the clinical diagnostic criteria. Click here to view this resource. The PTEN Cleveland Clinic Risk Calculator can be used to estimate the chance of finding a PTEN mutation in children and adults with signs and symptoms of Cowden syndrome. Is genetic testing available for Cowden syndrome? Yes, genetic testing is available for many of the genes known to cause Cowden syndrome. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional."},{"instruction":"What are the treatments for Cowden syndrome ?","output":"How might Cowden syndrome be treated? Because Cowden syndrome is associated with an increased risk for certain types of cancer, management is typically focused on high-risk cancer screening. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2014, the recommended screening protocol for Cowden syndrome includes: Cancer Screening for Women Breast self exams beginning at age 18 Clinical breast exams every 6-12 months beginning at age 25** Annual mammogram and breast MRI beginning at age 30-35** Annual screening for endometrial cancer with ultrasound and/or random biopsy may be considered beginning at age 30-35 Prophylactic surgeries may be considered as a preventative option for some forms of cancer Cancer Screening for Men and Women Annual physical examination beginning at age 18** Annual thyroid ultrasound beginning at age 18** Baseline colonoscopy at age 35 with follow-up every 5 years (more frequent if polyps identified) Consider renal (kidney) ultrasound every 1-2 years beginning at age 40 **or individualized based on the earliest diagnosis of cancer in the family GeneReviews offers more specific information on the treatment and management of Cowden syndrome.

The current treatment recommendation is to start with oral prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day. Most centers use prednisone and cyclophosphamide for 4-6 months to induce clinical remission, and then taper prednisone off. Patients generally stay on cyclophosphamide therapy between three and six months, depending on when remission occurs and if there are any potential side effects from cyclophosphamide. Once cyclophosphamide is discontinued, it should be replaced with a less toxic medication for an additional six to twelve months of maintenance therapy. Some doctors switch from cyclophosphamide to azathioprine (2 mg/kg) or mycophenolate mofetil. Methotrexate can also be used, but may be limited by its difficulty to cross the blood brain barrier.

Find the range of values for frac{BC cdot BD}{S}.","output":"# Solution:  Part (1): Given bcos C - ccos B = 2a, we apply the Law of Cosines to each term: - For bcos C, we use the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC for side c: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos C. Solving for cos C gives cos C = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}. - For ccos B, similarly, we use the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC for side b: b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2accos B. Solving for cos B gives cos B = frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}. Substituting these into the given equation: [ b cdot frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} - c cdot frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} = 2a ] Simplifying, we find: [ b^2 - c^2 = 2a^2 ] Given c = a, substituting c with a: [ b^2 - a^2 = 2a^2 ] This simplifies to b^2 = 3a^2, which implies b = sqrt{3}a. Therefore, using the Law of Cosines again for angle B: [ cos B = frac{a^2 + a^2 - 3a^2}{2a^2} = -frac{1}{2} ] Since B is an angle in a triangle and must be between 0 and pi radians, we find: [ B = frac{2pi}{3} ] Hence, the value of angle B is boxed{frac{2pi}{3}}.  Part (2): For the right triangle ABD, we have BD = c tan A. The area S of triangle ABC can be expressed as frac{1}{2}bcsin A. Therefore: [ frac{BC cdot BD}{S} = frac{a cdot c tan A}{frac{1}{2}bc sin A} = frac{2ac sin A}{bc sin A cos A} = frac{2a}{b cdot frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}} ] Simplifying further, we get: [ frac{BC cdot BD}{S} = frac{4ac}{b^2 + c^2 - a^2} ] From part (1), we know b^2 - c^2 = 2a^2, so: [ frac{BC cdot BD}{S} = frac{4ac}{2c^2 + a^2} = frac{4}{frac{2c}{a} + frac{a}{c}} ] Given c leqslant 2a, we have frac{c}{a} leq 2. Also, from the triangle inequality and the given conditions, we deduce frac{1}{2} < frac{c}{a} leq 2. Let t = frac{c}{a}, and consider the function f(t) = 2t + frac{1}{t}, where t in left(frac{1}{2}, 2right]. Analyzing f(t), we find it is monotonically decreasing on left(frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) and increasing on left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, 2right). Thus, f(t)_{text{min}} = fleft(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) = 2sqrt{2}, and f(t)_{text{max}} = f(2) = frac{9}{2}. Therefore, the range of frac{4}{f(t)} is [frac{8}{9}, sqrt{2}].

Step 2: Stir Cup 2 and pour half back to Cup 1 - Total liquid in Cup 2 before pouring back = 5 ounces. - Amount of liquid transferred back to Cup 1 = frac{5}{2} = 2.5 ounces. Since the liquid in Cup 2 is mixed evenly (2 ounces coffee, 3 ounces milk), each component (coffee and milk) comprises frac{2}{5} and frac{3}{5} of the cup, respectively.

We denote the areas of the faces by their respective edges they contain, for example, S_{ABC} for the face containing vertices A, B, and C.     2. **Projection on a plane:**    Consider a plane S perpendicular to the edge AB. When projecting the tetrahedron orthogonally onto this plane, the projection of the face containing AB and C will be a line segment m_c, and the projection of the face containing AB and D will be another line segment m_d. Given that these faces intersect perpendicularly at AB, we have:        [    m_c^2 + m_d^2 = left(C'D'right)^2    ]    Here, C' and D' are the projections of vertices C and D, respectively. 3. **Relate to original edge CD:**    In the projection plane, the edge CD projects to a line C'D' parallel to AB. The length of the projection C'D' is:        [    C'D' = CD sin alpha    ]        where alpha is the angle between edges CD and AB.

The resulting equation will be:    [    left( frac{CD cdot m_a}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{CD cdot m_b}{2} right)^2 = left( frac{AB cdot CD cdot sin alpha}{2} right)^2    ]     5. **Equality of sums of squares:**    Combining the results of both sets above, we get:    [    left( frac{AB cdot m_c}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{AB cdot m_d}{2} right)^2 = left( frac{CD cdot m_a}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{CD cdot m_b}{2} right)^2    ]    Thus, the sum of the squares of the areas of the two triangles forming one of the 90^circ angles is equal to the sum of the squares of the areas of the other two triangles.     # 2: 1. **Area vectors:**    Denote the area of the face ABC as t_D, and let overrightarrow{t_D} be the corresponding area vector perpendicular to the face ABC. 2. **Polyhedron theorem:**    By the theorem stated in Hajós György's \\"Bevezetés a geometriába\\", the sum of the outward-oriented area vectors of a polyhedron equals the zero vector.

What should be the reduced price of the radio so that the final amount spent, including all discounts and sales tax, remains Rs 2468?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final amount spent to find the reduced price of the radio before tax and discount are applied. Let's denote the reduced price of the radio as ( P ). The final amount spent is Rs 2468, which includes the sales tax and after the discount has been applied. We need to calculate the sales tax and discount based on the different price ranges and rates provided. First, we need to find the sales tax that would have been applied to the original price ranges: 1. For the first Rs 2500, the tax rate is 4%, so the tax would be ( 2500 times 0.04 = Rs 100 ). 2. For the amount between Rs 2501 and Rs 4500, the tax rate is 7%. The amount in this range is ( 4500 - 2500 = Rs 2000 ), so the tax would be ( 2000 times 0.07 = Rs 140 ). 3. For any amount above Rs 4500, the tax rate is 9%. Since the original price is Rs 5000, the amount in this range is ( 5000 - 4500 = Rs 500 ), so the tax would be ( 500 times 0.09 = Rs 45 ). The total tax on the original price would be ( Rs 100 + Rs 140 + Rs 45 = Rs 285 ). Now, let's calculate the discount that would have been applied to the original price ranges: 1. A 2% discount on the first Rs 2000 would be ( 2000 times 0.02 = Rs 40 ). 2. A 5% discount on the next Rs 2000 would be ( 2000 times 0.05 = Rs 100 ). 3. A 10% discount on any amount above Rs 4000. Since the original price is Rs 5000, the amount in this range is ( 5000 - 4000 = Rs 1000 ), so the discount would be ( 1000 times 0.10 = Rs 100 ). The total discount on the original price would be ( Rs 40 + Rs 100 + Rs 100 = Rs 240 ). Now, we can calculate the final price after applying the discount and adding the tax: ( P - Discount + Tax = Final Amount ) ( P - Rs 240 + Rs 285 = Rs 2468 ) ( P + Rs 45 = Rs 2468 ) ( P = Rs 2468 - Rs 45 ) ( P = Rs 2423 ) So, the reduced price of the radio before applying the discount and adding the sales tax should be Rs boxed{2423} ."},{"instruction":"an examination, there were 2000 candidates, out of which some candidates were girls and the rest were boys.

Teddy buys six hamburgers at 3 each and if he buys more than five hamburgers, he gets a 10% discount on all hamburgers. He also purchases an additional ten cans of soft drinks. How much do they spend in all?","output":"First, let's calculate the cost of the pizzas that Robert orders: The cost of one box of pizza is 10. Since he orders five boxes, the total cost without discount is 5 * 10 = 50. Since Robert orders more than three pizzas, he gets a 15% discount on the total cost of the pizzas. Let's calculate the discount amount and the final cost after the discount: Discount amount = 15% of 50 = 0.15 * 50 = 7.50. Final cost of pizzas after discount = 50 - 7.50 = 42.50. Now, let's calculate the cost of the soft drinks that Robert buys: The cost of one can of soft drink is 1.50. Since he buys ten cans, the total cost is 10 * 1.50 = 15. Next, let's calculate the cost of the hamburgers that Teddy buys: The cost of one hamburger is 3. Since he buys six hamburgers, the total cost without discount is 6 * 3 = 18. Since Teddy buys more than five hamburgers, he gets a 10% discount on all hamburgers. Let's calculate the discount amount and the final cost after the discount: Discount amount = 10% of 18 = 0.10 * 18 = 1.80. Final cost of hamburgers after discount = 18 - 1.80 = 16.20. Now, let's calculate the cost of the additional soft drinks that Teddy purchases: Since the cost of one can of soft drink is 1.50 and Teddy also buys ten cans, the total cost is the same as Robert's, which is 10 * 1.50 = 15. Finally, let's calculate the total amount spent by Robert and Teddy: Total spent by Robert = Cost of pizzas after discount + Cost of soft drinks Total spent by Robert = 42.50 + 15 = 57.50. Total spent by Teddy = Cost of hamburgers after discount + Cost of soft drinks Total spent by Teddy = 16.20 + 15 = 31.20.

For proposition p to hold true, that is boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{b} > 0, the cosine of the angle theta between the vectors must be positive because |boldsymbol{a}| and |boldsymbol{b}| are always positive given that they are non-zero vectors. The cosine of an angle is positive when the angle is acute (less than 90 degrees). Therefore, if p: boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{b} > 0 is true, then q: the angle between boldsymbol{a} and boldsymbol{b} is acute must also be true.

Drawing a line through point A with a slope of -1, let this line intersect the square at points B and C. Suppose this intersects at points dividing the edges into segments of length t and 1-t.    - Therefore, we have:      |x+y| = min {t, 1-t}    - Since |x| + |y| is at least the smallest of t or 1-t, the previous equations instantiate inequality (1). 4. **Step 4: Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**    - Consider the d_i in {0, 1, cdots, m}.

Prove that the sequence   {G_n}_{ninmathbb{N}}  is periodic after some term with period   T le 2^n .","output":"1. **Base Case Verification:**    - For ( n = 1 ), the graph ( G_0 ) has only one vertex ( A_1 ) and no edges. Therefore, ( G_1 ) will also have no edges, and the sequence is trivially periodic with period 1.    - For ( n = 2 ), the graph ( G_0 ) has two vertices ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ). If there is no edge between them in ( G_0 ), there will be no edge in ( G_1 ) either. If there is an edge, it will remain in ( G_1 ). Thus, the sequence is periodic with period 1.    - For ( n = 3 ), consider the possible edges in ( G_0 ). If ( G_0 ) is a complete graph ( K_3 ), then ( G_1 ) will also be ( K_3 ). If ( G_0 ) is not complete, the edges in ( G_1 ) will depend on the presence of common neighbors. The sequence will stabilize quickly, showing periodicity. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    Assume that for some ( k geq 3 ), the graph ( G_k ) contains a complete subgraph ( K_i ) for some ( i geq 3 ). This subgraph ( K_i ) will persist in all subsequent graphs ( G_{k+1}, G_{k+2}, ldots ) because the rule for constructing ( G_{n+1} ) ensures that if ( A_i ) and ( A_j ) are connected through a common neighbor ( A_k ), they will remain connected. 3. **Monotonicity and Constancy:**    The size of the largest complete subgraph in ( G_n ) is monotonically increasing. Since ( i leq n ), at some point, this size will become constant, say ( i_0 ). Once ( i_0 ) is reached, no member of ( K_{i_0} ) can connect to any member outside of it, as this would create a larger complete subgraph ( K_{i_0+1} ), contradicting the constancy of ( i_0 ). 4. **Decomposition into Groups:**    We can split the set of ( n ) vertices into two groups: ( K_{i_0} ) and the vertices not in ( K_{i_0} ). Applying the induction hypothesis, the period of these ( n ) vertices is at most ( 2^{|K_{i_0}|} times 2^{n - |K_{i_0}|} = 2^n ). 5. **Case of No Complete Subgraph:**    Suppose no complete subgraph ( K_i ) (for ( i geq 3 )) ever exists. Then, at any stage, there must be at most ( n ) segments (edges) because otherwise, by the Pigeonhole Principle, some vertex will have at least three segments, leading to a complete subgraph ( K_i ). 6. **Counting Segments:**    The number of segments (edges) in ( G_k ) never increases, so it becomes constant at some point. For this point, any vertex with edges has exactly 2 such edges, decomposing the set of ( n ) vertices into disjoint cycles. 7. **Cycle Analysis:**    - If there are at least two cycles, apply the induction hypothesis.    - If there is exactly one cycle, consider its length:      - If the cycle length is even, it will decompose into two cycles in the next stage.      - If the cycle length is odd, assume it has size ( r ). If ( r < n ), use the induction hypothesis. If ( r = n ), number theory guarantees that this cycle has a period at most ( phi(n) ), which is less than ( 2^n ).

From the condition of the problem, we have  sin Bcos C + cos Bsin C = 2sin Bsin C. This can be written as: begin{equation} sin Bcos C - sin Bsin C + cos Bsin C = 0. end{equation} Because triangle ABC is an acute triangle, cos B > 0 and cos C > 0. Dividing both sides of the equation by cos Bcos C, we get  tan B + tan C = 2tan Btan C. Also, we can express tan A as: tan A = -tan(pi - A) = -tan(B + C) = -frac{tan B + tan C}{1 - tan Btan C}, and by multiplying both sides by tan Btan C, we obtain: tan Atan Btan C = -frac{tan B + tan C}{1 - tan Btan C}tan Btan C. Substituting tan B + tan C = 2tan Btan C into the above expression, we have: tan Atan Btan C = -frac{2(tan Btan C)^2}{1 - tan Btan C}. Let t = tan Btan C, where t > 1 because all angles A, B, and C are acute, and thus their tangents are positive. Now we can rewrite our expression as: tan Atan Btan C = -frac{2t^2}{1 - t} = -frac{2}{frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t}}. The latter denominator can be expressed in terms of a square minus a constant: frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t} = left( frac{1}{t} - frac{1}{2} right)^2 - frac{1}{4}. Since t > 1, we have -frac{1}{4} leq frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t} < 0, thus the minimum value of tan Atan Btan C = -frac{2}{text{denominator}} is achieved when frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t} = -frac{1}{4}. This gives a minimum value of: boxed{tan Atan Btan C = 8}, which occurs when t = 2, that is when tan Btan C = 2.

Combining the geometric relationships in a triangle with the equation sin A = 2sin Bsin C allows us to conclude that sin Bcos C + cos Bsin C = 2sin Bsin C, leading to tan B + tan C = 2tan Btan C, which we used to ultimately find the minimum value by examining the monotonic nature of the function.

Because angles angle BO_1O_2 = frac{1}{2} angle BO_1A = angle BM_1A and angle BO_2O_1 = frac{1}{2} angle BO_2A = angle BM_2A,    - The similarity holds due to equal angle measurements caused by the properties of tangents and central angles in the circles. 5. Let’s denote the angle of rotation as alpha. Since the angles angle BM_1N + angle BM_2N consist of:    - angle BM_1M_2 + angle BM_2M_1 adding to angle BNM_1 + angle BNM_2 = 180^circ,    - This implies angle BM_1M_2 + angle BM_2M_1 + angle N M_1M_2 + angle N M_2M_1 = 180^circ. 6.

For angle NBM_1 = angle N M_2M_1 and angle JBO_1 = angle JO_2O_1,    - The difference in angles NBM_2 and JBO_1 equals the difference in angles N M_2M_2 and JO_2O_2. 8. This relation reflects the consistent angle formed by line segments. Given M_2M_2 || O_2J, thus,    - The angle difference NBM and JBO_1 leads to a rotation of alpha between M_2M_2 and O_2O_2. 9. Since, angle NBM_2 = angle M_1BO_1 and angle JBO_1 = NM_1M_2,    - It follows that line JN consistently passes through B independent of the choice of line M_1AM_2. 10. For proving the constant length of segment JN,     - Since O_1J || N M_2 perp O_1M_1, thus angle JNM_1 = angle M_2M_2B = angle O_2O_2B,     - Therefore, JN forms a right angle with O_2J projecting orthogonally to O_1J with the segment having constant length dictated by the radius of S_1.          - Specifically, JN = r_1 sin angle O_1O_2B , fulfilling the condition of constant length independent of the choice of M_1AM_2. # Conclusion: blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A cone has a surface area of 3pi.

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. First, we convert the speed of the train from km/hour to m/s because the time is given in seconds and the length of the bridge is in meters. Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hour × (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 45 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 45 × 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 45000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 12.5 Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while passing the bridge using the time it takes to pass the bridge. Total distance = Speed × Time Total distance = 12.5 m/s × 41.6 seconds Total distance = 520 meters The total distance covered by the train is the sum of the length of the train (let's call it L_train) and the length of the bridge (160 meters).

The perfect squares in this range are 9 (3²) and 16 (4²), as 25 (5²) is greater than 21. 2. **List Problematic Pairs**:     For each perfect square, list the pairs that sum to it:     - For 9: (2 + 7), (3 + 6), (4 + 5)     - For 16: (5 + 11), (6 + 10), (7 + 9)     Thus, the problematic pairs are:     [     {(2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 11), (6, 10), (7, 9)}     ] 3. **Analyze Overlap and Necessary Avoidance**:     Notice that:     - The number 2 appears in (2, 7)     - The number 3 appears in (3, 6)     - The number 4 appears in (4, 5)     - The number 5 appears in two pairs: (4, 5) and (5, 11)     - The number 6 appears in two pairs: (3, 6) and (6, 10)     - The number 7 appears in two pairs: (2, 7) and (7, 9)     - The number 9 appears in (7, 9)     - The number 10 appears in (6, 10)     - The number 11 appears in (5, 11)     Numbers 5, 6, and 7 each appear in two pairs. 4. **Formulate the Largest Set by Avoiding Critical Numbers**:     To maximize the number of selections while ensuring no two selected numbers form a pair that sums to a square, avoid 5, 6, and 7.

Here, two independent organizations, GSA and AWRA, have both measured the length of the river Rio-Coralio, yielding slightly different results, each with a margin of error.

Step 3: Calculate Cumulative Probability When combining the results from the two measurements, the combined result would be somewhere between their error margins. Given each result has an independent error of 0.02 probability in either direction, we can combine these probabilities. For the GSA measurement: - Probability true length is greater than 402.5 km: (0.02) - Probability true length is less than 401.5 km: (0.02) And for the AWRA measurement: - Probability true length is greater than 403.5 km: (0.02) - Probability true length is less than 402.5 km: (0.02) # Step 4: Determine Overlapping Useful Range Both measurements fall within 402 ± 0.5 km and 403 ± 0.5 km: - GSA's range: ([401.5, 402.5]) - AWRA's range: ([402.5, 403.5]) Since the overlap of the ranges, where there is the combined probability, is the segment ([402, 402.5]), we consider how the error distributions intersect. # Step 5: Combine Probabilities  The probabilities for the non-overlapping portions are: [ P(text{true length} > 402.5 text{ or } < 402) = 2 times 0.02 = 0.04 ] Thus, the confidence for the non-error measurement: [ P(text{true length} = 402.5 text{ km}) = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96 ]  Conclusion: The statistician combines the data correctly, given both independent measurements with random unbiased error show high consistency.

Let's denote: - (O) as the center of the oil platform, - (A) and (B) as the positions of two adjacent radars, - Each radar has a coverage radius (r = 17 text{ km}).

The tangent line can be written as:    [    y - y_0 = 2x_0 (x - x_0)    ]    Substituting ( y_0 = x_0^2 ):    [    y - x_0^2 = 2x_0 (x - x_0)    ]    Rearranging and simplifying, we get:    [    y = 2x_0 x - 2x_0^2 + x_0^2    ]    [    y = 2x_0 x - x_0^2    ] 2. **Intersection with the Coordinate Axes:**        - **Intersection with the Y-axis:**      This occurs when ( x = 0 ):      [      y = -x_0^2      ]      Hence, the intersection point is ( (0, -x_0^2) ).    - **Intersection with the X-axis:**      This occurs when ( y = 0 ):      [      0 = 2x_0 x - x_0^2      ]      Solving for ( x ):      [      2x_0 x = x_0^2      ]      [      x = frac{x_0^2}{2x_0} = frac{x_0}{2}      ]      Hence, the intersection point is ( left(frac{x_0}{2}, 0 right) ). 3. **Conditions for Integer Coordinates:**        For the intersection points to have integer coordinates:    - ( -x_0^2 ) must be an integer (true for any integer ( x_0 )).    - ( frac{x_0}{2} ) must be an integer. This requires ( x_0 ) to be an even integer. 4. **Range of ( x_0 ):**    Given the coordinates must not exceed 2020 in absolute value,    [    | x_0 | leq sqrt{2020}    ]    Simplifying the inequality:    [    | x_0 | leq 44.9    ]    Since ( x_0 ) must be an even integer, we consider the range of even integers from ( -44 ) to ( 44 ) (not including ( 0 )). 5. **Counting the Valid ( x_0 ):**        The even integers within the range are ( -44, -42, -40, ldots, -2, 2, 4, ldots, 42, 44 ). Each of these count as valid ( x_0 ) values.

To pass the test, the student needs to get 70% of M, which can be written as 0.70 * M. According to the information given, the student got 120 marks but failed the test by 150 marks. This means that the student needed 150 more marks to reach the passing threshold. So, the passing threshold (70% of M) is 120 marks (what the student got) plus 150 marks (the additional marks needed to pass). Therefore, we can write the equation: 0.70 * M = 120 + 150 Now, let's solve for M: 0.70 * M = 270 Divide both sides by 0.70 to isolate M: M = 270 / 0.70 M = 385.71 Since the maximum marks set for the test cannot be a fraction, we round up to the nearest whole number.

The recurrence relation is given by:    [    a_{n+1} = lfloor a_n + sqrt{a_n} + frac{1}{2} rfloor    ]    where ( lfloor x rfloor ) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to ( x ). 2. **Understanding the Recurrence Relation:**    To understand the behavior of the sequence, let's analyze the expression inside the floor function:    [    a_n + sqrt{a_n} + frac{1}{2}    ]    For any positive integer ( a_n ), ( sqrt{a_n} ) is a non-negative real number. Adding ( frac{1}{2} ) ensures that the expression ( a_n + sqrt{a_n} + frac{1}{2} ) is not an integer unless ( sqrt{a_n} ) itself is an integer. 3. **Checking for Perfect Squares:**    Suppose ( a_n ) is a perfect square, say ( a_n = k^2 ) for some integer ( k ). Then:    [    a_{n+1} = lfloor k^2 + k + frac{1}{2} rfloor    ]    Since ( k^2 + k + frac{1}{2} ) is not an integer (because ( k^2 + k ) is an integer and adding ( frac{1}{2} ) makes it a non-integer), the floor function will reduce it to:    [    a_{n+1} = k^2 + k    ]    Now, we need to check if ( k^2 + k ) can be a perfect square. Let ( k^2 + k = m^2 ) for some integer ( m ). This implies:    [    k^2 + k - m^2 = 0    ]    This is a quadratic equation in ( k ):    [    k^2 + k - m^2 = 0    ]    Solving for ( k ) using the quadratic formula:    [    k = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 4m^2}}{2}    ]    For ( k ) to be an integer, ( 1 + 4m^2 ) must be a perfect square. Let ( 1 + 4m^2 = t^2 ) for some integer ( t ). Then:    [    t^2 - 4m^2 = 1    ]    This is a Diophantine equation known as the Pell's equation. The fundamental solution to this equation is ( t = 3 ) and ( m = 1 ), leading to the sequence of solutions ( t_n ) and ( m_n ) given by the recurrence relations:    [    t_{n+1} = 3t_n + 4m_n    ]    [    m_{n+1} = 2t_n + 3m_n    ]    However, for our purposes, we only need to check the initial values. The smallest solution ( t = 3 ) and ( m = 1 ) gives:    [    k = frac{-1 pm 3}{2}    ]    This yields ( k = 1 ) or ( k = -2 ). Since ( k ) must be positive, we have ( k = 1 ). 4. **Conclusion:**    For ( k = 1 ), we have ( a_1 = 1 ). For ( n > 1 ), the sequence ( a_n ) will not be a perfect square because ( k^2 + k ) for ( k > 1 ) is not a perfect square. Therefore, the only ( n leq 2013 ) such that ( a_n ) is a perfect square is ( n = 1 ). The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 1 } )."},{"instruction":"Juice was sold in a cafeteria over three days.

Therefore, the equation of the parabola C_{2} is x^{2} = -2y. For the ellipse C_{1}, the eccentricity e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. This gives us c = sqrt{3}.

So, the equations for the coordinates of ( M ) in terms of ( (C, D) ) give:    begin{equation*}    M = left( frac{x_0 + x_4}{2}, frac{y_0 + y_4}{2} right)    end{equation*} 4. **Equating the Midpoints to Find Coordinates of Fourth Vertex:**    Equate the two expressions for ( M ):    begin{align*}    frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} &= frac{x_0 + x_4}{2}     frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} &= frac{y_0 + y_4}{2}    end{align*}        Solving these equations gives:    begin{align*}    x_4 &= x_1 + x_2 - x_0     y_4 &= y_1 + y_2 - y_0    end{align*} 5. **Conclusion:**    The coordinates ( (x_4, y_4) ) of the fourth vertex of the rectangle can therefore be determined by the formulas:    begin{align*}    x_4 &= x_1 + x_2 - x_0     y_4 &= y_1 + y_2 - y_0    end{align*} Hence, the geometric locus of the fourth vertex is given by these parameters, based on the initial three vertices.

Each person wears either a black hat or a white hat. The process of \\"blackening\\" for a person ( A ) is defined as follows: If there is a friend ( B ) of ( A ) who wears a black hat and among ( B )'s friends, ( A ) is the only one wearing a white hat, then ( A ) will change their hat to black; otherwise, ( A )'s hat color does not change. Similarly, one can define \\"whitening\\". Every morning, everyone in the village simultaneously undergoes a blackening process, and every evening they undergo a whitening process. Let ( S_i ) denote the set of all people wearing black hats at noon on the ( i )-th day. The question is: Does there exist a village (with any number of people and friendship relations), an initial hat color configuration, and a subset ( P ) consisting of 2021 people such that for any subset ( Q ) of ( P ), there exist infinitely many positive integers ( i ) such that ( S_i cap P = Q )?  The answer is certain. We can demonstrate by constructing a specific scenario. Here's a step-by-step detailed explanation. 1. **Construct a self-contained point**:    Define a point ( A ) whose color changes follow the pattern \\"white-black-black-black\\" cyclically each day (initial states illustrated as hollow for white and solid for black). For such a point to exist, its neighboring points must enforce this cycle by their color patterns. 2. **Define self-contained points (Fixed Points)**:    A point whose adjacent points always have at least two black and two white neighbors is a \\"self-contained point\\". Point ( A ) in the initial configuration is such a point as it is internally consistent with the imposed cycle. 3. **Black Hat Manufacturing Machine**:    For a point that remains black if its adjacent points always maintain black colors, we call it a \\"black hat manufacturing machine\\". It activates in one blackening cycle when all its adjacent points are black (or white upon whitening). 4. **Construct minimal period cycles**:    To structure a minimal cycle period of ( 2^k ) (where ( k geq 2 )), we create a black manufacturing machine ( G ). Co-construct two self-contained points ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) with a minimal cycle period of ( 2^{k-1} ). Machine ( G ) relates to them as ( G )'s cycle also fits into this ( 2^{k-1} ) period with one activation per period. 5. **Adjusting Initial Configuration**:    By adjusting the initial colors (oppositely changing colors), machines and points can form cycles of length ( 2^k ), where synchronous black and white manufacturing triggers create the desired sequences during specific cycles. 6. **Controlling Set ( P )**:    By linking a specific point ( P ) to a series of both black and white machines for a period, we control whether ( P )'s color changes during any cycle. Ensuring each cycle contains specific points ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{2021} ). Conclusion: Given arbitrary ( 2^{k} > 2022 ) allows subsets ( P ). Thus, constructing ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{2021} ) such that upon \\"blackening\\" decomposes ( P's ) indices within any period, ensuring in each cycle ( S_i cap P ) can include all its subsets: [ boxed{text{Yes}} ]"},{"instruction":"A coat is sold for 135 yuan after a 25% discount.

The current price is 75% of the original price, which is the same as saying it's sold at a 75% discount off the original price.

According to the problem, the coat is sold for 75% of its original price, which can be expressed as 0.75x. **Step 2:** We know that 0.75x = 135 yuan. **Step 3:** To find the original price x, we solve the equation 0.75x = 135. **Step 4:** Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75, we get x = frac{135}{0.75} = 180.

There is a third pipe in the bottom of the cistern to empty it. If all the 3 pipes are simultaneously opened, then the cistern is full in 50 min. In how much time can the third pipe alone empty the cistern?","output":"Let's denote the rate at which pipe A fills the cistern as A, the rate at which pipe B fills the cistern as B, and the rate at which the third pipe empties the cistern as C. We want to find the time it takes for the third pipe to empty the cistern, which we'll call T. We know that pipe A can fill the cistern in 60 minutes, so its rate is 1/60 of the cistern per minute. Similarly, pipe B's rate is 1/75 of the cistern per minute. When all three pipes are open, they fill the cistern in 50 minutes. This means that the combined rate of pipes A and B minus the rate of pipe C is equal to 1/50 of the cistern per minute. So we have: A + B - C = 1/50 Substituting the rates of A and B, we get: (1/60) + (1/75) - C = 1/50 To solve for C, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60, 75, and 50 is 300. So we convert the fractions: (5/300) + (4/300) - C = 6/300 Combining the fractions on the left side, we get: (5 + 4)/300 - C = 6/300 9/300 - C = 6/300 Subtracting 9/300 from both sides, we get: -C = 6/300 - 9/300 -C = -3/300 C = 3/300 C = 1/100 This means that the third pipe empties the cistern at a rate of 1/100 of the cistern per minute. To find the time T it takes for the third pipe to empty the cistern, we take the reciprocal of the rate: T = 1/C T = 1/(1/100) T = 100 minutes Therefore, the third pipe alone can empty the cistern in boxed{100}  minutes."},{"instruction":"There are 10 different books and 11 different movies in the 'crazy silly school' series.

You mentioned there are 10 different books in the 'crazy silly school' series, but then you said you read 13 of the books. Since there are only 10 books, you could not have read 13.

(Diameter is defined as the maximum distance between points in the set.)","output":"1. Define the diameter d of a finite set M of points on a plane. The diameter d is the maximum distance between any two points in M.      2. Let A, B be two points in M such that |AB| = d. By the definition of the diameter, this is the largest distance among any pair of points in M. 3. Consider the two circles with radius d centered at A and B, respectively. The intersection of these circles forms a lens-shaped region. Let's refer to this lens as L. 4. Any point P in M must lie either inside or on the boundary of the lens L formed by the intersection of these two circles. Otherwise, the distance from P to either A or B would be greater than d, contradicting the definition of d. 5. To prove that one point can be removed such that the remaining set can be split into two subsets each with a smaller diameter, we incrementally look at arc portions of the circles. 6. On the boundary of the lens L, the circular arcs AKC and BLD are formed. Here, K and L are the points where the circles intersect each other, dividing the lens into two arcs AKC and BLD. 7. Assume without loss of generality that there are no points of M on the arc AKC except for possibly A and C. 8. We need to demonstrate that upon removing one point (say A), the remaining set can be split into two regions such that each has a diameter less than d. 9. The crucial observation involves evaluating the cosine rule (Law of Cosines) for lengths to show that: [ K L^2 = AK^2 + d^2 - 2 cdot AK cdot d cdot cos(beta) > d^2 ]    Here, AK = 2dcos(alpha) is greater than 2dcos(beta) as alpha < beta. From this, KL > d. 10. Let's split the remaining points by drawing the line AB. Removing point A allows us to draw a line along AB, such that points on the left end up in one subset, and those on the right in another. 11. As a result, each point in one subset is at most a distance d from B, and the points in the other set are also within d but confined to points not=A. This automatically reduces the distance as no two points' distance will be greater than d in each subset. 12. Combining the analysis, we achieve two subsets where both have a smaller diameter than the original. Hence, removing any appropriately chosen point like A (but generalizable to any such point which splits the lens similarly) validates the proposition. # Conclusion: By removing one appropriately chosen point, we can divide the remaining set of points into two parts, each with a diameter less than the original.

Apply the triangle inequality: since (E) is outside of the line, consider the triangle formed by points (ACD) with (E) being an external point.    - In triangle (ACD), we use the point (E) outside the line.      [      AE + ED > AD.      ]    - Since points (A), (B), (C), (D) are in order, (AD) can be split into:      [      AD = AB + BC + CD      ]       4.

To show this inequality, we need to compare the distances of different segments:    - Apply triangle inequalities in triangles (AED) and (EBC):      [      AE + ED > AD      ]      and since (E) is not on the line (AD):      [      AD = AB + BC + CD > BE + CE.      ]    Since (AE + ED) spans over (BE + CE), the inequality (AE + ED > BE + CE) certainly holds. 6. Therefore, for any other cases where (AB neq CD) the term (|AB - CD|) ensures the left-hand side of the inequality is greater making it impossible for (BE + CE) to sum up to it, adhering to the properties of distance and points not on the straight line.

This ensures that any cell at the intersection of a given row and column receives its respective row's color. 4. **Verify no four-cell condition:**    Consider any four cells that would form a rectangle. They lie at the intersection of two different rows and two different columns:    - By construction, the same rows will have the same colors, and the same columns will have different colors.    - Thus, there would be only three or fewer distinct colors, as at least one row or column's color will be repeated within the rectangle formed. 5. **Proving (k geq 2n):**    Now it suffices to show that if (k geq 2n) colors are used, then there must be a rectangle with all four different colors:    - Consider a bipartite graph with vertices representing rows and columns.    - An edge between a row and column vertex indicates the color used at their intersection on the grid.    - Given (2n) vertices, draw edges representing the distinct colors used at each intersection. 6. **Graph argument and cycle length:**    - By coloring using (k geq 2n) and knowing each row and column must at least connect to (2n) vertices, we are guaranteed to have at least a four-vertex cycle.    - In a bipartite setting, any color arrangement connecting each row to each column implies combining distinct edges of new colors in enough overlap. 7. **Conclusion:**     Therefore, for (k geq 2n), there exists no arrangement without repeating colors' involvement.

Part (a): To determine which switch controls which lamp in one trip to the basement, the person can follow these steps: 1. **Turn on the First Switch:** Turn on the first switch and leave it on for a few minutes (enough time for the lamp to warm up). 2. **Turn on the Second Switch:** After a few minutes, turn off the first switch and immediately turn on the second switch. 3. **Do Not Touch the Third Switch:** Leave the third switch in its original, off position.

Using the Law of Sines in triangles (triangle ACD) and (triangle BCD):    [    frac{k_3}{sin gamma_1} = frac{frac{c}{2}}{sin alpha} quad text{and} quad frac{k_3}{sin gamma_2} = frac{frac{c}{2}}{sin beta}    ] 4. This leads to the equations:    [    k_3 = frac{c}{2} cdot frac{sin alpha}{sin gamma_1}    ]    [    k_3 = frac{c}{2} cdot frac{sin beta}{sin gamma_2}    ] 5. Dividing these equations:    [    frac{sin alpha}{sin beta} = frac{sin gamma_1}{sin gamma_2}    ] 6. Adding and subtracting these trigonometric terms:    [    frac{sin alpha + sin beta}{sin alpha - sin beta} = frac{sin gamma_1 + sin gamma_2}{sin gamma_1 - sin gamma_2}    ] 7. Using tangent relations:    [    frac{tan frac{gamma_1 + gamma_2}{2}}{tan frac{gamma_1 - gamma_2}{2}} = frac{tan frac{alpha + beta}{2}}{tan frac{alpha - beta}{2}}    ] 8. Hence:    [    tan frac{gamma_1 - gamma_2}{2} = frac{tan frac{alpha - beta}{2}}{tan frac{alpha + beta}{2}} cdot tan frac{gamma_1 + gamma_2}{2}    ]    Ultimately:    [    tan frac{gamma_1 - gamma_2}{2} = frac{tan frac{alpha - beta}{2}}{tan frac{alpha + beta}{2}} cdot cot frac{alpha + beta}{2}    ] 9. With this equation, we can solve for ( gamma_1 ) and ( gamma_2 ) since:    [    gamma_1 + gamma_2 text{ is known}    ] 10. Finally, using the found angles (gamma_1) and (gamma_2), compute the remaining parts of the triangles (triangle ADC) and (triangle BDC).  Second Solution Approach: 1. If (epsilon = angle CDB), then the Law of Cosines and the median length give:    [    a^2 = frac{c^2}{4} + k_3^2 + k_3 cdot c cdot cos epsilon    ]    [    b^2 = frac{c^2}{4} + k_3^2 - k_3 cdot c cdot cos epsilon    ] 2. From these, we add:    [    2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2 = 4k_3^2    ] 3. Substitute the sine rule expressions:    [    a = frac{c sin alpha}{sin gamma}, quad b = frac{c sin beta}{sin gamma}    ] 4. Thus:    [    c^2 = frac{4k_3^2 sin^2 gamma}{2sin^2 alpha + 2sin^2 beta - sin^2 gamma}    ]  Conclusion [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"10.25 people are lined up in a row, each of whom either tells the truth or lies.

Recall that in an equiangular (n)-gon, each interior angle is given by     [    theta = frac{(n-2) times 180^circ}{n} = frac{4 times 180^circ}{6} = 120^circ.    ] 2. To demonstrate that (|B C - E F| = |D E - A B| = |A F - C D|), we need to construct a geometrical model as follows:    - Construct a triangle (PQR) whose vertices lie at particular intersections of the diagonals of the hexagon. This step follows the methodology outlined in a previous reference (mentioned but not detailed). 3. Given that the hexagon (A B C D E F) is equiangular:    - The diagonals (AB), (CD), and (EF) are parallel to each other as they all subtend the same angle (theta = 120^circ).    - Similarly, the diagonals (AF), (BC), and (DE) are parallel, also subtending (theta = 120^circ). 4. To find the equality of the segments' lengths:    - (|PQ| = |AB - DE|),    - (|QR| = |CD - AF|),    - (|PR| = |EF - BC|). 5. Since the hexagon is equiangular:    - The constructed triangle (PQR) has equal side lengths because the pairwise differences of these segments result from the same structure of diagonal intersections. Returning to the equiangular property, each segment in the hexagon is directly translated to a side in the triangle (PQR). 6. Therefore, triangle (PQR) must be equilateral with equal side lengths, implying:    [    |PQ| = |QR| = |PR|.    ]    Substituting back the lengths from the original problem:    [    |AB - DE| = |CD - AF| = |EF - BC|.    ] # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that  [ |BC - EF| = |DE - AB| = |AF - CD|. ] The result concludes that the segments are equal: [ boxed{|BC - EF| = |DE - AB| = |AF - CD|} ]"},{"instruction":"Cara is in a group photo with her seven friends.

Since speed and time are inversely proportional (assuming the distance is constant), the time taken at this slower speed is ( T - 5 ) minutes.

The least possible value of z - x is 9.

Let's assume the smallest even integer for x to start with is 0 (since x is an even integer, 0 is a valid choice). The smallest odd integer greater than 0 by more than 5 would be 7 (since 7 - 0 = 7, which is greater than 5). However, since x must be an even integer, and we want to find the least possible value of x, we can't use 0 because it wouldn't satisfy the condition for z - x. Now, let's consider the condition for z. The least possible value of z - x is 9, which means z must be at least 9 greater than x. Since z is an odd integer, if we start with x = 0, the smallest odd integer that is at least 9 greater than 0 would be 9 itself. But 9 - 0 = 9, which is the least possible value for z - x. However, we need to ensure that y - x > 5 as well. If x = 0, y would need to be at least 7 (the smallest odd integer greater than 5). But if y is 7, then z must be greater than 7 to maintain z - x = 9. The next odd integer after 7 is 9, which would make z = 9. So, if x = 0, y = 7, and z = 9, we have: - y - x = 7 - 0 = 7, which is greater than 5. - z - x = 9 - 0 = 9, which is the least possible value for z - x.
