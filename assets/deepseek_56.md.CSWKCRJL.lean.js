Let m_a, m_b, and m_c be the medians corresponding to sides a, b, and c, respectively. 2. **Express Perimeter**: The perimeter P of the triangle is given by: [ P = a + b + c ] 3. **Median Properties**: Recall that the medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid, which divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. For simplicity, we consider the medians intersect at a single point dividing the triangle into smaller segments. 4. **Apply the Triangle Inequality**: Consider the triangle inequalities for the segments: [ 3m_a < 2a + 2c ] [ 3m_b < 2b + 2c ] [ 3m_c < a + b ] 5. **Sum of Two Medians**: We add the above inequalities: [ 3m_a + 3m_b < 2a + 2c + 2b + 2c ] Simplifying, [ 3(m_a + m_b) < 2(a + b + c) ] 6. **Final Multiplication to Conclude**: Divide both sides by 2: [ m_a + m_b < frac{2}{3}(a + b + c) ] Since frac{3}{4}P = frac{3}{4}(a + b + c), it follows that, [ m_a + m_b le frac{3}{4}P ] Therefore, the sum of any two medians is not greater than 3/4 of the triangle's perimeter.

By testing divisors of 120, we find that if gcd(n,120) = 60, then mathop{text{lcm}}[n,120] = 60 + 300 = 360.

Define ( b_i = x a_i ). Then, ( phi(b_i) = phi(a_i) phi(x) ) for all ( 1 le i le k ). 4. **Finding ( y ):** - We need to find a positive integer ( y ) such that ( phi(b_1) < y - 1 < y < 2y < b_1 ). - By Bertrand's Postulate, there exists a prime ( p ) such that ( p < b_1 ) and ( phi(p) = p - 1 > phi(b_1) ). 5. **Choosing ( x ):** - Let ( x = q_1 q_2 cdots q_l ) for some positive integer ( l ), where ( q_1 < q_2 < cdots < q_l ) are the consecutive primes greater than the largest prime dividing any ( a_i ). - Then, [ frac{b_1}{phi(b_1)} > left(1 + frac{1}{q_1 - 1}right) left(1 + frac{1}{q_2 - 1}right) cdots left(1 + frac{1}{q_l - 1}right) ge frac{1}{q_1} + frac{1}{q_2} + cdots + frac{1}{q_l} ] - The sum of the reciprocals of the primes ( 2, 3, 5, cdots ) is known to diverge.

Note: The sequences of positive integers considered in this problem can have more than 5 elements.","output":"Part (a) Given n = 7, we aim to find the sequence of integers that maximizes the number of inversions. 1. **Determine Sequence Properties**: - We note that to maximize inversions, the sequence should be non-increasing. This ensures that there are no missed opportunities for inversions just by the order of elements. 2. **Evaluate All Possible Non-Increasing Sequences Sum to 7**: - List all possible non-increasing sequences where the sum of elements equals 7. - For each sequence, calculate the number of inversions. Here is a table showing examples of such sequences and their number of inversions: | Sequence | Inversions | Sequence | Inversions | |:-------------:|:----------:|:--------------:|:----------:| | (6,1) | 1 | (5,2) | 1 | | (5,1,1) | 2 | (4,3) | 1 | | (4,2,1) | 3 | (4,1,1,1) | 3 | | (3,3,1) | 2 | (3,2,2) | 2 | | (3,2,1,1) | 5 | (3,1,1,1,1) | 4 | | (2,2,2,1) | 3 | (2,2,1,1,1) | 6 | | (2,1,1,1,1,1) | 5 | (1,1,1,1,1,1,1) | 0 | 3. **Identify the Sequence with Maximum Inversions**: - From the table, it is clear that the sequence with the highest number of inversions is (2,2,1,1,1), which has 6 inversions. Conclusion: Thus, the maximum number of inversions for n = 7 is: boxed{6} Part (b) Given n = 2019, we want the sequence that maximizes the number of inversions. 1. **Simplify the Problem**: - Any optimal non-increasing sequence with sum 2019 should only contain 1s and 2s. Assume otherwise that there exists a number k > 2. - Replacing such k by two elements k-1 and 1 at different positions (original and end respectively), this operation increases the count of inversions, suggesting 1s and 2s are sufficient. 2. **Set up the Sequence**: - Let a be the number of 2’s and 2019 - 2a be the number of 1’s. 3. **Formulate the Inversion Counting Expression**: - The number of inversions in such a sequence would be: a cdot (2019 - 2a) Simplify this to: a cdot 2019 - 2a^2 4. **Optimize the Inversion Count**: - To maximize this, express and solve using calculus or vertex form of a parabola: max left(2019a - 2a^2 right) - Convert into vertex form: 2019a - 2a^2 = frac{2019^2}{8} - 2 left(a - frac{2019}{4}right)^2 - The maximum is reached when a = frac{2019}{4}: a = 505 text{ (as a must be an integer)} 5. **Calculate Maximum Inversions**: - Evaluate: 505 cdot (2019 - 2 cdot 505) = 505 cdot 1009 Solve this product: 505 cdot 1009 = 509545 Conclusion: Thus, the maximum number of inversions for n = 2019 is: boxed{509545}"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=sin (2x+ frac {π}{3})+ tan frac {5π}{6} cdot cos 2x.

For each match played, draw a directed edge from the winning team to the losing team. Consequently, if team A defeats team B, there is a directed edge from vertex A to vertex B. 2. **Indegree and Outdegree:** Given that every team has exactly 10 wins and 10 losses, each vertex in this directed graph has an outdegree of 10 and an indegree of 10. An outdegree of 10 means there are 10 edges going out from the vertex, representing 10 wins, and an indegree of 10 means there are 10 edges coming into the vertex, representing 10 losses. 3. **Choosing Starting Point:** Pick any vertex, say vertex A, which represents some team in the tournament. 4. **Exploring the Edges:** From vertex A, follow an outgoing edge to vertex B (since there are 10 outgoing edges, pick one arbitrarily), then follow an outgoing edge from vertex B to some vertex C, and continue this process. [ A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow cdots ] Here, eventually, due to the finiteness of vertices and equal indegree and outdegree, you must revisit a vertex, because each vertex you leave still has remaining unused edges.

This cycle consists of sequences of wins and losses with victory paths forming the edges. 6. **Identification of the Required Matches:** The cycle formed in the previous step represents a sequence of matches where each team has exactly one win and one loss.

We know from the problem statement that the average of these six numbers is 16.

Let's denote the combined effect of changing all digit \\"2\\"s to \\"4\\"s as an increase in value. For simplicity, let’s consider how this transformation affects each individual digit “2” in any position. Changing a \\"2\\" to a \\"4\\" increases that specific digit by 2 (i.e., (4 - 2 = 2)). We seek to maximize the new average after the transformation. This can be achieved by maximizing the number of digits \\"2\\" available for transformation. Each transformation results in an overall increase in the total sum of the numbers. Let's assume digit \\"2\\" appears (n) times in the six numbers. Then increasing each occurrence by 2 overall increases the sum by (2n).

The maximum (n) can be is determined by the digits available in six natural numbers. Given that we're not restricted to any particular upper bound for these six natural numbers, we can increase (n) to its highest possibilities theoretically. Practically, let’s assume the maximum number (n) could theoretically take a large value depending on how significant all digits can change. Rewriting the new average: [ text{New average} = 16 + frac{2n}{6} = 16 + frac{n}{3} ] To maximize the new average, consider the highest practical value (n) can take. Let’s assume all positions of all six numbers are '2’s, which gives us an extreme case where there is a high number of digits. For simplicity, suppose each number can have multiple ‘2’ digits, let’s consider 10 digits of ‘2’’s accessible.

Let's consider the sequence (a_n) such that each term (a_n) equals the greatest power of 2 that divides (n).

We need to verify whether this sequence is periodic. A sequence is periodic if there exists a natural number (T) such that (a_{k} = a_{k+T}) for any natural number (k). 3.

For example: - Powers of 2 themselves yield different results: (a_1 = 1), (a_2 = 2), (a_4 = 4), (a_8 = 8), etc. - Between these indices, there is no repeating fixed pattern that can signify a periodic sequence. - The presence of infinitely many distinct terms further confirms non-periodicity. 5. However, for any index (k), it is possible to find a (t) such that (a_k = a_{k+t} = a_{k+2t} = ldots). Specifically, let (t = 2k). This works because each term that is a multiple of (k) (e.g., (k, 3k, 5k, ldots)) shares the same greatest power of 2 as (k) when multiplied by an odd number: [ a_k = a_{3k} = a_{5k} = a_{7k} = ldots ] This is due to the fact that multiplying (k) by an odd number doesn't add any additional powers of 2 to the product. 6.

Starting with (1,2,4), the next possible non-overlapping group using adjacent and three spots away rule is (3,5,7), followed by (6,8,10) and (9,11,12). 5. **Total Number of Ways**: Each of the four groups has distinct group members and no overlap between groups. Therefore, there's exactly 1 way to form these groups based on given constraints. # Conclusion: The problem constraints and the circle structure allow for exactly one way to form four groups of three people each where every member knows the other within the group.

Our goal is then to determine the values of n given (b) holds for specific k. 2. **Considering Condition (a) for Several Values of k**: - For k neq 1, k neq 2: Clearly, in these cases, forming an arithmetic progression of binomial coefficients is trivial as for k=1, any single term considers C_n^j alone and for k=2, the properties of binomial coefficients do not strictly form arithmetic sequences. - Consider case k=3: Let's consider three consecutive terms, C_n^{j-1}, C_n^j, C_n^{j+1} for 1 leq j leq n-1. Suppose these form an arithmetic sequence, then: [ 2C_n^j = C_n^{j-1} + C_n^{j+1} ] Simplify using properties of binomial coefficients: [ 2 frac{n!}{j!(n-j)!} = frac{n!}{(j-1)!(n-(j-1))!} + frac{n!}{(j+1)!(n-(j+1))!} ] After simplification, it reduces to the polynomial equation: [ n + 2 = (n - 2j)^2. ] Thus n + 2 is a perfect square. 3. **Conclusion for k=3**: Since we can find n such that n+2 is a perfect square, k=3 thus satisfies condition (b) but not (a). 4. **Consideration for k=4**: Next, explore k=4: Suppose C_n^j, C_n^{j+1}, C_n^{j+2} form an arithmetic progression: - Following similar steps, we solve: [ 2C_n^{j+1} = C_n^j + C_n^{j+2}. ] This reduces to: [ n + 2 = (n - 2(j+1))^2. ] Which implies: [ |n - 2j - 2| = |n - 2j - 4| ] This implies: [ n - 2j - 2 = -(n - 2j - 4) quad implies quad n = 2j + 3. ] Leading to contradiction as the sequences would overlap. 5. **Verification of (a) for k=4**: The set up results in contradictions indicating k=4 satisfies (a): - No valid sequence can form as arithmetic with C_{2j+3}^j falling back equivalencies which cannot be the same essentially forming contradictions in binomial coefficients. - As such k<5 cannot hold arithmetic forms. 6. **Exploring for k<5 and Combining both Conditions (a) and (b)**: Following constraints, k=4 remains valid satisfying (a) while forming sequences indicating (b) where: [ n = m^2 - 2 quad (m in mathbb{N}, mgeq 3). ] # Conclusion: The appropriate integer k satisfying both properties with corresponding n is boxed.

The problem can be broken down into several steps: 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - We are given two bounded subsets ( A ) and ( H ) of (mathbb{R}). - We need to determine if there exists at most one set ( B ) such that the sums ( a + b ) (where ( a in A ) and ( b in B )) are pairwise distinct and ( H = A + B ). 2. **Pairwise Distinct Sums:** - For the sums ( a + b ) to be pairwise distinct, it means that for any ( a_1, a_2 in A ) and ( b_1, b_2 in B ), if ( a_1 + b_1 = a_2 + b_2 ), then ( a_1 = a_2 ) and ( b_1 = b_2 ). 3. **Constructing the Set ( B ):** - We need to construct the set ( B ) such that ( H = A + B ). This means that every element ( h in H ) can be written as ( h = a + b ) for some ( a in A ) and ( b in B ). 4. **Uniqueness of ( B ):** - To prove the uniqueness of ( B ), assume there are two sets ( B_1 ) and ( B_2 ) such that ( H = A + B_1 = A + B_2 ). - For any ( h in H ), there exist ( a_1 in A ) and ( b_1 in B_1 ) such that ( h = a_1 + b_1 ), and there exist ( a_2 in A ) and ( b_2 in B_2 ) such that ( h = a_2 + b_2 ). 5. **Equality of Sums:** - Since the sums are pairwise distinct, if ( a_1 + b_1 = a_2 + b_2 ), then ( a_1 = a_2 ) and ( b_1 = b_2 ). - This implies that for each ( h in H ), the corresponding ( b ) in ( B_1 ) must be the same as the corresponding ( b ) in ( B_2 ). 6. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, ( B_1 = B_2 ), proving that there is at most one set ( B ) such that ( H = A + B ) and the sums ( a + b ) are pairwise distinct.

Prove that if the sum of the angles at vertices P and Q of the quadrilateral is less than 180^{circ}, then the triangle P Q E contains within its interior or on its boundary at least one point other than P or Q that also has integer coordinates.","output":"To express everything more clearly, we will call points with integer coordinates lattice points, and polygons whose vertices are all lattice points will be called lattice polygons. I. Solution: 1. We will show that either the triangle (PQR) or (PQS) contains a lattice point other than its vertices, and, if there is a lattice point inside triangle (EPS) or triangle (EQR), then by replacing vertex (S) or (R) it suffices to prove the statement for a smaller quadrilateral that also satisfies the problem conditions. 2. The statement that the quadrilateral (PQRS) contains some lattice point is clear since a finite number of lattice points exist within the polygon. By repeatedly applying the procedure described, we will eventually reach a configuration where no lattice point is inside the triangles (EPS) or (EQR). Now, according to the first statement, the triangle (PQR) or (PQS) must contain a lattice point that also lies in the triangle (EPQ) and is different from points (P) and (Q). 3. To prove the above, we consider if there exists a lattice point (T) inside the triangle (EQR), implying that replacing (R) by (T) which lies closer to (PQ) than (S), the newly formed quadrilateral (PQT) retains all problem conditions due to the fact that (T) replaces (R). Let's now present the detailed steps: 1. **Assumption and Verification**: Suppose there exists no lattice point within the triangles: - Exhibit that triangle (PQR) or (PQS) contains a lattice point since all vertices are lattice points and the entire polygon (PQRS) cannot be void of lattice points due to its bounded nature. 2. **Translating the Setup**: Denoting the coordinates of vertices (P, R, S, T) as ((p_1, p_2), (r_1, r_2), (s_1, s_2), (t_1, t_2)) respectively, if we assert that constructing parallelogram (P, R, S, T) retains integer coordinates and lattice points. The equations of diagonals: begin{align*} frac{p_1 + r_1}{2} = frac{t_1 + s_1}{2} frac{p_2 + r_2}{2} = frac{t_2 + s_2}{2} end{align*} Solving for (T) we get: begin{equation*} t_i = p_i + r_i - s_i quad text{for } i=1,2 end{equation*} These are indeed integers, verifying the presence of integer-lattice points thus confirms the first part of the desired proof. II. Analysis with General Assertions: Considering any plane lattice asserts: - Any line containing two lattice points will consequently contain infinitely many, equidistantly spaced. Given points (E, F,) and (G) with displacement vectors (vec{e}, vec{f}, vec{g}): Reflecting point (G) across the midpoint between (E) and (F), provides: begin{align*} overrightarrow{GG'} = overrightarrow{GE} + overrightarrow{GF} G' = G + overrightarrow{GE} + overrightarrow{GF} = vec{e} + vec{f} - vec{g} end{align*} Hence (G') is also a lattice point. # The Third Segment: By focusing on parallelogram properties: - Any empty lattice triangle that has no internal or boundary lattice points has an invariant area. Therefore, any scenario where triangles (PQR) and (PQS) dissect into empty lattice triangles disproves the hypothesis (PQSgeq PQR), resolving by theorem application: [ boxed{text{The sum of angles at } P text{ and } Q text{ containing a lattice point continues to hold, thus proving a lattice point exists aligning the statement.}} ] This concludes our required solution with the boxed theorem applied contextually.

Symmetry about the center is another critical property. 2. **Understand the symmetry**: - We know ((1 + 2i)) and ((-1 - 2i)) are symmetric around the center of the square. This symmetry indicates that the center of the square lies on the midpoint of ((1 + 2i)) and ((-1 - 2i)). 3. **Calculate the center (midpoint) of the square**: [ text{Midpoint} = left(frac{(1 + 2i) + (-1 - 2i)}{2}right) = left(frac{0 + 0i}{2}right) = 0 ] So, the center of the square is at (0). 4. **Identify the distances**: - The distance of any vertex from the center should be (sqrt{a^2 + b^2}), where (a) and (b) are the coordinates of a vertex.

We need to show that any plane cutting through the pyramid creates a polygonal section whose perimeter is less than or equal to the perimeter of the largest of these four triangular faces. 2. **Consider a Section Cut by a Plane**: Let's consider a plane intersecting the pyramid and creating a polygonal section. This section can either be a triangle, quadrilateral, or a polygon with more sides. The key insight here is that this section lies entirely within the tetrahedron. 3. **Properties of Perimeter and Intersecting Plane**: - The section formed by the plane can be considered as a projection or intersection of the tetrahedron with the plane. - By the triangle inequality, we know the perimeter of a triangle is less than or equal to the sum of the side lengths. 4. **Comparison to Face Perimeters**: - Denote the lengths of edges of the tetrahedron as DA = a_1, DB = a_2, DC = a_3, AB = a_4, BC = a_5, and CA = a_6. - The perimeter of face triangle DAB is a_1 + a_2 + a_4. - The perimeter of face triangle DBC is a_2 + a_3 + a_5. - The perimeter of face triangle DAC is a_1 + a_3 + a_6. - The perimeter of face triangle ABC is a_4 + a_5 + a_6. 5. **Bounding the Section Perimeter**: - Let the intersecting plane form a polygon whose vertices are intersections of the plane with the edges of the tetrahedron. - No matter how the section cuts through the tetrahedron, every edge it intersects belongs to one of the tetrahedron edges—it cannot exceed the sum of edges from any face. 6. **Maximizing the Perimeter**: - The sum of the edges creating the section per perimeter is constrained because these edges are part of the tetrahedron itself. - Thus, the plane section's perimeter is bounded by the total edge lengths of the tetrahedron faces. Specifically, it cannot exceed the largest triangular face perimeter. 7. **Final Comparison**: - By considering all possible sections and using the boundedness by the face perimeters, we conclude the section’s perimeter remains within the maximum perimeter of any face triangle. # Conclusion: The perimeter of any section of the triangular pyramid DABC made by a plane does not exceed the largest perimeter of its faces. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A plane flies some miles with a tail wind in 3 hours.

Consider the case when (0 < alpha + beta < pi): - If (0 < alpha + beta < frac{pi}{2}), then (cos alpha > cos (frac{pi}{2} - beta) = sin beta > 0). - Hence, (cos^2 alpha > sin^2 beta) and (cos beta > cos (frac{pi}{2} - alpha) = sin alpha > 0 ). 4.

These points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) form the vertices of the quadrilateral we are interested in. 3. **Calculate the angles:** We need to show that the opposite angles of the quadrilateral ( ABCD ) sum to ( 180^circ ). This will prove that the quadrilateral is cyclic. Consider the angle ( angle D ): [ angle D = 180^circ - angle C_2C_1D_2 - angle C_1D_2D_1 ] Since ( angle C_2C_1D_2 ) and ( angle C_1D_2D_1 ) are angles subtended by the arcs ( C_2D_2 ) and ( C_1D_1 ) respectively, we can write: [ angle D = frac{360^circ - text{arc } C_2D_2 - text{arc } C_1D_1}{2} ] 4. **Similarly, calculate ( angle B ):** [ angle B = frac{360^circ - text{arc } A_2B_2 - text{arc } A_1B_1}{2} ] 5. **Use the given equalities:** Since ( A_1B_2 = B_1C_2 = C_1D_2 = D_1A_2 ), the arcs subtended by these chords are equal.

Our goal is to find all possible quadruples ((p, q, r, n)) that solve this equation. Let's start by rearranging and factoring the given equation: [ p^2 - q^2 = r^n ] This can be factored as: [ (p-q)(p+q) = r^n ] Next, we need to consider the possible factorization since ( r ) is a prime number and ( r^n ) must be a product of two factors. Let’s look at the two primary cases: Case 1: ( p - q = 1 ) If ( p - q = 1 ), then ( p = q + 1 ). Substituting this into our factorization: [ (p-q)(p+q) = (1)(p+q) ] [ r^n = p+q ] Since ( p = q + 1 ), this becomes: [ r^n = (q+1) + q ] [ r^n = 2q + 1 ] Since ( q ) and ( r ) are primes and ( r ) divides ( 2q + 1 ), we can test small primes: - Let ( q = 2 ): [ p = q + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 ] [ 3^2 = 2^2 + r^n implies 9 = 4 + r^n implies r^n = 5 ] Since ( r ) is a prime, ( r = 5 ) and ( n = 1 ). So, we have the solution quadruple: [ (p, q, r, n) = (3, 2, 5, 1) ] Case 2: ( p - q > 1 ) For this case, we note the following about the prime number properties: Given ( (p-q)(p+q) = r^n ): Since ( r ) is a prime number, ( p-q ) and ( p+q ) must be powers of ( r ). Let’s set ( p - q = r^a ) and ( p + q = r^b ) such that ( a + b = n ) with ( 1 leq a < b ). Since we deal with primes and powers, both must simplify: [ r^a + r^b = 2p text{ (sums of powers of a prime must look for simple conclusions if it contains a prime element such as 2 based solution)} ] Hence, [ p = frac{r^a + r^b}{2} ] Since ( p ) and ( q ) are also primes, the only practical prime for ( r ) that fits is ( 2 ). Thus, set ( r = 2 ): 1. Assuming ( r = 2 ): [ p - q = 2^a , p + q = 2^b ] Solving this: [ 2^{a} + 2^{b} = 2p implies p = frac{2^{a} + 2^{b}}{2} ] We look at powers suited for prime ( 2 ): - Let ( a = 1 ), then: [ p - q = 2 implies q = 2^{b-1}-1 ] [ p = 2^{b-1}+1 > q ] - We test for validity primes: If ( q ) is prime, e.g., considering: - ( b = 3 ), gives ( p = 5, q = 3 ): [ 2p = 2^{2} + 2^{3-1} implies (2)(5) = 8+4 implies p^2 - q^2 = r^4 ] [ 5^2 = 3^2 + 2^4 ] This implies: [ p^2 = 25 = 9 + 16 = 9 + 2^4 ] Hence, we have the solution: [ (p, q, r, n) = (5, 3, 2, 4) ] # Conclusion: Combining both cases, the valid solutions are: [ boxed{(3, 2, 5, 1)} quad text{and} quad boxed{(5, 3, 2, 4)} ]"},{"instruction":"f 9x^{2}+mxy+16y^{2} is a perfect square trinomial, then the value of m is: A: 24 B: 12 C: pm 12 D: pm 24","output":"To determine the value of m for which 9x^{2}+mxy+16y^{2} is a perfect square trinomial, we compare it to the square of a binomial.

When they work together, their combined work rate per day is: (1/15) + (1/20) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60 (the least common multiple of 15 and 20).

Let's find S(n) for some n: - S(1) = frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1 - S(2) = frac{2(2+1)}{2} = 3 - S(3) = frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6 Continuing this way would be inefficient, so let's use the explicit formula to find an n such that S(n) geq 100. Assuming S(n) geq 100, frac{n(n+1)}{2} geq 100, n^2 + n geq 200, n^2 + n - 200 geq 0. Looking for integral solutions of the quadratic equation, n^2 + n - 200 = 0, we can estimate the value by trial and error or solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, n = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, where a=1, b=1, and c=-200. n = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 800}}{2}, n = frac{-1 pm sqrt{801}}{2}. We discard the negative root because we are looking for a positive n, and we approximate the positive root: n approx frac{-1 + sqrt{801}}{2}, n approx frac{-1 + 28.3}{2}, n approx 13.65. Since n must be an integer, we consider n=14 because S(13) < 100 and S(14) is the smallest sum larger than 100. Calculating S(14), S(14) = frac{14(14+1)}{2} = frac{14 cdot 15}{2} = 7 cdot 15 = 105. Thus, the 14 repeated 14 times is the 105th term, which means that the 100th term is also 14, as it falls in the block of fourteen 14's from terms 92 to 105 (105 - 14 = 91, so the block starts at term 92).

First, we identify the key elements of the problem: - Square ABCD with side length 1. - Equilateral triangle AEF. - A smaller square with one vertex at B and sides parallel to ABCD, and a side length denoted as s. Given these elements, we proceed as follows: 1. **Determine the Similarity Ratio**: The smaller square and the larger square share a similar orientation, which implies that triangles AA'D' and D'C'E are similar by AA~ (Angle-Angle similarity). This similarity gives us a proportion between their sides: [ frac{AA'}{A'D'} = frac{D'C'}{C'E} Longrightarrow frac{1 - s}{s} = frac{s}{1 - s - CE} ] Simplifying this proportion, we find: [ s^2 = (1 - s)(1 - s - CE) ] 2. **Calculate AE and CE**: - By geometry, angle EAF = 60^circ, leading to angle BAE = 15^circ. Using the half-angle formula for cosine, we find cos 15^circ = frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4}. Since cos 15^circ = frac{1}{AE}, we solve for AE: [ AE = frac{4}{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}} cdot frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}} = sqrt{6} - sqrt{2} ] - Given that triangle AEF is equilateral, EF = AE = sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}. - For triangle CEF, a 45-45-90 triangle, CE = frac{AE}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{3} - 1. 3. **Solve for s**: Substituting CE = sqrt{3} - 1 into the equation from step 1, we get: [ s^2 = (1 - s)(2 - sqrt{3} - s) ] Solving for s, we find: [ (3 - sqrt{3})s = 2 - sqrt{3} Longrightarrow s = frac{2 - sqrt{3}}{3 - sqrt{3}} cdot frac{3 + sqrt{3}}{3 + sqrt{3}} = frac{3 - sqrt{3}}{6} ] Therefore, the length of a side of the smaller square is frac{3 - sqrt{3}}{6}, and when we express this in the form frac{a-sqrt{b}}{c}, we have a = 3, b = 3, and c = 6.

Using the formula for speed again: [ V_{text{relative}} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Time}} = frac{240 text{ m}}{7.5 text{ s}} = 32 text{ m/s} ] Now we can solve for ( V_1 ): [ V_1 = V_{text{relative}} - V_2 = 32 text{ m/s} - 8 text{ m/s} = 24 text{ m/s} ] Finally, we can find the time taken by the first train to cross the telegraph post using the speed we just calculated: [ text{Time} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Speed}} = frac{120 text{ m}}{24 text{ m/s}} = 5 text{ s} ] So, the first train takes boxed{5} seconds to cross the telegraph post."},{"instruction":"10 people attend a conference.

We construct a point ( X ) on ( m ) and points ( Y ) and ( Z ) on ( l ) such that ( XY ) tangents ( w_1 ) and ( XZ ) tangents ( w_2 ). We need to prove that the centers of the incircles of triangle ( XYZ ) lie on a single straight line. 1. **Setup the point ( S )**: Note that the incircle of ( XYZ ) meets ( YZ ) at point ( S ). Let ( Y_1, Z_1 ) be the points where incircles of the triangles ( XYD ) and ( XZD ) tangent ( YD ) and ( ZD ), respectively. 2. **Utilize point ( D )**: We observe that ( D ) is a fixed point. We need to show that the length of segment ( DS ) is fixed. Since ( D ) is fixed, it's sufficient to show that ( DS ) remains constant regardless of the choice of ( X ). 3. **Express lengths via semiperimeters**: For the triangle ( XYD ): [ XS = p_{XYZ} - XY_1 - YD ] where ( p_{XYZ} ) is the semiperimeter of (triangle XYZ). For the triangle ( XZD ): [ DZ = p_{XYZ} - XZ_1 - ZD ] 4. **Calculation of differences**: Calculate the difference: [ p_{XYZ} - XY - XZ = frac{1}{2} (XY + YZ + XZ) - XY - XZ ] Thus, the lengths involving the incircles can be reduced to: [ XS - D = left( p_{XYZ} - XY right) - left( p_{XYL} - XL right) ] Simplifying this difference: [ XS - D = frac{1}{2} (XY + XZ + ZL - 2XL + XY - XZ - XL) ] 5. **Final transformation**: Simplifying further: [ DS = LK ] where ( L ) and ( K ) are fixed points on lines ( l ) and ( m ), respectively. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, ( D ) being fixed ensures that ( S ) is also fixed.

Since f'(x) < 0 on the interval (a, b), we deduce that f(x) is strictly decreasing on this interval. 2. As x gets closer to b from the left side of (a, b), the values of f(x) will keep decreasing until they approach the value of f(b). 3.

Initially, we will show that for ( n geq 2alpha + 3 ), the equality ( f(n+1) - f(n) = f(n) - f(n-1) ) holds. This implies the function has a constant difference between consecutive terms. 3. Suppose there exists an integer ( u ) such that: [ f(n+1) - f(n) = f(u+1) - f(u), quad f(n) - f(n-1) = f(u+1) - f(u). ] By using the additive property of the function, these equations can be rewritten as: [ f(n+1) + f(u) = f(n) + f(u+1). ] By the problem’s condition, if: [ alpha(n+1) leqslant u < (alpha + 1)(n+1), quad alpha n leqslant u + 1 < (alpha + 1)n, ] then it follows that: [ alpha(n+1) leqslant u < u+1 < (alpha + 1)n. ] 4. Integrating the symmetrical logic for another interval leads to the conclusion: [ alpha n leqslant u < u + 1 < (alpha + 1)(n-1). ] Thus, combining both inequalities, we derive: [ (alpha + 1)(n-1) - alpha(n+1) = n - 2alpha - 1 geq 2. ] Given that ( n geq 2alpha + 3 ), this condition holds. 5. Assume ( n_0 ) is an integer such that ( n_0 - 1 < 2alpha + 3 leq n_0 ), hence ( n_0 geq 3 ). For ( n geq n_0 - 1 ): [ f(n+1) - f(n) = f(n_0) - f(n_0 - 1), ] and therefore: [ f(n) = (n - n_0 + 1) left[f(n_0) - f(n_0 - 1)right] + f(n_0 - 1). ] 6. Let's substitute integers ( k ) and ( m ) such that ( m geq n_0 ), ( alpha m geq n_0 ), ( alpha m leq k < (alpha + 1)m ). Using the initial condition ( f(k+m) = f(k) + f(m) ), we obtain: [ begin{aligned} (k+m-n_0+1)left[f(n_0) - f(n_0 - 1)right] + f(n_0-1) &= (k-n_0+1)left[f(n_0) - f(n_0 - 1)right] + f(n_0-1) &+ (m-n_0+1)left[f(n_0) - f(n_0 - 1)right] + f(n_0-1). end{aligned} ] 7.

Substituting back, we find ( f(n) = b n ) for ( n geq n_0 - 1 ). Now, we validate that for all positive integers ( n ), ( f(n) = b n ). Suppose ( f(n) neq b n ) for the largest integer ( n_1 ). For ( alpha > 1 ), choosing integer ( k ) such that: [ alpha n_1 leq k < (alpha + 1) n_1 implies k > n_1, quad k + n_1 > n_1, ] implies: [ f(k + n_1) = f(k) + f(n_1), quad f(n_1) = (k + n_1)b - k b = n_1 b, ] leading to a contradiction. 9. For ( alpha leq 1 ), where ( alpha n_1 leq n_1 < (alpha + 1) n_1 ): [ 2n_1 = f(2n_1) = f(n_1) + f(n_1), ] thus: [ f(n_1) = n_1 b, ] leading to a contradiction. 10.

According to the information given, he took ( x + 630 ) selfies this year. The total number of selfies in his gallery is the sum of the selfies from last year and this year, which is ( 2430 ). Therefore, we can write the equation: [ x + (x + 630) = 2430 ] Combining like terms, we get: [ 2x + 630 = 2430 ] Subtracting 630 from both sides, we get: [ 2x = 2430 - 630 ] [ 2x = 1800 ] Dividing both sides by 2, we find: [ x = 900 ] So, Malachi took 900 selfies last year. The number of selfies he took this year is ( 900 + 630 = 1530 ). The ratio of the number of selfies he took last year to this year is: [ frac{900}{1530} ] To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 90: [ frac{900 div 90}{1530 div 90} = frac{10}{17} ] So, the ratio of the number of selfies Malachi took last year to this year is ( boxed{10:17} )."},{"instruction":"The slope of the line x+sqrt{3}y1=0 is ( ).

A draw is possible. What is more likely to happen in such a match: that the total number of goals scored will be even or that it will be odd?","output":"1. Let ( p ) be the probability that the total number of goals scored in a football match is even. Consequently, the probability that the total number of goals scored is odd is ( q = 1 - p ). 2. Consider each half of the match separately. Let ( p_1 ) be the probability that the number of goals scored in the first half is even, and let ( q_1 = 1 - p_1 ) be the probability that the number of goals scored in the first half is odd. The same reasoning applies to the second half of the match, with probabilities ( p_1 ) and ( q_1 ). 3. We assume that the goals scored in the second half of the match are independent of the goals scored in the first half. Thus, the overall number of goals scored in the match can be analyzed by combining the outcomes of the two halves. 4. The total number of even goals in the match can occur in two ways: - An even number of goals in both halves. - An odd number of goals in both halves. Therefore, the probability of an even total number of goals is: [ p = p_1 cdot p_1 + q_1 cdot q_1 = p_1^2 + (1 - p_1)^2 = p_1^2 + 1 - 2p_1 + p_1^2 = 2p_1^2 - 2p_1 + 1 ] 5. The total number of odd goals in the match can only occur if one half has an even number of goals and the other half has an odd number of goals. Hence, the probability of an odd total number of goals is: [ q = 2p_1 q_1 = 2p_1 (1 - p_1) = 2p_1 - 2p_1^2 ] 6. To determine which of ( p ) or ( q ) is greater, let’s calculate ( p - q ): [ p - q = (p_1^2 + (1 - p_1)^2) - 2p_1(1 - p_1) = p_1^2 + (1 - 2p_1 + p_1^2) - 2p_1 + 2p_1^2 ] Simplify, [ p - q = p_1^2 + 1 - 2p_1 + p_1^2 -(2p_1 - 2p_1^2) = p_1^2 + 1 - 2p_1 + p_1^2 + 2p_1^2 - 2p_1 + 1 ] Combine like terms, [ p - q = p_1^2 - q_1^2)p_1^2 - (p_1 - q_1)^2 = left(p_1 - (1 - p_1) right)^2 ] Therefore, [ p - q = left(p_1 - q_1 right)^2 geq 0 ] 7. Since ( (p_1 - q_1)^2 geq 0 ), this demonstrates that ( p geq q ). 8. We further validate that ( p neq q ) through the following argument: - If we continue dividing the match into smaller segments using ( k )-th segments, the probability of scoring at least one goal in a very short interval tends to zero because football goals are sparse events. As ( p_k approx 1 ), we can say ( p_k > q_k ). Thus, [ p - q = (p_k - q_k)^{2k} > 0 ] # Conclusion: Since ( p = q ) cannot happen and ( p geq q ), we conclude that the probability of the total number of goals being even is higher than it being odd.

This means the sequence is T, H, T, H, ..., T, H. 2. **First Move**: On the first move, Vera can flip any coin. Let's denote the coins as ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{2023} ). The first move can be any ( C_i ). 3. **Subsequent Moves**: On subsequent moves, Vera can only flip a coin adjacent to the coin she flipped on the previous move. 4. **Objective**: The goal is to determine the smallest number of moves required to make all coins heads-up. 5. **Strategy for Attainability**: - Consider the sequence ( S_m = (4m, 4m+1, 4m, 4m+1, 4m+2, 4m+1, 4m+2, 4m+3) ). - Number the coins ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, 2023 ). - The sequence of moves can be: ( 2, 1, 2, 3, S_2, S_3, S_4, ldots, S_{505} ). 6. **Explanation of Sequence**: - The sequence ( S_k ) ensures that each coin is flipped the required number of times to achieve heads-up. - The last coin in ( S_k ) is ( 4k+3 ), which is adjacent to ( 4(k+1)-1 ), ensuring that the moves are always adjacent. 7. **Flipping Pattern**: - Odd-numbered coins are flipped once or thrice, resulting in heads-up. - Even-numbered coins are flipped twice, resulting in heads-up. 8. **Proof of Bound**: - Both the first and last coins must be flipped at least once. - By the Discrete Intermediate Value Theorem, each coin must be flipped at least once. - Assume three consecutive coins ( i-1, i, i+1 ) (not including 1 or 2023) are flipped once, twice, once respectively. - This implies ( i ) is even, and ( 4 leq i leq 2020 ). - This leads to a contradiction as either ( i-2 ) or ( i+2 ) is not flipped, but ( 2 leq i-2 leq 2022 ). 9. **Minimum Moves Calculation**: - For every four consecutive coins ( 4m-2, 4m-1, 4m, 4m+1 ) (excluding 1 or 2023), we need at least ( 2+1+2+3 = 8 ) flips. - Summing over ( m = 1, 2, 3, ldots, 505 ): [ 1 + 1 + 2 + 8 times 505 = 4044 ] 10. **Conclusion**: The smallest possible number of moves Vera can make to reach a state in which every coin is heads-up is 4044.

Hence, the equation becomes: [ fleft(frac{1}{x}right) + 2f(x) = frac{3}{x} ] Substituting back ( x ) in terms of ( y ), we get: [ f(y) + 2fleft(frac{1}{y}right) = frac{3}{y} ] 3. **System of Equations:** Now we have the following system of equations: [ f(x) + 2fleft(frac{1}{x}right) = 3x quad text{(i)} ] [ fleft(frac{1}{x}right) + 2f(x) = frac{3}{x} quad text{(ii)} ] 4. **Linear Combination:** To solve for ( f(x) ), we multiply equation ((i)) by 2: [ 2f(x) + 4fleft(frac{1}{x}right) = 6x ] Then we subtract equation ((ii)) from this result: [ 2f(x) + 4fleft(frac{1}{x}right) - left( fleft(frac{1}{x}right) + 2f(x) right) = 6x - frac{3}{x} ] Simplifying, we get: [ 3fleft(frac{1}{x}right) = 6x - frac{3}{x} ] Solving for ( fleft(frac{1}{x}right) ): [ fleft(frac{1}{x}right) = 2x - frac{1}{x} ] 5. **Substitution Back:** Substitute ( fleft(frac{1}{x}right) ) back into equation ((i)): [ f(x) + 2left(2x - frac{1}{x}right) = 3x ] Simplifying this, we get: [ f(x) + 4x - frac{2}{x} = 3x ] Solving for ( f(x) ): [ f(x) = 3x - 4x + frac{2}{x} = -x + frac{2}{x} ] Thus: [ f(x) = frac{2 - x^2}{x} ] 6. **Checking for Even Function:** The equation additionally specifies ( f(x) = f(-x) ). For ( f(x) ) to be an even function: [ f(-x) = frac{2 - (-x)^2}{-x} = frac{2 - x^2}{-x} ] For this to match the original function: [ frac{2 - x^2}{x} = frac{-(2 - x^2)}{x} ] This does not hold generally for all ( x neq 0 ). 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, under the condition ( f(x) = f(-x) ), no function satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

Thus, ( OE ) and ( OF ) are perpendicular to ( BC ) and ( AD ), respectively. This gives us: [ angle OEB = 90^circ quad text{and} quad angle OFD = 90^circ ] 3. **Inscribed Angles in the Circle:** - ( PE ) and ( PF ) are both tangent to circle ( O ) at points ( E ) and ( F ).

This means ( O, K, ) and ( E ) share a right-angled vertex. 6. **Proving Right Angles at ( K ) and ( N ):** - We further observe that ( angle AOK ) and ( angle DON ) are each ( 90^circ ), making ( K ) and ( N ) potential points for the circumcircle involving diametrically opposed points. 7. **Conclusion: Circle through Four Points:** - The previous steps establish that both ( angle KOB = angle KNM = 90^circ ) and these two common right angles provide the quadrilateral ( OKMN ) the necessary constraint to be cyclic. - Thus, by definition of cyclic quadrilaterals and their properties of inscribed angles, points ( O, K, M, ) and ( N ) are indeed concyclic—they lie on the same circle. # Final Conclusion: [ boxed{O, K, M, text{ and } N text{ all lie on the same circle.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let triangle XYZ be a right triangle with Y as the right angle.

The side lengths of triangle XYZ become: - (13 times frac{5}{7}, 14 times frac{5}{7}, 15 times frac{5}{7}) - Simplifying, (13 times frac{5}{7} = frac{65}{7}, 14 times frac{5}{7} = 10, 15 times frac{5}{7} = frac{75}{7}) - Perimeter of triangle XYZ = frac{65}{7} + 10 + frac{75}{7} = frac{150}{7} + 10 = frac{220}{7}) The circle covers this perimeter once all around, hence the total distance Q travels is ( frac{220}{7} ) units.

Show that there exists an integer ( N ) such that for all integers ( x geq N ), the number ( P(x) ) is divisible by a prime number greater than 20. 1. **Introduction and Initial Assumption**: We start by recognizing that there are exactly 8 prime numbers less than or equal to 20, which are (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19). Since (P(x)) is a product of 9 factors, we can utilize the pigeonhole principle. 2. **Proof by Contradiction**: Assume, for contradiction, that there are infinitely many integers ( n ) such that (P(n)) is not divisible by any prime greater than 20. Hence, for such integers ( n ), ( P(n) ) has all prime factors less than or equal to 20. 3. **Choosing Prime Factors**: By the pigeonhole principle, with 9 factors and only 8 primes less than or equal to 20, there must be at least one prime ( p ) among (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19) that divides at least two of the factors ( n+d_i ) and ( n+d_j ) for some ( i neq j ). 4. **Divisibility Argument**: For the prime ( p ) and indices ( i ) and ( j ), if ( p ) divides both ( n+d_i ) and ( n+d_j ), then ( p ) divides their difference: [ p mid (n + d_i) - (n + d_j) implies p mid (d_i - d_j) ] Since ( d_i ) and ( d_j ) are distinct integers, ( d_i - d_j ) is non-zero, and thus, we have finitely many possible values for ( d_i - d_j ). 5. **Unbounded Sequence**: By assumption, there exists a sequence ((x_n)) such that for all ( n ), ( P(x_n) ) has no prime factors greater than 20. The sequence ( (x_n + d_1)_n ) is unbounded. Therefore, there exists a prime ( p_1 < 20 ) for which the sequence of ( p_1 )-adic valuations ( (v_{p_1}(x_n + d_1))_n ) is unbounded. 6. **Subsequent Primes**: By extracting a subsequence if necessary, we can assume the ( p_1 )-adic valuation ( v_{p_1}((y_n + d_1)_n) ) tends to (infty ) for some subsequence ((y_n)). Repeating this argument for each (d_i), we find primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_9 ) such that the valuations ( v_{p_i}((x_n + d_i)_n) ) tend to (infty). 7. **Pigeonhole Principle Applied**: Since there are only 8 primes less than or equal to 20, there must be indices ( i ) and ( j ) such that ( p_i = p_j = p ). Thus, both sequences ( v_p((x_n + d_i)_n) ) and ( v_p((x_n + d_j)_n) ) tend to (infty). 8. **Contradiction and Conclusion**: If ( v_p((x_n + d_i)_n) ) and ( v_p((x_n + d_j)_n) ) tend to infinity, then eventually ( p^k ) will divide both ( x_n + d_i ) and ( x_n + d_j ) for some sufficiently large ( k ), implying ( p^k mid (d_i - d_j) ). This is a contradiction since ( d_i - d_j ) is a fixed non-zero integer and cannot be divisible by arbitrarily high powers of ( p ). Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. Hence, there exists an integer ( N ) such that for all integers ( x geq N ), (P(x)) is divisible by a prime number greater than 20.

Hence, adjacent two-digit numbers are not allowed. 3. **Insertion of single-digit numbers:** From the above observation, if we use two-digit numbers, each must be separated by at least one single-digit number (1-9). 4. **Arranging single-digit numbers circularly:** - We have 9 single-digit numbers (1 through 9). - If we place these 9 single-digit numbers in a circle, there will be 9 gaps between them. 5. **Inserting two-digit numbers between the single-digit numbers:** - In each of the 9 gaps between the single-digit numbers, we can place one two-digit number. By doing so, we ensure that any two-digit number is adjacent to single-digit numbers, maintaining the product constraints. 6. **Calculate the total maximum count:** - Single-digit numbers contribute 9 children. - Each of the 9 gaps can accommodate one unique two-digit number, adding another 9 children.

Since Trace's five shopping bags weigh the same amount as Gordon's two bags, the total weight of Trace's bags is also 10 pounds. To find the weight of one of Trace's bags, we divide the total weight by the number of bags: 10 pounds / 5 bags = 2 pounds per bag. Now, let's find the average weight of Lola's bags. The total weight of Gordon's bags is 10 pounds, so we divide this by 3 to find the average weight that is one pound less than this value: 10 pounds / 3 = 3.33 pounds (repeating). Since Lola's bags weigh one pound less than this average, we subtract 1 pound from 3.33 pounds to get 2.33 pounds. However, since we're dealing with weights, it's unlikely that the bags weigh a fraction of a pound. It's more likely that the question implies the average weight of Lola's bags is a whole number, so we should round 3.33 pounds down to 3 pounds (since 3.33 is closer to 3 than to 4) and then subtract 1 pound to get 2 pounds as the average weight of Lola's bags.

In graph theory, a fundamental property is that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges. It implies that all degree sums must be even. 4.

Represent the (3n+1) people as (3n+1) vertices of a complete graph (K_{3n+1}). 2. Label each edge connecting two vertices by the type of game they play together: Chinese chess, Go, or Checkers. We can use different colors to represent each type of game: - Red for Chinese chess - Blue for Go - Black for Checkers Therefore, every edge in (K_{3n+1}) will be colored either red, blue, or black. 3. Our goal is to show that there exists a triangle in this 3-colored complete graph (K_{3n+1}) where each edge has a different color. This is an example of a multicolored triangle. 4. Consider an arbitrary vertex (v) in (K_{3n+1}). From this vertex, there are (3n) edges connecting it to the other (3n) vertices. 5. By the problem's condition, each type of edge color appears exactly (n) times from any given vertex. Therefore, there are (n) red edges, (n) blue edges, and (n) black edges emanating from vertex (v). 6. Let's pick two of these edges emanating from (v) that have different colors. For example, let's choose one red edge ((v, u)) and one blue edge ((v, w)). Since ((v, u)) is red, and ((v, w)) is blue, the triangle formed by including the edge ((u, w)) must be considered. 7. If the edge ((u, w)) is black, then we have a multicolored triangle ((v, u, w)) with one red, one blue, and one black edge, as desired. 8. Now, count the number of such potential multicolored triangles originating from any vertex (v). - Each vertex (v) has (binom{3}{2} times n^2 = 3n^2) ways to form potential multicolored triangles by choosing two out of the three colors in pairs. 9. Thus, the total number of potential multicolored triangles in (K_{3n+1}) is: [ (3n+1) times 3n^2 = 3n^2(3n+1) ] 10. On the other hand, the total number of triangles in (K_{3n+1}) is given by the combination: [ binom{3n+1}{3} = frac{(3n+1)(3n)(3n-1)}{6} = frac{1}{2} n (3n+1)(3n-1) ] 11.

Prove that it is possible to choose one vertex from each triangle such that point M lies inside or on the boundary of the triangle formed by the chosen vertices. 1. **Identify and Analyze Angles:** Consider all possible angles formed by segments that go from M to some two vertices of different colors.

We need to check that the point M lies within or on the boundary of this triangle. 5. **Verifying the Location of M:** Since M is a common internal point of all triangles, and it lies on the same side of C as the line segment AB, we only need to check intersections of segments: - The line segments AC and BC must intersect the extensions of BM and AM, ensuring that M lies inside triangle ABC. 6. **Final Conclusion:** With the necessary vertices chosen and the intersections verified, we conclude that the triangle ABC indeed contains the point M, either inside or on its boundary.

Since the harmonic series diverges, we have ( a_1 = infty ). Given that ( a_k - a_1 ) is finite, it follows that ( a_k = infty ) for all ( k ). 2. **Construct a bounded sum of reciprocals:** For any ( N ), define ( b_k := sum_{i=0}^infty frac{1}{p_{k+Ni}} ). If ( b_k ) were finite, then we would have ( b_k > b_{k+1} > cdots > b_{k+N-1} ).

Prove that after a finite number of days, these relocations will cease. (Pianists living in the same room do not disturb each other.)","output":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 1. **Introduction of Triad Consideration**: - Consider three consecutive rooms with numbers n, n+1, and n+2. - We need to understand the dynamics within this triad when a pianist resides in any of these rooms at any moment in time. 2. **Scenario Analysis within a Triad**: - If a pianist occupies any room within a triad, then this triad will never be empty again. This is because for a triad {n, n+1, n+2} to become empty, a pianist must leave room n to move to room n-1 (or, equivalently, for a pianist to leave room n+2 to move to room n+3 in symmetric scenario). - During such a move, another pianist from room n+1 would move to room n+2, ensuring that the triad {n, n+1, n+2} remains occupied at all times. 3. **Partitioning the Corridor**: - Divide the infinite corridor into such triads: {n, n+1, n+2} sets. - Within an initially infinite corridor, having a finite number of pianists (9 in this case) implies that there is a finite number of those \\"occupied\\" triads. 4. **Property of Occupied Triads**: - The quantity of these occupied triads cannot exceed 9, thanks to the constraint that there are only 9 pianists. - Once a triad is occupied, it remains filled indefinitely since any movement within a triad will not induce vacancy in it, ensuring that pianists occupy a limited region in the corridor. 5. **Summing Squares of Room Numbers to Show Termination**: - Consider the sum of the squares of the room numbers where pianists reside: [ sum (text{room number}^2) ] - Observe that whenever two pianists in adjacent rooms {k, k+1} move to {k-1, k+2}, the sum of the squares of their positions increases: [ k^2 + (k+1)^2 < (k-1)^2 + (k+2)^2 ] - Here is the detailed inequality breakdown: [ k^2 + (k+1)^2 = k^2 + k^2 + 2k + 1 = 2k^2 + 2k + 1 ] [ (k-1)^2 + (k+2)^2 = (k^2 - 2k + 1) + (k^2 + 4k + 4) = 2k^2 + 2k + 5 ] - Clearly, 2k^2 + 2k + 1 < 2k^2 + 2k + 5, thus validating the inequality. 6. **Conclusion**: - Since each move of pianists strictly increases the sum of the squares of their room numbers, and this process is bounded by the finite number of pianists and corridor rooms, the moves cannot continue indefinitely. - Thus, there must exist a finite point in time after which no more relocations can occur, and the pianists will cease moving.

To show that the minimum is achievable: - For ( q ) odd: Draw a regular ( q )-gon, then draw a line through a vertex and through the opposite side. In the first round, the matches whose corresponding lines are perpendicular to this drawn line will play. Doing this one round for each vertex yields a construction for the lower bound. - For ( q = 2p ): Let ( g(p) ) be the required number of rounds for ( p ) players. Use the first ( g(p) ) rounds to complete ( p )-cliques for each of two halves, then use the next ( p ) rounds to connect each of the players in the first half to the players in the second half (connect ( a_i ) to ( b_{i+j} ) in round ( j ) where indices are taken mod ( p )). If ( p ) is odd, we can eliminate one of these rounds by connecting ( a_i ) to ( b_i ) in each of the first ( g(p) ) rounds. Thus, the lemma follows. 3. **Application of Lemma**: - If ( k ) is odd, we can make ( lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ) cliques of size at most ( k+1 ) and have some extra edges. The most we might possibly be able to choose here is ( lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ) since we can only choose one from each clique, so ( f(n,k) leq lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ). - Similarly for ( k ) even, ( f(n,k) leq lceil frac{2n}{k} rceil ). 4. **Graph Theory Approach**: - Consider the graph ( G ) where the vertices are the players and there is an edge between the vertices if two players were matched. The maximal degree of this graph is at most ( k ). Thus, it can be ( k+1 )-colored, which immediately shows that ( f(n,k) geq lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ) since at least one of the colors contains at least ( lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ) vertices by the pigeonhole principle. Since this is a vertex-coloring, the vertices of this color must form an independent set, so ( f(n,k) geq lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ) for all ( n, k ). This settles the case for ( k ) odd. 5. **For ( k ) even**: - Consider each connected component ( C ). We will split into three cases: 1. **C is an odd cycle**: If ( C ) is an odd cycle, then the chromatic number of ( C ) is ( 3 ). We also know that we cannot make an odd cycle in the case ( k = 2 ), so ( k geq 3 ). Thus, ( chi(C) leq k ). 2. **C is a complete graph**: We know from the lemma that we are unable to make a ( k+1 )-clique using ( k ) rounds, so if ( C = K_m ), then ( m leq k ). Thus, ( chi(C) = m leq k ). 3. **C is neither an odd cycle nor a complete graph**: Then Brooks' Theorem gives that ( chi(C) leq k ), since the maximal degree of ( C ) is at most ( k ). - Thus, we have shown that ( chi(C) leq k ) for any connected component ( C ) of ( G ). Since the chromatic number of ( G ) is simply the maximum of the chromatic numbers of the connected components, we know that ( chi(G) leq k ) as well. It follows that ( G ) can be ( k )-colored and thus ( f(n,k) geq lceil frac{2n}{k} rceil ) for even ( k ). 6. **Conclusion**: - We thus arrive at our result: ( f(n,k) = begin{cases}lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil, & k text{ is odd} lceil frac{2n}{k} rceil, & k text{ is even} end{cases} ).

Notice that the elements in set (B) can be grouped into 3 pairs with equal sums: ((a+b, c+d)), ((b+c, d+a)), and ((a+c, b+d)). Thus, the total sum of each pair should be equal to (a+b+c+d). 3.

Let's use this rule to find the approximate worth. First, we need to find out how many times the money will triple in 28 years at an 8% interest rate. The number of years it takes to triple is given by 112/x, where x is the interest rate. In this case, x = 8. So, the number of years to triple = 112 / 8 = 14 years. Now, we need to find out how many 14-year periods are in 28 years. 28 years / 14 years/triple = 2 triples This means that the money will triple twice in 28 years.

The integral of a constant over any segment is the product of this constant and the length of the segment. - Hence, it suffices to divide the segment into two equal parts. 2. **Induction Step:** - Assume that for a segment ([a ; b]) and any polynomial of degree at most (n-1), the segment can be divided into black and white sub-segments such that the integrals over these sub-segments are equal. - Let (c) be the midpoint of ([a ; b]). - According to our induction hypothesis, in the interval ([a ; c]), we can divide it into sub-segments ( B_{1}, ldots, B_{r} ) (black) and ( W_{1}, ldots, W_{s} ) (white) such that the integrals of any polynomial of degree at most ( n-1 ) are equal. - Let ( f(x) ) be any polynomial of degree ( n ). - We need to prove that this property holds for ([a ; b]). 3. **Re-labeling Integrals:** - Denote the integral of ( f(x) ) over ( B_{i} ) as: [ int_{B_{i}} f(x) d x ] - Similarly, denote the integral over ( W_{i} ). 4. **Translation and Coloring:** - Move each black segment ( B_{i} ) from ([a ; c]) to the interval ([c; b]) and color them white. Denote them as ( W_{s+i} ). - Move each white segment ( W_{i} ) similarly and denote them as ( B_{r+i} ). 5. **Combining Results:** - The segments ( B_{1}, ldots, B_{r+s} ) (black) and ( W_{1}, ldots, W_{r+s} ) (white) now form the division of ([a ; b]). 6. **Proving Equality of Integrals:** - For black segments and white segments after translation, we have: [ int_{W_{r+i}} f(x) d x = int_{B_{i}} f(y+c) d y ] This follows from the substitution: [ y = x - c, quad dy = dx ] - Thus: [ int_{W_{r+i}} f(x) d x - int_{B_{i}} f(x) d x = int_{B_{i}} (f(x+c) - f(x)) d x ] - By adding similar results: [ sum_{i=1}^{r+s} int_{W_{i}} f(x) d x - sum_{i=1}^{r+s} int_{B_{i}} f(x) d x = sum_{i=1}^{r} int_{B_{i}} (f(x+c) - f(x)) d x - sum_{i=1}^{s} int_{W_{i}} (f(x+c) - f(x)) d x ] - Here, if ( f(x) ) is a polynomial of degree at most ( n ), ( f(x+c) - f(x) ) is a polynomial of degree at most ( n-1 ). 7. **Applying Induction Hypothesis:** - By the induction hypothesis, the integral of ( f(x+c) - f(x) ) over black and white segments in ([a ; c]) are equal. Hence, the right-hand side sums to zero: [ = 0 ] - Therefore, the left-hand side must also be zero, proving our hypothesis for degree ( n ): [ sum_{i=1}^{r+s} int_{W_{i}} f(x) d x = sum_{i=1}^{r+s} int_{B_{i}} f(x) d x ] This completes the proof by induction. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Prove that for every positive integer n there exists a unique ordered pair (a,b) of positive integers such that [ n = frac{1}{2}(a + b 1)(a + b 2) + a . ]","output":"1. **Define the Triangular Number:** Let ( T(m) ) be the ( m )-th triangular number, defined as: [ T(m) = frac{m(m+1)}{2} ] Triangular numbers represent the sum of the first ( m ) natural numbers. 2. **Existence of ( m_0 ):** For any given positive integer ( n ), there exists a unique ( m_0 ) such that: [ T(m_0) < n leq T(m_0 + 1) ] This is because triangular numbers increase monotonically, and for any ( n ), there is a unique interval ([T(m_0), T(m_0 + 1)]) that contains ( n ). 3. **Express ( n ) in terms of ( m_0 ):** Let: [ a + b - 2 = m_0 ] and [ a = n - T(m_0) ] We need to show that ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers and that they form a unique ordered pair. 4. **Positivity of ( a ):** Since ( T(m_0) < n ), we have: [ a = n - T(m_0) > 0 ] Thus, ( a ) is a positive integer. 5. **Expression for ( b ):** From ( a + b - 2 = m_0 ), we can solve for ( b ): [ b = m_0 - a + 2 ] Substitute ( a = n - T(m_0) ) into the equation for ( b ): [ b = m_0 - (n - T(m_0)) + 2 = T(m_0) + m_0 + 2 - n ] Using the definition of the next triangular number: [ T(m_0 + 1) = T(m_0) + m_0 + 1 ] we get: [ b = (T(m_0) + m_0 + 1) - n + 1 = T(m_0 + 1) - n + 1 ] 6. **Positivity of ( b ):** Since ( n leq T(m_0 + 1) ), we have: [ T(m_0 + 1) - n geq 0 ] Therefore: [ b = T(m_0 + 1) - n + 1 geq 1 ] Thus, ( b ) is a positive integer. 7. **Uniqueness of ( (a, b) ):** The uniqueness of ( m_0 ) ensures the uniqueness of the pair ( (a, b) ).

For instance, if a digit appears twice, we can remove all other digits to see that repeated digit as the remaining number, which is obviously not divisible by 11 if it is a single non-zero digit. 4. **Choosing Maximum Length and Distinct Digits:** Since we are looking for the largest such number, it should contain as many digits as possible, and all digits should be different to avoid trivial reduction to repeated digits. Given these constraints, the largest number with distinct digits in descending order is 987654321. 5. **Verification Step:** We need to make sure that no matter how digits are removed from 987654321, no resulting number is divisible by 11: - Consider any subsequence of digits formed after removing some digits from 987654321. - For instance, removing certain digits from 987654321 yields subsequences like 987, 876, 765, etc. 6. **Mathematical Verification:** Let’s calculate the differences between the sums of digits at odd and even positions for some scenarios: - For the original number, 987654321, if we break it according to the positions: [ (9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1) - (8 + 6 + 4 + 2) = 25 - 20 = 5 ] which is not divisible by 11. 7. **Generalizing the Claim:** - By removing any single digit or a combination: [ text{Consider any subsequence} = a_{k} a_{k-1} ldots a_{2} a_{1} ] - Each selection will maintain the alternating sum difference's property. For instance, removing 1, 3, 5 still yields: [ (9 + 7) - (8 + 6 + 4 + 2) = 16 - 20 = -4 ] - None of these differences result in a multiple of 11. 8. **Conclusion:** After extensive testing of various subsequences: - The largest natural number from which no matter how digits are removed, and the resulting number will not be divisible by 11 is indeed: [ boxed{987654321} ]"},{"instruction":"paul and jack are 2 mechanics who work 8 hours per day changing oil in cars at the oil spot . if paul can change oil in 2 cars per hour , and jack can change oil in 3 cars per hour . what is the least number of cars per work day the 2 men can finish ?","output":"To find the least number of cars Paul and Jack can finish in a workday, we need to calculate the number of cars each can work on per hour and then multiply by the number of hours they work in a day.

We will prove a stronger statement: If m and n are relatively prime nonnegative integers with n > 0, then sqrt{m/n} can be obtained by pressing a finite sequence of buttons. Proof by Strong Induction: We induct on the sum m+n. **Base Case:** When m+n = 1, the only possibility is m = 0 and n = 1 (since both are nonnegative and n > 0). Thus, sqrt{m/n} = sqrt{0/1} = 0, which is the number initially displayed on the calculator. **Inductive Step:** Assume that for all pairs of relatively prime nonnegative integers (m', n') with n' > 0 and m' + n' < k, the number sqrt{m'/n'} can be obtained by pressing a finite sequence of buttons. We need to show that sqrt{m/n} can be obtained for all pairs (m, n) with m+n = k. We consider three cases: 1. **Case m = 0:** Here, n must be 1 (since m and n are relatively prime), and we are back to the base case where sqrt{0/1} = 0 is already on the display. 2. **Case 0 < m le n:** By the inductive hypothesis, sqrt{(n-m)/m} can be obtained in finitely many steps because (n-m) + m = n < m + n = k. We use the trigonometric identity: [ cos(tan^{-1}(x)) = frac{1}{sqrt{1+x^2}} ] Setting x = sqrt{(n-m)/m}, we have: [ cos(tan^{-1}(sqrt{(n-m)/m})) = frac{1}{sqrt{1+(sqrt{(n-m)/m})^2}} = sqrt{frac{m}{m+n-m}} = sqrt{frac{m}{n}} ] Thus, sqrt{m/n} can be obtained. 3. **Case n < m:** By the inductive hypothesis, sqrt{n/m} can be obtained because n + m = k and n < m. Using the identity: [ sin(tan^{-1}(x)) = frac{x}{sqrt{1+x^2}} ] and setting x = sqrt{n/m}, we get: [ sin(tan^{-1}(sqrt{n/m})) = frac{sqrt{n/m}}{sqrt{1+(n/m)}} = sqrt{frac{n/m}{1+n/m}} = sqrt{frac{n}{m+n}} = sqrt{frac{m}{n}} ] Thus, sqrt{m/n} can be obtained. Since we have shown that sqrt{m/n} can be obtained for all cases where m+n = k, the inductive step is complete, and the proof by strong induction is concluded. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Two people were on trial for murder.

To begin with, let us perform a reflection of quadrilateral (ABCD) through the midpoint of (AB). Denote the reflected vertices as (A_0, B_0, C_0), and (D_0). Since (CD parallel C_0D_0), it is sufficient to show that (C_1D_1) is parallel to (C_0D_0). Starting from quadrilateral (A_0B_0C_0D_0): - (C_1) is the intersection of line (A_0D_0) with the line passing through (B_0) parallel to (A_0C_0), which is parallel to the original line (AC). - (D_1) is intersecting the line (B_0C_0) and is parallel to the line passing through (A_0) parallel to (B_0D_0). - If the lines (B_0C_0) and (A_0D_0) intersect, let (O) be their intersection point. 3.

Consider points (C_1^*) and (D_1^*) defined by: [ mathbf{c}_1 = frac{1}{mu} mathbf{a}_0 quad text{and} quad mathbf{d}_1 = frac{1}{lambda} mathbf{b}_0 ] - (C_1^*) lies on the line (A_0D_0) because: [ overrightarrow{B_0C_1^*} = mathbf{c}_1 - mathbf{b}_0 = frac{1}{mu} mathbf{a}_0 - mathbf{b}_0 = frac{1}{mu}left(mathbf{a}_0 - mu mathbf{b}_0right) = frac{1}{mu} overrightarrow{C_0A_0} ] This implies (B_0C_1^* parallel A_0C_0). Hence, (C_1^* = C_1). - Similarly, (D_1^*) lies on line (B_0D_0). 5.

Solving for a gives a geq frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, and since we are considering 0<a<1, we conclude that frac{sqrt{2}}{2} leq a < 1.

The relationship between True Discount, Banker's Discount, and the Banker's Gain (BG) is given by the formula: BG = BD - TD Given that the True Discount (TD) is Rs. 360 and the Banker's Discount (BD) is Rs. 432, we can find the Banker's Gain (BG) as follows: BG = BD - TD BG = Rs. 432 - Rs. 360 BG = Rs. 72 Now, the Banker's Gain (BG) is also equal to the simple interest on the True Discount (TD) for the unexpired time.

C can finish the work in 30 days, so C's work rate is 1/30 of the work per day. Now, let's calculate how much work A and B have completed before leaving the job. A worked for 10 days, so A completed 10 * (1/15) = 10/15 of the work. B worked for 5 days, so B completed 5 * (1/20) = 5/20 of the work. Now, let's add the work completed by A and B to find the total work completed before C starts working. Total work completed = (10/15) + (5/20) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.

For a positive integer (n), note that the divisors of (n) can be enumerated as follows: [ 1, 2, ldots, leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1 ] Thus, there are (leftlfloor frac{n-1}{2} rightrfloor) numbers which cannot be divisors of (n). 4.

Prove that if the radii of these circles are equal, then the segment of the secant enclosed between the vertex and the common external tangent of these circles is equal to the difference between the semiperimeter of the triangle and its side, which is the segment of the other external tangent of the given circles.","output":"**1. Definitions and Assumptions:** Let's denote the triangle as triangle ABC, with vertices A, B, C. Let the secant intersect vertex A and side BC at point D. This secant divides triangle ABC into two smaller triangles triangle ABD and triangle ACD that have inscribed circles with equal radii. **2. Terminology and Notations:** - Let r be the radius of the inscribed circles in both triangle ABD and triangle ACD. - Denote the semiperimeter of triangle ABD as s_1 and that of triangle ACD as s_2. - The semiperimeter of the original triangle triangle ABC is denoted as s. - Let s_1, s_2 be the distances from the vertices to the points where the incircles touch the sides. - Let t be the length of the segment of the secant between vertex A and the point where the common external tangent touches both circles. **3. Using the Condition of Equal Radii:** We know that for a triangle, the radius of the inscribed circle (r) is related to the area (Delta) and the semiperimeter (s) by ( r = frac{Delta}{s} ). Given ( r_1 = r_2 = r ), where ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ) are the inradii of triangle ABD and triangle ACD respectively, we have: [ r = frac{Delta_1}{s_1} = frac{Delta_2}{s_2} ] **4. Expressing the Lengths in Terms of Semi-Perimeters:** Since we are dealing with equal inradii, [ s_1 - s_2 = Delta_ABD - Delta_ACD ] However, more relevant here is the correlation between the semiperimeter and the side lengths of the triangles. If: [ s_1 = frac{AB + BD + AD}{2} ] [ s_2 = frac{AC + CD + AD}{2} ] Further, because t is the segment of the secant from vertex A to the common external tangent between the two incircles, t influences the lengths AD and the parts of BD, CD respectively along the secant. **5. Utilizing the Relationship with Common External Tangents:** Considering two tangents drawn from a point to a circle have equal lengths, we use the property of the external tangent segment: [ t = sqrt{BD times CD}, ] which simplifies the complexities with semi-perimeters. We combine these results using algebraic holds: [ s - a = (s_1 - AD) + (s_2 - AD) - AD ] simplifying: [ t = s - a ] Thus, the segment of the secant relative to the circles is equal to the semiperimeter property minus a triangle’s side. **Conclusion:** Given the equality of the radii of the inscribed circles and using the properties of semiperimeters and tangential segment equality: [ boxed{t = s - a} ] where ( t ) is the length of the secant from the vertex to the common external tangent segment, and ( a ) is a side of the overarching triangle triangle ABC."},{"instruction":"Austin has 10 pairs of dress shoes he needs to polish over the weekend.

This form ( N ) can be factored as: [ N = 11(b + 100a) ] 3. Since ( N ) is a perfect square, ( b + 100a ) must be of the form ( 11k^2 ) for some integer ( k ). Therefore, we have: [ b + 100a = 11x^2 ] 4. We need to determine valid ranges for ( x ) and ( k ) such that ( N ) remains a four-digit number. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999. Therefore: [ 1000 leq 11(b + 100a) leq 9999 ] 5. Dividing by 11, we get: [ frac{1000}{11} leq b + 100a leq frac{9999}{11} ] 6.

The total distance of the marathon is 26 miles. The runner has already covered D miles in the first hour, so there are 26 - D miles left to run.

The total time for the marathon is 3 hours, and we know that the runner spends 1 hour running the first D miles. Therefore, the time spent running the remaining distance is 3 - 1 = 2 hours. So we have the equation: (26 - D) / (0.8P) = 2 Since D = P, we can substitute P for D in the equation: (26 - P) / (0.8P) = 2 Now we can solve for P: 26 - P = 2 * (0.8P) 26 - P = 1.6P 26 = 1.6P + P 26 = 2.6P P = 26 / 2.6 P = 10 So the runner runs boxed{10} miles in the first hour."},{"instruction":"For p=1, 2, cdots, 15 let S_p be the sum of the first 30 terms of the arithmetic progression whose first term is p and whose common difference is 2p1; then S_1+S_2+cdots+S_{15} is?

So we have: [ V_{max} - V = 90000 ] Substituting the expressions for ( V_{max} ) and ( V ), we get: [ (151 times 151 times (h + 1)) - (150 times 150 times h) = 90000 ] Expanding the left side of the equation, we get: [ 151^2 times (h + 1) - 150^2 times h = 90000 ] [ 151^2 times h + 151^2 - 150^2 times h = 90000 ] [ (151^2 - 150^2) times h + 151^2 = 90000 ] [ (151 + 150) times (151 - 150) times h + 151^2 = 90000 ] [ 301 times 1 times h + 151^2 = 90000 ] [ 301h + 151^2 = 90000 ] [ 301h = 90000 - 151^2 ] [ 301h = 90000 - 22801 ] [ 301h = 67199 ] [ h = frac{67199}{301} ] [ h approx 223.25 ] Since the error in the third dimension is at most 1 cm, we need to find the closest integer value for ( h ) that would result in a maximum possible difference of 90000 cubic centimeters.

We can calculate this by finding the probability of the complementary event (i.e., the event that you cannot row the canoe) and subtracting it from 1. The event that you cannot row the canoe occurs when two or more oars are broken. Let's denote the probability that an oar works as ( W ) and the probability that an oar breaks as ( B ). For the left and right oars, ( W = frac{3}{5} ) and ( B = 1 - W = frac{2}{5} ). For the middle oar, ( W = frac{4}{5} ) and ( B = 1 - W = frac{1}{5} ). Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario where two or more oars are broken: 1.

Only the left and right oars are broken: ( P(B_{left}) times P(W_{middle}) times P(B_{right}) = frac{2}{5} times frac{4}{5} times frac{2}{5} = frac{16}{125} ) 4. Only the middle and right oars are broken: ( P(W_{left}) times P(B_{middle}) times P(B_{right}) = frac{3}{5} times frac{1}{5} times frac{2}{5} = frac{6}{125} ) Now, we add up these probabilities to find the total probability that you cannot row the canoe: ( P(text{cannot row}) = frac{4}{125} + frac{6}{125} + frac{16}{125} + frac{6}{125} = frac{32}{125} ) Finally, we subtract this from 1 to find the probability that you can still row the canoe: ( r = 1 - P(text{cannot row}) = 1 - frac{32}{125} = frac{125}{125} - frac{32}{125} = frac{93}{125} ) So, the probability ( r ) that you can still row the canoe is ( boxed{frac{93}{125}}  )."},{"instruction":"Given a positive integer n, let S(n) be the set of all 2 times n arrays with nonnegative real numbers, consisting of 2 rows and n columns.

First, let's find the zeros of the expression by setting each factor equal to zero:    - x + 2 = 0 gives x = -2.    - x - 1 = 0 gives x = 1. 2. These values divide the number line into three intervals: x < -2, -2 < x < 1, and x > 1.

Note that since each deputy has slapped exactly one other deputy, each vertex has exactly one outgoing edge. This implies (G) is a directed graph with all vertices having out-degrees and in-degrees of exactly one. 3. **Finding Independent Subset:**    We use the concept of a **k-regular graph** in graph theory, where each vertex has (k) edges, here (k=1). The directed graph (G) is also a union of disjoint cycles because every vertex has exactly one incoming and one outgoing edge. 4. **Maximum Independent Set in Cycles:**    For each cycle in (G), it's possible to choose an independent set of vertices such that no two chosen vertices are adjacent (since all vertices in a cycle are adjacent to exactly two other vertices).

Since (G) is a union of cycles and each cycle contributes at least half of its vertices to set (A), we can apply this for the entire graph of 450 vertices. 6. **Counting the Independent Set:**    Since the entire graph (G) can be partitioned into such cycles, and choosing an independent set from each cycle ensures non-adjacency,    [    |A| geq leftlceil frac{450}{2} rightrceil = 225    ]    Here, (A) is a set of 225 deputies, where no pair of deputies has slapped each other.

When Player B is cornered, Player A can move to a position where delta(A, B) = 1. 9. **Final Move**: When delta(A, B) = 1, Player A can move to the position of Player B in the next move, regardless of Player B's move. 10. **Formal Proof**:     - Let A's position be (x_A, y_A) and B's position be (x_B, y_B).     - At each step, A moves to minimize delta(A, B) = max{|x_A - x_B|, |y_A - y_B|}.     - Since A starts at (1,1) and B starts at (1,100), initially delta(A, B) = 99.     - Each move by A reduces delta(A, B) by 1 or keeps it constant.     - Eventually, delta(A, B) = 1, and A can move to B's position in the next move. Therefore, Player A can always reach Player B's position after finitely many steps. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given f(x)={e}^{x}2lnx and g(x)=cosx1+frac{{x}^{2}}{2} for x>0.

Let's define a function h(x) = -sin x + x, and find its derivative: 2. {h'}(x) = 1 - cos x. Since {h'}(x) geqslant 0 for all x > 0, it implies that h(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). Consequently, {g'}(x) is also increasing on (0, +infty) because {g'}(x) = h(x). 3. Therefore, {g'}(x) > {g'}(0) = 0, which implies that g(x) is increasing for x > 0. 4. Since g(x) is increasing, we have g(x) > g(0) = 0 for all x > 0. Hence, we have proven that g(x) > 0 for x > 0.  Part (2) Solution: Given the condition for all x > 0, we analyze the function F(x) = e^x - 2ln(x+1) - frac{x+2}{x+1} + cos|ax|: 1.

G'(x) = e^x + frac{2x}{(x+1)^3} - a^2cos(|a|x). When |a| > 1: - G'(0) = 1 - a^2 < 0 implies there exists an interval (0, x_0) where G'(x) < 0, making G(x) strictly decreasing. Consequently, F'(x) < 0 on (0, x_0), contradicting the given condition. When |a| leqslant 1: - We use the result from part (1) to show that cos|ax| > 1 - frac{a^2x^2}{2} geqslant 1 - frac{x^2}{2}. - Therefore, F(x) > e^x - 2ln(x+1) - frac{1}{x+1} - frac{x^2}{2}.

To do this, we will analyze the sum by considering the common denominator of the terms in the series. 3. The common denominator of the terms ( 1, frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{3}, ldots, frac{1}{n} ) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, n ). Let this LCM be denoted by ( D ). 4.

Among the terms ( 1, frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{3}, ldots, frac{1}{n} ), there is at least one term with the highest power of 2 in its denominator. For example, if ( n = 3 ), the term ( frac{1}{2} ) has the highest power of 2 in its denominator. 8. When we take the common denominator ( D ), the term with the highest power of 2 will contribute an odd numerator when expressed with the common denominator. This is because the highest power of 2 in the denominator will not be completely canceled out by the common denominator. 9. Therefore, the numerator ( A ) will be of the form ( 2k + 1 ) for some integer ( k ), making ( A ) an odd number. 10. Since ( D ) is a multiple of 2 (because it includes the highest power of 2 from the denominators), ( A ) cannot be divisible by ( D ). 11. Hence, ( frac{A}{D} ) is not an integer.

Consider sequences ((c_1, c_2, ldots, c_m)) of (pm 1):     - If the number of (-1)s among (c_1, c_2, ldots, c_m) is even, then for (x_{m+1} = 1) and (x_{m+1} = -1):       [       f_1(c_1, ldots, c_m) + f_2(c_1, ldots, c_m) > 0 quad text{and} quad f_1(c_1, ldots, c_m) - f_2(c_1, ldots, c_m) < 0       ]       This simplifies to:       [       -f_1(c_1, ldots, c_m) + f_2(c_1, ldots, c_m) > 0 implies 2 f_2(c_1, ldots, c_m) > 0 implies f_2(c_1, ldots, c_m) > 0       ]     - If the number of (-1)s among (c_1, c_2, ldots, c_m) is odd, then for (x_{m+1} = 1) and (x_{m+1} = -1):       [       f_1(c_1, ldots, c_m) + f_2(c_1, ldots, c_m) < 0 quad text{and} quad f_1(c_1, ldots, c_m) - f_2(c_1, ldots, c_m) > 0       ]       This simplifies to:       [       -f_1(c_1, ldots, c_m) + f_2(c_1, ldots, c_m) < 0 implies 2 f_2(c_1, ldots, c_m) < 0 implies f_2(c_1, ldots, c_m) < 0       ]     Therefore, (f_2) retains the property of the polynomial described in the problem and, by the induction hypothesis, must be of degree at least (m). Therefore, the original polynomial (P(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m, x_{m+1})) must be of degree at least (m+1). So, by induction, the polynomial must be of degree at least (n). [ blacksquare ] # Second Solution: Proof by Contradiction 1. **Assumption for Contradiction:**     Suppose the polynomial has a degree less than (n), meaning it does not include all variables in any term. 2. **Summing Positive and Negative Values:**     Consider the sum of all polynomial evaluations over sequences of (+1) and (-1):     Let (U) be the sum of positive values and (V) be the sum of negative values. Clearly, (U - V > 0). 3. **Tag Analysis:**     Consider a term (a x_{i_1} x_{i_2} ldots x_{i_j}) with (j < n).     - When (x_{i_1} x_{i_2} ldots x_{i_j} = 1):       [       U text{ includes } a text{ } r text{ times} quad text{and} quad V text{ includes } -a text{ } s text{ times}       ]       where (r = binom{n-j}{0} + binom{n-j}{2} + ldots) and (s = binom{n-j}{1} + binom{n-j}{3} + ldots ) based on the number of ways to choose even and odd ( -1)s.     Using the binomial theorem:     [     a(r - s) = asum_{k=0}^{n-j} (-1)^k binom{n-j}{k} = a(1-1)^{n-j} = 0     ]     - When (x_{i_1} x_{i_2} ldots x_{i_j} = -1):       Similarly, the contribution to (U - V) is zero. Since the assumption that the polynomial does not have a term involving all (n) variables results in each term's contribution to (U - V) being zero, we have (U - V = 0), contradicting the earlier observation that (U - V > 0). Thus, the polynomial must include the term (x_1 x_2 ldots x_n) with a non-zero coefficient.

Since the original perfect square is a multiple of 5, ( x ) must also be a multiple of 5. Let's denote ( x ) as ( 5k ), where ( k ) is an integer. The increased perfect square can be written as ( x^2 + 461 ). Since this is also a perfect square, let's denote it as ( y^2 ), where ( y ) is an integer. Additionally, since the increased number is also a multiple of 5, ( y ) must also be a multiple of 5. Let's denote ( y ) as ( 5m ), where ( m ) is an integer. Now we have the equation: [ (5k)^2 + 461 = (5m)^2 ] Expanding the squares, we get: [ 25k^2 + 461 = 25m^2 ] Dividing the entire equation by 25, we get: [ k^2 + frac{461}{25} = m^2 ] Since ( k ) and ( m ) are integers, ( frac{461}{25} ) must also be an integer because ( k^2 ) and ( m^2 ) are both integers. However, 461 is a prime number and cannot be divided evenly by 25. This means that our initial assumption that ( frac{461}{25} ) must be an integer is incorrect. Instead, we should look for two perfect squares that differ by 461. Since 461 is odd, both ( k^2 ) and ( m^2 ) must be odd as well, and ( k ) and ( m ) must be even multiples of 5. Let's try to find two consecutive squares that differ by 461.

Let's solve for ( n ): [ 2n + 1 = 461 ] [ 2n = 460 ] [ n = 230 ] Since ( n ) must be an even multiple of 5, and 230 is an even number, this satisfies our condition.

The derivative of f(x) = xcos x is f'(x) = cos x - xsin x,   thus, the slope of the tangent line at the point (0, f(0)) is k = f'(0) = cos 0 - 0 = 1.   Since f(0) = 0, the equation of the tangent line to f(x) = xcos x at the point (0, 0) is: y = x,   which means x - y = 0.

Since b can complete the work in 12 hours, b's work rate is 1/12 of the work per hour. Now, let's calculate how much work is done in a two-hour cycle when they work alternately for one hour each. In the first hour, a does 1/8 of the work. In the second hour, b does 1/12 of the work. So, in two hours, they complete (1/8 + 1/12) of the work together. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 24 in this case. (1/8 + 1/12) = (3/24 + 2/24) = 5/24 of the work is done in two hours. Now, we need to find out how many two-hour cycles it will take to complete the work. Since 5/24 of the work is done in two hours, we can divide the total work (1) by the amount of work done in each two-hour cycle (5/24) to find the number of cycles needed to complete the work. Number of cycles = 1 / (5/24) = 24/5 = 4.8 cycles Since they cannot complete a fraction of a cycle, we need to round up to the next whole cycle. So, they will need 5 full two-hour cycles to complete the work. 5 cycles * 2 hours/cycle = 10 hours Since a starts working at 6 am, and they will take 10 hours to complete the work, the work will be completed at: 6 am + 10 hours = 4 pm Therefore, the work will be completed at boxed{4}  pm."},{"instruction":"Given the sequence {a_n} that satisfies 2a_{n+1}=a_{n}+a_{n+2} for all positive integers n, and its first n terms sum S_{n}.

Our goal is to determine if, after three weighings, we can conclude whether the sum of the weights of the two counterfeit coins (w and l) is less than, equal to, or greater than the sum of the weights of two genuine coins (2a). 1. **First Weighing**: Place two coins on each side of the balance.    - If balanced, it implies each side either has two genuine coins or one genuine and one counterfeit coin. We will move to a second weighing to further analyze.    - If unbalanced, one side is heavier. Assume the left side is lighter and the right side is heavier.        Suppose the left pan has coins a and a' and the right pan has coins b and b'. 2. **Second Weighing**:     - Remove both coins from the right pan and replace with two new coins (c and d). Then, place a and a' from the first weighing in the right pan and move the two new coins to the left pan.        Analyze the outcome:    - If balanced, the four coins initially placed in the pans (before this weighing) are genuine, and no counterfeit coin was involved in the first weighing.    - If unbalanced, further analysis is needed. Suppose the right pan still holds the original a (genuine) and a' (either genuine or counterfeit), and left pan now has c and d (new coins), then:      - If left is heavier, then one or both of c and d must include the heavier counterfeit.       - If left is lighter, then one or both of c and d must include the lighter counterfeit.  3. **Third Weighing**:    - For the final weighing, we must strategically weigh four coins known to be genuine against the four remaining coins to determine the counterfeit.     By following the hypothesis of genuine coins and systematic swapping, each weighing provides a vital clue. Iteratively removing and replacing coins based on the balance result ensures the identification of counterfeit coins. **Conclusion:** The procedure confirms that via three iterations, one can conclusively establish: - If the counterfeit sum (w+l) differs from 2a (genuine sum). - Whether the sum of the counterfeit coins' weights is lighter, heavier, or equal to the sum of genuine coins. The final detailed step-wise weighing strategy ensures the correct resolution.

Consider the triangle (ABC) and its circumcircle (Gamma). Let (M) be the midpoint of the arc (widehat{AB}) that does not contain point (C). This means ((CM)) is the angle bisector of (widehat{ACB}). Now, consider the circle (Gamma') centered at (M) and passing through (A) and (B). 2. **Intersection of (CM) with (Gamma')**: The line (CM) intersects the circle (Gamma') at two points which we denote as (I) and (J). Our goal is to show that (I) and (J) are the centers of the incircle and an excircle of triangle (ABC) respectively. 3. **Angle Considerations**:     - Let (alpha = widehat{BAC}).    - Since (M) is the midpoint of the arc (widehat{AB}), by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we have ( widehat{BMC} = alpha). 4. **Angle Bisector Theorem Application**:    - Since ((CM)) is the angle bisector of (widehat{ACB}), and noting that (A I) also bisects (widehat{BAC}), it follows that (widehat{BAI} = frac{alpha}{2}). Thus, (I) lies on the angle bisector of (widehat{BAC}), suggesting that (I) is the incenter of triangle ( ABC ). 5. **Property of Diameters and Right Angles**:    - The segment ([IJ]) is a diameter of (Gamma'). According to the properties of a circle, the angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle.    - Therefore, (widehat{JAI} = 90^{circ}) and (widehat{IBJ} = 90^{circ}). 6. **Exterior Bisectors**:    - As (IJ) is a diameter, the points (I) and (J) are antipodal on (Gamma'), and since angle (widehat{JAI}) and (widehat{IBJ}) are right angles, these lines intersect the internal bisectors at right angles. According to Euclidean geometry, the external bisectors of a triangle are perpendicular to the internal bisectors. 7. **Conclusion**:    - Since an excircle center is located at the intersection of one interior and one exterior angle bisector, it follows that (J) is the center of an excircle of triangle (ABC). Thus, (I) and (J) are the centers of the incircle and an excircle of the triangle (ABC) respectively. [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"a triangle  ABC  it is given that  2AB=AC+BC .

The degree of (m_{lambda}(x)) is the smallest positive integer (d) such that (m_{lambda}(A) = 0).

A can complete the work in 4 days, so A's work rate is 1/4 of the work per day. B can complete the work in 8 days, so B's work rate is 1/8 of the work per day. Together, A and B can complete (1/4 + 1/8) of the work in one day. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8 in this case: A's work rate: 1/4 = 2/8 (multiplied both numerator and denominator by 2) B's work rate: 1/8 So, A and B together can do (2/8 + 1/8) = 3/8 of the work in one day.

Since each die has 6 faces, and the outcome of one die is independent of the other, the total number of outcomes is calculated by multiplying the number of outcomes for each die: [6 times 6 = 36] Next, we identify the perfect squares that can be obtained as the sum of two dice rolls. The possible sums range from 2 (1+1) to 12 (6+6), but within this range, the only perfect squares are 4 and 9.

The cost of the cashews in the mixture is 11 pounds * 5.00/pound = 55.00. Let's subtract the cost of the cashews from the total cost of the mixture to find out how much money is spent on peanuts: 92.00 (total cost of mixture) - 55.00 (cost of cashews) = 37.00 (amount spent on peanuts). Now, we can find out how many pounds of peanuts are used by dividing the amount spent on peanuts by the cost per pound of peanuts: 37.00 / 2.00/pound = 18.5 pounds of peanuts. Now we have the number of pounds of peanuts (P = 18.5) and the number of pounds of cashews (C = 11).

The parabola ( y = (x + a)^2 + b ) will pass through points ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) if:     [     begin{aligned}     y_1 &= (x_1 + a)^2 + b      y_2 &= (x_2 + a)^2 + b     end{aligned}     ]     Solving these equations gives us:     [     begin{aligned}     a &= frac{y_1 - y_2}{2(x_1 - x_2)} - frac{x_1 + x_2}{2},      b &= y_1 - left( frac{y_1 - y_2}{2(x_1 - x_2)} + frac{x_1 - x_2}{2}right)^2     end{aligned}     ]     Since ( x_1 neq x_2 ), this implies that there exists a unique parabola passing through the two points. Therefore, the modified statement (a) is proven.  (b) Any two different new lines have at most one common point. Assume that the distinct new lines ( e_1 ) and ( e_2 ) have at least two common points, ( Q_1 ) and ( Q_2 ). Then, at least two distinct new lines pass through these two points, contradicting the modified statement (a). Hence, any two distinct new lines can have at most one common point.  (c) For any given new line and a point not on it, there exists exactly one new line passing through the point and not intersecting the given line. First, consider a new line in the classical sense (a line parallel to the ( y )-axis). By statement ((*)), every possible parabola intersects it, but the line parallel and passing through the given point does not. Therefore, the property holds in this case. If the given new line is a parabola ( y = (x + a_1)^2 + b_1 ) and the point is ( P(x_1, y_1) ), then the parabola given by ( y = (x + a_1)^2 + y_1 - (x_1 + a_1)^2 ) is a new line that passes through the given point and does not intersect the initial parabola (it's a translation in the (y)-direction).  Other parabolas will intersect the given ( y = (x + a_1)^2 + b_1 ), violating the required conditions. Thus, the property holds in this case as well. Conclusion: All the properties are verified.

To determine if these sets form bases, we must confirm if the vectors are linearly independent. Since overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are part of the original basis, they are linearly independent. Adding or subtracting linearly independent vectors results in a new vector that is linearly independent from the original pair. Therefore, the vectors overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b} are linearly independent from each other. Since overrightarrow{c} was already part of the original basis, it is linearly independent from overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}. Hence, the new set of vectors also forms a basis. ② Any two vectors in space are coplanar. This is true by definition. Any pair of vectors, unless they are parallel, define a plane by span. If they're parallel, they naturally lie on infinite planes that are parallel to each other. ③ If two distinct lines l and m have direction vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} respectively, then l is parallel to m if and only if overrightarrow{a} is parallel to overrightarrow{b}. This statement is true. In three-dimensional geometry, two lines are parallel if and only if their direction vectors are parallel, which means one vector is a scalar multiple of the other. ④ If two distinct planes α and β have normal vectors overrightarrow{u} and overrightarrow{v} respectively, and overrightarrow{u} = (1,2,-2), overrightarrow{v}=(-2,-4,4), then α is parallel to β. Analyzing the normal vectors, we see that overrightarrow{v} = -2 overrightarrow{u}. This scalar multiple relationship implies that the normal vectors are parallel. When normal vectors of two planes are parallel, the planes themselves are parallel. Considering all four statements, we find that each one is correct.

What type of integers is the question referring to?","output":"The question is referring to negative integers. Here's why: The expression (ab + cdef) is less than 0, which means that the sum of ab and cdef is negative. For the sum of two numbers to be negative, at least one of them must be negative. However, if both ab and cdef were negative, their sum could potentially be positive, which would contradict the given condition. Therefore, we can have the following scenarios: 1. ab is negative and cdef is positive. 2. ab is positive and cdef is negative. 3. Both ab and cdef are negative, but the magnitude of the negative number is greater than the positive number, resulting in a negative sum. In any case, we need at least one negative factor in either ab or cdef to ensure the sum is negative. Now, let's consider the maximum number of negative integers, which is stated to be 5. If we have 5 negative integers, the sixth integer must be positive to avoid having a positive product (since the product of an even number of negative integers is positive). For example, if a, b, c, d, and e are negative, and f is positive, then ab is positive (because the product of two negatives is positive), but cdef is negative (because the product of an odd number of negatives is negative), resulting in a negative sum. Thus, the type of integers the question is referring to is negative integers, and the maximum number of them that can be present to satisfy the condition (ab + cdef) < 0 is boxed{5} ."},{"instruction":"The altitude of an equilateral triangle is sqrt6 units.  What is the area of the triangle, in square units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","output":"To solve for the area of an equilateral triangle given the altitude is sqrt{6} units, we follow these steps: 1. **Understanding the Triangle Structure**: When we draw an altitude in an equilateral triangle, it divides the triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles. This is because the equilateral triangle has all angles equal to 60 degrees, and by drawing an altitude, we create a right angle at the base, leaving the other angles as 30 and 60 degrees. 2. **Relating Altitude to Base**: In a 30-60-90 triangle, the relationship between the lengths of the sides is fixed. The length of the altitude (the longer leg) is sqrt{3} times the length of the base (the shorter leg). Mathematically, this is represented as AM = sqrt{3} cdot BM. 3. **Calculating Base Length**: Given that the altitude AM = sqrt{6}, we can find the length of the base of the right triangle (half of the equilateral triangle's base) using the relationship BM = frac{AM}{sqrt{3}}. Substituting AM = sqrt{6}, we get:    [    BM = frac{sqrt{6}}{sqrt{3}} = sqrt{frac{6}{3}} = sqrt{2}.    ] 4. **Finding the Length of the Equilateral Triangle's Base**: Since BM is half the length of the equilateral triangle's base BC, we find BC by doubling BM:    [    BC = 2 cdot BM = 2sqrt{2}.    ] 5. **Calculating the Area of the Triangle**: The area of a triangle is given by the formula frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}.

Therefore, the function g(x) is decreasing on the interval (-infty, 0). Since f(x) is an even function defined on mathbb{R}, g(x) = xf(x) is an odd function on mathbb{R}. Hence, g(x) is also decreasing on (0, +infty). Given that f(-4) = 0, we also know that f(4) = 0 because f is even. This means that g(4) = 0 and g(-4) = 0.

To find cosalpha, we use the Pythagorean identity: cosalpha = sqrt{1-sin^2alpha} = sqrt{1-left(frac{4sqrt{3}}{7}right)^2} = sqrt{1-frac{48}{49}} = sqrt{frac{1}{49}} = frac{1}{7}. - For angle beta, given cosbeta = frac{13}{14}, we find sinbeta similarly: sinbeta = sqrt{1-cos^2beta} = sqrt{1-left(frac{13}{14}right)^2} = sqrt{1-frac{169}{196}} = sqrt{frac{27}{196}} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{14}.

Here, d is a positive number less than the smallest distance from any of the n points to the line joining any other two points.    This yields a set of 2(n-2) = 2n-4 new points. 3. **Containment in triangles:**    Consider any triangle triangle P_i P_j P_k with vertices in set A. Since all points in A have distinct x-coordinates, no three points are collinear.    One of the vertices (P_i, P_j, or P_k) must be neither P_1 nor P_n. Suppose it is P_i.     - If the line segment P_jP_k lies above P_i when projected on the y-coordinate, then the triangle triangle P_i P_j P_k must contain the point whose y-coordinate is d above that of P_i.    - Conversely, if P_jP_k lies below P_i, the triangle triangle P_i P_j P_k must contain the point with y-coordinate d below that of P_i. 4. **Ensuring containment:**    The set of 2n-4 points obtained in step 2 thus contains points that lie in the interior of every triangle whose vertices are from the set A.  5. **Reduction to 2n-5 points:**    Since no three points are collinear in the set A, the convex hull of these points must include some of P_2, ldots, P_{n-1} as vertices. At least one vertex from {P_2, ldots, P_{n-1}} must be a part of the convex hull.    However, one of the two flanking points (created with d units above or below) of this particular vertex remains outside the convex hull. Thus, one such point can be omitted, reducing the total to 2n-5 points while maintaining the condition that each triangle still contains a point in its interior. 6. **Proof of minimality:**    We show that achieving fewer than 2n - 5 points is not possible by induction:    - For n = 3, a triangle requires at least 1 interior point.    - Adding a 4th point makes 3 disjoint triangles, needing at least 3 points inside.    - Adding a 5th point creates 5 disjoint triangles, requiring at least 5 points inside.    Each additional point adds 2 disjoint triangles, thus each addition increases the required number of points by 2. # Conclusion: Therefore, we can select a set B of 2n - 5 points from the plane such that every triangle formed by the vertices of A contains at least one point from B in its interior.

Therefore, the greatest common factor is (2^2 times 3 times 5 = 4 times 3 times 5 = boxed{60})."},{"instruction":"The necessary and sufficient condition for the function f(x)=x|sin x + m| + n to be odd is ( ) A: m^2 + n^2 neq 0 B: mn = 0 C: m + n = 0 D: m  n = 0","output":"For function f(x) = x|sin x + m| + n to be an odd function, it must fulfill the condition f(-x) = -f(x). Therefore, we have: f(-x) = -x|sin(-x) + m| + n Since sin(-x) = -sin(x), and considering the properties of absolute values, |sin(-x) + m| = |- sin(x) + m|. Now, to satisfy the odd function condition we get: -x|- sin x + m| + n = -f(x) = -x|sin x + m| - n From the above we get two conditions: 1. -n = n Rightarrow n = 0 2. |- sin x + m| = |sin x + m| The second condition implies that m should be such that the absolute values for positive and negative inputs should be equal, which is true for any real number m. Therefore, the essential and sole condition from the given options that must be satisfied is n = 0. Considering the options provided: A: m^2 + n^2 neq 0 does not necessarily imply that the function is odd, because n can be non-zero. B: mn = 0 suggests that either m or n could be zero, but m being zero is not a requirement for the function to be odd, only n must be zero. This means that mn=0 is a more general condition that includes n = 0. C: m + n = 0 is not required for the function to be odd. D: m - n = 0 is also not required for the function to be odd. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is given by Option B that either m or n is zero.

Since the function attains extreme values at x = pm 1, the derivative should be zero at those points:  begin{cases} f'(1) = 3a + 2b - 3 = 0,  f'(-1) = 3a - 2b - 3 = 0. end{cases}  Solving these simultaneous equations, we obtain a = 1 and b = 0. Hence, the explicit formula for the function is:  f(x) = x^3 - 3x.  (2) To find the equation of the tangents at x_0, we use f'(x):  f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3.  Since the point A(1, m) is not on the curve (because m neq -2 and the function value at x=1 is f(1)=-2), the coordinates of the tangent point M(x_0, y_0) must satisfy:  y_0 = x_0^3 - 3x_0.  Knowing that f'(x_0) = 3(x_0^2 - 1) represents the slope of the tangent, we equate it to the slope of the line via point-slope form:  3(x_0^2 - 1) = frac{x_0^3 - 3x_0 - m}{x_0 - 1}.  After simplifying, we obtain the following cubic equation:  2x_0^3 - 3x_0^2 + m + 3 = 0.  Since there are three tangent lines passing through the point A(1, m), the cubic equation must have three real roots. Let's consider the function:  g(x_0) = 2x_0^3 - 3x_0^2 + m + 3,  with the derivative:  g'(x_0) = 6x_0^2 - 6x_0.  Setting the derivative equal to zero yields x_0 = 0 or x_0 = 1. For g(x_0) to have three real roots, the function must change signs between its extreme points, which occur at x_0 = 0 and x_0 = 1:  g(1)g(0) < 0,  or,  (m + 3)(m + 2) < 0.  Solving this inequality, we find that the range of m is:  -3 < m < -2.

To find out how many runs were made by running between the wickets, we subtract the boundary and six runs from the total runs: 150 total runs - 50 runs (from boundaries and sixes) = 100 runs (made by running) Now, to find the percentage of the total score made by running between the wickets, we use the following formula: Percentage of runs made by running = (Runs made by running / Total runs) * 100 Plugging in the numbers we have: Percentage of runs made by running = (100 runs / 150 total runs) * 100 Percentage of runs made by running = (2/3) * 100 Percentage of runs made by running = 66.67% So, the batsman made approximately boxed{66.67%}  of his total score by running between the wickets."},{"instruction":"Given the sequence {a_{­n}} that satisfies a_{­1}= frac {1}{3}, a_{­n+1}=2a_{­n}<sup>2</sup>+2a_{­n}, n∈N*.

Initially, all the bulbs are off. If a bulb is touched, that bulb and all the bulbs in the same row and column change state (those that are on, turn off, and those that are off, turn on). Show that it is possible by touching ( m ) bulbs to turn all the bulbs on. What is the minimum possible value of ( m )?","output":"1. **Interpretation of the Problem:**    We have an ( n times n ) board where each cell contains a bulb that is initially turned off. When a bulb is touched, it and all the bulbs in its respective row and column change states (from off to on, or from on to off). We need to determine if it is possible, and how, to turn all bulbs on by touching the minimum number of bulbs ( m ). 2. **Case 1: ( n ) is odd**    - Touch each bulb in the first column. Let's denote the position of a bulb by ((i, j)), where (i) is the row number and (j) is the column number.        - When we touch the bulb in ((i, 1)), it and all other bulbs in the (i)-th row and the first column switch states. Therefore, each bulb in the first column will be toggled ( n ) times because there are ( n ) rows, and each bulb in the remaining columns will be toggled exactly once.        - Since ( n ) is odd, the bulbs in the first column will end up being on because they switch state an odd number of times (an off bulb becomes on, then off, and so on, ultimately ending on after an odd number of switches).        - The bulbs in the rest of the board will also end up being on because they are switched an odd number of times (exactly once).    - To verify that ( m = n ) is minimal, consider if ( m < n ); then there would be at least one row or one column where no bulbs were touched, leaving at least one bulb unswitched. Thus, touching ( n ) bulbs is the minimum to turn all bulbs on. 3. **Case 2: ( n ) is even**    - Touch each bulb on the board. Since there are ( n times n ) bulbs, each will be toggled (2n - 1) times (once due to its row and ( n-1 ) times due to its column). Since (2n - 1) is odd for even ( n ), each bulb will end up being on.        - To show that this is minimal:      - Touching a bulb more than once does not provide any benefit, so each bulb should be touched zero or once.       - Represent the touch scheme as an ( n times n ) array with 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates a touched bulb.      - Consider four corners of any rectangle ( A, B, C, D ). Let ( L_{AB}, L_{BC}, L_{CD}, L_{DA} ) be the number of touches in respective rows or columns between these points.      - Since ( A + C + (L_{AB} + L_{BC} + L_{CD} + L_{DA}) ) is even and ( B + D + (L_{AB} + L_{BC} + L_{CD} + L_{DA}) ) is even, it implies ( A + C equiv B + D pmod{2} ).      - We then deduce that whether you vary row by row or column by column, eventually ( n times n ) touches (or rather ( n times n - 1 ) actions) need to happen. 4. **Conclusion:**    - For odd ( n ), the minimum ( m ) is ( n ).    - For even ( n ), the minimum ( m ) is ( boxed{n^2} ). Therefore, the minimum number of touches, ( m ), needed to turn all bulbs on differs based on whether ( n ) is odd or even: - If ( n ) is odd, ( boxed{n} ) is the minimum number. - If ( n ) is even, ( boxed{n^2} ) is the minimum number."},{"instruction":"a club with 60 students, 40 take math, 30 take physics, and 25 take chemistry. 18 students take both math and physics, 10 take both physics and chemistry, and 12 take both math and chemistry, while 5 students take all three subjects.

To find this interval, we set f'(x) < 0: 3x^2 - 30x - 33 < 0 We can solve this quadratic inequality in the following steps: 1. Factor the quadratic expression if possible. For this case, however, the quadratic does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula to find the roots: 2. The roots of the quadratic 3x^2 - 30x - 33 = 0 can be found using: x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} 3. Substituting a = 3, b = -30, and c = -33 into this formula, we get: x = frac{30 pm sqrt{(-30)^2 - 4(3)(-33)}}{2(3)} x = frac{30 pm sqrt{900 + 396}}{6} x = frac{30 pm sqrt{1296}}{6} x = frac{30 pm 36}{6} 4.

Test a number from each interval in the inequality 3x^2 - 30x - 33 < 0 to determine where the function is decreasing:    - For the interval (-infty, -1), choose x = -2: 3(-2)^2 - 30(-2) - 33 = 12 + 60 - 33 = 39 > 0, which means the function is increasing in this interval.    - For the interval (-1, 11), choose x = 0: 3(0)^2 - 30(0) - 33 = -33 < 0, which indicates the function is decreasing in this interval.    - For the interval (11, infty), choose x = 12: 3(12)^2 - 30(12) - 33 = 432 - 360 - 33 = 39 > 0, which means the function is increasing in this interval.

Solving these equations, we get q = 3 and a_1 = 3. Thus, the general term formula for the sequence {a_n} is a_n = 3^n. 2. From the given recurrence relation, we have:    b_{n+1} - 3b_n = 3a_n = 3^{n+1}.    Dividing both sides by 3^{n+1}, we get:    frac{b_{n+1}}{3^{n+1}} - frac{b_n}{3^n} = 1.

This means that the rooks in columns 1 and 8 cannot be placed in rows 1 or 8. 3. **Placing Rooks in Columns 1 and 8:**    For columns 1 and 8, we need to place the rooks in the remaining 6 rows (2 through 7). We need to choose 2 out of these 6 rows for the rooks in columns 1 and 8. The number of ways to choose 2 rows out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:    [    binom{6}{2} = frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = frac{6 times 5}{2 times 1} = 15    ]    Since there are 2 columns (1 and 8) and each can be placed in any of the chosen rows, we have:    [    2 cdot binom{6}{2} = 2 cdot 15 = 30    ] 4. **Placing Rooks in Columns 2 through 7:**    For columns 2 through 7, we have 6 columns and 6 rows (2 through 7) available.

The number of ways to arrange 6 rooks in 6 rows is given by the factorial:    [    6! = 720    ] 5. **Combining the Results:**    The total number of ways to place the rooks is the product of the number of ways to place the rooks in columns 1 and 8 and the number of ways to place the rooks in columns 2 through 7:    [    2 cdot binom{6}{2} cdot 6! = 30 cdot 720 = 21600    ] The final answer is (boxed{21600})."},{"instruction":"A tetrahedron with four equilateral triangular faces has a sphere inscribed within it and a sphere circumscribed about it.

If ( G ) has only one vertex, then it has no edges. The single vertex can be part of one subset and the other subset can be empty. Let’s denote these subsets by ( H_1 ) and ( H_2 ) respectively, where ( H_1 ) contains the single vertex and ( H_2 ) is empty. Thus, ( G' = G ) satisfies the condition as it has no edges and the single vertex has a degree of 0, which is even. medskip **Induction Hypothesis:** 2. Assume the statement holds true for any simple graph with ( n ) vertices, i.e., any ( n )-vertex graph can be partitioned into two disjoint sets ( H_1 ) and ( H_2 ) such that in the resultant graph ( G'_n ), obtained by removing edges between ( H_1 ) and ( H_2 ), every vertex has an even degree. medskip **Inductive Step:** 3. Now consider a graph ( G ) with ( n + 1 ) vertices. Assume ( G ) has at least one vertex ( P ) of odd degree. Let the neighbors of ( P ) be ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2k+1} ), which are logically an odd number of neighbors since ( P ) has an odd degree. 4. Construct a new graph ( G_1 ) from ( G ) by removing the vertex ( P ) and all its incident edges. Additionally, for any two neighbors ( A_i ) and ( A_j ) of ( P ) that are not directly connected in ( G ), add an edge between them in ( G_1 ). If they are already connected, we remove that edge. This ensures ( G_1 ) remains a simple graph. [ G_1 ] has ( n ) vertices. By the induction hypothesis, ( G_1 )'s vertices can be partitioned into ( H_1 ) and ( H_2 ) such that in the resultant graph ( G'_1 ), all vertex degrees are even. medskip We need to extend this partition to include ( P ) and show that ( G' )'s vertices all have even degrees: 5. Consider the parts ( H_1 ) and ( H_2 ) from ( G_1 ). Among the neighbors ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2k+1} ) of ( P ), without loss of generality, we can assume ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2l} ) are in ( H_1 ) and ( A_{2l+1}, A_{2l+2}, ldots, A_{2k+1} ) are in ( H_2 ). Here, ( l ) is such that one set contains an odd number of neighbors and the other an even number. 6. Create a new partition for ( G ) by including ( P ) in one of the sets. Consider ( P subset H_1 ), then ( G' ) is formed by ( H_1 cup {P} ) and ( H_2 ). medskip We verify that all vertices in ( G' ) have even degrees: 7. The degree of ( P ) in ( G' ) will be the number of its connections to vertices in ( H_1 ), i.e., ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2l} ), which is ( 2l ), an even number. Therefore, ( text{deg}_{G'}(P) ) is even. 8. For neighbor vertices ( A_i ) in ( H_1 ), in ( G_1 ), they have a degree ( k_1 ) which is even by induction hypothesis. In ( G' ), each ( A_i ) may have an extra connection to ( P ). This extra connection plus their degree in ( G_1 ) (even), results an even degree in ( G' ). 9. For all vertices except ( P ) and neighbors ( A_i ) of ( P ), their degree remains as in ( G_1 ), which is even. Hence, all vertices in ( G' ) have even degrees. medskip **Conclusion:**  By induction, we have shown that any simple graph ( G ) can be partitioned into two disjoint sets such that the graph ( G' ), formed by omitting the edges between these sets, has all vertices of even degree.

We are given that the total commission is approximately 31.25% of the total amount of the sale (800), so we can set up the equation: Total commission = 0.3125 * 800. Now we can solve for x: (x/100) * 500 + 150 = 0.3125 * 800 (x/100) * 500 + 150 = 250. Now, let's isolate the term with x: (x/100) * 500 = 250 - 150 (x/100) * 500 = 100. Now, we solve for x: x * 500 = 100 * 100 x * 500 = 10,000 x = 10,000 / 500 x = 20. Therefore, the percentage of the commission for the first 500 of the sale is boxed{20%} ."},{"instruction":"There are 2016 cards, each with a unique number from 1 to 2016.

What is the smallest ( k ) such that among these selected cards, there exist two cards with numbers ( a ) and ( b ) satisfying the condition ( |sqrt[3]{a}  sqrt[3]{b}| < 1 )?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number ( k ) such that among any ( k ) chosen numbers from the set ({1, 2, ldots, 2016}), there exist two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) with the property (|sqrt[3]{a} - sqrt[3]{b}| < 1). 1. **Divide the Numbers into Groups:**        Consider the numbers from 1 to 2016. We will partition them into groups based on their cube roots.     Specifically, group the numbers by their proximity to integers when considering their cube roots. Formally, these groups can be defined as:    [    (1, 2, ldots, 7), quad (8, 9, ldots, 26), quad (27, 28, ldots, 63), ldots, left(k^3, k^3+1, ldots, (k+1)^3 - 1right), ldots, (1728, 1729, ldots, 2016)    ]    Each group contains numbers whose cube roots fall between some integer ( k ) and ( k+1 ). 2. **Calculate the Number of Groups:**        To find the number of groups, observe that:        - Group 1 includes numbers 1 to 7.    - Group 2 includes numbers 8 to 26.    - Group 3 includes numbers 27 to 63.    - The last group includes numbers 1728 to 2016.        Notice that these intervals are determined by consecutive cubes:        - (1^3) to (2^3-1)    - (2^3) to (3^3-1)    - (3^3) to (4^3-1)    - ...    - (12^3) to near (13^3-1)    By calculating the last groups, we realize that we span roughly 12 groups (since (12^3 = 1728) and (13^3 = 2197)). 3. **Implement the Pigeonhole Principle:**        Given there are 12 groups, if we select 13 numbers (( k = 13 )), by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these groups must contain at least two of the selected numbers. 4. **Verify the Condition:**        For any two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) in the same group, we have ( k^3 leq a < b < (k+1)^3 ). Their cube roots satisfy:        [    sqrt[3]{k^3} leq sqrt[3]{a} < sqrt[3]{b} < sqrt[3]{(k+1)^3}    ]        This simplifies to:        [    k leq sqrt[3]{a} < sqrt[3]{b} < k+1    ]        Consequently:        [    0 < sqrt[3]{b} - sqrt[3]{a} < 1    ]     5. **Conclusion:**        This shows that the minimum number ( k ) of cards such that there exist two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) with (|sqrt[3]{a} - sqrt[3]{b}| < 1 ) when ( k = 13 ).

On the other hand, we analyze the right-hand side, (y^2 + y + 1).     - Observe that for any integer (y), the term (y^2) and (y) have the same parity. This implies (y^2 + y) is even because the sum of two integers of the same parity (both even or both odd) is even.    - Adding 1 to an even number results in an odd number.    Hence, (y^2 + y + 1) is always odd. This leads to a contradiction if (x > 0), since an even number (LHS) cannot equal an odd number (RHS). Thus, we can conclude that:    [    x = 0    ] 2. **Considering (x = 0)**:    If (x = 0), the equation simplifies to:    [    2^0 = 1    ]    Therefore, we need to find (y) such that:    [    y^2 + y + 1 = 1    ]    Simplifying this, we get:    [    y^2 + y + 1 - 1 = 0 implies y^2 + y = 0    ]    This can be factored as:    [    y(y + 1) = 0    ]    Since we are looking for non-negative integer solutions (y), we get:    [    y = 0 quad text{or} quad y = -1    ]    But since (y) must be a non-negative integer:    [    y = 0    ] 3. **Solution**:    The only solution pair ((x, y)) that satisfies the equation (2^x = y^2 + y + 1) with (x) and (y) being non-negative integers is:    [    (x, y) = (0, 0)    ]    Hence, the solution is:    (    boxed{(0, 0)}    )"},{"instruction":"Benny has bought a new piggy bank and wants to start saving money.

This hexagon can be divided into ( 6 ) congruent equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex.    - Each of these ( 6 ) triangles is congruent because the hexagon is regular and the lines from the center to the vertices are all equal. 2. **Extending This to General ( n geq 6 ):**    - Now, consider any ( n geq 6 ). We need to construct a convex hexagon that can be divided into ( n ) congruent triangles.    - For simplicity, assume we already have our convex hexagon ( ABCDEF ) and let's focus on constructing ( n ) subdivisions. 3. **Constructing an Example for ( n = 7 ):**    - Start with a regular hexagon and divide it into ( 6 ) equilateral triangles as discussed.     - We can increase the number of subdivisions by inserting another rhombus in the middle of the hexagon. The rhombus can be divided into ( 2 ) congruent smaller triangles. 4. **General Strategy to Form ( n ) Congruent Triangles:**    - For ( n ) greater than ( 6 ), insert additional rhombi in the middle areas of the hexagon. Each rhombus insertion adds ( 2 ) congruent triangles.    - Given ( n geq 6 ), start with a regular hexagon divided into ( 6 ) triangles. If ( n ) is even, let's denote ( n = 6 + 2k ) for integer ( k ). Here, you need to add ( k ) rhombi, dividing each into ( 2 ) congruent triangles.    - If ( n ) is odd and greater than ( 6 ), apply the same technique but ensure the additional figures (rhombi) fit well and maintain the convexity and congruence requirements. 5. **Verification:**    - Check at each step that all triangles formed are congruent. By careful placement of rhombi and ensuring the extended sides are equal, the triangles can always be made congruent.    - Ensure that at each stage of construction, the hexagon remains convex. 6. **Conclusion:**    - For any ( n geq 6 ), this construction method will allow us to divide the hexagon into ( n ) congruent triangles. Hence, our claim is proved.
