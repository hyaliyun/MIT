Therefore, ( x = 0 ) is not a root of the polynomial.  Step 4: Consider the polynomial transformed by all terms being positive Transferring all negative terms to the right side and dividing the equation by ( x^{2022} ) yields: [ x^{2022} = a_2 x^{2021} + a_3 x^{2020} + ldots + a_{2022} x + a_{2023} ] By dividing every term by ( x^{2022} ), we get: [ 1 = frac{a_2}{x} + frac{a_3}{x^2} + ldots + frac{a_{2022}}{x^{2021}} + frac{a_{2023}}{x^{2022}} ]  Step 5: Analyze the function on the positive real axis Define the function: [ f(x) = sum_{k=1}^{2022} frac{a_{k+1}}{x^k} ] This function is strictly monotonically decreasing on the positive real axis because for any ( x_1 > 0 ) and ( x_2 > 0 ) where ( x_1 < x_2 ): [ frac{a_{k+1}}{x_2^k} < frac{a_{k+1}}{x_1^k} implies f(x_2) < f(x_1) ] Hence, ( f(x) ) is strictly decreasing on ( x > 0 ).  Step 6: Interpreting the monotonic decrease Because ( f(x) ) is strictly decreasing, it means this function crosses the horizontal line ( y = 1 ) at one unique point. Consequently, there can only be one positive value of ( x ) where ( f(x) = 1 ), implying that there is only one positive root for the polynomial equation. # Conclusion Since the function ( f(x) ) is strictly monotonically decreasing and crosses ( y = 1 ) exactly once, the polynomial equation can have at most one positive root, regardless of how the coefficients are rearranged.

(II) f(x) > 0 always holds, which is equivalent to f(x)_{min} > 0 always holds.   Let g(x)=f'(x)=e^{x}-2ax-2, then g'(x)=e^{x}-2a.   Since a > 0, g'(x) > 0, so g(x) is monotonically increasing.   Also, g(0)=-1 < 0, g(1)=e-2a-2 > 0, so there exists x_{0}in(0,1) such that g(x_{0})=0.   Then, when xin(-infty,x_{0}), g(x)=f'(x) < 0, f(x) is monotonically decreasing;   when xin(x_{0},+infty), g(x)=f'(x) > 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing;   Therefore, f(x)_{min}=f(x_{0})=e^{x_{0}}-a x_{0}^{2}-2x_{0}+b > 0 always holds.

Let m(x)=(frac{x}{2}-1)e^{x}+x, xin(0,ln 2), n(x)=m'(x)= frac{1}{2}(x-1)e^{x}+1, n'(x)= frac{1}{2}xe^{x} > 0,   so n(x) > n(0)= frac{1}{2} > 0, thus m(x) is monotonically increasing, m(x) > m(0)=(-1)e^{0}=-1, m(x) < m(ln 2)=(frac{ln 2}{2}-1)e^{ln 2}+ln 2=2ln 2-2.

Since P(B) + P(B') = 1 (the probability of getting or not getting the software contract must sum to 1), we have: P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 Now we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A ∪ B') = P(A) + P(B') - P(A ∩ B') We are given P(A ∪ B') = 9/10, so we can solve for P(A ∩ B'): 9/10 = 4/5 + 2/5 - P(A ∩ B') To combine the fractions on the right side, we need a common denominator, which is 5: 9/10 = (4/5)(2/2) + (2/5)(4/4) - P(A ∩ B') 9/10 = 8/10 + 8/10 - P(A ∩ B') Now we can combine the fractions: 9/10 = 16/10 - P(A ∩ B') Subtract 16/10 from both sides to solve for P(A ∩ B'): P(A ∩ B') = 16/10 - 9/10 P(A ∩ B') = 7/10 So the probability that the company will get both the hardware and the software contracts is boxed{7/10} ."},{"instruction":"The lengths of the three sides of an obtuse triangle △ABC are consecutive natural numbers.

This is equivalent to finding the minimum number of edges in a graph where every pair of vertices has a common neighbor. 1. **Graph Representation and Initial Assumptions:**    Let (G) be a graph with (n = 12) vertices. We need to find the minimum number of edges (E(G)) such that for every pair of vertices (A) and (B), there exists a vertex (C) that is adjacent to both (A) and (B). 2. **Dutch Windmill Construction:**    Consider a \\"dutch windmill\\" graph, which consists of (k) triangles sharing a common vertex. For (2n+2) vertices, a graph with (3n+2) edges can be realized by a \\"dutch windmill\\" with (n) triangles, all sharing one common vertex, plus one more vertex connected to the hub of the windmill and any of the other vertices. 3. **Assumption and Degree Calculation:**    Assume there exists a graph (G) on (3n+1) edges or less. The sum of the degrees of all vertices is given by:    [    sum_{x in V(G)} deg(x) = 2|E(G)| leq 2(3n+1)    ]    This implies there exists a vertex (u) with degree:    [    deg(u) leq leftlfloor frac{2(3n+1)}{2n+2} rightrfloor    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    deg(u) leq 2    ] 4. **Degree Analysis:**    Clearly, we cannot have (deg(u) leq 1), so it must be (deg(u) = 2). Let (u) be connected to vertices (v) and (w). Then (v) and (w) must be connected, and any other vertex must be connected to at least one of them. Therefore:    [    deg(v) + deg(w) geq 4 + (2n-1) = 2n+3    ]    Now, the sum of the degrees of the remaining vertices is:    [    sum_{x neq v, w} deg(x) leq 2(3n+1) - (2n+3) = 4n-1    ]    This implies one of these (2n) vertices has a degree strictly less than 2, which is a contradiction. 5. **Graph with (2n+1) Vertices:**    For (2n+1) vertices, a model is the graph with (3n) edges realized by a \\"dutch windmill\\" with (n) triangles, all sharing one common vertex. Repeating the above considerations proves no such graph on (3n-1) edges or less may exist. Conclusion: The minimum number of pairs of friends (edges) in a graph with 12 vertices such that every pair of vertices has a common neighbor is (3n+2) for (n = 6).

This implies two things:    - Since it passes through the first and fourth quadrants, it must intersect the x-axis, which means b > 0 because the y-intercept is positive.    - Since it passes through the second quadrant as well, the slope a must be negative to allow the line to extend from the second quadrant through the first and fourth quadrants.

Similarly, Jill walks up 11 steps and the escalator moves N-11 steps during her trip. Since Jill's trip takes twice as long as Jack's trip, the distance the escalator has moved should be twice for Jill compared to the distance for Jack: [ N - 11 = 2(N - 29) ] 5. Solve the equation: [ N - 11 = 2N - 58 ] Subtract N from both sides: [ -11 = N - 58 ] Add 58 to both sides: [ N = 47 ] Therefore, the number of steps when escalator is stopped is boxed{47}."},{"instruction":"fter a storm deposits 110 billion gallons of water into the city reservoir , the reservoir is 60 % full . if the original contents of the reservoir totaled 220 billion gallons , the reservoir was approximately what percentage full before the storm ?","output":"Let's denote the original percentage of the reservoir's fullness as P%.

To find out how much water that is, we calculate 60% of 330 billion gallons: 60% of 330 billion gallons = 0.60 * 330 billion gallons = 198 billion gallons Before the storm, the reservoir had 220 billion gallons of water. To find out what percentage this represents of the total capacity, we use the following formula: Percentage full before the storm = (Original contents / Total capacity) * 100 Plugging in the values we have: Percentage full before the storm = (220 billion gallons / 330 billion gallons) * 100 Percentage full before the storm = (2/3) * 100 Percentage full before the storm ≈ 66.67% So, before the storm, the reservoir was approximately boxed{66.67%}  full."},{"instruction":"The zero of the function f(x)=2x8+log_{3}x must be located in the interval (quad)   A: (5,6)   B: (3,4)   C: (2,3)   D: (1,2)","output":"Since the function f(x)=2x-8+log_{3}x is a continuous function, and f(3)=-1, f(4)=log_{3}4 > 0,   we have f(3)f(4) < 0.

Each power of 10 moves one digit from the right of the decimal point to the left. We are told that the final result has 22 digits to the right of the decimal place. Since raising 3.456789 to the 11th power gives 66 digits to the right of the decimal, and we want only 22, we must have shifted 66 - 22 = 44 digits to the left of the decimal point. This means that ( 10^{11x} ) must have been ( 10^{44} ), because each power of 10 shifts one digit.

In order to minimize the average comprehensive cost per square meter W (in yuan), which includes both the average construction cost and the average land purchase cost per square meter, the building should have how many floors? What is the minimum value of the average comprehensive cost per square meter? Note: The average comprehensive cost per square meter equals the average construction cost per square meter plus the average land purchase cost per square meter, where the average land purchase cost per square meter is calculated as the total land purchase cost divided by the total construction area (pay attention to unit consistency).","output":"To solve this problem, let's break it down into detailed steps: 1. **Define the average comprehensive cost per square meter, W:**    The problem gives us the formula for the average construction cost per square meter, s = 3000 + 50x, where x is the number of floors. The average land purchase cost per square meter is calculated by dividing the total land purchase cost by the total construction area. Given that the land was purchased for 80 million yuan and each floor has an area of 4000 square meters, we can express W as follows:    [    W = s + frac{8000 times 10^4}{4000x} = 50x + frac{20000}{x} + 3000    ]    where x geq 12 and x in mathbb{N}. 2. **Minimize W:**    To find the minimum value of W, we look at its components: 50x + frac{20000}{x} + 3000. We can apply the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality) here, which states that for any non-negative real numbers a and b, the square of their arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to their product, i.e., left(frac{a+b}{2}right)^2 geq ab, with equality holding if and only if a = b.    Applying this to 50x and frac{20000}{x}, we get:    [    W = 50x + frac{20000}{x} + 3000 geq 2sqrt{50x times frac{20000}{x}} + 3000 = 2sqrt{1000000} + 3000 = 5000    ]    This shows that the minimum value of W is 5000 yuan, and this minimum is achieved when the equality condition of the AM-GM inequality holds, which is when 50x = frac{20000}{x}. 3. **Solve for x to find the number of floors:**    To find the value of x that makes 50x = frac{20000}{x}, we solve this equation:    [    50x = frac{20000}{x} implies 50x^2 = 20000 implies x^2 = 400 implies x = 20    ]    since x must be a positive integer (as x represents the number of floors).

This implies each G_i is bipartite.     8. **Bipartite Coloring**:    - Select any vertex v_i in G_i. Mark the collection of vertices V_i'' that are an even distance from v_i and V_i' that are an odd distance from v_i.    - No edges between vertices within V_i'' or within V_i' can exist within G. 9. **General Bipartiteness**:    - Therefore, G is bipartite; hence, it can be split into two sets of vertices, A_1 and A_2, where no internal edge within each set is colored with 1 or 2. 10. **Four-coloring the Original Graph**:     - Similarly, consider the graph composed of vertices and edges colored with colors 3 or 4. A similar argument shows that this graph is bipartite, creating sets B_1 and B_2. 11. **Combine Color Groups**:     - Therefore, the entire set of vertices of the original graph can be divided into the four groups: A_1 cap B_1, A_1 cap B_2, A_2 cap B_1, and A_2 cap B_2.      - These four groups can each be assigned one of the four colors. 12. **Final Coloring Conclusion**:     - This arrangement ensures that any two adjacent vertices (connected by an edge) are in different groups, hence colored differently.     - Thus, the condition is satisfied that any two connected vertices have different colors.

We will treat A1 and A2 as a single unit since they must sit next to each other with A1 to the left of A2, and similarly, we will treat B1 and B2 as a single unit with B1 to the left of B2. We will also consider the restriction that A1 and B1 cannot sit next to each other. First, let's find the total number of ways to arrange the 6 units (A1A2, B1B2, C, D, E, F) without any restrictions. This is simply 6! (6 factorial), which is 720. Now, let's find the number of valid arrangements with the given restrictions. We have 6 positions to place our units: 1. Place A1A2. There are 5 possible positions for A1A2 (since they take up 2 spots): (A1A2, _, _, _, _, _), (_, A1A2, _, _, _, _), (_, _, A1A2, _, _, _), (_, _, _, A1A2, _, _), (_, _, _, _, A1A2, _). 2. Place B1B2. Since B1B2 cannot be next to A1A2, we have to exclude the positions directly next to A1A2. This leaves us with 3 possible positions for B1B2 for each position of A1A2. 3. Place the remaining 4 individuals (C, D, E, F) in the remaining 4 positions. This can be done in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 24. So for each position of A1A2, there are 3 positions for B1B2 and 24 ways to arrange the remaining individuals. This gives us a total of 5 (positions for A1A2) * 3 (positions for B1B2) * 24 (arrangements of C, D, E, F) = 360 valid arrangements. Finally, the probability of a valid arrangement is the number of valid arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements: Probability = Number of valid arrangements / Total number of arrangements Probability = 360 / 720 Probability = 1 / 2 So the probability that A1 & A2 and B1 & B2 are sitting adjacent to each other, with A1 to the left of A2 and B1 to the left of B2, and A1 and B1 are not next to each other is boxed{1/2}  or 50%."},{"instruction":"Let ( k ) and ( n ) be integers with ( 0 leq k leq n2 ).

By the induction hypothesis, this leads to a contradiction if (m > 2^k). 5. **Applying the Induction Hypothesis:**    - Apply the induction hypothesis to the rows with the first column blank or 0, and similarly to the rows with the first column blank or 1.    - This implies (x + y - 2^{k-1}) rows to remove and (x + z - 2^{k-1}) rows to remove.    - If any of these rows starts with a 1 or 0, it can be removed, leading to a contradiction. 6. **Conclusion:**    - The blank rows must be split between these two sets, implying (m = x + y + z leq 2^k). Thus, we have shown that (m leq 2^k).

We need to find all 2-digit prime numbers ( p ) such that there exists a prime number ( q ) for which ( 100q + p ) is a perfect square. This means ( 100q + p = k^2 ) for some integer ( k ). 2. Since ( 100q + p ) is a perfect square, we can write:    [    100q + p equiv k^2 pmod{100}    ]    This implies that ( p equiv k^2 pmod{100} ). 3. The possible values of ( k^2 pmod{100} ) are the last two digits of the squares of integers. We need to check the last two digits of the squares of integers from 10 to 99. 4. We observe that ( k^2 equiv 1, 9 pmod{10} ) implies ( k equiv 1, 3, 7, 9 pmod{10} ). Therefore, we only need to check the squares of numbers ending in 1, 3, 7, and 9. 5.

We need to verify that these values of ( p ) do not lead to contradictions. For example, for ( p = 41 ):    [    100q + 41 equiv k^2 pmod{100}    ]    Since ( k^2 ) is an odd perfect square, ( 100q + 41 equiv 1 pmod{8} ):    [    100q + 1 equiv 1 pmod{8} implies 100q equiv 0 pmod{8} implies q equiv 0 pmod{8}    ]    This is a contradiction since ( q ) is a prime number and cannot be divisible by 8. 10.

Vasya and Petya have each cut rectangular pieces from the ribbon, marked with rows of cells. Vasya's piece has one more cut cell than Petya's piece. 2. **Sum of Visible Numbers**:     Let’s denote the sums of numbers visible through the cut cells of Vasya’s and Petya’s pieces initially as ( S_V ) and ( S_P ) respectively. Assume ( S_P ) is initially greater than ( S_V ). This can be arranged, for instance, by ensuring that one of the numbers visible through Petya’s piece is larger than the total sum of numbers visible through Vasya’s piece. 3. **Aligning the Pieces**:     We will attempt to place both pieces on the ribbon such that the sums ( S_V ) and ( S_P ) become equal. Note that both pieces are aligned horizontally. 4. **Shifting Both Pieces**:     Begin by placing both pieces on the ribbon such that the difference ( S_P - S_V ) is positive. Move both pieces one cell to the right along the ribbon thereby covering new numbers in the infinite sequence while keeping their relative positions fixed. 5. **Analyzing the Difference**:     As both pieces are moved one cell to the right, each visible number increases by 1 because the naturally ordered sequence ensures a uniform increment. To illustrate:     - Let’s denote the visible numbers of Vasya’s piece as ( v_1, v_2, v_3, ..., v_{n+1} ).     - Let’s denote the visible numbers of Petya’s piece as ( p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n ).     Therefore, if Vasya's and Petya’s pieces are moved one cell to the right on the ribbon, each number visible on both pieces will increase uniformly by 1. 6. **Change in Sums**:     When moved one cell to the right:     [     S_V rightarrow S_V + n + 1     ]     [     S_P rightarrow S_P + n     ]     Hence, the difference:     [     Delta = (S_P + n) - (S_V + n + 1) = S_P - S_V - 1     ] 7. **Continuing the Shift**:     Continue shifting both pieces one cell at a time. The difference ( Delta ) between the sums ( S_P ) and ( S_V ) decreases by 1 with each shift. 8. **Conclusion**:     At some point, the difference ( Delta ) will decrease to zero (since the numbers are natural and the number of cells is finite), effectively making the sums equal.

Substituting the coordinates of point (P(3, sqrt{7})) into the above equation, we get:  frac{9}{a^2} - frac{7}{4 - a^2} = 1.  Solving for (a^2), we find (a^2 = 18) (which we discard) or (a^2 = 2).

When substituted into the equation of hyperbola (C) and simplified, we get:  (1 - k^2)x^2 - 4kx - 6 = 0.

C: There are 2 lines passing through the point (1,1) with equal intercepts on the xaxis and yaxis. D: The intercept of the line frac{x}{2}frac{y}{3}=1 on the yaxis is 3.","output":"To analyze each statement step by step: **Statement A**: The slope of a straight line, often denoted as m, and the inclination angle theta have a relationship where m = tan(theta). The slope m increases as theta moves towards frac{pi}{2} from either direction within the interval [0, frac{pi}{2}) and (frac{pi}{2}, pi). However, the statement implies a direct correlation without acknowledging the undefined slope at theta = frac{pi}{2}. Thus, the correctness is ambiguous, making our analysis conclude with uncertainty towards statement A. **Statement B**: For a straight line passing through points P(x_{1}, y_{1}) and Q(x_{2}, y_{2}), the correct equation of the line based on the two-point formula is frac{y-y_{1}}{y_{2}-y_{1}} = frac{x-x_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}. The given equation in statement B is a rearrangement but mistakenly uses x_{1}-x_{2} in the denominator for both fractions, which should correctly reflect as frac{y-y_{1}}{y_{2}-y_{1}} = frac{x-x_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}. This mistake points to an incorrect formulation, thereby identifying statement B as incorrect. **Statement C**: For any point (1,1), it's possible to find two lines with equal intercepts on both axes. One is the line y = x, which passes through the origin, and another can have the form y = x + c or x = y + c, where c is a constant that determines the intercepts, ensuring they are equal but not at the origin. Thus, statement C is found to be correct. **Statement D**: For the line equation frac{x}{2} - frac{y}{3} = 1, setting x=0 to find the y-intercept gives us -frac{y}{3} = 1, which simplifies to y = -3. This calculation shows that the y-intercept is indeed -3, contradicting the assertion in statement D that it is 3. Thus, statement D is incorrect. In conclusion, after analyzing each statement carefully, we find that the incorrect statements based on their analysis are B and D. However, the original solution identifies A, B, and D as incorrect without detailed justification for A. Following the instructions to stay as close as possible to the original solution, we recognize a misunderstanding in statement A's analysis but will adhere to the provided solutions.

Prove that the unit's digit of a^{n} and a^{n+4} is the same.","output":"**I. Approach:** 1. **Define the problem clearly:**    We want to prove that for any integer ( a ), the units digit of ( a^n ) and ( a^{n+4} ) are the same. This is equivalent to showing that the difference between these two numbers has the units digit 0. 2. **Formulate the difference and factor it:**    Consider the difference:    [    a^{n+4} - a^n    ]    Factor out ( a^n ):    [    a^{n+4} - a^n = a^n (a^4 - 1)    ]    For the units digit of the product ( a^n (a^4 - 1) ) to be 0, the product ( a^n (a^4 - 1) ) must be divisible by 10, hence must be divisible by both 2 and 5. 3. **Check divisibility by 2:**    - If ( a ) is even, then ( a^n ) is even.    - If ( a ) is odd, then ( a^4 - 1 ) is even.    Therefore, in both cases, ( a^n (a^4 - 1) ) is divisible by 2. 4. **Check divisibility by 5:**    - If ( a ) is a multiple of 5, then ( a^n ) is also a multiple of 5.    - If ( a ) is not a multiple of 5, possible units digits for ( a^2 ) are 1, 4, 6, or 9. Consequently, ( a^4 ) ends in 1, and the units digit of ( a^4 - 1 ) is 0.    Thus, ( a^n (a^4 - 1) ) is divisible by 5. Therefore, ( a^n (a^4 - 1) ) is divisible by both 2 and 5, hence divisible by 10. This completes the proof for approach I. [ blacksquare ] ---  **II. Approach:** 1. **Express the difference and factor it further:**    Similar to the previous approach, consider:    [    a^{n+4} - a^n = a^n (a^4 - 1)    ]    Factor ( a^4 - 1 ):    [    a^{n+4} - a^n = a^n (a - 1)(a + 1)(a^2 + 1)    ] 2. **Exploit properties of consecutive integers:**    Notice:    [    a^2 + 1 = (a^2 - 4) + 5 = (a - 2)(a + 2) + 5    ]     3. **Combine everything:**    [    a^{n+4} - a^n = a^{n-1}(a - 2)(a - 1)a(a + 1)(a + 2) + 5a^n (a^2 - 1)    ]    The first term involves the product of five consecutive integers, which means it’s divisible by both 2 and 5. The second term involves products that contribute to divisibility by 10. Since ( a^{n+4} - a^n ) must be divisible by 10 from the structure of its factors, this also proves the statement for approach II. [ blacksquare ] ---  **III. Approach:** 1. **Units digit patterns of specific numbers:**    - For units digits ( 0, 1, 5, ) and ( 6 ), any power of these numbers retains the same units digit.    Thus, for these digits, the property is trivially verified. 2. **Verification for other digits:**    - Digits 3, 7, 9:      The fourth powers of these digits end in 1 (( 3^4 = 81, 7^4 = 2401, 9^4 = 6561 )). This gives the fourth power units digit of 1.    - Multiplying ( a^n ) by 1 does not change the units digit.    - Digits 2, 4, 8:      Their fourth powers end in 6 (( 2^4 = 16, 4^4 = 256, 8^4 = 4096 )).      Multiplying a number ending in 2, 4, 6, or 8 by another number ending in 6 retains the same units digit.

Rearranging, we get:        z_1 y_1 - z_1 x_1 = x_1 y_1        or        z_1 y_1 - x_1 y_1 = z_1 x_1        Therefore:        y_1(z_1 - x_1) = x_1 z_1         If we multiply both sides of the equation by x_1, we obtain:        x_1^2 = (x_1 - y_1)(x_1 - z_1)         6. If x_1 is coprime with both x_1 - y_1 and x_1 - z_1, the factors (x_1 - y_1) and (x_1 - z_1) are coprime too. Given that their product (x_1^2) is a perfect square, each of the individual factors must also be a perfect square (since the product of two coprime numbers is a perfect square only if each of them is a perfect square). 7. Therefore:        x_1 - y_1        is a perfect square. 8. Since y_1 - x_1 is a perfect square and d is an integer, it follows that  d^4 cdot (y_1 - x_1) is a perfect square. Thus, we have shown that gcd(x, y, z) cdot (y-x) is indeed a perfect square, and this completes the proof.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A sum consists of quarters and dimes.

Additionally, we need to find the number of such sequences of maximal length. 1. **Prime Factorization of 31**:        The number 31 is a prime number. Thus, any sequence ending in 31 must have multiples that include prime factors building up to 31. 2. **Prime Factorization of Members**:        Each member of the sequence must contain more prime factors than its predecessor. To determine the factors contributing to the sequence, let's consider prime numbers and their multiples leading up to 31.  3. **Possible Growth of Factors**:        Starting with 1 (which has no prime factors), each subsequent number must introduce new prime factors or increase the power of existing ones. Here are some possible steps:    - Begin with (1).    - The next number can add the smallest prime factor (2), making (2).    - Further, introduce another small prime factor, (3), to get (6) (since (6 = 2 cdot 3)).    - Continue adding new primes in ascending order.    - Finally, ensure that the sequence reaches (31). 4. **Building the Sequence**:        Through sequence exploration with distinct prime factors, consider the following steps:    - (1)    - (2)    - (6 = 2 times 3)    - (30 = 2 times 3 times 5)    - (31)    This builds the sequence: (1, 2, 6, 30, 31). 5. **Counting Sequences**:        Any valid sequence must consider permutations of introducing these prime factors while ensuring each number is divisible by its predecessor. As we outline below:    - Number of factors in (n):      Let (a), (b), and (c) represent counts of appearances of primes (2), (3), and (5) respectively until reaching 31.    - Total number of distinct factors:      We aim to maximize the count of distinct factors; for maximal length, this includes increasing prime factors (a + b + 3c).

The condition for f'(x) = 3x^2 + a to have real roots is that its discriminant Delta > 0. Since there is no b term in the quadratic equation, Delta = 0 - 4 cdot 3 cdot a = -12a > 0, which simplifies to a < 0. 2. To ensure f(x) has 3 zeros, we need f(x) to change signs at the roots of f'(x), which are at x = -sqrt{-frac{a}{3}} and x = sqrt{-frac{a}{3}}. This means f(x) must be positive at its local maximum and negative at its local minimum. 3. The local maximum occurs at x = -sqrt{-frac{a}{3}}. Substituting this into f(x), we get f(-sqrt{-frac{a}{3}}) = (-sqrt{-frac{a}{3}})^3 + a(-sqrt{-frac{a}{3}}) + 2.

Next, we need to find the number of proper subsets of P odot Q. A proper subset is any subset of a set that is not the set itself. The total number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n, and since we want only the proper subsets, we subtract one for the set itself to get 2^n - 1. For this set, n = 5 because there are five elements in P odot Q. Therefore, the number of proper subsets of P odot Q is 2^5 - 1 which equals 32 - 1 = 31. So, the set P odot Q has boxed{31} proper subsets."},{"instruction":"There are 1763 automata that print pairs of natural numbers on cards.

For event A to occur, all three dice must show different numbers. There are 6 choices for the first die, 5 choices for the second die (because it can't match the first die), and 4 choices for the third die (because it can't match either of the first two dice). So there are 6*5*4=120 ways to roll three different numbers. Now, let's calculate the number of outcomes that satisfy both A and B. Since at least one die has to show a six, we can calculate the number of ways this can happen with no other die showing the same number. We need to consider the cases where exactly one die shows a six or two dice show a six. - If exactly one die shows a six, we have 1 choice for the six, and then 5 choices for the number on the second die and 4 choices for the third die, for total of 3*5*4=60 outcomes (we multiply by 3 because any of the three dice can be the one showing the six). - If exactly two dice show a six, we have 3*1*5=15 possibilities (3 ways of choosing which dice show the sixes and 5 choices for the remaining die). So, combining these together, we have 60 + 15 = 75 successful outcomes. Thus, P(AB) is calculated as:  P(AB) = frac{text{Number of successful outcomes for both A and B}}{text{Total number of possible outcomes}}   P(AB) = frac{75}{216}  Now to calculate P(B|A), which is the conditional probability that event B occurs given that event A has occurred. We use the definition of conditional probability:  P(B|A) = frac{P(AB)}{P(A)}  We've already determined that P(AB) = frac{75}{216}, and P(A), the probability of event A occurring, is 120/216.

A common tangent (t) touches circle (gamma) at point (T) and circle (gamma') at point (T').

This tangent intersects the segment ([TT']) at some point (M'). 3. **Use the tangent-segment theorem (Apollonius's theorem)**:     - For the circle (gamma), the tangent-segment theorem states that any line drawn from the point of tangency to a point on the circle is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency. Therefore, (M'T = M'A).     - Similarly, for circle (gamma'), we have (M'A = M'T') by the same tangent-segment theorem applied to (gamma'). 4. **Equality of Tangent Segments**: Since (M'A = M'T) and (M'A = M'T'), we conclude that (M'T = M'T'). 5. **Midpoint Identification**: Since (M'T = M'T'), point (M') must be equidistant from (T) and (T'). By definition, this indicates that (M') is indeed the midpoint of ([TT']). 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, (M = M'), and we can conclude that (M), as the midpoint of segment ([TT']), satisfies (MT = MA = MT').

[    A_1B_1 = B_1C_1 = C_1A_1 = A_2B_2 = B_2C_2 = C_2A_2 = frac{ssqrt{3}}{3}    ] 4. **Illustrate perpendicularity:**    Note A_1B_1 parallel AC, hence A_1B forms a perpendicular bisector making AA_1C_1, similarly derived for other vertices implying the triangle sides hold inherent perpendicularity as a geometric property of equilateral triangles. # Conclusion: Therefore, triangle A_1B_1C_1 and triangle A_2B_2C_2 are equilateral, their sides equal and perpendicular to respective sides of triangle ABC. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Susan is picking strawberries.

Let's denote these rows as r_{i1} and r_{i2}. 3. **Construct a graph:**    Consider a graph where each vertex corresponds to a row of the table, and there is an edge between two vertices (rows) if and only if the corresponding rows differ only in one column. 4. **Analyze the graph:**    Since each column i provides exactly one distinct pair of rows (r_{i1} and r_{i2}), and there are N columns, the graph consists of N edges and N vertices. 5. **Cycle detection in the graph:**    In a graph with N vertices and N edges, a simple cycle must exist (this follows from the properties of graphs, specifically from the fact that a connected graph with vertex degree sums equal to twice the number of edges must have cycles). 6. **Label and examine the cycle:**    Without loss of generality, let’s assume the cycle consists of k rows labeled as a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k}.

This is impossible, thus contradicting our initial assumption. 9. **Conclusion:**    Hence, it must be the case that one can remove a column such that all rows in the resulting table are still distinct.

Here, the midline is a horizontal line through ( O ).    - To be equidistant from the circle, points need to be on the circle itself, as the distance from the circle to any external point is the length of the tangent from that point to the circle, which is minimal when the point lies on the circle. 3. **Identifying Specific Points**:    - For points on the midline to be equidistant from the circle, they must lie on the circle where the midline intersects it. This occurs at the endpoints of the diameter that lies on the midline.    - The configuration requires ( d > r ), so these lines are not tangents and do not affect the intersection of the midline with the circle. 4. **Conclusion**:    - The equidistant points are the two intersection points of the circle with the midline.    - There are exactly two such points.

The proposition to show is that one diagonal of the formed parallelogram, namely (MN), lies on one of the bisectors of the angle formed by the intersecting lines (e) and (f). # Detailed Steps for Proof  Proof Strategy: We use geometric properties of triangles and bisectors to show the required results. 1. Consider the triangles (MAB) and (MCD):     - Since (AB = CD) and lines (a) and (d) are parallel to (AC), and (AC) are parallel, triangles (MAB) and (MCD) are similar by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) similarity criteria.     - Similar triangles have equal areas; therefore, (text{Area}(MAB) = text{Area}(MCD)). 2. Similarly, for (N), in triangles (NAB) and (NCD):     - The same argument as above applies because the sides are handled similarly in their respective triangles.     - Therefore, (text{Area}(NAB) = text{Area}(NCD)). 3. Since the bases (AB) on (e) and (CD) on (f) are equal and parallel, the heights from (M) and (N) to these bases must also be equal. 4. Therefore, the points (M) and (N) are equidistant from both lines (e) and (f). This implies that both (M) and (N) lie on the angle bisectors of the angles formed by (e) and (f).  Confirmation of (M) and (N) on the Same Angle Bisector: 1. The angle formed by the intersecting lines is divided into four regions by their respective bisectors. 2. The segments within the formed parallelogram maintain the symmetrical properties regardless of their orientation because of equivalent triangular areas and heights. 3. Therefore, (M) and (N) must lie on the same or symmetric opposite angle bisectors of the angles formed by (e) and (f).  Geometric Verification: Consider the parallelogram (AMDS) and (CNBS).  1. Establish the geometric properties and proportions using coordinate geometry or trigonometric relations based on chosen axes. 2. Verifying with basic equations confirms that the diagonal (MN) indeed intersects at (O), which further solidifies the proof. # Conclusion: Based on the detailed geometric properties, the formed parallelogram has one diagonal that lies on the bisector of the angle formed by the intersecting lines (e) and (f). boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Let (f(x)=begin{cases} x^2, & 0leqslant xleqslant 1  2x, & 1 < xleqslant 2 end{cases}), then (int_{0}^{2}{f(x)dx}=) (    ) A:  (dfrac{3}{4}) B:  (dfrac{4}{5}) C: (dfrac{5}{6}) D: Does not ex","output":"**Analysis** This question examines the calculation of definite integrals, focusing on finding the original function, and is considered a basic question. **Solution** Solution: ( int_{0}^{2}f(x)dx= int_{0}^{1}x^{2}dx+ int_{1}^{2}(2-x)dx= dfrac{1}{3}x^{3}|_{0}^{1}+(2x- dfrac{1}{2}x^{2})|_{1}^{2}= dfrac{1}{3}+(2times2- dfrac{1}{2}times2^{2})-(2- dfrac{1}{2})= dfrac{1}{3}+4-2-2+ dfrac{1}{2}= dfrac{5}{6}.)

When we swap two elements in a permutation, it changes the parity of the permutation.      - A parity of a permutation refers to the number of transpositions needed to bring the permutation to its original configuration. If this number is even, the permutation is considered even; if odd, the permutation is odd.      5. **Implication of 25 Hits**:      - Initially, the configuration has a specific parity (either even or odd).     - Each hit, which swaps two pucks, changes the parity. Given the total of 25 swaps:       [       25 text{ (odd number of swaps)} implies text{odd parity change}       ]     - Therefore, an odd number of swaps (25 in this case) will change the permutation to one with an opposite parity to its starting configuration.      6. **Conclusion**:      - The initial configuration had a specific parity (even, assuming initial position as proper).     - After 25 odd swaps (odd parity change), the resulting permutation must have an opposite parity (odd).     - Therefore, after 25 hits, it is impossible for the pucks to return to their initial arrangement (which would require the same parity). boxed{text{No, the pucks cannot return to their initial positions.}}"},{"instruction":"Calculate the value of the following expression:   sqrt {6 frac {1}{4}}  (pi  1)^0  left(3 frac {3}{8}right)^{frac {1}{3}} + left(frac {1}{64}right)^{frac {2}{3}} = ______.","output":"Let's simplify the given expression step by step. 1.

Archie ends up with 20 marbles after losing half of the remaining ones down a sewer. This means before losing them into the sewer, he had twice as many. So, we calculate the number of marbles before this loss: [ 20 times 2 = 40 ] 2. Now, knowing he had 40 marbles before losing them into the sewer, and considering this amount represents 40% of his original number of marbles (since he lost 60% into the street), we can find the initial number of marbles. The calculation is based on the fact that 40 marbles is 40% (or 0.4) of the original number. Thus, to find the original number, we divide the 40 marbles by 0.4: [ 40 / 0.4 = 100 ] Therefore, Archie started with boxed{100} marbles."},{"instruction":"What is the result of the operation 65 + 5 * 12 / ( 180 / 3 )?","output":"To solve the expression 65 + 5 * 12 / ( 180 / 3 ), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given that their difference is a prime number, we have (d(a_1 - b_1) = p), where (p) is a prime number. 4. Given that the last digit of their sum is 3, we have (d(a_1 + b_1) equiv 3 pmod{10}). 5.

Substituting (a_1 = b_1 + 1) into the product condition, we get (d^2 b_1 (b_1 + 1) = x^2). 8.

Since (y, z geq 1), we have (z + y geq 2) and (z - y in mathbb{Z}), which is a contradiction. 10. Thus, (gcd(a, b) = 1).

We need to prove: it is possible to find 1000 rows and 1000 columns such that the sum of the numbers at their intersections is at least 1000. 2. **Sum Properties:**    Since the sum of all the numbers in the grid is non-negative, this implies:    [    sum_{i=1}^{2000} sum_{j=1}^{2000} a_{ij} geq 0    ]    where (a_{ij}) represents the number in the (i)-th row and (j)-th column. 3. **Row Analysis:**    By definition, at least one row must have a non-negative sum.

Use Recurrence Relation:    - Each new great circle added intersects all previous circles at two points, thus each intersection splits a region into two regions, adding two regions per previous circle:      [      a_{n+1} = a_n + 2n      ] 4.

This can be observed as:     - If there are three pawns in a (2 times 2) square, these positions could be any combination excluding the possibility of four pawns on the entire square.     - This combination is guaranteed to form an \\"L\\" shape because there are no possible ways to place three pawns in a (2 times 2) square without at least one set being aligned to form an \\"L\\".

What path does the vertex of the curve trace if lambda varies within the indicated limits?","output":"**1^{0}: Characterize the Shape of the Function Curve** 1. The given function is ( y = x^2 - 2lambda x + a^2 ). 2. This is a quadratic function in ( x ), where the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive. Therefore, the curve is a parabola that opens upwards. 3. Rewrite the function in the vertex form:    [    y = (x - lambda)^2 + a^2 - lambda^2    ] 4. The vertex form shows that the vertex (or the lowest point) of the parabola is at ( (x, y) = (lambda, a^2 - lambda^2) ). 5. The axis of symmetry of the parabola is a vertical line passing through ( x = lambda ). **2^{0}: Position of the Curve Relative to the Y-Axis When lambda leqq 0** 1. If ( lambda = 0 ), then the vertex of the parabola is:    [    (0, a^2)    ] 2. If ( lambda > 0 ), the vertex ( (lambda, a^2 - lambda^2) ) lies to the right of the ( Y )-axis. 3. If ( lambda < 0 ), the vertex lies to the left of the ( Y )-axis. 4. For ( lambda ) with opposite signs but the same absolute value (e.g., ( lambda ) and ( -lambda )), the vertices of the parabolas are symmetric with respect to the ( Y )-axis. The ( y )-coordinate of the vertex remains ( a^2 - lambda^2 ). 5. All these parabolas pass through the point ( (0, a^2) ) (i.e., when ( x = 0 ), ( y = a^2 )). **3^{0}: Values of lambda for Which the Curve Intersects the X-Axis** 1. The parabola intersects the ( X )-axis where ( y = 0 ). 2. Set ( y = 0 ) in the equation ( y = x^2 - 2lambda x + a^2 ):    [    x^2 - 2lambda x + a^2 = 0    ] 3. The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative for real roots:    [    Delta = (-2lambda)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot a^2 = 4lambda^2 - 4a^2 = 4(lambda^2 - a^2)    ]    This must be greater than or equal to zero:    [    lambda^2 - a^2 geq 0    ]    Thus, the condition is:    [    lambda^2 geq a^2 quad text{or} quad |lambda| geq a    ] 4. Since the product of the roots of ( x^2 - 2lambda x + a^2 = 0 ) is positive, both roots have the same sign. Therefore, the intersection points lie on the same side of the ( Y )-axis:    - If ( lambda > 0 ), the intersection points are to the right of the ( Y )-axis.    - If ( lambda < 0 ), the intersection points are to the left of the ( Y )-axis. 5. If ( lambda = pm a ), the parabola touches the ( X )-axis at one point (the vertex is on the ( X )-axis). **4^{0}: Path Traced by the Vertex of the Curve as lambda Varies** 1. The coordinates of the vertex of the parabolas are ( (x, y) = (lambda, a^2 - lambda^2) ). 2. This indicates the vertex of the parabolas lies on another curve:    [    y = a^2 - x^2    ] 3. This equation represents another parabola opening downwards with the vertex at ( (0, a^2) ). **Conclusion**: - The vertices of the parabolas form the curve ( y = a^2 - x^2 ). boxed{}"},{"instruction":"The guests at a football banquet consumed a total of 327 pounds of food.

The last advertisement must be an Olympic promotional advertisement, and the two Olympic promotional advertisements cannot be broadcast consecutively. How many different broadcasting methods are there?  A. 120  B. 48  C. 36  D. 18","output":"To solve this problem, we first consider the placement of the 3 commercial advertisements and 1 Olympic promotional advertisement (excluding the one that must be last). Since the last advertisement must be an Olympic promotional advertisement, we only need to arrange the remaining 4 advertisements (3 commercial + 1 Olympic promotional). We can consider the 3 commercial advertisements as a group and the 1 Olympic promotional advertisement as another group. There are 4 positions to place these groups, which can be seen as arranging 4 different objects. Therefore, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange these advertisements. However, we must also consider the internal arrangement of the 3 commercial advertisements. Since these are distinct, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them within their group. Multiplying the arrangements of the groups by the internal arrangements of the commercial advertisements, we get 24 times 6 = 144 ways. But, since we have considered the Olympic promotional advertisement as a single group without internal arrangement, we need to divide by the number of ways we could arrange the 2 Olympic promotional advertisements if they were considered distinct. Since there's only 1 way to arrange a single item (the Olympic promotional advertisement in the sequence excluding the last position), we don't need to adjust our calculation for this. Finally, considering the requirement that the two Olympic promotional advertisements cannot be broadcast consecutively, we realize that the initial approach does not directly account for this constraint. The correct approach is to place the 3 commercial advertisements first, which can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Then, we have 4 slots created by these advertisements (before the first, between the first and second, between the second and third, and after the third) where we can place the Olympic promotional advertisements. Since we need to choose 2 out of these 4 slots without them being consecutive, and considering the last slot must be chosen for the final Olympic promotional advertisement, there are 3 choices for the placement of the other Olympic promotional advertisement (before the first commercial, between the first and second, or between the second and third).

We need to determine whether there exists a polynomial ( g(x) ) with real coefficients such that ( g(n) = f(n) ) for any integer ( n ). 1. **Notation**: Define ( Delta h(x) ) for a function ( h(x) ) as:    [ Delta h(x) = h(x+1) - h(x). ] 2. **Lemma Setup**: If ( Delta h(x) ) coincides in integer points with a polynomial of degree at most ( m-1 ), then ( h(x) ) coincides in integer points with a polynomial of degree at most ( m ). 3. **Proof of Lemma**:     - **Base Case**: For ( m = 1 ), if ( Delta h(x) ) is constant ( c ) at integer points, then:      [ h(x) = h(0) + cx text{ for all integers } x. ]    - **Inductive Step**: Suppose the lemma holds for ( m ).

[ h_0(x) = h(x) - frac{a}{(m+1)} x(x-1)(x-2) ldots (x-m). ]      Notice that:      [ Delta h_0(x) = Delta h(x) - a x(x-1)(x-2) ldots (x-m+1). ]      Therefore, ( Delta h_0(x) ) coincides with a polynomial of degree at most ( m-1 ) at integer points. By the inductive hypothesis, ( h_0(x) ) coincides with a polynomial of degree at most ( m ). Thus, ( h(x) ) coincides with a polynomial of degree at most ( m+1 ) at integer points. 4. **Inductive Proof on ( k )**:    - **Base Case** ( ( k = 0 ) ):      For each prime ( p ), there exists a constant ( Q_p ) such that ( f(x) - Q_p ) is divisible by ( p ).

Consider the function ( Delta f(x) ):      [ Delta f(x) = f(x+1) - f(x). ]      Since ( Delta f(x) - Delta Q_p(x) ) is divisible by ( p ) and ( Delta Q_p(x) ) is of degree no greater than ( k-1 ), ( Delta f(x) ) coincides with a polynomial of degree at most ( k-1 ).

This is due to the property of geometric sequences where the sign of the term changes if the common ratio is negative. 3. **Achieving the Minimum Value of a_{5}**: For a_{5} to achieve its minimum value, given that 1 and 9 are among the first 6 terms, it implies that q < 0. This is because a negative common ratio would result in alternating signs, and for a_{5} to be minimal, it should be negative. 4. **Position of 1 and 9**: Given q < 0, and aiming for the minimum value of a_{5}, 1 and 9 must be among a_{2}, a_{4}, and a_{6}. This ensures that we are considering the terms with the same sign and utilizing the negative common ratio effectively. 5. **Determining |q| for Minimum a_{5}**: When a_{2} = 1 and a_{4} = 9, the absolute value of q, |q|, is maximized. This scenario leads to the minimum possible value for a_{5} because a larger |q| (with q being negative) will result in a smaller (more negative) a_{5}. 6. **Calculating q and a_{5}**: At this point, we find that q = -3. This is deduced from the relationship a_{4} = a_{2}q^2, which gives 9 = 1 cdot q^2, leading to q^2 = 9 and hence q = -3 (since we established q must be negative for a_{5} to be minimal). Consequently, a_{5} = a_{4} cdot q = 9 cdot (-3) = -27. Therefore, the minimum value of a_{5} in this geometric sequence is boxed{-27}, which corresponds to choice boxed{B}."},{"instruction":"A man has some amount in dimes and nickels.

The speed of the jogger is 9 kmph, and the speed of the train is 45 kmph. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the jogger's speed from the train's speed to get the relative speed: Relative speed = Speed of train - Speed of jogger Relative speed = 45 kmph - 9 kmph Relative speed = 36 kmph To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to m/s by multiplying by (1000 m / 1 km) and dividing by (3600 s / 1 hour): Relative speed in m/s = 36 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in m/s = 36 * (10 / 36) Relative speed in m/s = 10 m/s The train takes 35 seconds to pass the jogger.

Let ( m, c, d, ) and ( u ) be the digits of the year of birth such that: [ y = 1000m + 100c + 10d + u ] Next, we need to subtract the sum of the constituent digits from the year of birth. The sum of the digits is: [ S = m + c + d + u ] So, we form the difference between the year of birth and the sum of its digits: [ y - S = (1000m + 100c + 10d + u) - (m + c + d + u) ] Let’s simplify this expression step by step: 1. Distribute the negative sign across the terms in ( S ):    [    y - S = 1000m + 100c + 10d + u - m - c - d - u    ] 2. Combine like terms:    [    y - S = (1000m - m) + (100c - c) + (10d - d) + (u - u)    ] 3. Simplify each group:    [    y - S = 999m + 99c + 9d + 0    ] Since ( u - u = 0 ), we can ignore this term. Therefore, we have:    [    y - S = 999m + 99c + 9d    ] 4. Factor out the common factor of 9:    [    y - S = 9(111m + 11c + d)    ] Notice that (111m + 11c + d) is an integer. Consequently, the entire expression (9(111m + 11c + d)) is clearly divisible by 9. This means that whenever we subtract the sum of the digits of a year from the year itself, the result will always be divisible by 9. # Conclusion: The number obtained by subtracting the sum of the digits of the year of birth from the year itself is always divisible by 9 because the calculation simplifies to (9(111m + 11c + d)), which is a multiple of 9.

This is a key observation that will guide the analysis of the options provided. 2. **Analyzing Option A (a_{1} < 0)**: Given the condition S_{n} leqslant S_{8}, for the sum of the first 8 terms to be maximized, the sequence must start decreasing after a certain point within these first 8 terms. This means the first term a_{1} could be positive to ensure a maximum sum before the sequence starts decreasing due to a negative common difference. Thus, option A is not necessarily true. 3. **Analyzing Option B (d < 0)**: For S_{n} leqslant S_{8} to hold, especially if the sum reaches a maximum at S_{8}, the common difference d must be negative. This ensures that the sum of the terms starts decreasing after reaching a peak, which aligns with the given condition. Therefore, d < 0 is a correct interpretation, making option B correct. 4. **Analyzing Option C (a_{8} = 0)**: The term a_{8} is calculated as S_{8} - S_{7}. Since S_{8} is the maximum sum up to the first 8 terms, a_{8} could be positive or zero, but not necessarily zero. Therefore, option C cannot be definitively stated as true based on the given information. 5. **Analyzing Option D (S_{17} leqslant 0)**: Considering a_{9} = S_{9} - S_{8} leqslant 0 due to the condition S_{n} leqslant S_{8} and a negative common difference, it follows that the sequence's terms become non-positive from the 9^{th} term onwards. The sum S_{17}, which includes these non-positive terms, would thus be less than or equal to zero, making option D correct. Therefore, the correct options, based on the analysis, are B and D.

First, we consider the given condition f(0) = 0. Based on the function f(x), we have: f(0) = Asin(omega cdot 0 + phi) = Asin(phi) = 0. Since A > 0, the above equation implies that sin(phi) = 0.

Since squaring is a strictly increasing function for non-negative numbers (which absolute values are), we can deduce that:    [    |a|^{2} > |b|^{2} implies |a| > |b|    ] 3. **Concluding the relationship between the inequalities:**    From the steps above, we see that starting from a^{2} > b^{2}, we logically deduced that |a| > |b|. This means that if a^{2} > b^{2} is true, then it is guaranteed that |a| > |b| is also true. Conversely, if |a| > |b|, then squaring both sides of this inequality (since squaring is a strictly increasing function for non-negative inputs) leads us back to a^{2} > b^{2}. Therefore, the condition \\"a^{2} > b^{2}\\" is both necessary and sufficient for \\"|a| > |b|\\". Thus, the correct answer to the question of the relationship between \\"a^{2} > b^{2}\\" and \\"|a| > |b|\\" is: [ boxed{text{C: Necessary and sufficient condition}} ]"},{"instruction":"A positive integer is called *fancy* if it can be expressed in the form    2^{a_1}+2^{a_2}+ cdots+ 2^{a_{100}},    where  a_1,a_2, cdots, a_{100}  are nonnegative integers that are not necessarily distinct. Find the smallest positive integer  n  such that no multiple of  n  is a *fancy* number. *Senior Problems Committee of the Australian Mathematical Olympiad Committee*","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that no multiple of ( n ) is a *fancy* number. A *fancy* number is defined as a sum of 100 powers of 2, where the exponents are non-negative integers. 1. **Understanding the structure of a *fancy* number:**    A *fancy* number can be written as:    [    2^{a_1} + 2^{a_2} + cdots + 2^{a_{100}}    ]    where ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100} ) are non-negative integers. This means that a *fancy* number is essentially a sum of 100 terms, each of which is a power of 2. 2. **Binary representation:**    Each term ( 2^{a_i} ) in the sum corresponds to a 1 in the binary representation of the number at position ( a_i ). Therefore, a *fancy* number has exactly 100 ones in its binary representation. 3. **Finding the smallest ( n ):**    We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that no multiple of ( n ) can be a *fancy* number. This means that for any integer ( k ), ( k cdot n ) should not have exactly 100 ones in its binary representation. 4. **Considering ( n = 2^k - 1 ):**    Let's consider ( n = 2^k - 1 ). We need to show that no multiple of ( 2^k - 1 ) can be a *fancy* number.    - **Binary representation of ( 2^k - 1 ):**      The number ( 2^k - 1 ) in binary is represented as ( k ) ones. For example, ( 2^3 - 1 = 7 ) is ( 111 ) in binary.    - **Multiples of ( 2^k - 1 ):**      Any multiple of ( 2^k - 1 ) will have a binary representation that is a repetition of the pattern of ( k ) ones. For example, ( 3 cdot (2^3 - 1) = 3 cdot 7 = 21 ), which is ( 10101 ) in binary. 5. **Checking the number of ones:**    - If ( k ) is chosen such that ( k > 100 ), then any multiple of ( 2^k - 1 ) will have more than 100 ones in its binary representation.    - If ( k leq 100 ), then the number of ones in any multiple of ( 2^k - 1 ) will be a multiple of ( k ). Since ( k ) is a divisor of 100, it cannot be equal to 100 unless ( k = 100 ). 6. **Conclusion:**    The smallest ( k ) such that ( 2^k - 1 ) ensures no multiple of it can be a *fancy* number is when ( k = 101 ). This is because ( 2^{101} - 1 ) has 101 ones in its binary representation, and any multiple of it will have more than 100 ones. Therefore, the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that no multiple of ( n ) is a *fancy* number is ( 2^{101} - 1 ).

As ( ell ) rotates 180 degrees, ( b-r ) will become negative. 6. **Intermediate Value Theorem:**    - Since ( b-r ) changes by 1 each time ( ell ) passes over a point, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a position of ( ell ) where ( b-r = 0 ).

By the induction hypothesis, we can pair the ( 2k ) points on the right and the ( 2(n-k) ) points on the left such that no two segments intersect within each group. 8. **Combining Pairs:**    - Since ( ell ) separates the points into two non-intersecting groups, the pairs formed on the right and left of ( ell ) will not intersect each other.

Describe all possible values of ( S ) with justification.","output":":  We are given a square with sides of length 1 text{ cm}. We need to determine all possible values of the sum ( S ) of the perimeters of four rectangles obtained by cutting this square.  Step 1: Understanding the Perimeter Calculation To find the sum of the perimeters of the four rectangles, we consider any cuts we make inside the square. Any internal cut will add to the perimeter of more than one rectangle. For simplicity, we denote these internal cuts and their contributions as follows: - A cut of length ( l ) that spans the entire side adds ( 2l ) to the perimeter of the resulting rectangles. - Any partial cut ( x ) adds ( 2x ).  Step 2: Base Perimeter The original perimeter of the square is: [ 4 text{ cm} ]  Step 3: General Case - Horizontal or Vertical Cut Suppose we make a single cut (either horizontal or vertical) through the entire length of the square. This will separate the square into two equal parts: [ text{Additional perimeter added} = 2 cdot 1 = 2 text{ cm} ] Thus, the sum of the perimeters of the two resulting rectangles will be: [ S = 4 + 2 = 6 text{ cm} ] However, since we need four rectangles, additional cuts are needed.  Step 4: Further Cuts and Maximum Case Consider the diagrams shown (let’s take Squares 1 and 8). They represent a strategy of making three parallel cuts, creating four 1 times frac{1}{4} rectangles. Each parallel cut spans the entire length of the side: [ text{Total length of internal segments} = 3 cdot 1 = 3 ] Then: [ text{Additional perimeter added} = 2 cdot 3 = 6 text{ cm} ] Thus, the total sum of perimeters is: [ S = 4 + 6 = 10 text{ cm} ]  Step 5: Intermediate Values By varying the placements of cuts inside the square, we can achieve any value between the aforementioned minimum and maximum: - If the cut lengths differ from spanning the entire side to partial lengths, the total added perimeter ( 2a ) can take any value between 0 to 6 cm. - Hence, intermediate values: [ S = 4 + 2a ]  Step 6: Possible Values of (a) - ( 0 < a leq 3 ) - Therefore: [ 6 < S leq 10 ]  Conclusion: The possible values of ( S ) when we cut the square into four rectangles and sum their perimeters lie in the interval ( (6,10] ).

When examining the remainders modulo 2009:    - If any pair of numbers in ( A ) have the same remainder, their difference will be divisible by 2009, and we are done.    - Suppose all 1006 remainders when divided by 2009 are unique. These unique remainders form a 1006-element subset of ({0, 1, ldots, 2008}). 6. **Reformatting the set of remainders**:    The set of remainders can be viewed modulo 2009 as elements within:    [    X = {-1004, -1003, ldots, -1, 0, 1, 2, ldots, 1004}    ]    This set ( X ) contains exactly 2009 numbers. 7. **Sum within a shifted set**:    By the pigeonhole principle, every subset of 1006 elements chosen from ( X ) must contain at least one pair of elements whose sum equals zero,    [    a + (-a) = 0 quad (text{mod } 2009)    ]    Hence, the sum ( a + b ) of two distinct numbers in ( A ) will be divisible by 2009. 8. **Final conclusion**:    Therefore, 1006 is the least integer ( n ) with the desired property.

Clearly, ( m geq 4 ) because no three points are collinear and it is a finite set. 3. **Convex Hull and Parallelogram**:    - Pick ( i = 1 ). Consider the edge ( A_1A_2 ). Since ( S ) is finite and ( A_1A_2 ) is part of the convex hull, all points in ( S ) lie on one side of the line through ( A_1A_2 ).    - Set up a coordinate system with ( A_1 ) as the origin ((0, 0)) and ( A_1A_2 ) along the x-axis. Hence, any point ( X (x_1, y_1) in S ) will have ( y_1 > 0 ). 4. **Existence of Point ( D )**:    - Assume there exists a point ( X_0(x_0, y_0) in S ) such that ( y_0 ) is maximal. ( X_0 ) must be a vertex of the convex hull, otherwise, it contradicts the maximal ( y )-value.    - Suppose ( X_0 = A_k (k neq i, i+1) ). Consider ( A_1, A_2, A_k ). 5. **Forming a Parallelogram**:    - There exists point ( D in S ) as per the problem's condition such that ( A_1, A_2, A_k, D ) form a parallelogram. Let ( D(x_D, y_D) ). From geometric properties, ( y_D > 0 ).    - Thus, ( X_0D parallel A_1A_2 ) and ( X_0D = A_1A_2 ). 6. **Final Arrangement**:    - This proves all points ( D ) lie on the convex hull unless contradicting, proving that ( S ) forms a convex hull which must be a parallelogram.     - Any point not on the convex hull leading to a parallelogram structure ( A_1A_2A_kD ) must lead ( D ) back to a vertex on the parallelogram structure. 7. **Consider Largest Triangle**:    - Assume ( S ) contains the largest area triangle ( triangle A_1 A_r A_s ) on ( S )'s convex hull.    - Consider a triangle ( triangle B_0 B_1 B_2 ) such that ( triangle A_1 A_r A_s ) lies entirely within it.    - Any configuration of ( A, B, C ) forming ( D subset S ) ensuring ( A, B, C, D ) forming a parallelogram, contradicts any point lying outside the convex hull without forming a perfect parallelogram with any of ( B_0, B_1, B_2 ). 8. **Conclusion**:    This completes our proof by contradiction that the convex hull of ( S ) must be the set of vertices of a parallelogram. If ( S ) were any larger non-parallel configuration, it would lead to inconsistencies given the problem constraints. Hence, ( S ) must exactly be the four vertices of a parallelogram in a plane.

For the function to be monotonically increasing, its derivative must be non-negative on the interval (2, +infty). Firstly, since we are dealing with a logarithmic function, the base of the logarithm, a, should be greater than 1 in order for it to be increasing. This implies that a > 1. Now, let's examine the inner function g(x) = x^3 - ax. To ensure that f(x) is increasing, g(x) must also be increasing. We can derive g(x) to get its derivative g'(x):  g'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - ax) = 3x^2 - a.  For the derivative to be non-negative over (2, +infty):  3x^2 - a geq 0, , forall x > 2.  This inequality should hold for the minimal value of x in the interval, which is 2. Plugging x=2 into the inequality:  3(2)^2 - a geq 0 Rightarrow 12 - a geq 0 Rightarrow a leq 12.  Therefore, combining the two conditions (a > 1 and a leq 12), we conclude that 1 < a leq 12. However, we must also ensure that the argument of the logarithm function is positive, since the logarithm is only defined for positive values. This means that for x = 2, the inequality x^3 - ax > 0 must hold:  (2)^3 - a(2) > 0 Rightarrow 8 - 2a > 0 Rightarrow a < 4.  Once more, combining all conditions (a > 1, a leq 12, and a < 4), we narrow down the range of a to 1 < a leq 4.

To construct the square using these points, we proceed as follows: 1. **Identify the Circles:**     - Consider the line segments ( KP ) and ( RQ ) as diameters of circles. Recall that any angle subtended by the diameter of a circle is a right angle (Thales' theorem). 2. **Construct the Circles:**     - Construct circles with diameters ( KP ) and ( RQ ). Points ( B ) and ( D ) are on the circumference of the circles since ( angle KBR ) and ( angle PDR ) are right angles because of the properties of circle diameters. 3. **Finding the Centers (M and N):**     - Let ( M ) and ( N ) be the midpoints of the semicircles directed towards each other, with ( KP ) and ( RQ ) as their diameters.     - Since the diagonals of a square bisect each other and meet at right angles, line ( MN ) is the diagonal of the square. 4. **Intersection:**     - Let ( D ) be the intersection point of the diagonal of the square and circles. 5. **Completion:**     - Diagonals of the square intersect at ( O ), the center of the square. This shows that the diagonal cuts the square into two equal right-angled isosceles triangles.  Similarly for another method: 1. **Assume Given Points:**     - Points ( K, P, R, Q ) are given on the sides of the square ( AB, BC, CD, AD ). 2. **Perpendicular from R:**     - Draw a perpendicular from ( R ) to ( PQ ) and let ( X ) be the intersection point of this perpendicular with ( PQ ). 3. **Equal Segment on Perpendicular:**     - On this perpendicular from ( R ), mark a point ( S ) such that ( RS = PQ ). 4. **Coordinate of Point S and Confirmation:**     - If ( S ) coincides with ( K ), it confirms the sides.     - Otherwise, construct line ( KS ); it is a side of the square. 5. **Remain Confirmation:**     - Draw remaining sides; they meet at right angles, confirming a square. Conclusively, the above steps ensure constructing a square given the four points on different sides via geometric properties (right angles, circle theorem).

Given that both Sarah's and Ryan's services shipped the same number of packages this morning, which is 198, we can set up the following equation: ( 18 times S = R times R' ) where ( S ) is the number of loads Sarah's trucks made and ( R' ) is the number of loads Ryan's trucks made. Since we know that Sarah's trucks carry 18 packages per load, we can find out how many loads Sarah's trucks made by dividing the total number of packages by 18: ( S = frac{198}{18} ) ( S = 11 ) So, Sarah's trucks made 11 loads. Now, we need to find a number ( R ) such that when multiplied by some integer ( R' ), it equals 198. Since we know that Sarah's trucks made 11 loads, we can infer that Ryan's trucks would need to make fewer loads because they carry more packages per load than Sarah's trucks.

If leading zeros are not allowed, the number of codes lost would not be 10000.

If leading zeros are not allowed, the first digit can only be from 1 to 9 (9 possibilities), while the remaining three digits can be from 0 to 9 (10 possibilities each). So, the number of possible codes without leading zeros is 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 9000. The number of codes lost when disallowing leading zeros is the difference between the total possible codes with leading zeros and without leading zeros: 10000 (with leading zeros) - 9000 (without leading zeros) = 1000 codes lost.

(2) Find the mathematical expectation and variance of xi and eta, and compare the shooting skills of shooter A and shooter B.","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution:  Part 1: Finding the Distribution of xi and eta - For shooter A, we are given the probabilities of hitting 10, 9, 8, and 7 rings as 0.5, 3a, a, and 0.1, respectively. Since the total probability must sum up to 1, we have: 0.5 + 3a + a + 0.1 = 1 Solving for a, we get: 4a = 1 - 0.5 - 0.1 = 0.4 Rightarrow a = 0.1 Thus, the probabilities for shooter A are: P(xi = 10) = 0.5, quad P(xi = 9) = 3 times 0.1 = 0.3, quad P(xi = 8) = 0.1, quad P(xi = 7) = 0.1 - For shooter B, the probabilities of hitting 10, 9, and 8 rings are given as 0.3, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively. To find the probability of hitting 7 rings, we subtract the sum of these probabilities from 1: P(eta = 7) = 1 - (0.3 + 0.3 + 0.2) = 0.2 Thus, the probabilities for shooter B are: P(eta = 10) = 0.3, quad P(eta = 9) = 0.3, quad P(eta = 8) = 0.2, quad P(eta = 7) = 0.2 Therefore, the distributions of xi and eta are as follows: - For xi (Shooter A): P(xi = 10) = 0.5, P(xi = 9) = 0.3, P(xi = 8) = 0.1, P(xi = 7) = 0.1 - For eta (Shooter B): P(eta = 10) = 0.3, P(eta = 9) = 0.3, P(eta = 8) = 0.2, P(eta = 7) = 0.2  Part 2: Mathematical Expectation and Variance - The expectation for xi and eta can be calculated as follows: Exi = 10 times 0.5 + 9 times 0.3 + 8 times 0.1 + 7 times 0.1 = 9.2 Eeta = 10 times 0.3 + 9 times 0.3 + 8 times 0.2 + 7 times 0.2 = 8.7 - The variance for xi and eta can be calculated as follows: Dxi = 0.5 times (10 - 9.2)^2 + 0.3 times (9 - 9.2)^2 + 0.1 times (8 - 9.2)^2 + 0.1 times (7 - 9.2)^2 = 0.96 Deta = 0.3 times (10 - 8.7)^2 + 0.3 times (9 - 8.7)^2 + 0.2 times (8 - 8.7)^2 + 0.2 times (7 - 8.7)^2 = 1.21  Conclusion: - Shooter A has a higher average score (Exi = 9.2) than shooter B (Eeta = 8.7), and a relatively stable performance (Dxi = 0.96 < Deta = 1.21).

Let's denote the number of female democrats as D_F and the number of male democrats as D_M. Then: D_F = 1/2 * F (half of the female participants are democrats) D_M = 1/4 * M (one-quarter of the male participants are democrats) We also know that one-third of all participants are democrats: D_F + D_M = 1/3 * (F + M) D_F + D_M = 1/3 * 870 D_F + D_M = 290 (total number of democrat participants) Now we can substitute D_F and D_M in terms of F and M into the equation: 1/2 * F + 1/4 * M = 290 We need to find the value of D_F, which is 1/2 * F. To do this, we need to find the value of F.

When there is no traffic, the same trip takes only 4 hours. During the heavy traffic trip, she encounters two construction zones, each taking an additional 15 minute delay per zone, and has to take 3 rest stops each taking 10 minutes. When there is no traffic, she takes 2 rest stops each taking 10 minutes. If her son's house is 200 miles away, what is the difference between her average speed when there is heavy traffic and when there is no traffic, taking into account the delays and rest stops?","output":"First, let's calculate the total time Jennie spends on the road during heavy traffic without the delays and rest stops. Since each construction zone delay is 15 minutes and there are two zones, that's a total of 30 minutes of delay. Additionally, she takes 3 rest stops, each lasting 10 minutes, which adds up to 30 minutes. So, the total delay and rest time during heavy traffic is 30 minutes (construction zones) + 30 minutes (rest stops) = 60 minutes or 1 hour. The total time Jennie spends on the road during heavy traffic is 5 hours, so the actual driving time without delays and rest stops is 5 hours - 1 hour = 4 hours. Now, let's calculate the total time Jennie spends on the road during no traffic without the rest stops. She takes 2 rest stops, each lasting 10 minutes, which adds up to 20 minutes or 1/3 of an hour. The total time Jennie spends on the road during no traffic is 4 hours, so the actual driving time without rest stops is 4 hours - 1/3 hour = 3 hours and 40 minutes or 3.67 hours. Now we can calculate her average speed during both scenarios: For heavy traffic: Distance = 200 miles Time = 4 hours Average speed = Distance / Time = 200 miles / 4 hours = 50 mph For no traffic: Distance = 200 miles Time = 3.67 hours Average speed = Distance / Time = 200 miles / 3.67 hours ≈ 54.5 mph The difference between her average speed during heavy traffic and no traffic is: 54.5 mph - 50 mph = 4.5 mph So, the difference between her average speed when there is heavy traffic and when there is no traffic, taking into account the delays and rest stops, is boxed{4.5}  mph."},{"instruction":"The graph of the quadratic function y=ax^2+bx+2 passes through the point (1,0).

It turns out that there is only one number among them such that the product of the remaining numbers can be represented as the difference of the squares of two natural numbers. Prove that this number is 2006.","output":"Part (a) 1. Recall that a natural number can be expressed as the difference of squares of two natural numbers if and only if it can be written as the product of two different numbers of the same parity (i.e., both odd or both even). 2. First, consider the 2007 natural numbers greater than 1. If there's exactly one even number, we can ensure that the product of the remaining numbers can be expressed as the difference of squares of two natural numbers. 3. If there are two or more even numbers, we can ignore one of the even numbers to meet the condition. Thus, it is sufficient to show that the product of any remaining numbers can be expressed as the difference of squares if there is an odd number of even numbers. 4. If there is exactly one even number, denote it as ( n_1 ), and all other natural numbers are odd. The product of these odd numbers is still an odd number. Removing the single even number makes the remaining product an odd number greater than 1. 5. An odd number greater than 1 can be written as the difference of squares ( a^2 - b^2 ). Specifically, forall , k = 2m + 1 (an odd number), it can be represented as ( (m+1)^2 - m^2 ).  6. If there are multiple even numbers, say ( n_1, n_2, ldots, n_k ), and ( n_1 ) is even:    - Remove ( n_1 ). Finally, the product of the remaining numbers will be either odd or in the form of 4 multiplied by another number (achieved by leaving at least another even number).

Thus, we have: boxed{} ---  Part (b) 1. Consider the 2007 natural numbers, where exactly one of them is 2006. 2. From Part (a), we've established that a product can be represented as a difference of squares under specific conditions on parity. Here, 2006 is the only even number: 3. If there was another even number among the set, then, by excluding 2006, the resulting condition would allow multiple combinations leading to products that can be expressed as a difference of squares. 4. However, since 2006 is the only even number present:    - Removing 2006 leaves the product of 2006 and excluding 2006 as odd numbers.    - Any odd product of multiple numbers can be expressed as a difference of squares as described in part (a), where an odd number is greater than 1. 5. The given constraint inherently ensures that the unique condition of having only one even number is satisfied, i.e., 2006 is the only even number in the set of 2007 numbers.

Since the sum of the angles in any triangle is pi (180 degrees), we have:        alpha + beta + gamma = pi         Consequently, the ranges for the individual angles must satisfy:        0 < alpha leq frac{pi}{3}         since alpha is the smallest angle and all angles must add up to pi. Thus:        0 < tan(alpha) leq sqrt{3}        Since tan(alpha) must be a natural number, we must have tan(alpha) = 1. Thus, alpha = frac{pi}{4}. 2. Now, with alpha = frac{pi}{4}, it follows that:        beta + gamma = pi - alpha = pi - frac{pi}{4} = frac{3pi}{4}      3. Using the tangent sum formula for beta and gamma:        tan(beta + gamma) = frac{tan(beta) + tan(gamma)}{1 - tan(beta) tan(gamma)}        Given that beta + gamma = frac{3pi}{4}, we have:        tan(frac{3pi}{4}) = -1 = frac{tan(beta) + tan(gamma)}{1 - tan(beta) tan(gamma)}     4. This results in the equation:        -1 = frac{tan(beta) + tan(gamma)}{1 - tan(beta) tan(gamma)}        Simplifying, this gives:        tan(beta) + tan(gamma) = tan(beta) tan(gamma) - 1        Rearranging terms, we get:        (tan(beta) - 1)(tan(gamma) - 1) = 2     5. Since 2 is a prime number, the expressions (tan(beta) - 1) and (tan(gamma) - 1) must be 1 and 2 (or vice versa), as there are no other natural number pairs that multiply to 2. Thus, we have the cases:        tan(beta) - 1 = 1 quad text{and} quad tan(gamma) - 1 = 2        which imply:        tan(beta) = 2 quad text{and} quad tan(gamma) = 3     6. Hence, the natural number values for the tangents of the angles of the triangle are tan(alpha) = 1, tan(beta) = 2, and tan(gamma) = 3. 7. We need to check if there could be any other possible values. Since the smallest angle must be equal to frac{pi}{4} (as discussed earlier) and given that tan(alpha) must equal 1, any other values for natural tangents must adhere to similar constraints and transformations:     - The other combinations distinctly do not satisfy the given sum property without resulting in contradictions or undefined values.

Determine all  n  such that 5 does not divide  q_n .","output":"To solve the problem, we need to determine all positive integers ( n ) such that the denominator ( q_n ) of the sum ( sum_{m=1}^n frac{1}{m} ) in its lowest terms is not divisible by 5. We will use the given theorems and corollaries to systematically identify these integers. 1. **Theorem I**: If ( frac{a_i}{b_i} ) are fractions in their lowest terms for ( i=1, 2, 3 ), ( frac{a_1}{b_1} + frac{a_2}{b_2} = frac{a_3}{b_3} ), and ( b_1 ) is not divisible by 5, then the highest power of 5 dividing ( b_2 ) and ( b_3 ) are the same.    **Proof**:     - If 5 is not a factor of ( b_2 ), then ( b_3 ) is a factor of ( b_1 b_2 ) and hence not divisible by 5.    - If ( b_2 ) is a multiple of 5, then ( a_2 ) is not, and hence ( a_2 b_1 ) is not, and hence ( a_2 b_1 + a_1 b_2 ) is not a multiple of 5.    - Thus, since ( b_3 = frac{b_1 b_2}{gcd(b_1 b_2, a_2 b_1 + a_1 b_2)} ), ( b_3 ) and ( b_2 ) are divisible by the same powers of 5. 2. **Corollary II**: For ( 0 le k le 4 ) and positive integer ( n ), the highest power of 5 dividing the denominator of ( frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} + ldots + frac{1}{5n+k} ) is the same as that dividing the denominator of ( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{10} + ldots + frac{1}{5n} ).    **Proof**: The integer reciprocals omitted in the latter sum give a fraction whose denominator is not divisible by 5. 3. **Corollary III**: For ( 0 le k le 4 ) and positive integer ( n ), ( q_{5n+k} ) is not divisible by 5 if and only if ( p_n ) is divisible by 5.    **Proof**: Corollary II states that the highest power of 5 dividing ( q_{5n+k} ) is the same as the highest power of five dividing the lowest-terms denominator of ( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{10} + ldots + frac{1}{5n} = frac{p_n}{5q_n} ). This will be a multiple of 5 if ( p_n ) is not divisible by 5. If, on the other hand, ( p_n ) is a multiple of 5, then ( q_n ) is not, so the 5 will cancel. 4. **Corollary IV**: If we define ( D ) to be the set of integers such that ( q_n ) is not divisible by 5 and ( N ) to be the set of integers such that ( p_n ) is divisible by 5, then ( N ) is a subset of ( D ) and for ( 0 le k le 4 ) and ( n > 0 ), ( 5n+k in D ) iff ( n in N ).    **Proof**: ( 5n+k in D ) iff ( n in N ) is the content of Corollary III. If we let ( n ) be some element of ( N ) that is not in ( D ), then the coprime integers ( p_n ) and ( q_n ) are both divisible by 5, which is a contradiction. 5. **Lemma V**: ( {1,2,3} subset (D setminus N) ), while ( 4 in N subset D ).    **Proof**: Let us consider the integers 1 to 4 separately:    - ( frac{1}{1} = frac{1}{1} ), so 1 is in ( D ) but not ( N ).    - ( frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2} ), so 2 is in ( D ) but not ( N ).    - ( frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} = frac{11}{6} ), so 3 is in ( D ) but not ( N ).    - ( frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{4} = frac{25}{12} ), so 4 is in ( D ) and in ( N ). 6. **Theorem VI**: ( N = {4, 20, 24} ), so ( D = {1, 2, 3, 4, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124} ).    **Partial Proof**:    - Since 4 is in ( N ), it follows that the numbers 20 up to 24 are in ( D ).    - By inspection, 20 and 24 are the numbers in this range in ( N ).    - Thus the numbers in the ranges ( [100..104] ) and ( [120..124] ) are both contained in ( D ).    - By further inspection, none of these numbers are in ( N ).    Then given a minimal number ( n ) other than ( {4, 20, 24} ) in ( N ), ( n ge 5 ) by Lemma V. Then ( n = 5k + r ) for some positive integer ( k ) and integer ( 0 le r le 4 ). Then ( n ) is in ( N ) which means that ( n ) is in ( D ) and hence ( k ) is in ( N ) by Corollary IV. By the minimality of ( N ), ( k in {4, 20, 24} ) and hence ( n in {21, 22, 23, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124} ). However, we have already inspected that none of these ( n ) are in ( N ). The final answer is ( boxed{ {1, 2, 3, 4, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124} } )."},{"instruction":"m  and  n  are positive integers.

Then ( 4m(m-n)^2 + 4 neq 4 ), so ( 4m(m-n)^2 + 4 ) has a prime divisor ( p ). 3. Since ( k ) is an integer, we have:    [    p mid 4m(m-n)^2 + 4 implies p mid (m+n)^2    ]    This implies ( p mid m+n ). 4. Multiply the first relation by ((m+n)^2) and subtract the second one from it:    [    p mid 4m(m-n)^2(m+n)^2 + 4(m+n)^2 - (m+n)^2    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    p mid 4m(m-n)^2(m+n)^2 + 3(m+n)^2    ]    Since ( p mid (m+n)^2 ), we can factor out ((m+n)^2):    [    p mid (m+n)^2 (4m(m-n)^2 + 3)    ]    Since ( p mid (m+n)^2 ), it must also divide ( 4m(m-n)^2 + 3 ). 5. Now, consider the prime divisor ( p ) of ( 4m(m-n)^2 + 4 ). Since ( p mid (m+n)^2 ), we have:    [    p mid m(m-n)^4    ]    This is impossible because ( p ) does not appear in the prime factorization of ( m ) or ( (m-n) ), otherwise, the initial relation would imply ( p mid 1 ), which is a contradiction. 6. Therefore, we must have ( m = n ). Substituting ( m = n ) into the expression for ( k ):    [    k = frac{(m+m)^2}{4m(m-m)^2 + 4} = frac{(2m)^2}{4} = m^2    ] 7. Hence, ( k ) is a perfect square.

The reduction of 40% in the price means that the reduced price R is 60% of the original price P, i.e., R = 0.6P. The man can now obtain 64 more apples for Rs. 40, which means that the number of apples he could get for Rs. 40 at the original price was fewer by 64 than the number he can get at the reduced price. Let's denote the number of apples he could get for Rs. 40 at the original price as A, and the number of apples he can get at the reduced price as A + 64. Using the original price, the cost for A apples would be A * P = 40 Rs. Using the reduced price, the cost for A + 64 apples would be (A + 64) * R = 40 Rs. Since R = 0.6P, we can substitute R in the second equation: (A + 64) * 0.6P = 40 Now, we know that A * P = 40, so we can substitute AP with 40 in the above equation: (A + 64) * 0.6 * (40 / A) = 40 Simplifying, we get: 0.6 * (A + 64) = A 0.6A + 38.4 = A 38.4 = A - 0.6A 38.4 = 0.4A A = 38.4 / 0.4 A = 96 So, the man could originally get 96 apples for Rs. 40.

Now, let's find the reduced price per apple: 40 Rs / 160 apples = 0.25 Rs per apple To find the reduced price per dozen (12 apples), we multiply the price per apple by 12: 0.25 Rs/apple * 12 apples/dozen = 3 Rs/dozen So, the reduced price per dozen is Rs. boxed{3} ."},{"instruction":"Calculate:<br/>(1)sqrt{16}+sqrt[3]{{27}}+|sqrt{3}2|;<br/>(2)(16a^{4}b^{3}12a^{3}b^{2}+4ab)div 4ab.","output":"# Solution:  For the first part: We calculate each term step by step: 1. sqrt{16} = 4 because 4^2 = 16. 2. sqrt[3]{-27} = -3 because (-3)^3 = -27. 3. |sqrt{3}-2| requires two steps:    - First, calculate sqrt{3} - 2.

We also have that A = {-4, 0} because the quadratic equation x^2 + 4x = 0 can be factored as x(x+4) = 0. We want to find the conditions under which B subseteq A, so we analyze the quadratic equation that defines set B: x^2 + 2(a+1)x + a^2 - 1 = 0. This quadratic equation can potentially yield two solutions, depending on the discriminant Delta. We calculate the discriminant Delta for the second quadratic equation: Delta = [2(a+1)]^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (a^2 - 1) = 4(a+1)^2 - 4(a^2 - 1) = 4(2a + 2) = 8a + 8. We now consider the discriminant Delta under different conditions: 1. If Delta = 8a + 8 < 0, which occurs when a < -1, then B has no real roots. Therefore, B = emptyset, which is trivially a subset of any set A, including A = {-4, 0}. 2. If Delta = 8a + 8 = 0, which happens when a = -1, then B has a single real root. This implies that B is a singleton set that could potentially be a subset of A. A quick check of the quadratic equation for B when a = -1 reveals that B = {0}, so B subseteq A is true in this case. 3. If Delta = 8a + 8 > 0, which is true when a > -1, then B has two distinct real roots. For B subseteq A, these roots must be exactly the elements of A. Solving the quadratic equation for B with the quadratic formula, we find the two roots as a function of a and equate them to the elements in A:    - For x = -4, the equation becomes (-4)^2 + 2(a+1)(-4) + a^2 - 1 = 0. Simplifying, we get 16 - 8(a+1) + a^2 - 1 = 0 Rightarrow a^2 - 8a + 15 = 0. The solutions for this quadratic equation are a = 3 or a = 5.

We need to determine the correct expression involving a, b, c, and d for the area A based on given conditions. 1. **Area Calculation - Diagonal as a Symmetry Line**:        The quadrilateral MNPQ can be divided into two triangles by its diagonal MP. The area A of MNPQ can be expressed as the sum of the areas of these two triangles. Hence:    [    A = frac{1}{2} times a times b times sin N + frac{1}{2} times c times d times sin Q    ]    where N and Q are the angles at vertices N and Q, respectively. 2. **Area Calculation - Considering Alternate Diagonal**:    Alternatively, if we consider the diagonal NQ, we again get two triangles.

Consequently, we have 23 participants and 23 possible values for the number of friends: from 0 to 22. 5. But here appears a contradiction. If there exists a participant (P) who has 22 friends, then (P) is friends with every other participant. Therefore, every other participant must have at least 1 friend. 6. Simultaneously, if there is another participant (Q) who has 0 friends, this participant cannot have any friends, and hence cannot have (Q) as a friend. 7.

How many seconds does it take for the dog to catch the sheep?","output":"Let's calculate the distance the sheepdog covers before it needs to stop for a breath. The sheepdog runs at 30 feet per second and stops every 100 feet. So, it takes the sheepdog ( frac{100 text{ feet}}{30 text{ feet/second}} = frac{10}{3} text{ seconds} ) to cover 100 feet before it needs to stop for 3 seconds. Now, let's calculate the distance the sheep covers while the sheepdog is running and resting. In ( frac{10}{3} text{ seconds} ), the sheep, running at 18 feet per second, will cover ( 18 text{ feet/second} times frac{10}{3} text{ seconds} = 60 text{ feet} ).

We will use the following steps to derive the solution: 1. **Define the Problem:**    We need to find the heaviest and lightest objects among ( n ) objects using a balance. The balance can compare two objects at a time, and we need to minimize the number of comparisons. 2. **Measure of Progress:**    To prove that a given object is not the heaviest or the lightest, we need to display a heavier and a lighter object. We will call an object *light* if we have found a heavier object and *heavy* if we have found a lighter object. Our measure of progress will be the number of light objects plus the number of heavy objects. By the end of the algorithm, we should have a total of ( 2n - 2 ) (since we need to identify ( n-1 ) objects that are not the heaviest and ( n-1 ) objects that are not the lightest). 3. **Adversary Argument:**    Imagine an adversary who controls the balance. If we give the adversary two objects about which we know nothing (neither heavy nor light), our progress must increase by 2 (since one will be heavier and one will be lighter). Otherwise, the adversary can make our progress increase by at most 1 (since we will only learn about one object being heavier or lighter). 4. **Progress Calculation:**    We can only get double progress on ( leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ) of our weighings. This is because each weighing involving two unknown objects will give us 2 units of progress. For the remaining weighings, we will get only 1 unit of progress. 5. **Minimum Number of Weighings:**    To achieve a total progress of ( 2n - 2 ), we need to account for the weighings that give us double progress and those that give us single progress. The minimum number of weighings required is:    [    2n - 2 - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor    ] Therefore, the minimum number of weighings required to find both the heaviest and lightest objects among ( n ) objects is ( 2n - 2 - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ).

For the first term, 3x^{2}y, the degree is 2+1=3. For the second term, -2xy, the degree is 1+1=2. The highest degree of any term in the polynomial determines the polynomial's degree, which is 3 in this case, not 5.

Consider the two 1982 times 1983 grids where each small square is painted either red or blue, such that each row and each column of the grid contains an odd number of blue squares.     2. When these two grids are properly aligned and overlaid, there is at least one square where a blue cell from one grid coincides with a red cell from the other. This is our initial observation, which we will build upon. 3. Now consider the row that contains this initially identified mismatched cell. In this row, we note that due to the parity condition (an odd number of blue cells):     - The number of blue cells in this row from the first grid is odd.     - The number of blue cells in this row from the second grid is also odd. 4. If our initial mismatched cell within this row indicates one blue-on-red overlap, then the remaining blue cells in the row must still follow the parity condition for each grid. 5. Given the specificity of the parity condition, if there were no other such blue-on-red overlaps in the rest of the row, we would violate the condition that each row contains an odd number of blue squares, leading to a contradiction.   6. Therefore, at least one more such mismatched square (blue-on-red) must exist in this row to satisfy the parity of blue cells in the row. 7. By similar logic, we analyze the column containing the initially identified mismatched cell. Therein:     - The number of blue cells in this column from the first grid is odd.     - The number of blue cells in this column from the second grid is also odd. 8. The parity condition dictates that, similarly to the row argument, another mismatched cell (blue-on-red) must exist in this column. 9. Consequently, at least three mismatched cells must be determined:     - The originally calculated blue-on-red cell,     - One additional blue-on-red cell within the same row,      - One additional blue-on-red cell within the same column. Conclusively, our arguments establish the parity conditions ensuring that there are at least 3 such mismatched cells (blue-on-red or red-on-blue): [boxed{3}]"},{"instruction":"A woman purchased 3 towels at Rs. 100 each, 5 towels at Rs. 150 each, and two towels at a certain rate which is now slipped off from her memory.

An overtake at the segment boundaries is not counted.","output":"1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - Two teams of 20 participants each are running a relay race from Moscow to Petushki.    - Each team splits the distance into 20 segments, not necessarily equal, and each participant runs exactly one segment.    - The speed of each runner is constant but different.    - The first runners from both teams start simultaneously, and the baton handoff happens instantaneously.    - We need to figure out the maximum number of overtakes in such a relay race, with overtakes at the segment borders not counting. 2. **Upper Bound Explanation:**    - Consider the initial overtakes and changes of the running participants between overtakes. 3. **Number of Changes:**    - In each team, there are 19 transitions as each runner finishes their segment and passes the baton to the next runner.    - Therefore, for both teams together, there are (19 + 19 = 38) transitions. 4. **Maximum Number of Overtakes:**    - Each overtake necessitates that at least one runner from a team switches, because overtakes cannot be counted at the segment borders, only within segments.    - Thus, the total number of overtakes cannot exceed the number of transitions, which is 38. 5. **Illustrating 38 Overtakes:**    - To show that 38 overtakes are possible, consider constructing a sequence wherein such overtakes can be counted. 6. **Trajectory Representation:**    - Draw the movement trajectories of the teams on a graph, with the horizontal axis representing time and the vertical axis representing distance.     - Plot a trajectory for each team where the positions (distance covered) of team members form a polyline with consecutive segments. 7. **Example Construction:**    - Construct a polyline for the first team consisting of 40 consecutive sides of a regular 160-gon, oriented such that the last side is horizontal.      - Each side is turned by (9/4^circ) compared to its predecessor.      - This leads to a final segment at (40 cdot 9 / 4^circ = 90^circ) relative to the vertical axis.    - The sequence of segments connecting vertices (1, 2, 4, 6, ldots, 50) forms one team's trajectory. 8. **Second Team's Construction:**    - Similarly, you can construct the trajectory for the second team, connecting vertices (1, 3, 5, ldots 51).    - The segments such as ((i, i+2)) and ((i+1, i+3)) for (i=1, 2, ldots, 38) intersect. 9. **Counting Overtakes:**    - The intersections between segments from the two teams represent overtakes.    - Each pair gives an overtake, leading to 38 intersections. 10. **Conclusion:**    - Thus, you can construct a situation where maximum 38 overtakes occur.

The amount of provisions used in 21 days is: Provisions used in 21 days = 2000 men * 21 days So, the remaining provisions after 21 days is: Remaining provisions = P - (2000 men * 21 days) At this point, reinforcements arrive, and we'll call the number of reinforcements R. Now, the total number of men in the garrison is 2000 + R. The remaining provisions are now supposed to last for 20 more days for the new total number of men.

This produces a function ( f(x) ). 3. **Properties of ( f(x) )**:    - The function ( f(x) ) represents the \\"contour\\" of the arrangement of paper.    - ( f(x) ) will be continuous except for a finite number of jump discontinuities.    - There will be an upwards jump discontinuity from ( -infty ) at the start and a downwards jump discontinuity to ( infty ) at the end. 4. **Identifying a Key Interval**:    - There exists a finite interval on which ( f(x) ) is continuous.    - There is an upwards jump discontinuity at the left endpoint and a downwards jump discontinuity at the right endpoint.    - This interval represents some edge(s) that is \\"above\\" everything else. 5. **Analyzing the Laser-Exposed Multi-Edge**:    - Walk along this \\"laser-exposed multi-edge\\" from left to right.    - When reaching an edge that does not lie on this multi-edge, note whether it goes left or right based on the angle it makes with the vertical.    - Vertical edges fall into both categories. 6. **Identifying a Polygon to Slide**:    - The leftmost edge goes right and the rightmost edge goes left.    - There must be two consecutive edges where the first goes right and the second goes left.    - The polygon containing these two edges cannot have points to the left of the first edge or to the right of the second edge. 7. **Sliding the Polygon**:    - The identified polygon can be slid out vertically without any obstructions.    - No point in this polygon has any points directly above it. 8. **Conclusion**:    - By induction, we can repeat this process to slide all pieces of paper off the table in finitely many steps.

Thus, we have: 1. cosleft(frac{7pi}{2} + alpharight) = cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + alpharight) because adding 2pi (a full rotation) does not change the value of the trigonometric function. 2. cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + alpharight) = sin(alpha), by using the co-function identity, which relates the cosine of an angle to the sine of its complement. Therefore, we have sin(alpha) = frac{4}{7}. Given that tan(alpha) < 0, and knowing that the tangent function is the ratio of sine over cosine, we can deduce that cos(alpha) must be negative (since sine is positive and tangent is negative in the given condition). Thus, we calculate cos(alpha) as follows: 3. cos(alpha) = -sqrt{1 - sin^2(alpha)} = -sqrt{1 - left(frac{4}{7}right)^2} = -sqrt{1 - frac{16}{49}} = -sqrt{frac{33}{49}} = -frac{sqrt{33}}{7}.

Substituting the values we have: 6. -cos(alpha) + cos(alpha) cdot tan(alpha) = -left(-frac{sqrt{33}}{7}right) + left(frac{4}{7}right) cdot tan(alpha). Since tan(alpha) = frac{sin(alpha)}{cos(alpha)} = frac{frac{4}{7}}{-frac{sqrt{33}}{7}} = -frac{4}{sqrt{33}}, we substitute this into the equation: 7. -left(-frac{sqrt{33}}{7}right) + left(frac{4}{7}right) cdot left(-frac{4}{sqrt{33}}right) = frac{sqrt{33}}{7} - frac{16}{7sqrt{33}}. To simplify, we find a common denominator and combine the terms: 8. frac{sqrt{33}}{7} - frac{16}{7sqrt{33}} = frac{sqrt{33}^2 - 16}{7sqrt{33}} = frac{33 - 16}{7sqrt{33}} = frac{17}{7sqrt{33}}.

Consider the series (1 + x^4 + x^8 + x^{12} + x^{16}):     [     1 + x^4 + x^8 + x^{12} + x^{16}     ]     Substituting the values calculated:     [     1 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x     ] 5.

The difference in distance covered in 1 hour due to stoppages is 80 km - 40 km = 40 km. Since the bus travels 40 km less in 1 hour due to stoppages, we can calculate the stoppage time by finding out how long it would take to travel those 40 km at the original speed (80 km/hr).

Substituting left(0,0right) into the equation gives 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0, which simplifies to F = 0. 2. Substituting left(4,0right) into the equation gives 16 + 0 + 4D + 0 + F = 0, which simplifies to 16 + 4D + F = 0. 3. Substituting left(-1,1right) into the equation gives 1 + 1 - D + E + F = 0, which simplifies to 2 - D + E + F = 0. From the first equation, we have F = 0. Substituting F = 0 into the second equation gives 16 + 4D = 0, which simplifies to 4D = -16 and further to D = -4. Substituting D = -4 and F = 0 into the third equation gives 2 + 4 + E = 0, which simplifies to E = -6.

The company found through sales records that when the selling price does not exceed 13 yuan, the daily net profit after donation increases with the increase in the selling price x (in yuan per kilogram). Find the range of values for a.","output":"# Solution:  Part 1: Finding the Functional Relationship Given that when the selling price is 10 yuan, 300 kilograms can be sold per day. For every increase of 1 yuan in the selling price, the daily sales volume decreases by 50 kilograms. Let's denote the selling price as x (in yuan per kilogram) and the daily sales volume as y (in kilograms).  When x = 10, y = 300. If the selling price increases by 1 yuan, the sales volume decreases by 50 kilograms, which can be represented as: [y = 300 - 50(x - 10)] Expanding this, we get: [y = 300 - 50x + 500] [y = -50x + 800] Thus, the functional relationship between the daily sales volume y and the selling price x is: [y = -50x + 800]  Part 2: Maximum Profit Calculation Given that the daily sales volume is not less than 250 kilograms, we set up the inequality: [-50x + 800 geq 250] Solving for x, we find: [800 - 250 geq 50x] [550 geq 50x] [x leq 11] The profit w is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price, multiplied by the sales volume, which gives us: [w = (x - 8)(-50x + 800)] Expanding and simplifying: [w = -50x^2 + 1200x - 6400] [w = -50(x^2 - 24x + 128)] [w = -50(x - 12)^2 + 800] Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, the profit function opens downwards, indicating a maximum value at the vertex. The vertex occurs at x = 12, but since the sales volume must be at least 250 kilograms, we consider x leq 11. Therefore, at x = 11, we find the maximum profit: [w = -50(11 - 12)^2 + 800] [w = -50(-1)^2 + 800] [w = -50 + 800] [w = 750] Thus, the maximum profit w that the supermarket can make from selling this fruit per day is boxed{750} yuan when the selling price is 11 yuan per kilogram.

When x > 0, f'(x) > 0, which means that the function f(x) is monotonic increasing on the interval (0, +infty).   Therefore, f(x) > f(0) = 0.   (2) Let's prove by mathematical induction that x_n > frac{1}{2^n}.   i. Base case: For n=1, x_1 = 1 > frac{1}{2}, so x_1 > frac{1}{2^1} is true.   ii. Inductive step: Assume for n=k, we have x_k > frac{1}{2^k}.   For n=k+1, from x_n e^{x_{n+1}} = e^{x_n} - 1, we get e^{x_{k+1}} = frac{e^{x_k} - 1}{x_k}.   Using the inequality e^x - 1 > x for x > 0, and noting that the function g(x) = frac{e^x - 1}{x} is monotonic increasing on (0, +infty),   we have e^{x_{k+1}} = frac{e^{x_k} - 1}{x_k} > frac{e^{frac{1}{2^k}} - 1}{frac{1}{2^k}} > frac{1}{2^{k+1}}.   Thus, x_{k+1} > frac{1}{2^{k+1}}.   From (i) and (ii), for any positive integer n, it holds that x_n > frac{1}{2^n}, which implies x_{n+1} > frac{1}{2^{n+1}}.   Since f(x) is always positive for x > 0 (as proved in (1)), we deduce that (1-x_n)e^{x_n} - 1 < 0, which means e^{x_n} - 1 < x_n e^{x_n}.   Given x_n e^{x_{n+1}} = e^{x_n} - 1, it follows that x_{n+1} < x_n.

Normally, in the binomial theorem, if n is even, the largest binomial coefficient is the middle term; if n is odd, the two middle terms have the largest binomial coefficients.

First, we note that the symmetry of f(x) about the point (0,1) implies that the graph of f(x) - 1 is symmetric about the origin. This is because shifting a function down by 1 unit makes (0,1) effectively the new origin for the purposes of symmetry. Let's define a new function g(x) = f(x) + x - 1.

(Ⅲ) Prove that if a_{1}=2 and d_{n}=1 for n=1,2,3,ldots, then the terms of left{a_{n}right} can only be 1 or 2, and there are infinitely many terms that are equal to 1.","output":"(Ⅰ) For the sequence 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, ldots with a period of 4, we calculate the values of d_{n} for n=1 to 4 as follows: - For n=1, we have A_{1}=2 (the maximum value of the first term) and B_{1}=1 (the minimum value of all terms after the first term). Therefore, d_{1}=A_{1}-B_{1}=2-1=1. - For n=2, A_{2}=2 (the maximum value of the first two terms) and B_{2}=1 (the minimum value of all terms after the second term). Thus, d_{2}=A_{2}-B_{2}=2-1=1. - For n=3, A_{3}=4 (the maximum value of the first three terms) and B_{3}=1 (the minimum value of all terms after the third term). Hence, d_{3}=A_{3}-B_{3}=4-1=3. - For n=4, A_{4}=4 (the maximum value of the first four terms) and B_{4}=1 (the minimum value of all terms after the fourth term). Therefore, d_{4}=A_{4}-B_{4}=4-1=3. Thus, the values of d_{n} for n=1 to 4 are d_{1}=1, d_{2}=1, d_{3}=3, and d_{4}=3.  (Ⅱ) To prove the statement about arithmetic sequences: - **Sufficiency**: Assume left{a_{n}right} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of d. Then, a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)d. This implies A_{n}=a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)d and B_{n}=a_{n+1}=a_{1}+nd. Therefore, d_{n}=A_{n}-B_{n}=(a_{1}+(n-1)d)-(a_{1}+nd)=-d. This shows that if left{a_{n}right} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of d, then d_{n}=-d for all n. - **Necessity**: Assume d_{n}=A_{n}-B_{n}=-d for all n. Suppose there exists a term a_{k} such that a_{k}-a_{k-1} < 0. Then, d_{k}=A_{k}-B_{k}=a_{k-1}-B_{k}geq a_{k-1}-a_{k} > 0, which contradicts d_{n}=-dleq 0. Hence, left{a_{n}right} must be a non-decreasing sequence. Since d_{n}=A_{n}-B_{n}=a_{n}-a_{n+1}=-d, it follows that a_{n+1}-a_{n}=d, proving left{a_{n}right} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of d. (Ⅲ) To prove the statement about the sequence with a_{1}=2 and d_{n}=1: - First, if there exists a term equal to 0, then d_{1}=2-0=2, which contradicts d_{n}=1. Therefore, no term can be 0. - Assume there exists a term a_{m} > 2. Since the sequence must contain 1 (otherwise d_{1}neq 1), for ngeq m, a_{n}geq 2. Let i be the largest index between 2 and m-1 such that a_{i}=1. Then, d_{i}=A_{i}-B_{i}=2-B_{i}leq 2-2=0, contradicting d_{n}=1. Thus, no term can exceed 2. - If there were a last term equal to 1, say a_{k}, then all subsequent terms would be 2, making d_{k}=A_{k}-B_{k}=2-2=0, which contradicts d_{n}=1. Therefore, there must be infinitely many terms equal to 1.

Given an 8-person company where each person knows exactly 6 other people, it implies that each person is unfamiliar with (8 - 1 - 6 = 1) person. This forms the basis for our analysis. 2. We can interpret the company's structure in graph theory terms. Let each person be a vertex in an undirected graph where an edge represents acquaintance (bidirectional). Since each person is acquainted with 6 others, this translates into a graph where each vertex has a degree of 6. 3. Due to the symmetric nature of acquaintance (if A knows B, then B knows A), each person (vertex) not primarily unfamiliar with exactly one other person (vertex). This suggests that the graph can be distinctly partitioned into disjoint pairs, where each pair represents two people who do not know each other. 4. Therefore, we have 8 people split into 4 pairs.

Consequently, for each pair, there are 2 choices (since either of the two individuals in a pair can be chosen). 6. Using the rule of product for independent events, the number of ways to choose one individual from each pair to form a group of four people who all know each other is given by: [ 2^4 = 16 ] # Conclusion: The number of ways to select four people so that any two of them know each other is: [ boxed{16} ]"},{"instruction":"The sphere omega passes through the vertex S of the pyramid SABC and intersects the edges SA, SB, and SC again at points A_{1}, B_{1}, and C_{1} respectively.

Prove that the points A, B, C, A_{2}, B_{2}, and C_{2} lie on the same sphere.","output":"Let's break down the steps to prove that points A, B, C, A_2, B_2, and C_2 lie on the same sphere. 1. **Understand the Problem Setup:**    - We have a pyramid SABC.    - Sphere ω passes through the vertex S of pyramid SABC and intersects the edges SA, SB, and SC at points A_1, B_1, and C_1 respectively.    - Sphere Omega, described around pyramid SABC, intersects sphere ω along a circle lying in a plane parallel to the plane (ABC).    - Points A_2, B_2, and C_2 are symmetric to points A_1, B_1, and C_1 respectively with respect to the midpoints of the edges SA, SB, and SC. 2. **Restate the Key Observation:**    The condition to prove is equivalent to showing:    [    SA_2 cdot SA = SB_2 cdot SB = SC_2 cdot SC.    ]    Given the symmetry relations:    [    AA_1 = SA_2 quad text{and similarly for the other points},    ]    it's sufficient to prove:    [    AA_1 cdot AS = BB_1 cdot BS = CC_1 cdot CS.    ] 3. **Introduce Auxiliary Elements:**    Let ℓ be a line passing through the centers of spheres Omega and ω. This line ℓ is perpendicular to the plane (ABC). Given that sphere ω intersects plane (ABC) in a circle, any rotation about ℓ will leave the circumcircle of triangle ABC invariant. 4. **Fixed Point Method:**    Consider a rotation about ℓ that maps point A to point B. Consequently, points S and A_1 on ω move to points S' and A_1' respectively, which must also lie on ω. 5. **Equality of Products:**    Since A to B, S to S' and A_1 to A_1', we have:    [    AA_1 cdot AS = BA_1' cdot BS' = BB_1 cdot BS.    ]    The argument is analogous for the third product, thus confirming:    [    AA_1 cdot AS = CC_1 cdot CS.    ] 6. **Alternative Symmetry Argument:**    Let's denote the centers of spheres ω and Omega as O_1 and O respectively. The line ℓ (passing through O and O_1) is perpendicular to plane (ABC).    - Denote O_2 as the point symmetric to O_1 with respect to O. Then O_2 lies on ℓ and is equidistant to points A, B, C (all at distance r, say). 7. **Projection Argument:**    - Project points O_2 and O_1 onto edge SA. They are symmetric with respect to O, so the midpoint projection yields midpoint A'. Given symmetry and that O_1 lies midway along SA_1, the projection symmetry implies A_2O_2=AO_2=r.    - Similar logic holds for B_2O_2 and C_2O_2. 8. **Conclusion:**    - Since O_2A = O_2B = O_2C = r and O_2A_2 = O_2B_2 = O_2C_2 = r, points A, B, C, A_2, B_2, and C_2 lie on a sphere centered at O_2 with radius r.
