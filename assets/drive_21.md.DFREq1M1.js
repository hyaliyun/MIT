The charge on this small arc will be: [ Delta q = frac{Delta s}{2 pi R} cdot Q ] where the total circumference of the ring is ( 2 pi R ). 2. **Current due to Rotating Charge:** As the ring rotates with angular velocity ( omega ), the small arc with charge ( Delta q ) contributes to a current.

We need to prove that within 8 seconds, the spider can come within 1 meter of the stationary locust. 1. **Grid Size and Definition**: - The given grid is a square ( text{side length} = 1 ,text{meter} ), divided further into smaller squares. - We split the whole grid into ( 2^8 times 2^8 ) smaller squares since the spider moves in 8 steps and can halve the size of the current square it occupies each second. - The side length of each small square is ( frac{1}{2^8} ). 2. **Initial Position of Locust**: - Assume the locust is at point ( A ) within a small square ( R_0 ). 3. **Spider Movement Consideration**: - Each second, the spider moves to the midpoint of one of the ( 4 ) adjacent edges of the current small square. - Represent this movement transformation in a coordinate system aligned with the center of the grid and continually halved. 4. **Representation of Squares**: - Initially, ( R_0 ) is represented by coordinates in the large square. - By moving along the grid in the described manner, in each second, it transforms into squares of side length ( 2^{-7} ) (next bigger scale, halved). 5. **Iterative Halving**: - Each second, ( R_1 ), ( R_2 ), ( ldots ), ( R_8 ) are representations of successive halved squares. - After 8 seconds, ( R_8 ) will be the entire grid, confirming the spider's movement aligns perfectly within the grid by occupying squares whose edge lengths are halved each second. 6. **Reverse Calculation**: - Starting from the large grid back to ( R_0 ): - After each second, moving along any of the four available paths continues halving the reachable area. - Consequently, within 8 seconds, the spider can move within the initial small square ( R_0 ). 7. **Distance Calculation**: - The maximum distance within ( R_0 ) can be calculated using the diagonal, ( d = sqrt{2} times frac{1}{2^8} ). - ( d = sqrt{2} times 2^{-8} = frac{sqrt{2}}{256} approx 0.0056 , text{meters} ). 8. **Conclusion**: - The maximum distance of ( approx 0.0056 , text{meters} ) placed within ( R_0 ) confirms the spider reaches within ( text{1 centimeter} ) of the locust after 8 seconds.

What is his regular pay per hour?","output":"Let's call the man's regular pay per hour \\"R\\". For the first 40 hours, he earns R dollars per hour. For the overtime hours, he earns twice his regular pay, so that's 2R dollars per hour. He worked 13 hours of overtime, so his total pay for overtime is 13 hours * 2R dollars/hour = 26R dollars. His total pay is the sum of his regular pay for 40 hours and his overtime pay for 13 hours, which is 198. So we have: 40R (regular pay for 40 hours) + 26R (overtime pay for 13 hours) = 198 Combining like terms, we get: 66R = 198 Now, we divide both sides by 66 to solve for R: R = 198 / 66 R = 3 Therefore, the man's regular pay per hour is boxed{3} ."},{"instruction":"The school will select 4 students from 4 boys and 4 girls to serve as the first, second, third, and fourth debaters in a debate competition.

Therefore, overrightarrow{EM} = (x- frac{1}{4})overrightarrow{AB} - frac{overrightarrow{AC}}{4}. Similarly, we can obtain overrightarrow{EN} = (y- frac{1}{4})overrightarrow{AC} - frac{overrightarrow{AB}}{4}. Since overrightarrow{EM} and overrightarrow{EN} are collinear, we have overrightarrow{EM} = lambda overrightarrow{EN}, and lambda < 0. Therefore, (x- frac{1}{4})overrightarrow{AB} - frac{overrightarrow{AC}}{4} = lambda[(y- frac{1}{4})overrightarrow{AC} - frac{overrightarrow{AB}}{4}], which implies x- frac{1}{4} = lambda(- frac{1}{4}), and - frac{1}{4} = lambda(y- frac{1}{4}).

Starting with the line (x + 2y = 3): [ 2y = -x + 3 implies y = -frac{1}{2}x + frac{3}{2} ] Therefore, the slope of this line is (-frac{1}{2}). 4. Next, consider the line (nx + my = 4). We want to write it in the same form: [ my = -nx + 4 implies y = -frac{n}{m}x + frac{4}{m} ] Therefore, the slope of this line is (-frac{n}{m}). 5.

Now, let's find out how many chocolates are left in total after the students ate the ones with nuts: 80 chocolates - 32 chocolates = 48 chocolates left. Since there are 28 chocolates left in total and we just calculated that there are 48 chocolates left after eating the ones with nuts, we can now find out how many of the chocolates without nuts were eaten. 48 chocolates (left after eating the ones with nuts) - 28 chocolates (left in total) = 20 chocolates without nuts eaten. Now, to find the portion of the chocolates without nuts that were eaten, we divide the number of chocolates without nuts eaten by the initial number of chocolates without nuts: 20 chocolates without nuts eaten / 40 chocolates without nuts initially = 0.5 or 50%.

[ P(text{third card spade | first two red}) = frac{13}{50} ] Using the multiplication rule for independent events (since each draw reduces the number of total and specific cards without replacement), the overall probability that the first two cards are red, followed by a spade, is: [ P(text{combo}) = P(text{first red}) times P(text{second red | first red}) times P(text{third spade | first two red}) = frac{1}{2} times frac{25}{51} times frac{13}{50} = frac{25 times 13}{2 times 51 times 50} = frac{325}{5100} = frac{13}{204} ] Thus, the probability is: [boxed{frac{13}{204}}.]"},{"instruction":"Given the hyperbola C: frac{x^2}{a} frac{y^2}{a^2 a + 4} = 1 (a > 0), a line l intersects the right branch of the hyperbola C at points A and B.

D: If a = 1, the tangent line at point A intersects the two asymptotes at points E and F, then the area of triangle EOF is a constant value.","output":"To solve this problem, we analyze each statement given in the problem by breaking down the solution into detailed steps. **For Statement A:** Given the hyperbola C: frac{x^2}{a} - frac{y^2}{a^2 - a + 4} = 1, we first find the eccentricity e of the hyperbola. The eccentricity formula for a hyperbola is derived from its standard form, and in this case, we have: [e^{2} = 1 + frac{a^2 - a + 4}{a} = 1 + a - 1 + frac{4}{a} = a + frac{4}{a}] To find the minimum value of e^2, we apply the AM-GM inequality: [e^{2} = a + frac{4}{a} geq 2sqrt{a cdot frac{4}{a}} = 2sqrt{4} = 4] Equality holds when a = frac{4}{a}, which implies a^2 = 4 and thus a = 2 (since a > 0). Therefore, the minimum value of e is 2, not 4. Hence, statement A is incorrect. **For Statement B:** When a = 2, the hyperbola equation becomes frac{x^2}{2} - frac{y^2}{6} = 1. The equations of the asymptotes for a hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 are y = pm frac{b}{a}x. Substituting a^2 = 2 and b^2 = 6 into this formula, we get the asymptotes as sqrt{3}x pm y = 0. Therefore, statement B is correct. **For Statement C:** Given a line l intersects the hyperbola and its asymptotes, and considering the geometric property that the midpoints of the segments formed by the intersections with the hyperbola and its asymptotes coincide, we conclude that |AC| = |BD|. This property is inherent to the geometry of hyperbolas and their asymptotes, making statement C correct. **For Statement D:** When a = 1, the hyperbola's equation simplifies to x^{2} - frac{y^{2}}{4} = 1, with asymptotes y = pm 2x. The tangent line at any point A(m, n) on the hyperbola is mx - frac{1}{4}ny = 1. Intersecting this tangent line with the asymptotes y = pm 2x gives the points E and F.

Each segment divides a region into two. - Adding one horizontal line increases the number of regions by (s + 1). - Therefore, (h) horizontal lines increase the number of regions by: [ h(s + 1) ] - Including (h) horizontal lines, the total number of regions formed by (h + s) lines is: [ h(s + 1) + 1 + frac{s(s+1)}{2} = 1992 ] 4. **Solve for (s) and (h)**: Combine and simplify the equation: [ h(s+1) + 1 + frac{s(s+1)}{2} = 1992 ] [ 2 h(s+1) + 2 + s(s+1) = 3984 ] [ 2 h(s+1) + s(s+1) + 2 = 3984 ] [ (s+1)(2h + s) = 3982 ] - Factorize (3982) as: [ 3982 = 2 times 11 times 181 ] - Possible factor pairs for ((s + 1)(2h + s)): [ (1, 3982), (2, 1991), (11, 362), (22, 181) ] Corresponding solutions for ((h, s)): - (s+1 = 2), (2h+s = 1991 Rightarrow s = 1, 2h + 1 = 1991 Rightarrow 2h = 1990 Rightarrow h = 995) [ (h, s) = (995, 1) ] - (s+1 = 11), (2h+s = 362 Rightarrow s = 10, 2h + 10 = 362 Rightarrow 2h = 352 Rightarrow h = 176) [ (h, s) = (176, 10) ] - (s+1 = 22), (2h+s = 181 Rightarrow s = 21, 2h + 21 = 181 Rightarrow 2h = 160 Rightarrow h = 80) [ (h, s) = (80, 21) ] Conclusion: The integer solutions ((h, s)) are [ boxed{(995, 1), (176, 10), (80, 21)} ]"},{"instruction":"For the function f(x), the solution to the equation f(x) = x is called the fixed point of f(x), and the solution to the equation f(f(x)) = x is called the stable point of f(x). ① Let the set of fixed points of the function f(x) be M, and the set of stable points be N, then M subseteq N; ② The function f(x) can have infinitely many stable points; ③ When f(x) is monotonically increasing in its domain, if x_0 is a stable point of f(x), then x_0 is a fixed point of f(x); Among the above three propositions, the serial numbers of all true propositions are __________.","output":"Solution: ① If M = emptyset, then M subseteq N obviously holds; If M neq emptyset, let t in M, then f(t) = t, f(f(t)) = f(t) = t, therefore t in N, Hence M subseteq N, so ① is correct; ② Take f(x) = x, then the equation f(x) = x has infinitely many solutions, i.e., there are infinitely many fixed points, Since fixed points are definitely stable points, the function f(x) can have infinitely many stable points, hence ② is correct; ③ Suppose x_0 is a stable point of f(x), then f(f(x_0)) = x_0, assume f(x_0) > x_0, f(x) is an increasing function on mathbb{R}, then f(f(x_0)) > f(x_0), therefore x_0 > f(x_0), which is a contradiction; If x_0 > f(x_0), f(x) is an increasing function on mathbb{R}, then f(x_0) > f(f(x_0)), therefore f(x_0) > x_0 which is a contradiction.

We need to understand what this implies about the relationship between (z_k) and (z_{k+1}). 2. **Simplifying the condition:** Notice that (i^k) and (i^{k+1}) are just powers of (i), which cycle through (i, -1, -i, 1). Therefore, the condition can be rewritten as: [ |z_k i^k + z_{k+1} i^{k+1}| = |z_{k+1} i^k + z_k i^{k+1}| ] This implies that the magnitudes of the complex numbers formed by these linear combinations are equal. 3. **Interpreting the condition:** The condition implies that the ratio of the imaginary part to the real part of (z_k) is constant for all (k).

Therefore, option A is incorrect. B: The temperature is an indicator of the average kinetic energy of the molecular thermal motion. When the temperature rises, the average kinetic energy of molecules increases. According to the ideal gas law frac {PV}{T} = C, where (P) is pressure, (V) is volume, and (T) is temperature, a rise in temperature may lead to a decrease in gas pressure. Therefore, option B is correct. C: Brownian motion is the irregular motion of small solid particles suspended in a liquid, and is a reflection of the irregular thermal motion of liquid molecules. The higher the temperature, the more intense the Brownian motion becomes. This means that option C is incorrect, because it incorrectly states that Brownian motion refers to the movement of the liquid molecules themselves rather than the suspended particles. D: The difference in temperature between shallow and deep seawater can be exploited to create a heat engine that converts part of the seawater's internal energy into mechanical energy. This is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics, and thus, is feasible in principle. Therefore, option D is correct. In conclusion, we must be aware of the following principles: 1. The second law of thermodynamics states that it is impossible to transfer heat from a colder body to a hotter body without other effects and it is impossible to convert heat from a single heat source entirely into useful work without other effects. 2. The temperature is an indicator of the average kinetic energy of molecular motion. 3. Brownian motion is the irregular motion of small solid particles suspended in a liquid, which reflects the irregular thermal motion of liquid molecules.

First, we analyze the number of each type of name: - Alexanders: 45 - Borises: 122 - Vasilies: 27 - Gennadies: Unknown (denoted as x) Given that no two individuals with the same name can stand next to each other, we need to ensure that each spot between Borises is occupied by at least one person with a different name. Step-by-step breakdown: 1. **Handling Borises:** - We have 122 Borises. - To separate each pair of Borises, we need at least 121 other people (since there are 121 gaps between 122 Borises). 2. **Calculating the minimum number of non-Boris individuals:** - We are given that there are 45 Alexanders and 27 Vasilies. - Together, they provide 45 + 27 = 72 individuals. 3. **Filling the remaining gaps:** - We need 121 - 72 = 49 more individuals to ensure all Borises are separated appropriately. Therefore, the minimum number of Gennadies required is given by: [ 121 - (45 + 27) = 49 ] We can verify this solution: If there are exactly 49 Gennadies, we can sequence the participants as follows: - First, distribute 45 Alexanders and 27 Vasilies in the gaps between 122 Borises. - Then, fill the remaining gaps with 49 Gennadies.

To find its period, we note that both component functions ( sin(ax) ) and ( cos(ax) ) have a period of ( frac{2pi}{a} ).

First, calculate the number of segments in the 2 millipedes that are twice as long as the first one. Since the first millipede has 60 segments, the ones that are twice as long have 60 times 2 = 120 segments each. 2. Next, we find the total number of segments from these 2 millipedes by multiplying the number of segments per millipede by the number of millipedes, which gives us 120 times 2 = 240 segments. 3. We then add the segments from the first millipede to the total from the step above to find the total number of segments the scorpion has eaten so far: 60 + 240 = 300 segments. 4. To find out how many segments the scorpion still needs to eat to reach its daily total, we subtract the number of segments it has already eaten from the total number of segments it needs to eat in a day: 800 - 300 = 500 segments. 5.

It is given that all vertices except possibly C_i are known to lie on a given sphere. 2. **Consider an Inversion:** Perform an inversion with respect to a sphere centered at one of the vertices, say A. This transformation simplifies the problem because it converts the sphere passing through these seven known vertices into a plane. This is because in inversion, a sphere passing through the center of inversion is transformed into a plane. 3. **Effect on Faces:** Under this inversion, the circumcircles of the quadrilateral faces A B C D, A B B_1 A_i, and A A_1 D_1 D become straight lines. Thus, these faces transform into planes in the inverted space. 4. **Intersection Point:** The point C_i transforms to C_i^* in the inverted space. Since C_i is the intersection point of the planes A_1 B_1 D_1, C D_1 D, and B B_1 C, the image under inversion, C_i^*, must be the intersection point of the images of these planes in the inverted configuration. 5. **Common Point:** Therefore, to prove that C_i lies on the original sphere, it is sufficient to show that the circumcircles of the transformed triangles A_1^* B_1^* D_1^*, C^* D_1^* D^*, and B^* B_1^* C^* intersect at a common point different from the inversion center A. Specifically, if we prove that the inverted points form triangles whose circumcircles intersect at a common point, it implies that their pre-images (the original points) lie on the same sphere. Thus, using geometric transformations and properties of inversion, we can conclude that the verification of a common intersection point in the inverted scenario ensures that all points, including C_i, lie on the initial sphere. Therefore, the eighth vertex C_i also lies on the given sphere. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The least common multiple of two numbers is 4620, and the greatest common divisor is 21.

Let's analyze the given information and the reference solution. We start by examining the equation ( x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0 ). 2. We aim to divide the equation by ( x^2 ) to simplify it.

The important point here is to consider whether ( x = 0 ) could be a solution to the original equation ( x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0 ). If ( x = 0 ) were a solution, substituting ( x = 0 ) into the original equation should satisfy it: [ 0^4 + 0^3 + 0^2 + 0 + 1 = 1 neq 0 ] Thus, ( x = 0 ) is not a solution to the equation ( x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0 ). 4. Since ( x = 0 ) is not a root of the original equation, we can safely divide through by ( x^2 ) without losing any valid solutions.

The characteristic polynomial associated with this recurrence relation is: [ p(xi) = xi^2 - 4xi + 1 ] 2. **Solve the characteristic polynomial:** To find the roots of the characteristic polynomial, we solve: [ xi^2 - 4xi + 1 = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula (xi = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}), where (a = 1), (b = -4), and (c = 1), we get: [ xi = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{12}}{2} = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{3} ] Thus, the roots are (zeta_1 = 2 + sqrt{3}) and (zeta_2 = 2 - sqrt{3}). 3. **Form the general solution:** The general solution to the recurrence relation is: [ a_n = lambda_1 (2 + sqrt{3})^n + lambda_2 (2 - sqrt{3})^n ] 4. **Determine the constants (lambda_1) and (lambda_2):** Using the initial conditions (a_0 = 1) and (a_1 = 2): [ a_0 = lambda_1 + lambda_2 = 1 ] [ a_1 = lambda_1 (2 + sqrt{3}) + lambda_2 (2 - sqrt{3}) = 2 ] Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: [ lambda_1 + lambda_2 = 1 ] [ lambda_1 (2 + sqrt{3}) + lambda_2 (2 - sqrt{3}) = 2 ] Let (lambda_1 = x) and (lambda_2 = 1 - x).

Define the point (S') as the intersection of the circumcircle (Gamma) with the internal angle bisector of (widehat{BAC}). 2. **Theorem of the Inscribed Angle (or Inscribed Angle Theorem)**: By the inscribed angle theorem, we know that the angle subtended by a chord at the circumference is half the angle subtended by the same chord at the center. This also implies that angles subtended by the same chord, but on the same side of the chord, are equal. Therefore, for (S'): [ widehat{S'BC} = widehat{S'AC} quad text{and} quad widehat{S'CB} = widehat{S'AB} ] 3. Since (S') lies on the angle bisector of (widehat{BAC}): [ widehat{S'AC} = widehat{S'AB} ] 4. Thus, combining the above with the inscribed angles from steps 2 and 3: [ widehat{S'BC} = widehat{S'CB} ] 5. Therefore, since (widehat{S'BC}) is equal to (widehat{S'CB}), triangle (S'BC) is isosceles with (S') being equidistant from (B) and (C). 6. As a result, (S') must lie on the perpendicular bisector of segment ([BC]). 7. The perpendicular bisector of (BC) intersecting the circumcircle (Gamma) at point (S') confirms that (S') is the same as the point (S), the intersection of the angle bisector and the perpendicular bisector. 8.

Step-by-Step Analysis: # 1. Checking divisibility conditions: By examining the equation, we note that if ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) are non-negative integers, then the sum ( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 ) must be divisible by 2. This implies that among the numbers ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) one of the following cases must be true: a) One number is even and two numbers are odd. b) All three numbers are even. # Case 1: One number is even and two are odd. Let's assume ( x ) is even while ( y ) and ( z ) are odd. We can express these variables as: [ x = 2k, quad y = 2m+1, quad z = 2n+1 ] for some integers ( k, m, ) and ( n ).

Recursive Even Divisibility: The last equation indicates that ( x_1^2 + y_1^2 + z_1^2 ) must also be such that if nonzero, one is even and two are odd, or three are even. We continue this recursive process, demonstrating that ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) must be divisible by higher powers of two until: [ x = 2^n x_n, quad y = 2^n y_n, quad z = 2^n z_n ] continue recursively showing that these variables need to be zero.

Find the ratio of the bases of the trapezoid.","output":"To solve the problem of finding the ratio of the bases of an isosceles trapezoid, we need to use the information given and apply geometric properties. 1. **Notation and Setup**: Let's denote the lengths of the bases by (a) and (b) with (a > b). Also, let the height of the trapezoid, which is dropped from one of the vertices on the smaller base to the larger base, be denoted by (h). According to the problem, this height divides the larger base (a) into segments in a (1:3) ratio. 2. **Dividing the Larger Base**: Since the height divides the larger base (a) in a (1:3) ratio, we can write the segments as: [ frac{x}{a-x} = frac{1}{3} ] Solving for (x): [ 3x = a - x implies 4x = a implies x = frac{a}{4} ] Thus, the segments are (x = frac{a}{4}) and (a - x = frac{3a}{4}). 3. **Construction of Height and Right Triangles**: The height (h) drops perpendicularly to the base and creates two right triangles. These right triangles allow us to use the Pythagorean theorem. 4. **Base Projection Relationships**: The projection of the height onto the larger base creates a subtraction that relates the bases. Let the legs of the trapezoid be (L). Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by height and the segments of the bases, we have: [ L^2 - h^2 = left(frac{3a}{4}right)^2 quad text{and} quad L^2 - h^2 = left(frac{a}{4}right)^2 ] 5. **Summing the Segments of the Bases**: Let’s denote the projection lengths as: [ frac{a pm b}{2} ] The given problem implies the height subtracts to form: [ frac{a - b}{2} quad text{and adds as} quad frac{a + b}{2} ] 6. **Final Calculation for the Ratio**: We derive the ratio between the bases by equating the derived terms from the problem's condition: [ frac{a - b}{a + b} = k quad (text{given some proportional term (k)}) ] Since the geometric proportional conditions coincide with (1:3) ratio, apply: [ a + b = 4k quad text{and} quad a - b = 2k a - b = 2 times frac{a + b}{2} = 2(a - b) ] 7. **Solving for (a) and (b) Ratio**: Using above self-defining linear system: [ a = 3b ] 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the ratio of the bases (a) and (b) of the trapezoid is: [ frac{a}{b} = 3 ] (boxed{3})"},{"instruction":"Simplify ( cos 72^circ cos 144^circ ).","output":"Let ( c = cos 72^circ ) and ( d = cos 144^circ ).

The fourth line cannot intersect only the sides of the triangle (ABC); rather, it must intersect at least one extension of the sides of (ABC). Suppose, for instance, that it intersects the extension of side (AB) at a point (M) beyond the vertex (B). 4. Consequently, points (A) and (M) lie on different sides of line (BC).

(The diameter is the maximum distance between points in the set.)","output":"Solution: We want to prove that from any finite set of points on a plane, it is possible to remove one point such that the remaining set can be partitioned into two subsets with smaller diameters. 1. **Define the Problem:** - Let M be the finite set of points in the plane. - Let A and B be two points in M such that the distance between them is the diameter d of M , i.e., d = max_{P, Q in M} text{dist}(P, Q) = text{dist}(A, B) . 2. **Characteristic of the Diameter:** - Consider the circles with radius d centered at A and B . The points of M must either lie inside or on the boundary of these circles, because these circles overlap creating a lens-shaped region. 3. **Lens-shaped Region Analysis:** - Let P in M. - The points must lie within the intersection region of these two circles (the lens). 4. **Select Arcs:** - Choose arcs overset{frown}{AKS} and overset{frown}{BLD} as the boundaries of the lens-shaped region created by the circles. 5. **Insure Points in Arcs:** - Using the properties of arcs, if a point K lies on the arc but not at A or B, we must show that text{dist}(K, L) > d, ensuring no points other than A and B are diametric. 6. **Apply the Law of Cosines:** - For the points on the arcs, - Let angle BAK = alpha and angle LAK = beta, - It follows that beta > alpha. 7. **Calculation Using Law of Cosines:** - Distance between two arbitrary points K and L: [ KL^2 = AK^2 + d^2 - 2,AK,d,cos(beta) > d^2 ] - This result is because AK = 2d cos(alpha) > 2d cos(beta) when beta > alpha. 8. **Point Removal and Division:** - Assume there are no points on overset{frown}{AC} except A. Removing A would permit us to divide the remaining points into two groups via the line AB. 9. **Final Division Claim:** - By removing the point A and drawing the line AB, the remaining points can be divided into subsets, ensuring: - Each point must be closer to A or B, - The diameters of the divided sets will be less than d. This completes the proof, as removing the point A allows us to partition the set into two subsets with diameters strictly less than d . blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A sequence (a_1,b_1), (a_2,b_2), (a_3,b_3), ldots of points in the coordinate plane satisfies [(a_{n + 1}, b_{n + 1}) = (2a_n sqrt{3}b_n, 2b_n + sqrt{3}a_n)]for n = 1,2,3,ldots.

Without loss of generality, assume that they lie on mathcal{K}_2. 4. **Formation of a Convex Sub-figure**: The segment A B, together with the arc mathcal{K}_2, forms a convex curve mathcal{K}^*. This curve mathcal{K}^* is the boundary of one of the two convex figures into which the plane is divided by the line containing A B. 5. **Convexity by Supporting Line**: The line containing the segment A B acts as a supporting line for the convex curve mathcal{K}^*. Therefore, all vertices C, ldots, P lie on one side of the line A B. 6. **Generalization to All Sides**: Since the above argument holds for any side of the polygon, it follows that every side of the polygon A B C ldots P acts as a supporting line.

We start by expressing ( n^2 + 8n + 15 ) in terms of ((n+4)^2). First, let's expand ( (n+4)^2 ): [ (n + 4)^2 = n^2 + 8n + 16 ] 2. **Subtract 1 to balance the equation**: Notice that ( (n + 4)^2 ) produces ( n^2 + 8n + 16 ).

Therefore, the original expression ( n^2 + 8n + 15 ) is not divisible by ( n + 4 ) for any positive integer ( n ).

The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is f'(x) = 2x. Since x leq 0, we have f'(x) = 2x leq 0. This indicates that f(x) = x^2 is monotonically decreasing for x leq 0. **Case 2: When x > 0** For a=0, the function becomes f(x) = x + frac{1}{x} for x > 0.

Let's break down the problem and solution step by step. 1. **Definition and Initial Setup:** A positive integer ( n ) is called *good* if for all positive integers ( a ) which can be written as ( a = n^2 sum_{i=1}^n {x_i}^2 ) where ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) are integers, it is possible to express ( a ) as ( a = sum_{i=1}^n {y_i}^2 ) where ( y_1, y_2, ldots, y_n ) are integers with none of them divisible by ( n ). 2. **Case Analysis for ( n ):** We need to check the conditions for different values of ( n ). 3. **Case ( n = 1 ):** - For ( n = 1 ), ( a = 1^2 sum_{i=1}^1 {x_i}^2 = x_1^2 ). - Any ( a ) can be written as ( y_1^2 ) where ( y_1 = x_1 ), and since ( y_1 ) must not be divisible by 1, this condition is trivially satisfied. - Therefore, ( n = 1 ) is a good number. 4. **Case ( n = 2 ):** - For ( n = 2 ), ( a = 2^2 sum_{i=1}^2 {x_i}^2 = 4(x_1^2 + x_2^2) ). - We need to express ( a ) as ( y_1^2 + y_2^2 ) where ( y_1 ) and ( y_2 ) are not divisible by 2. - Consider ( a = 4 ). We have ( 4 = 2^2 + 0^2 ), but 0 is divisible by 2, so this does not satisfy the condition. - Therefore, ( n = 2 ) is not a good number. 5. **Case ( n = 4 ):** - For ( n = 4 ), ( a = 4^2 sum_{i=1}^4 {x_i}^2 = 16(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2) ). - We need to express ( a ) as ( y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 + y_4^2 ) where ( y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4 ) are not divisible by 4. - Consider ( a = 64 ). We have ( 64 = 8^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 ), but 0 is divisible by 4, so this does not satisfy the condition. - Therefore, ( n = 4 ) is not a good number. 6. **General Case for ( n geq 3 ) and ( n neq 4 ):** - For ( n geq 3 ) and ( n neq 4 ), we need to show that any ( a ) can be written as ( a = sum_{i=1}^n {y_i}^2 ) where none of the ( y_i ) are divisible by ( n ). - If ( n ) does not divide ( 2X ), then ( y_i = 2X - nx_i ) holds the condition. - If ( n ) divides ( 2X ): - If at least one ( x_i ) is not divisible by ( n ), we can adjust ( X ) to ensure ( y_i ) are not divisible by ( n ). - If all ( x_i ) are divisible by ( n ), we can find ( w_i ) such that ( a = sum_{i=1}^n n^{2k} w_i^2 ) and at least one ( w_i ) is not divisible by ( n ). By applying this iteratively, we can find ( y_i ) not divisible by ( n ). 7. **Conclusion:** - From the analysis, we see that ( n = 1 ) is a good number. - ( n = 2 ) and ( n = 4 ) are not good numbers. - For ( n geq 3 ) and ( n neq 4 ), the conditions can be satisfied.

Since an angle of zero degrees in a quadrilateral is not geometrically feasible, we need to reassess our situation based on the given conditions. 6. **Step 6: Symmetric Angles in Triangle** From the given conditions: - If ( alpha + beta = beta + gamma ), then ( alpha = gamma ). - If ( beta + gamma = gamma + alpha ), then ( beta = alpha ). - If ( alpha + gamma = alpha + beta ), hence ( gamma = beta ).

The angles ( angle APD = angle APB = angle PBC = angle PDC = 90^circ ), we aim to find the height of the prism. 2. Recognize that ( ABCD ) is a rectangle (with ( AB = AD ) and ( BC = CD )) as illustrated in Figure 53(a). Thus, ( AC ) is the diagonal of this rectangle. 3. Since the angles ( angle PAB = angle PAD = 45^circ ), the plane ( PAC ) is a symmetry plane of the triangular prism ( P-ABCD ). 4. In this plane ( PAC ), draw ( PH perp AC ), where ( H ) is the foot of the perpendicular from ( P ) to ( AC ). Therefore, ( PH ) represents the height of the triangular prism. 5. Let the intersection of the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) be ( O ). Note that ( BD ) is perpendicular to the symmetry plane ( PAC ). Therefore, [ angle BOC = angle BOP = 90^circ ] 6.

After the elder brother took 10 rubles one more time, the younger brother was left with less than 10 rubles. To ensure an equal division, the elder brother gave the younger brother his knife. How many rubles was the knife valued at?","output":"1. **Problem Understanding**: We need to determine the value of the knife based on the given conditions. Given that the brothers sold a herd of sheep, received an amount of money for each sheep matching the number of sheep in rubles, and split the total money by each taking 10 rubles in turn until the younger brother had less than 10 rubles left. 2. **Definition and Calculation**: Let ( n ) be the number of sheep. Therefore, the total money received is ( n times n = n^2 ) rubles. 3. **Condition Analysis**: The elder brother takes the last full 10 rubles, leaving the younger brother with less than 10 rubles. This means that there are an odd number of tens in ( n^2 ). 4. **Mathematical Formulation**: We write ( n ) in the form ( 10k + m ), where ( k ) is the number of tens, and ( m ) is the units digit. Then, [ n^2 = (10k + m)^2 = 100k^2 + 20km + m^2 ] We need ( 100k^2 + 20km + m^2 ) to have an odd number of tens. 5. **Simplification of the Problem**: The oddness of the tens place in ( n^2 ) is solely determined by the tens digit of ( m^2 ) because ( 100k^2 ) and ( 20km ) are always multiples of 10 and thus do not affect the last two digits significantly. 6. **Investigation of Units Digits of ( m )**: We examine the possible units digits ( m ) for ( n in {0, 1, 2, ldots, 9} ): - ( 0^2 = 0 ) - ( 1^2 = 1 ) - ( 2^2 = 4 ) - ( 3^2 = 9 ) - ( 4^2 = 16 ) - ( 5^2 = 25 ) - ( 6^2 = 36 ) - ( 7^2 = 49 ) - ( 8^2 = 64 ) - ( 9^2 = 81 ) Of these values, we need those where the number of tens is odd. Specifically, ( 4^2 = 16 ) and ( 6^2 = 36 ) both result in an odd number of tens (1 and 3, respectively). 7. **Conclusion Based on the Tens Places**: Since ( n = 4 ) or ( n = 6 ) satisfies the condition, the total amount is ( 4^2 = 16 ) or ( 6^2 = 36 ). In either case, when the elder brother takes the last 10 rubles, the younger one is left with 6 rubles. 8. **Equal Division After Correction**: To ensure equal division, the elder brother compensates the younger brother by giving him part of the last 10 rubles he took. Since the younger brother needs 2 more rubles to equalize the difference of 4 rubles (from 6 rubles difference), the knife must be worth these 2 rubles. # Conclusion: [ boxed{2} ]"},{"instruction":"A pipe can empty 2/3 of a cistern in a certain amount of time.

Let's correct the setup according to the provided solution: Given x = 3y and knowing that x + y = 312000, we correctly interpret the relationship as x = frac{9}{10} cdot 312000 for the total cost being divided into parts of 3:1 ratio for albums to cups. Thus, solving for y directly from the ratio: [x = 3y Rightarrow x + y = 4y = 312000 Rightarrow y = frac{312000}{4} = 78000] [x = 312000 - y = 312000 - 78000 = 234000] But again, this does not align with the provided solution.

Therefore: [ s = a + d, quad t = s + d = a + 2d, quad b = a + 3d. ] Solving for (d): [ b = a + 3d implies d = frac{b - a}{3}. ] Hence, [ s = a + frac{b - a}{3} = frac{2a + b}{3}, quad t = a + 2left(frac{b - a}{3}right) = frac{a + 2b}{3}. ] 2. **Geometric Sequence Analysis:** For a geometric sequence with common ratio ( q ), the terms are: [ u = aq, quad v = aq^2, quad b = aq^3. ] Since ( b = aq^3 ), we have: [ q^3 = frac{b}{a}. ] Hence, [ q = sqrt[3]{frac{b}{a}}. ] 3. **Comparison of Sums of Products:** Calculate ( s + t ) and ( u + v ): [ s + t = frac{2a + b}{3} + frac{a + 2b}{3} = frac{3a + 3b}{3} = a + b, ] [ u + v = aq + aq^2 = a(q + q^2). ] 4. **Determine ( st ) and ( uv ):** [ st = left(frac{2a + b}{3}right)left(frac{a + 2b}{3}right), ] Calculating explicitly: [ st = frac{(2a+b)(a+2b)}{9} = frac{2a^2 + 4ab + ab + 2b^2}{9} = frac{2a^2 + 5ab + 2b^2}{9}. ] [ uv = (aq)(aq^2) = a^2 q^3 = a^2 left(frac{b}{a}right) = ab. ] 5. **Comparison of ( x ) and ( y ):** Calculate ( x ) and ( y ): [ x = st(s+t) = frac{2a^2 + 5ab + 2b^2}{9} (a + b), ] [ y = uv(u+v) = ab(a(q + q^2)). ] Since ( q = sqrt[3]{frac{b}{a}} ), it follows that: [ y = ab(a (sqrt[3]{frac{b}{a}} + sqrt[3]{frac{b}{a}}^2)). ] 6. **Simplification:** [ y = ab(a(sqrt[3]{frac{b}{a}} + frac{b}{a})) = ab(afrac{sqrt[3]{b^2}}{a} + b) = ab(sqrt[3]{b^2} + b). ] Comparing algebraic expressions, we see that: [ s + t = a + b quad text{and} quad u + v = a sqrt[3]{frac{b}{a}} + a sqrt[3]{frac{b}{a}}^2 neq a + b, ] demonstrating that (s + t > u + v).

The caterer needs 1200 asparagus spears in total. To find out the total number of plates (and thus the total number of guests including the extra plates), we divide the total number of asparagus spears by the number of spears per plate: 1200 spears / 8 spears per plate = 150 plates Now we know there are 150 plates in total, including the extra plates. To find the total number of guests without the extra plates, we subtract the 10 extra plates: 150 plates - 10 extra plates = 140 guests We already know Bridgette is inviting 84 guests, so we can find the number of guests Alex is inviting by subtracting Bridgette's guests from the total number of guests: 140 guests - 84 guests = 56 guests (Alex's guests) Now we have the number of guests Alex is inviting (56) and the number of guests Bridgette is inviting (84). To find the ratio of Alex's guests to Bridgette's guests, we divide the number of Alex's guests by the number of Bridgette's guests: Ratio (Alex's guests : Bridgette's guests) = 56 : 84 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 28: 56 / 28 = 2 84 / 28 = 3 So the simplified ratio of the number of guests Alex is inviting to the number of guests Bridgette is inviting is boxed{2:3} ."},{"instruction":"A line passing through the focus of the parabola y^2 = 4x intersects the parabola at points A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2).

There are 10,000 square meters in a hectare, so: [ A = 17.56 text{ hectares} times 10,000 text{ m}^2/text{hectare} = 175,600 text{ m}^2 ] Now we can find the radius ( r ) by rearranging the area formula: [ r = sqrt{frac{A}{pi}} ] [ r = sqrt{frac{175,600}{pi}} ] [ r approx sqrt{frac{175,600}{3.14159}} ] [ r approx sqrt{55,896.118} ] [ r approx 236.43 text{ meters} ] Now we can find the circumference ( C ) of the field: [ C = 2pi r ] [ C approx 2 times 3.14159 times 236.43 ] [ C approx 6.28318 times 236.43 ] [ C approx 1485.73 text{ meters} ] The total cost of fencing is Rs. 7427.41. To find the rate of fencing per meter, we divide the total cost by the total length of the fence (circumference): [ text{Rate per meter} = frac{text{Total cost}}{text{Circumference}} ] [ text{Rate per meter} = frac{7427.41}{1485.73} ] [ text{Rate per meter} approx 5 ] Therefore, the rate of fencing per meter is approximately Rs. boxed{5} ."},{"instruction":"A new proposal suggests that we make years ending in double zeros leap years only if the year, when divided by 700, leaves a remainder of 200 or 500.

Continuing this addition until we exceed 4500, we have: 2300+700=3000, 3000+700=3700, 3700+700=4400. Now we add 500 to 1400 and get 1900, which has a remainder of 500 when divided by 700.

Here's a structured approach to solve the problem: 1. **Understanding the constraints**: - The figures on each captive's forehead can repeat. - Figures will not be repeated on the same number of people. - Each captive sees the figures on everyone else's forehead but not their own. - Each prisoner must draw the figure that was on their forehead individually. - If at least one person guesses correctly, everyone is freed. 2. **Identify the Main Figure**: Since figures are not repeated on the same number of people, there must be a figure (let's call it the \\"main figure\\") that appears the most on the captives' foreheads. - Assume the primary figures are a square and a circle. - Let's denote the main figure by the symbol ( A ). 3. **Formulating the Strategy**: - Each captive will undertake a systematic approach by counting the occurrences of figures they can see. - If squares and circles are the primary candidates and each captive sees different counts, they can identify the most frequent figure as the main one. - We must consider cases when there's ambiguity if they see equal numbers (which cannot happen by constraint). 4. **Details of the Solution**: - Captives should agree on identifying the main figure as the one that appears most frequently among the figures they can see. - If every captive sees that squares are the majority, they deduce that even if they cannot be sure which figure they have, drawing the square gives a higher probability of being correct. - In such cases, even with ties, they can opt for the systematic approach of selecting a preferred candidate based on a pre-agreed rule (e.g., always choosing the figure they saw first in clockwise order). 5. **Ensuring Correctness**: - If figures are uneven (e.g., more squares than circles and others), the one with the most squares should just guess their own as a square. - Similarly, in any edge cases, where two figures have comparable counts potentially differing by one, identify based on the higher count provided it follows the rule of differing representation # Conclusion: By agreeing beforehand on such a logic or algorithm, at least one captive will always be able to correctly identify the figure on their forehead, ensuring that everyone gets freed.

Consider the requirement for lengths ( a_{3}, a_{4}, a_{5} ): - By the obtuse condition for a triangle: [ a_3^2 + a_4^2 < a_5^2 ] Implies: [ a_5^2 > a_4^2 + a_3^2 geq 2a_3^2 > 2a_2^2 + 2a_1^2 ] - By the triangle inequality: [ a_5 < a_1 + a_2 ] Squaring both sides: [ a_5^2 < (a_1 + a_2)^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + 2a_1a_2 ] - Comparing these inequalities: [ 2a_1^2 + 2a_2^2 < a_1^2 + a_2^2 + 2a_1a_2 ] Simplifying: [ a_1^2 + a_2^2 < 2a_1a_2 ] This inequality leads to a contradiction since (a_1^2 + a_2^2 < 2a_1a_2) cannot hold for all positive (a_1, a_2). 4. **Constructing an example for ( n = 4 ):** We need to provide an example where we can obtain obtuse triangles from 4 stick lengths: - Consider: [ a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 text{ slightly greater than } sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{2}, quad a_4 text{ slightly greater than } sqrt{1^2 + a_3^2} ] One possible set of lengths could be: [ a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 1.5, a_4 = 1.9 ] For these lengths: - ( a_3 approx 1.5 ), which is slightly greater than (sqrt{2} approx 1.414). - ( a_4 approx 1.9 ), which is chosen to ensure it is greater than (sqrt{1 + 1.5^2} approx sqrt{3.25} approx 1.8).

Bill, Fred, and Mark each eat 3 slices, so together they eat 3 * 3 = 9 slices. Now let's add up all the slices consumed: George + Bob + Susie + Bill + Fred + Mark = 3 + 4 + 2 + 9 = 18 slices.

Now let's find out how many slices came from small pizzas: 28 total slices - 16 slices from large pizzas = 12 slices from small pizzas.

Possible values for digits leading the multiple ( 7x ), ending in 1, are ( x = 3 ) or ( x = 13 ), giving 21 or 91. 3. **1 DOWN Analysis:** - The clue involves a multiple of squares of odd primes. The relevant primes and their squares are: - (3^2 = 9) - (5^2 = 25) - (7^2 = 49) - To avoid squares or cubes, out of multiples of these squares and observing neither to be squares themselves, the candidates are: 90, 98, and 99. - Since 3 ACROSS cannot start with \\"0”, eliminate 90, leaving only 98 and 99. With 91 being viable (for 1 ACROSS), **1 DOWN** becomes: - To harmonize with 91, taking 99 satisfies the requirements. 4. **Finding 5 ACROSS:** - Must be greater than 10. Examining potential factors of 1 DOWN: - Factors of 99: (3, 9, 11, 33) - 5 ACROSS possibly starting from 2 proper factors like '2', '5', or '8' due to double-digit square properties: - 21-29 Analysis: - Not viable due to factors not being proper two-digit and share units. - 51-59 Analysis: - Similarly not viable by previous factor logic. - 81-89 Analysis to ensure yielding valid double-digit factor: - Only 84 valid (having factor 14 satisfying clue).

When all four pipes are opened simultaneously, their combined rate (( R_{total} )) is the sum of their individual rates: [ R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + R_4 ] Substituting the rates: [ R_{total} = 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{4} ] 3. To add these fractions, we first need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 12.

This implies that ( G(Z) = 0 ). 7. **Conclusion:** Thus, ( G(Z) = 0 ) for all non-primitive roots of degree ( A_N ). The number of such roots is ( A_N - varphi(A_N) ).

According to the problem, one character exits the house and claims, \\"I have a card of purple suit.\\" 3. We need to determine whether the statement is a lie or the truth and which character made the statement. 4. Consider the two possible card suits: orange and purple. 5. If the speaking character were T1 and he had an orange suit card, his truthful statement would be, \\"I have a card of orange suit.\\" Since the statement made was about a purple suit card, this implies that if T1 spoke, he either lied or had a purple card and told the truth. Therefore, if T1: - had an orange card: T1 lied. - had a purple card: T1 told the truth. 6. If the speaking character were T2 and he had a purple suit card, he would state the truth since his exact words, \\"I have a card of purple suit,\\" match his card's suit. Hence, he could be telling the truth with a purple card. 7. The implications for the characters can be summarized as: - If T1 speaks: - With an orange card: T1 lies. - With a purple card: T1 tells the truth. - If T2 speaks: - With an orange card: T2 lies. - With a purple card: T2 tells the truth. 8. Given only the information that the statement \\"I have a card of purple suit\\" was made, and it must be consistent with the card suits, we need additional insight from the problem itself: - The correct character who came out was not T1 with an orange card because he would have explicitly said, \\"I have a card of orange suit.\\" 9. Lastly, verifying the other conditions: - T1 could not make such claiming statements about a purple card as his options for truthfulness lies directly on having a purple card. If T1 makes the statement indicating purple suit while holding an orange suit, he inherently lies, ruling him out. Similarly, - T2 with an orange card would lie with the same condition, holding a purple card and aligning truthfully to the stated problem. So, it automatically excludes T1 and aligns the speaking to T2, explicitly addressing the conclusion. # Conclusion The speaker must be **Trulalya (Тrulalya)**.

Next, we evaluate the derivative at ( x = -1 ) to find the slope of the tangent line at that point: y'bigg|_{x = -1} = 2 - 3(-1)^2 = 2 - 3(1) = -1. Now we have the slope of the tangent line, which is ( -1 ). The coordinates of the point of tangency are obtained by substituting ( x = -1 ) into the original equation: y = 2(-1) - (-1)^3 = -2 - (-1) = -1. So, the point of tangency is ( (-1, -1) ). Therefore, the equation of the tangent line can be written in point-slope form: y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where ( m ) is the slope and ( (x_1, y_1) ) is the point of tangency. Substituting the values we have ( m = -1 ) and ( (x_1, y_1) = (-1, -1) ): y - (-1) = -1(x - (-1)), which simplifies to: y + 1 = -x -1.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds together. The speed of the first train is 60 km/hr, and the speed of the second train is 40 km/hr. Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr Relative speed = 100 km/hr To work with the crossing time, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s by multiplying with 5/18 (since 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s). Relative speed in m/s = 100 km/hr * (5/18) m/s/km/hr Relative speed in m/s = (100 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed in m/s = (500/18) m/s Relative speed in m/s = 27.777... m/s (approximately) The time taken to cross each other is given as 12.239020878329734 seconds. The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths. Let's denote the length of the second train as L meters. Total distance covered = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance covered = 140 m + L We know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, so we can write: Total distance covered = Relative speed * Time taken to cross 140 m + L = 27.777... m/s * 12.239020878329734 s Now we solve for L: L = (27.777... m/s * 12.239020878329734 s) - 140 m L ≈ (27.777... * 12.239020878329734) - 140 L ≈ 340 - 140 L ≈ 200 m Therefore, the length of the second bullet train is approximately boxed{200} meters."},{"instruction":"We define: left(a,b,cright) as the associated numbers of the function y=ax^{2}+bx+c.

To find the x-intercepts, we use the quadratic formula: [x = frac{-b pm sqrt{Delta}}{2a} = frac{m+2 pm sqrt{(m-2)^2}}{2m}.] This simplifies to two possible values for x: [x_1 = frac{m+2 + (m-2)}{2m} = 1,] [x_2 = frac{m+2 - (m-2)}{2m} = frac{4}{2m} = frac{2}{m}.] Given that m is a positive integer and we need both x_1 and x_2 to be integers, we find that when m=1, it satisfies the conditions, making x_2 = 2. Thus, the integer intersection points on the x-axis are (1,0) and (2,0). To find the y-intercept, we let x=0 in the original equation, which gives us y = c = 2. Therefore, the y-intercept is (0,2).

Simplifying: [ 4u^2 - 4u + 1 geq 0 ] 12. This can be written as: [ (2u - 1)^2 geq 0 ] 13. This is always true for all real numbers ( u ). Therefore, the original inequality holds for all ( x neq -1 ), ( y neq -1 ) with ( xy = 1 ).

Define a new function ( g ) as the composition of ( f ) with itself, i.e., let ( g = f circ f ). Therefore, [ g(n) = f(f(n)). ] 3. From the given functional equation, it follows that [ g(n) = n + 1987. ] 4. Next, we show that ( f ) must be injective. Assume ( a, b in mathbb{N}^{star} ) such that ( f(a) = f(b) ). Then, [ f(f(a)) = f(f(b)). ] Using the functional equation, we get: [ a + 1987 = b + 1987 implies a = b. ] Hence, ( f ) is injective. 5. Moreover, for any integer ( n > 0 ), ( f(n) neq n ). If there were an ( n ) such that ( f(n) = n ), we would have: [ f(f(n)) = f(n) implies n + 1987 = n, ] which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( f ) has no fixed points. 6.

Each set ( O_k ) contains numbers of the form ( k + 1987n ) for non-negative integers ( n ). 9. Consequently, for each ( k in {1, 2, ldots, 1987} ), there exist integers ( m geq 0 ) and ( n in {1, 2, ldots, 1987} ) such that: [ f(k) = g^m(n). ] 10. Since ( f ) is injective, there are two possibilities: - ( m = 0 ): In this case, ( f(k) = n ). - ( m = 1 ): In this case, ( f(k) = g(n) = n + 1987 ). 11. Given ( f ) is injective and ( f(k) neq k ), if ( m = 1 ), we simplify ( k = f(n) ), creating a pairing of numbers in ( { 1, 2, ldots, 1987 } ) such that ( f ) pairs each number ( n ) with another distinct number ( f(n) ). 12. The set ( {1, 2, ldots, 1987} ) must then be divided into pairs ( {n, f(n)} ). This necessary pairing of integers means that the number of integers in this set should be even. However, 1987 is an odd number, which makes such a pairing impossible. # Conclusion: Therefore, no such function ( f ) can exist, as it leads to a contradiction. This completes the proof.

Imagine we divide the rooms into 100 segments with each segment containing m + 1 rooms. - Each tourist checks all the rooms in their segment first (from left to right). If no free room is found within their segment, they will check the spare room (if available), and then move to the next segment's rooms (from right to left). - For this setup, n geq 100(m + 1) rooms are needed to ensure that all tourists find a free room without breaking the arrangement. - In conclusion, for even k, the minimal n should be: [ boxed{n = 100(m + 1)} ] 2. **Case 2: k = 2m + 1 (odd)** - Since k is odd, follow a similar segmentation approach as in the even case, but account for the odd number making k one more than an even number. - Consider spare check rooms for odd k, which means accounting for an additional room in total. - Therefore, n geq 100(m + 1) + 1 rooms are required to avoid any collision during room allocation. - In conclusion, for odd k, the minimal n should be: [ boxed{n = 100(m + 1) + 1} ] # Detailed Algorithm: 1. **Initial Setup:** - For both cases k = 2m and k = 2m + 1, divide the room list into 100 sections, each containing m+1 rooms. - Assign each tourist to a specific section to first check for free rooms sequentially. 2. **Tourist Check-In Process:** - **For each tourist i,** - Step into section i and check each room from left to right until a free room is found. - If no free room is found, move to the next section (for i = 100, cycle back to 1) and again check room availability. - Ensure that no tourist will settle in an already occupied room by examining segments carefully before moving ahead. 3. **Even k Condition:** - Establish and verify room availability within designated spaces. - n = 100(m+1) is sufficient for no disruptions when k = 2m. 4. **Odd k Condition:** - Configure extra room checks for odd k and allocate additional rooms if necessary. - n = 100(m+1) + 1 is sufficient when k = 2m + 1 for ensuring no disturbances among tourists.

The mean of these integers will also be an integer and be the middle element, say (x). Therefore, the sum of these integers can be expressed as: [ (2n + 1) times x = 100 ] This implies: [ x = frac{100}{2n + 1} ] For (x) to be an integer, (2n + 1) must be a divisor of 100.

Thus, (5) and (25) are the only valid divisors in this case, giving one possible set of consecutive integers. 4. **Case 2: Even number of elements** Suppose the number of elements is even, denoted as (2n). The mean of these integers will fall exactly between the middle two integers. Let this mean be (x).

This ensures that Aerith consistently matches squares in such a way that pairs of adjacent squares are removed symmetrically. 3. **Outcome analysis**: - Because Aerith always pairs Bob's moves by targeting adjacent squares, she ensures the last two squares to be crossed out would be adjacent. - For example, if Aeroith pairs actions perfectly as Bob goes first (e.g., Bob chooses 1 or 19, Aerith goes 2 or 18), the last moves will always land on adjacent squares. Thus, Aerith has a winning strategy as her systematic pairing ensures that the last two squares will always be adjacent.

Specifically, we aim for sums of the form ( mn ), where ( m < n ). - As long as there are at least ( n ) cards, we can use the following argument: - Consider the set of partial sums ( {a_1, a_1 + a_2, a_1 + a_2 + a_3, ldots} ). - By the Pigeonhole Principle, either one of these partial sums is a multiple of ( n ), or two of these partial sums have the same remainder when divided by ( n ). - In the latter case, the difference between these two sums is a subset of the cards whose sum is divisible by ( n ). 5. **Forming the Subsets:** - We can always find a subset of cards whose sum is divisible by ( n ). Remove this subset and repeat the process. - When fewer than ( n ) cards remain, the remaining cards must form a subset whose sum is divisible by ( n ). 6. **Applying the Induction Hypothesis:** - After forming subsets whose sums are multiples of ( n ), we can treat these subsets as new \\"cards\\" with values ( mn ). - By the induction hypothesis, we can arrange these new \\"cards\\" into ( k ) stacks such that the sum of the numbers in each stack is ( n(n-1)! = n! ).

We need to show that ( f ) is constant.    - Let (varphi) be a bump function, i.e., a smooth function whose support is compact and contains 0.    - Define (varphi_{epsilon}(x) = frac{1}{epsilon} varphi left( frac{x}{epsilon} right)). Then (int_{a}^{b} g(x) varphi_{epsilon} (x - c) ; dx to g(c)) for all (g(x) in C[a, b]) and (a < c < b).    - Now, let (eta_{epsilon}(x) = int_{-1}^{x} [varphi_{epsilon}(t - a) - varphi_{epsilon}(t - b)] ; dt) for (-1 < a < b < 1).

Since (a) and (b) are arbitrary, (f) must be constant. 2. **Main Proof:**    - Assume (S) achieves its minimum for (f in mathbb{A}). Then for any (eta in C_{0}^{infty}(-1, 1)) and (epsilon in mathbb{R}), we have (S(f + epsilon eta) geq S(f)).    - This implies (frac{d}{depsilon} S(f + epsilon eta) = 0). A simple calculation shows that this implies (int_{-1}^{1} x^2 f'(x) eta'(x) ; dx = 0).    - By the Lemma, the continuous function (x^2 f'(x)) must be constant. This is possible only if (f'(x) = 0), which contradicts the boundary conditions (f(-1) = -1) and (f(1) = 1). Thus, (S) has no minimum. 3. **Infimum Calculation:**    - We claim that (inf_{f in mathbb{A}} S(f) = 0). Clearly, (S(f)) is non-negative, so it suffices to show that the infimum cannot be positive.    - For (0 < epsilon < 1), let (f_{epsilon}) be defined such that (f_{epsilon}(-1) = -1) and       [      f'_{epsilon}(x) =       begin{cases}       frac{2}{epsilon} left( 1 - left| frac{x}{epsilon} right| right) & text{if } |x| leq epsilon,       0 & text{otherwise}.      end{cases}      ]    - Then (f_{epsilon} in mathbb{A}) and we have       [      S(f_{epsilon}) = int_{-epsilon}^{epsilon} x^2 f'_{epsilon}(x)^2 ; dx = 8epsilon int_{0}^{1} t^2 (1 - t)^2 ; dt.      ]    - Evaluating the integral, we get       [      int_{0}^{1} t^2 (1 - t)^2 ; dt = int_{0}^{1} (t^2 - 2t^3 + t^4) ; dt = left[ frac{t^3}{3} - frac{2t^4}{4} + frac{t^5}{5} right]_{0}^{1} = frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{5} = frac{10 - 15 + 6}{30} = frac{1}{30}.      ]    - Thus,       [      S(f_{epsilon}) = 8epsilon cdot frac{1}{30} = frac{8epsilon}{30} = frac{4epsilon}{15}.      ]    - By choosing sufficiently small (epsilon), we can make (S(f_{epsilon})) as small as we wish.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to form three committees of 4 members each from 9 MBAs without any restrictions. Since the order of the committees doesn't matter, we can use combinations. The total number of ways to choose the first committee is: C(9,4) = 9! / (4! * (9-4)!) = 9! / (4! * 5!) = (9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 126 After choosing the first committee, we have 5 MBAs left for the second committee: C(5,4) = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5! / (4! * 1!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 5 The remaining MBA automatically goes to the third committee. So, the total number of ways to form the committees is 126 * 5 = 630. Now, let's calculate the number of ways Jane and Albert can be on the same committee. We'll treat Jane and Albert as a single entity since we want them to be together. First, we place Jane and Albert together in a committee, which can be done in 1 way. Then we have 7 other MBAs to distribute into three committees with 2 spots already taken by Jane and Albert.

The number of ways to choose the next committee is: C(5,4) = 5 The remaining MBA goes to the last committee. So, the number of ways to form the committees with Jane and Albert together is 21 * 5 = 105.

Let's look into each scenario with details: **Scenario 1** We can further break it down into two sub-scenarios: - Teacher A is with either C or D, or - Teacher B is with either C or D. Since C and D are interchangeable in terms of being paired with A or B and the remaining one will be alone in another class, we need to count the permutations for both A and B: - For teacher A to be paired with either C or D, there are 2 choices of who to pair A with and 3! ways to arrange the three different classes. So, we have a total of:      2 times 3! = 2 times 6 = 12 text{ways for A with either C or D}.    - Similarly for B paired with either C or D, we also have 12 ways. Therefore, the total number of ways for Scenario 1 is: text{Total for Scenario 1} = 12 + 12 = 24.  **Scenario 2** For the case where C and D are in the same class, ignoring A and B's constraints: - We have 3! ways to assign the classes since the other two (A and B, who cannot be together) will automatically occupy the remaining classes.

Given that a prism's lateral faces are connected by their edges, and these edges are parallel because they extend from the parallel edges of the bases, we can conclude that the lateral faces must indeed be parallelograms. Moreover, since each pair of adjacent parallelograms shares a common side (which is an edge of the prism), and these sides are parallel (as they extend from the parallel sides of the bases), this further supports the correctness of statement A.

Step-by-Step Procedure: 1. **Reflect Circle B Over Line m:**    - Reflecting circle B over the line m, we obtain a new circle, denoted as B'.    - The reflection process ensures that any geometrical relationship between points and lines with respect to B and m are preserved in B'. 2. **Find Tangents to Both A and B':**    - Identify and construct common tangents between circle A and the reflected circle B'.     - There are generally four common tangents to two circles: two external tangents and two internal tangents. 3. **Analyze Tangent Reflections:**    - The tangents to A that are also tangents to B' will provide us with the solutions we seek.    - The tangents to B' when reflected over the line m will correspond to tangents to B. 4. **Construction of Tangents:**    - For each common tangent, determine the point of tangency on both circles A and B'.    - Reflect these points of tangency over the line m to verify their relation to circle B. # Conclusion: The tangent that meets the criteria provided will be one of the four possibilities derived from the construction of tangents between A and B' and their reflection back.

It is known that if any one child is excluded, the remaining 99 children can be divided into 33 groups of three such that in each group all three children are mutual friends. Find the minimum possible number of pairs of children who are friends.","output":"1. **Problem Statement Interpretation:**    We start by translating the problem into the language of graph theory with the following correspondences:    - Each child represents a vertex.    - Each mutual friendship between two children represents an edge.        Thus, we have a graph (G) with 100 vertices. The condition states that if any vertex is removed, the remaining 99 vertices can be divided into 33 groups of 3 vertices each, such that every group forms a triangle (i.e., every pair of vertices in each group is connected by an edge). 2. **Constructing a Graph Example:**    To find the minimum number of edges, let’s construct a graph:    - Consider 99 vertices, excluding a specific vertex (A).    - These 99 vertices can be partitioned into 33 triangles (with 3 vertices each). Within each triangle, all pairs are connected.    - Next, connect the vertex (A) to every other vertex.    Each of the 33 groups (triangles) has 3 edges, so the total number of edges among these 99 vertices is:    [    33 times 3 = 99 text{ edges}    ]    Then, vertex (A) is connected to each of the 99 other vertices, adding:    [    99 text{ edges}    ]        Therefore, the total number of edges in the constructed graph is:    [    99 + 99 = 198 text{ edges}    ]     3. **Verifying the Minimum Edge Requirement:**    We need to show that 198 is the minimum possible number of edges. We will use mathematical induction on ( k ), defined as follows:    - Call a graph on ( 3k + 1 ) vertices \\"good\\" if, when any one vertex is removed, the remaining ( 3k ) vertices can always be partitioned into ( k ) triangles.    **Base case ( ( k = 1 ) )**: A graph with 4 vertices ( K_4 ) (complete graph with 4 vertices):    - Removing any vertex from ( K_4 ) leaves a triangle ( ( K_3 ) ) consisting of all pairs connected.    - ( K_4 ) has ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ) edges, meeting the requirement.    **Inductive step**: Assume a good graph on ( 3k + 1 ) vertices has at least ( 6k ) edges.    If any vertex is connected to at least 4 other vertices, the total number of edges:    [     frac{(3k + 1) times 4}{2} = 2(3k + 1) ]    This exceeds ( 6k ), the number we need.    - Now consider the case where a vertex ( A ) is connected to at most 3 other vertices ( B, C, ) and ( D ).    Removing ( A ) and an arbitrary vertex ( Y ) allows us to re-assign ( A ) into any existing or new triangle.    - Consider the worst-case scenario with fewer than 4 connections: ( A ) has 3 neighbors ( B, C, ) and ( D ). Then:      - Removing ( B ) (or ( C ), ( D )) ensures remaining vertices can still form required triangles.    Ultimately, at least ( 3/2 times 4 = 6 ) edges will be preserved when ( 2(3k + 1) > 6k ) are expected. Thus, the number is optimal. **Conclusion**: The minimal number of edges in such a graph is:    [    boxed{198}    ]"},{"instruction":"For every positive integer  k , let  mathbf{T}_k = (k(k+1), 0) , and define  mathcal{H}_k  as the homothety centered at  mathbf{T}_k  with ratio  tfrac{1}{2}  if  k  is odd and  tfrac{2}{3}  is  k  is even.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of students studying Japanese from both classes: (3/8)S + xJ = (1/3)(J + S) Since S = 2J, we can substitute S with 2J in the equation: (3/8)(2J) + xJ = (1/3)(J + 2J) Simplify the left side of the equation: (3/4)J + xJ = (1/3)(3J) Combine like terms on the left side: ((3/4) + x)J = J Now, we can solve for x: (3/4)J + xJ = J xJ = J - (3/4)J xJ = (1 - 3/4)J xJ = (1/4)J Divide both sides by J to solve for x: x = 1/4 Therefore, boxed{1/4}  of the juniors study Japanese."},{"instruction":"Janeth bought 5 bags of round balloons with 25 balloons in each bag, 4 bags of long balloons with 35 balloons in each bag, 3 bags of heartshaped balloons with 40 balloons in each bag, and 2 bags of starshaped balloons with 50 balloons in each bag.

Placing ( 1 ) on top would instantly win the game for the player.        - **Generalized Claim:** Assume ( k ) is the ( m )-th largest card. Then the smallest card has at most value ( m ).      - **Proof:** There are ( k ) cards within the first ( k ) cards, and ( m-1 ) of those are larger than ( k ). Thus, ( k-m ) of those are smaller than ( k ). This implies the smallest card must be at most ( m ). 5. **Algorithm and Monovariant:**    - Using the described algorithm, Player 1 will always force Player 2 to place a card ( i ) with ( i > k ) on top.    - This increases the number of cards Player 1 can work with.    - Since this process is a monovariant (a quantity that changes in a single direction), Player 1 will eventually have the card with value ( 1 ) in the first ( k ) cards and win. 6. **State Definitions:**    - Define the state where ( k ) is not the smallest card within the first ( k ) cards as \\"big\\".    - Define the state where ( k ) is the smallest card within the first ( k ) cards as \\"small\\". 7. **Conclusion:**    - If Anna (Player 1) starts with a \\"big\\" state, she can apply the algorithm and eventually win.    - If Anna starts in a \\"small\\" state, Beatrice (Player 2) will find herself in a \\"big\\" state on her turn and can force a win.

Line segments (PQ) intersecting (AB) and (CD) at (N) and (M) can be associated to this property. 3. **Application to the Problem**:     - **Geometric Configuration**:         - Form triangles (ANP), (BNQ), (CMP), and (DMQ).         - We need to demonstrate that the circumcircles of these triangles intersect at a single point, known as the Miquel point in the context of our quadrilateral configuration. 4. **Using the Miquel Point Theorem**:     - In our quadrilateral (ABCD):         - Draw circumcircle of triangle (ANP).         - Next, draw the circumcircle of triangle (BNQ).              - According to the property, since (P) and (Q) are midpoints, they lie on the circumcircle defined by diagonals (AC) (hence triangle (ANP)) and (BD) (hence triangle (BNQ)).         - By symmetry and construction, we then consider circumcircles of triangles (CMP) and (DMQ). 5. **Intersections of Circumcircles**:     - Let’s denote the circumcircle of triangle (ANP) as (omega_1), triangle (BNQ) as (omega_2), (CMP) as (omega_3), and (DMQ) as (omega_4).      - According to the Miquel point theorem:         - The circumcircle (omega_1) will intersect (omega_2) at a point (R), and similarly, this intersection point (R) should also lie on (omega_3) and (omega_4). 6. **Conclusion**:     - Hence, using the Miquel point theorem, the circumcircles of the triangles (ANP), (BNQ), (CMP), and (DMQ) will indeed intersect at a single common point, e.g., the Miquel point of our problem construction. Therefore, we conclude that the circumcircles of triangles (ANP), (BNQ), (CMP), and (DMQ) intersect at a single point, proving the statement. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Gail has two fish tanks.

[      AB = 2 sin 2alpha, quad BC = 2 sin 2beta, quad CD = 2 sin 2gamma, quad DA = 2 sin 2delta      ]    - Similarly, the lengths of the diagonals can be expressed as:      [      AC = 2 sin(2alpha + 2beta), quad BD = 2 sin(2beta + 2gamma)      ] 3. **Sum of Sines Properties**:    - Using the addition properties of sine function and inscribed quadrilateral properties:      - The maximum value for any sine function is 1.    - This prioritizes the values for sides such that their sum differences will not exceed a certain range. 4. **Final Conclusion**:    - Combining all insights, we conclude that the difference between the perimeter and the sum of diagonals is within the given range:      [      0 < text{Perimeter} - text{Sum of Diagonals} < 2      ] [ boxed{0 < text{Perimeter} - text{Sum of Diagonals} < 2} ]"},{"instruction":"Grace is looking to plant some lettuce in her raised bed garden.

The medium bed can house a certain number of rows with 20 seeds being sown per row. Grace can plant 320 seeds in all four beds of her raised bed garden. How many rows of lettuce can the medium bed hold?","output":"Let's start by calculating how many seeds Grace can sow in the top beds. Since there are 2 large beds, each with 4 rows, and each row can hold 25 seeds, we can calculate the total number of seeds for the top beds as follows: Number of seeds in one large bed = 4 rows * 25 seeds/row = 100 seeds Total seeds in both large beds = 2 * 100 seeds = 200 seeds Now, we know that Grace can plant a total of 320 seeds in all four beds. If we subtract the number of seeds in the top beds from the total, we can find out how many seeds can be sown in the medium beds: Total seeds for medium beds = Total seeds - Seeds in top beds Total seeds for medium beds = 320 seeds - 200 seeds = 120 seeds Since each row in the medium beds can hold 20 seeds, we can calculate the number of rows in the medium beds by dividing the total number of seeds for the medium beds by the number of seeds per row: Number of rows in medium beds = Total seeds for medium beds / Seeds per row Number of rows in medium beds = 120 seeds / 20 seeds/row = 6 rows Therefore, the medium bed can hold boxed{6}  rows of lettuce."},{"instruction":"For a triangle ( ABC ) with side lengths ( a < b < c ), denote the medians corresponding to sides ( a, b, ) and ( c ) as ( s_{a}, s_{b}, ) and ( s_{c} ) respectively.

Consider the medians s_a, s_b, and s_c of the triangle ABC intersecting the sides a, b, and c at A_1, B_1, and C_1, respectively, such that a < b < c.     2. Note that since b < c, vertex A is on the same side of the perpendicular bisector of side BC as vertex C. Therefore, the median AA_1 = s_a forms an acute angle delta with A_1C.    Using the cosine theorem in the triangle AA_1C:        cos delta = frac{A_1A^2 + A_1C^2 - AC^2}{2 cdot A_1A cdot A_1C}     3. The cotangent of the angle delta in the triangle AA_1C is given by:        operatorname{ctg} delta = frac{cos delta}{sin delta} = frac{A_1A^2 + A_1C^2 - AC^2}{2 cdot A_1A cdot A_1C sin delta}     4.

Express s_a^2 in terms of the sides of the triangle. Using the cosine theorem again in triangles AA_1C and AA_1B and noting cos (180^circ - delta) = -cos delta, we get:    - For triangle AA_1C:        b^2 = frac{a^2}{4} + s_a^2 - a cdot s_a cdot cos delta        - For triangle AA_1B:        c^2 = frac{a^2}{4} + s_a^2 + a cdot s_a cdot cos delta     6. Adding these equations and solving:        s_a^2 + frac{a^2}{4} = frac{b^2 + c^2}{2}     7. Substituting s_a^2 into the original cotangent formula:        operatorname{ctg} delta = frac{c^2 - b^2}{4t}     8.

By the infinite pigeonhole principle, there exists an infinite subset A_2 subset A_1 such that all elements in A_2 are congruent modulo mn. Let this common residue be a.

A graph with ( 2 ) vertices and no triangles can only have ( 1 ) edge, which is equal to ( 1^2 ). 3. **Induction Hypothesis**: Suppose the result holds true for a graph with ( 2n ) vertices: any such graph with no triangles has at most ( n^2 ) edges. 4. **Induction Step**: We need to prove the statement for ( 2n + 2 ) vertices.

This particular mapping sends lines (UD) to lines (UE), which are perpendicular to the original lines (UD) because (angle EUD = 90^circ). 4. **Mapping Lines (UE) to Points on (BC)**:     - We map lines through (U) to their intersection points (E) on line (BC). 5. **Orthographic Projection from (BC) to (AB)**:     - Finally, we project orthogonally from line (BC) onto line (AB).

At x=0, this simplifies to:  f'(0) = e^{0} + kcdot0cdot e^{0} = 1. Additionally, because f(0)=0cdot e^{kcdot0}=0, the y-coordinate of the point of tangency is 0. Hence, the equation of the tangent line at the point (0,f(0)) is:  y = f'(0)(x-0) + f(0), Substituting f'(0) = 1 and f(0) = 0, we find:  y = x.  **(Ⅱ) Determining intervals of monotonicity:** We need to find where the derivative f'(x) is positive (for increasing behavior) or negative (for decreasing behavior). Let's investigate the sign changes of f'(x):  f'(x) = (1+kx)e^{kx} = 0. To find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero. The exponential function e^{kx} is never zero, thus we only need to consider the zeroes of 1+kx, which lead to:  x = -frac{1}{k},  (k neq 0). For k>0, when x in (-infty, -frac{1}{k}), we have f'(x) < 0, which means f(x) is monotonically decreasing in that interval. Conversely, when x in (-frac{1}{k}, +infty), we have f'(x) > 0 and f(x) is monotonically increasing. Similarly, for k<0, when x in (-infty, -frac{1}{k}), f'(x) > 0 and f(x) is monotonically increasing, but when x in (-frac{1}{k}, +infty), f'(x) < 0 and f(x) is monotonically decreasing. **(Ⅲ) Finding the range of k for the monotonic increase in (-1,1):** Based on the monotonicity intervals identified in part (Ⅱ), for k>0, f(x) is monotonically increasing in (-1,1) if and only if:  -frac{1}{k} leq -1, which simplifies to:  k leq 1. For k<0, f(x) is monotonically increasing in (-1,1) if and only if:  -frac{1}{k} geq 1, which simplifies to:  k geq -1. Combining both cases, we see that if f(x) is monotonically increasing in (-1,1), the range for k is:  k in [-1,0) cup (0,1].

Multiplying through by q^2 s^2 to clear the denominators, we have:    [    p^2 s^2 + r^2 q^2 = 168 q^2 s^2    ] 4. Notice that the right-hand side of the equation is divisible by q^2. Thus, the left-hand side must also be divisible by q^2. Since p and q are relatively prime, this implies that q^2 mid s^2, or q mid s. 5. Similarly, since the right-hand side is divisible by s^2, the left-hand side must also be divisible by s^2. Given that r and s are relatively prime, this implies that s^2 mid q^2, or s mid q. 6. The only way two positive integers can be mutual divisors is if they are equal. Therefore, we must have q = s.

Now, let's calculate the tax on the applicable items (food and beverages, souvenirs, and games): Taxable amount = Food and beverages + Souvenirs + Games Taxable amount = 37 + 15 + 30 + 27 Taxable amount = 109 Tax on the taxable amount at 8% = 8% of 109 Tax = 0.08 * 109 Tax = 8.72 Now, let's add up all the expenditures including the tax: Total expenditure = Admission Tickets + Food and Beverages + Souvenirs + Games + Transportation + Tax Total expenditure = 45 + 37 + 15 + 30 + 27 + 25 + 8.72 Total expenditure = 187.72 Therefore, the total amount the Greene family spent on their trip to the amusement park after taking into account all expenditures, discounts, and taxes is boxed{187.72} ."},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, A=60^{circ}, b=1, S_{triangle ABC}=sqrt{3}, then a=____.","output":"Given triangle ABC with A=60^{circ}, b=1, and S_{triangle ABC}=sqrt{3}, we aim to find a.

We need to prove that 4 mid n. 2. **Proving n is even**:     - Use **proof by contradiction**.     - Assume that n is odd.  3. **Analysis under the assumption of odd n**:     - Since n is odd, every a_i must also be odd in order to make their product, an odd number, equal to n (which is odd).     - Sum of n odd numbers:         - Since the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is always odd,          - consequently, sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i must be odd.     - However, it contradicts the given condition sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = 0, which is even. 4. **Concluding that n is even**:     - Therefore, our assumption that n is odd must be false.     - Hence, n is even. 5. **Proving 4 mid n**:     - Continue with proof by contradiction to show that n must be a multiple of 4.     - Assume n is even but not a multiple of 4. Therefore, n can be expressed as n = 2k where k is an odd number. 6. **Further Analysis**:     - Recall prod_{i=1}^{n} a_i = n = 2k. This implies that at least one of the a_i must be even (because an odd product cannot make an even number like (2k)).     - Let a_1 be the even number and the rest be odd numbers for a contradiction.     - Since we assumed (k) is odd, there are k-1 odd numbers left (out of k) which implies sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i includes the sum of odd numbers and one even number.         - Sum of k-1 odd numbers + 1 even number is odd (sum of odd numbers is even if their count is even, and adding even to even is even).         - Thus, sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i neq 0 (because it would be odd). 7. **Final Contradiction**:     - This contradicts the condition sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = 0.     - The contradiction arises from the wrong assumption that n is not a multiple of 4. 8. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, 4 mid n.

Since the radius of the circle is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency, we could first find the slope of the radius CP. The gradient of radius CP is given by the change in y over the change in x, which is:  text{slope of } CP = frac{2 - 0}{1 - 0} = 2.  The slope of the tangent line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of CP because the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line is:  m = -frac{1}{text{slope of } CP} = -frac{1}{2}.  The equation of a straight line in point-slope form is given by y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point that the line passes through. Using point P(1, 2) and the slope m = -frac{1}{2}, the equation of the tangent line becomes:  y - 2 = -frac{1}{2}(x - 1).

This means that 70% of the reporters who cover politics do cover local politics in country X.

The common denominator for 36, 18, and 4 is 36x, so we multiply each term by 36x/W to clear the denominators: 36x(W/36) + 36x(W/18) + 36x(W/x) = 36x(W/4) This simplifies to: x + 2x + 36 = 9x Now we combine like terms: 3x + 36 = 9x Subtract 3x from both sides: 36 = 6x Now divide both sides by 6 to solve for x: x = 36 / 6 x = 6 Therefore, c alone can finish the work in boxed{6}  days."},{"instruction":"Simplify the expression dfrac{36}{51}cdotdfrac{35}{24}cdotdfrac{68}{49}.","output":"First, we identify the prime factors: - (36 = 2^2 cdot 3^2) - (51 = 3 cdot 17) - (35 = 5 cdot 7) - (24 = 2^3 cdot 3) - (68 = 2^2 cdot 17) - (49 = 7^2) Setting up the multiplication of fractions, we have: [ frac{36}{51} cdot frac{35}{24} cdot frac{68}{49} = frac{36 cdot 35 cdot 68}{51 cdot 24 cdot 49} ] We simplify by canceling out common factors: - (3) is a common factor between 36 and 51. - (2^2) is a common factor between 36 and 68. - (7) is a common factor between 35 and 49.

The reaction between methane (CH4) and chlorine (Cl2) typically proceeds via a radical halogenation mechanism, which can result in the substitution of one or more hydrogen atoms in methane with chlorine atoms. However, for simplicity, let's consider the initial step where one hydrogen atom is substituted to form HCl and CH3Cl (methyl chloride).

You have 2 moles of CH4 and 4 moles of Cl2. Since the reaction requires a 1:1 molar ratio of CH4 to Cl2, the limiting reactant will determine the amount of HCl produced. In this case, CH4 is the limiting reactant because you have fewer moles of CH4 (2 moles) compared to Cl2 (4 moles). Therefore, the reaction will stop once all the CH4 has been consumed.

An isosceles triangle has two equal sides, and we are given two different lengths: 4cm and 9cm. We need to determine which length represents the equal sides and then calculate the perimeter accordingly. First, let's consider the scenario where the equal sides are 4cm each. In this case, we would have the sides of the triangle as 4cm, 4cm, and 9cm. However, for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Checking this condition: [4cm + 4cm lt 9cm] [8cm lt 9cm] This condition does not hold, which means that having the equal sides as 4cm each does not form a valid triangle. Therefore, this possibility is discarded. Next, let's consider the scenario where the equal sides are 9cm each. In this case, the sides of the triangle would be 9cm, 9cm, and 4cm.

Describe your purchasing method and calculate how much money is saved.","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Calculation of Costs **Scheme 1: Buying from Store A** - Cost of tennis rackets: 30 times 100 = 3000 yuan - Since one can of tennis balls is free for each racket, the cost for the remaining cans: (x - 30) times 20 - Total cost for Store A: 3000 + 20x - 600 = 20x + 2400 yuan **Scheme 2: Buying from Store B** - Cost of tennis rackets without discount: 30 times 100 = 3000 yuan - Cost of tennis balls without discount: 20x - Total cost without discount: 3000 + 20x - Applying a 90% discount: (3000 + 20x) times 0.9 = 2700 + 18x yuan Therefore, the algebraic expressions for the costs are: - Store A: 20x + 2400 yuan - Store B: 18x + 2700 yuan  Part 2: Comparison for x=100 **Store A:** - Substituting x = 100: 20 times 100 + 2400 = 4400 yuan **Store B:** - Substituting x = 100: 18 times 100 + 2700 = 4500 yuan Since 4400 < 4500, buying from Store A is more cost-effective.  Part 3: More Cost-Effective Plan for x=100 1. Buy 30 tennis rackets from Store A to get 30 cans of tennis balls for free. 2. Buy the remaining 70 cans of tennis balls from Store B with a 90% discount. **Calculation:** - Cost of 30 rackets from Store A: 30 times 100 = 3000 yuan - Cost of 70 cans of tennis balls from Store B with discount: 70 times 20 times 0.9 = 1260 yuan - Total cost: 3000 + 1260 = 4260 yuan **Savings:** - Original cost from Store A for x=100: 4400 yuan - New plan cost: 4260 yuan - Savings: 4400 - 4260 = 140 yuan Therefore, the more cost-effective plan saves boxed{140text{ yuan}}."},{"instruction":"The Megatek Corporation is displaying its distribution of employees by department in a circle graph.

The first car runs 25 km along the main road. 2. It takes a right turn and runs 15 km. 3. It turns left and runs another 25 km. 4. It then takes the direction back to reach the main road. When the first car takes a right turn and then a left, it forms a right-angled triangle with the main road. The distance it travels away from the main road is 15 km (the side perpendicular to the main road), and then it comes back parallel to the main road for 25 km. However, since it needs to return to the main road, it will cover the same 15 km back. So, the total distance covered by the first car in the direction along the main road is 25 km (initial run) + 25 km (after the left turn) = 50 km. Now, let's consider the second car: The second car has a minor breakdown and runs only 62 km along the main road. To find the distance between the two cars, we need to consider their positions on the main road. Initially, they were 150 km apart. The first car has covered 50 km along the main road, and the second car has covered 62 km. So, the distance between them along the main road is now: Initial distance - distance covered by the first car - distance covered by the second car = 150 km - 50 km - 62 km = 150 km - 112 km = 38 km Therefore, the distance between the two cars at this point is boxed{38}  km along the main road."},{"instruction":"Calculate the value of r if 8=2^{6r+2}.","output":"Start by recognizing that 8 can be written as a power of 2, specifically, 8 = 2^3.

Given that t = 42, we can subtract this from the total sum to find the sum of the remaining four integers: 80 - 42 = 38. Since k < m < r < s < t, the median of these 5 integers will be r, the middle value. To maximize the value of r, we need to minimize the values of k and m. Since they are positive integers, the smallest value for k is 1. To keep m greater than k, the smallest value for m would be 2. Now, we have k = 1 and m = 2, and their sum is 1 + 2 = 3. Subtracting this from the remaining sum of 38, we get 38 - 3 = 35. This 35 must be split between r and s, with r being the smaller number to maintain the order k < m < r < s < t. To maximize r, we should minimize s. Since s must be greater than r and we want to maximize r, we can set s to be one more than r (r + 1). So we have r + (r + 1) = 35. Combining like terms, we get 2r + 1 = 35. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 2r = 34. Dividing both sides by 2, we get r = 17.

The centers are collinear, and the separation between O_1 and O_2 will be O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 6 + 8 = 14. For the chord to be tangent to both C_1 and C_2, it must lie perpendicular to the line joining the centers, at a point T. Let T be the foot of the perpendicular from O_3 to the chord. Then, O_3T is perpendicular to the chord. Since C_2 is internally tangent, O_3O_2 = R - 8, and since C_1 is externally tangent, O_3O_1 = R + 6. Along the line of centers, the point T divides O_3O_1 externally and O_3O_2 internally. Setting up the equation for balance: [ frac{O_3T}{R - 8} = frac{14 - O_3T}{R + 6} ] Solving for O_3T, we get: [ O_3T (R + 6) = (14 - O_3T)(R - 8)  O_3T R + 6O_3T = 14R - 112 - O_3T R + 8O_3T  14R - 112 = 14O_3T  O_3T = R - 8 ] Thus, the height O_3T from the center to the tangent point simplifies to R - 8.

Conclusion: Given that C_1 and C_2 have specific radii and tangency conditions and that C_3 must accommodate these circles along a straight line, the solution provides a valid chord length.

To solve this, we're translating the problem into graph theory terms, which involves analyzing Hamiltonian cycles in complete graphs. 1. **Graph Representation**    - The problem can be restated in terms of graph theory: specifically, can we find (n) Hamiltonian cycles in a complete graph with (2n + 1) vertices, such that no edge is shared between any two of the cycles?    - Each seating arrangement corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle, where each vertex represents a person, and an edge represents two people sitting next to each other. 2. **Hamiltonian Cycles Analysis**    - A complete graph (K_{2n+1}) has a total of ((2n+1)n) edges, since every vertex connects to every other vertex.    - A Hamiltonian cycle in such a graph uses exactly (2n + 1) edges.    - Given (n) Hamiltonian cycles, each edge of (K_{2n+1}) must be used exactly once in the n distinct cycles. 3. **Specific Cases**    a) **Case (n=5)**:       - For (n=5), we need (2n+1=11) vertices. The task involves finding 5 different Hamiltonian cycles for a complete graph (K_{11}).       - Constructing such cycles involves careful combinatorial arrangements, where each cycle refrains from sharing edges with the others.        b) **Case (n=4)**:       - For (n=4), there are (2n+1=9) vertices, and the task is thus finding 4 Hamiltonian cycles in the complete graph (K_{9}).       - The solution involves structures like the 9-vertex pyramid graph representation, essentially considering rotational symmetries. # General Case (n):    - For any natural number (n), the complete graph (K_{2n+1}) can be decomposed into (n) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles if (2n + 1) is a prime number.    - The construction uses properties of regular polygons and combinatorial design to guarantee no reused edges among different cycles. # Summary: By examining construction patterns for smaller values of (n) and using general principles of complete graphs and Hamiltonian cycles, we can affirm that such seating arrangements are possible:     [ boxed{text{Yes for all n, given 2n+1 is prime}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given a function f(x) (xinmathbb{R}) that satisfies: for any real numbers x, y, it always holds that f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) + frac{1}{2}, and when x > 0, f(x) > f(0) always holds, (1) Determine the monotonicity of f(x) on mathbb{R} and prove it; (2) If the function F(x) = f(max{x, 2xx^2}) + f(k) + 1 (text{where } max{a, b} = begin{cases} a, & a geq b  b, & a < b end{cases}) has three distinct zeros x_1, x_2, x_3, calculate the range of values for u = (x_1+x_2+x_3) + x_1x_2x_3.","output":"(1) The function f(x) is increasing on mathbb{R}, Proof: Taking x=y=0 gives us: f(0+0) = f(0) + f(0) + frac{1}{2}, solving which yields f(0) = -frac{1}{2}. For any x_1, x_2 in mathbb{R} such that x_1 < x_2, we have: f(x_2) - f(x_1) = f((x_2 - x_1) + x_1) - f(x_1) = f(x_2 - x_1) + f(x_1) + frac{1}{2} - f(x_1) = f(x_2 - x_1) + frac{1}{2} > 0, because x_2 - x_1 > 0 implies f(x_2 - x_1) > -frac{1}{2}. Therefore, f(x_1) < f(x_2), which means that f(x) is increasing on mathbb{R}. (2) We have F(x) = 0 Leftrightarrow f(max{-x, 2x-x^2}) + f(-k) + 1 = 0 Leftrightarrow f(max{-x, 2x-x^2}) + f(-k) + frac{1}{2} = -frac{1}{2} Leftrightarrow f(max{-x, 2x-x^2} - k) = f(0). Since f(x) is increasing on mathbb{R}, we have f(max{-x, 2x-x^2} - k) = f(0) Leftrightarrow max{-x, 2x-x^2} - k = 0 Leftrightarrow k = max{-x, 2x-x^2}. Construct the function g(x) = max{-x, 2x-x^2}, and note that -x > 2x-x^2 Leftrightarrow x < 0 or x > 3.

If there are 65 alligators, the turtle population would be: Turtle population = 3 * Alligator population Turtle population = 3 * 65 Turtle population = 195 Since the turtle population is also within the resource limit (195 turtles for 65 alligators, total 260 which is more than 200 but we were only given the limit for alligators), we can conclude that the number of male alligators during the mating season remains the same as during the non-mating season, which is boxed{10} ."},{"instruction":"Given that the sequence {a<sub>n</sub>} is a geometric sequence, a<sub>7</sub> = 4, a<sub>5</sub> + a<sub>9</sub> = 10, find the value of a<sub>3</sub> + a<sub>11</sub> = (    ) A: 32 B: 17 C: 10 D: 8","output":"The sequence {a<sub>n</sub>} is a geometric sequence, a<sub>7</sub> = 4, a<sub>5</sub> + a<sub>9</sub> = 10, ∴ frac {4}{q^{2}} + 4q<sup>2</sup> = 10, Solving for q<sup>2</sup>, we get q<sup>2</sup> = 2 or q<sup>2</sup> = frac {1}{2}, ∴ a<sub>3</sub> + a<sub>11</sub> = frac {a_{7}}{q^{4}} + a<sub>7</sub>q<sup>4</sup> = 4 × ( frac {1}{4} + 4) = 17, Hence, the answer is: boxed{text{B}}.

If the two colours agree at a vertex, then it is assigned that colour; otherwise, it becomes yellow. Show that, if some circle contains at least  2061  yellow points, then the vertices of some region are all yellow.  Proposed by *India*","output":"1. **Lemma 1**: Let two circles in the configuration cross at points ( x ) and ( y ). Then ( x ) and ( y ) are either both yellow or both non-yellow. This is because the numbers of interior vertices on the four arcs determined by ( x ) and ( y ) on the two circles have like parities. Each circle in the configuration contains an even number of yellow vertices.        **Proof of Lemma 1**: Consider two circles ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) intersecting at points ( x ) and ( y ). The arcs between ( x ) and ( y ) on ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) can be labeled as ( overarc{xy} ) and ( overarc{yx} ). Since the vertices are alternately colored, the number of vertices between ( x ) and ( y ) on each arc must be even. Therefore, if ( x ) is yellow, then ( y ) must also be yellow, and vice versa. This proves that ( x ) and ( y ) are either both yellow or both non-yellow. 2. **Lemma 2**: If ( overarc{xy} ), ( overarc{yz} ), and ( overarc{zx} ) are circular arcs of three pairwise distinct circles in the configuration, then the number of yellow vertices in the set ({x, y, z}) is odd.    **Proof of Lemma 2**: Consider three circles ( C_1 ), ( C_2 ), and ( C_3 ) intersecting at points ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ). By Lemma 1, the number of yellow vertices on each arc is even. Since the total number of vertices in the set ({x, y, z}) is three, and each vertex is counted twice (once for each intersecting circle), the number of yellow vertices must be odd. 3. **Classification of Circles**: The two lemmas show that the circles in the configuration split into two classes. Consider any circle ( C ) along with all circles that cross ( C ) at yellow points to form one class; the remaining circles then form the other class. Lemma 2 shows that any pair of circles in the same class cross at yellow points, otherwise, they cross at non-yellow points. Call the circles from the two classes \\"white\\" and \\"black\\" respectively. 4. **Regions and Arcs**: Let ( w ) and ( b ) be the numbers of white and black circles, respectively; clearly, ( w + b = n ). Assume that ( w ge b ), and that there is no yellow region. Clearly, ( b ge 1 ), otherwise each region is yellow. The white circles subdivide the plane into ( w(w-1) + 2 ) larger regions, call them \\"white regions\\". The white circles (or rather their boundaries) subdivide each black circle into \\"black arcs\\". Since there are no yellow regions, each white region contains at least one black arc. 5. **Counting Crossings**: Consider any white region, let it contain ( t ge 1 ) black arcs. We claim that the number of points at which ( t ) arcs cross doesn't exceed ( t - 1 ). To prove that, consider a multigraph whose vertices are these black arcs, two vertices being joined by an edge for each point at which the corresponding arcs cross. If this graph had more than ( t - 1 ) edges, it would contain a cycle, since it has ( t ) vertices; this cycle would correspond to a closed contour formed by black sub-arcs, lying inside the region under consideration. This contour would, in turn, define at least one yellow region, which is impossible. 6. **Summing Up**: Let ( t_i ) be the number of black arcs inside the ( i )-th white region. The total number of black arcs is (sum_i t_i = 2wb), they cross at (2 binom{b}{2} = b(b-1)) points. By the preceding argument,    [    b(b-1) leq sum_{i=1}^{w^2-w+2} (t_i - 1) = sum_{i=1}^{w^2-w+2} t_i - (w^2-w+2) = 2wb - (w^2-w+2).    ]    Equivalently,    [    (w - b)^2 ge w + b - 2 = n - 2,    ]    which is the case if and only if ( w - b leq lfloor sqrt{n-2} rfloor ). Consequently,    [    b ge w ge frac{n + lfloor sqrt{n-2} rfloor}{2},    ]    so there are at most ( 2(w-1) leq n + lfloor sqrt{n-2} rfloor - 2 ) yellow vertices on each circle, a contradiction. Therefore, if some circle contains at least 2061 yellow points, then the vertices of some region are all yellow.

This implies that ( p equiv 1 pmod{9} ). 2. **Objective**: Show that there exists an integer ( n ) such that ( p mid n^3 - 3n + 1 ). 3. **Step 1**: Since ( p equiv 1 pmod{9} ), we know that ( 9 mid (p - 1) ). This implies that ( p - 1 = 9m ) for some integer ( m ). 4. **Step 2**: Consider the finite field ( mathbb{F}_{p^2} ). Since ( p equiv 1 pmod{9} ), the multiplicative group ( mathbb{F}_{p^2}^* ) has order ( p^2 - 1 ).  5. **Step 3**: The order of ( mathbb{F}_{p^2}^* ) is ( p^2 - 1 ). Since ( p equiv 1 pmod{9} ), we have ( p^2 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{9} ). Therefore, ( 9 mid (p^2 - 1) ). 6. **Step 4**: There exists an element ( t ) in ( mathbb{F}_{p^2} ) with order 9. This is because the order of the multiplicative group ( mathbb{F}_{p^2}^* ) is divisible by 9. 7. **Step 5**: Consider the element ( t + frac{1}{t} ) in ( mathbb{F}_p ). We need to show that ( t + frac{1}{t} ) satisfies the equation ( n^3 - 3n + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p} ). 8. **Step 6**: Compute ( left(t + frac{1}{t}right)^3 - 3left(t + frac{1}{t}right) + 1 ):    [    left(t + frac{1}{t}right)^3 = t^3 + 3t + frac{3}{t} + frac{1}{t^3}    ]    [    left(t + frac{1}{t}right)^3 - 3left(t + frac{1}{t}right) + 1 = t^3 + frac{1}{t^3} + 3left(t + frac{1}{t}right) - 3left(t + frac{1}{t}right) + 1    ]    [    = t^3 + frac{1}{t^3} + 1    ] 9. **Step 7**: Since ( t ) has order 9, ( t^9 = 1 ). Therefore, ( t^6 = frac{1}{t^3} ). Substitute ( t^6 = frac{1}{t^3} ) into the equation:    [    t^3 + frac{1}{t^3} + 1 = t^3 + t^6 + 1 = t^3 + frac{1}{t^3} + 1 = 0    ] 10. **Step 8**: Thus, ( left(t + frac{1}{t}right)^3 - 3left(t + frac{1}{t}right) + 1 = 0 ).

Let ( text{sum}(T) ) denote the sum of elements of a set ( T ) (if ( T ) is empty, then ( text{sum}(T) = 0 )). 2. **Prove that ( k = 2^m ) works:**    To show that all ( k = 2^m ) work, we take ( S = {3^1, 3^2, ldots, 3^m} cup {2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ldots} ). For any integer ( z > 3^{m+1000} ), the number ( z - text{sum}(T) ) can be written using powers of 2 in exactly one way for any subset ( T ) of ( S ). Thus, there are exactly ( 2^m ) ways to write ( z ) in terms of distinct elements in ( S ). 3. **Show that ( k ) must be a power of 2:**    - **Lemma 1:** If the problem condition holds with ( k ge 3 ), then ( S = F cup B ) where ( F ) is a finite set and ( B ) is a majorized infinite set.      - **Proof:** Suppose for all ( n ge N ), there are exactly ( k ) ways to write ( n ) in terms of distinct elements of ( S ). Let ( s_i ) be the ( i )-th smallest element in ( S ). Let ( t ) be the smallest integer such that ( s_t ge N ). We prove that we can take ( B = {s_t, s_{t+1}, s_{t+2}, ldots} ). Consider any ( i > j ge t ). The sum ( s_i + s_j ) can be written in exactly ( k ) ways. However, ( s_j ) can be written in exactly ( k ) ways, so all ways to write ( s_i + s_j ) must contain the element ( s_i ). On the other hand, consider the ( k ) ways to write ( s_i ). Suppose there is a way to write ( s_i = s_{i_1} + s_{i_2} + ldots + s_{i_p} ) where ( i_1 > i_2 > ldots > i_p ) with ( p ge 2 ) and all indices are not equal to ( j ). Then, ( s_i + s_j = s_j + s_{i_1} + s_{i_2} + ldots + s_{i_p} ) is a way to write ( s_i + s_j ) in terms of distinct elements in ( S ) without ( s_i ), a contradiction. Thus, ( s_j ) must appear in any sum representation of ( s_i ) with ( ge 2 ) elements for all ( t le j < i ). Hence, ( s_i = s_{i-1} + s_{i-2} + ldots + s_t + X ) for some ( X ). Note that ( X > 0 ) since we require at least two ways to write ( X ) in terms of distinct elements in ( S ) since ( k ge 3 ). Thus, ( s_i > s_{i-1} + s_{i-2} + ldots + s_t ), proving that ( B ) is indeed majorized.    - **Lemma 2:** Let ( B ) be a majorized infinite set. Then, ( text{ways}(B, x) le 1 ) for all ( x ).      - **Proof:** Let ( B = {b_1, b_2, b_3, ldots} ) where ( b_i < b_{i+1} ) for all ( i ge 1 ). Clearly, ( text{ways}(B, x) le 1 ) for all ( x le b_1 ). Now, we prove the claim ( text{ways}(B, x) le 1 ) by strong induction. Suppose ( x ge b_1 ). Let ( i ) be the largest integer such that ( x ge b_i ). ( b_i ) must be included in the sum representation of ( x ), since otherwise ( b_{i-1} + b_{i-2} + ldots + b_1 < b_i le x ). Hence, ( text{ways}(B, x) = text{ways}(B, x - b_i) le 1 ) by the induction hypothesis.    - **Combining Lemmas:**      Let ( S = F cup B ) as in our lemma and let ( b_i ) be the ( i )-th smallest element of ( B ). Consider the infinite binary vector ( V = (v_1, v_2, ldots) ) where ( v_i = text{ways}(B, i) ). Denote ( text{gap}(i) ) as ( b_i - (b_1 + b_2 + ldots + b_{i-1}) > 0 ) since ( B ) is majorized. Now, we observe that our vector ( V ) takes a special form.      - **Lemma 3:** Define ( W_n ) as the vector obtained by removing the first ( n ) elements of ( V ). Let ( N ) be a fixed positive integer. Then, for any prefix ( W ) of ( V ), there exists an integer ( N' > N ) such that ( W ) appears as a prefix of ( W_{N'} ).        - **Proof:** Let ( i ) be the minimum integer such that ( V_i ) contains ( W ) as a prefix. Then, for all ( j ge i ), ( V_j ) contains ( W ) as a prefix. Choose ( j ) such that the length of ( V_j ) is larger than ( N ). Note that by the recursive definition, ( V_{j+1} ) contains a copy of ( V_j ) as a substring starting from a position larger than ( N ). Thus, we can choose ( N' ) appropriately to remove a prefix from ( V_{j+1} ) (and thus ( V )) such that the starting position is the starting position of the second copy of ( V_j ) in ( V_{j+1} ).      - **Lemma 4:** For any integer ( l ), there exists a prefix of ( V ) with length ( ge l ) such that it can be written as the concatenation of ( W ), ( 1 ), and ( W ) where ( W ) is some binary vector containing ( 2^m - 1 ) ones for some ( m ge 0 ) (i.e., it is of the form ( (w_1, w_2, ldots, w_n, 1, w_1, w_2, ldots, w_n) ) and exactly ( 2^m - 1 ) of the ( w_i )s are ( 1 )s).        - **Proof:** Let ( N > l^{2020} + 2020 ). Consider the sequence ( text{gap}(N), text{gap}(N+1), text{gap}(N+2), ldots ). Since all the terms are positive integers, there must exist some ( j ge N ) such that ( text{gap}(j) le text{gap}(j+1) ). Now, we look at vector ( V_{j+1} ). It is the concatenation of ( V_j ), ( text{gap}(j+1) - 1 ) zeros, a 1 followed by ( V_j ). We focus on the prefix which is the concatenation of ( V_j ) and ( text{gap}(j+1) - 1 ) zeros, which can be rewritten as the concatenation of ( V_{j-1} ), ( text{gap}(j) - 1 ) zeros, a 1, ( V_{j-1} ), and ( text{gap}(j+1) - 1 ) zeros. Since ( text{gap}(j) le text{gap}(j+1) ), choosing ( W ) as the concatenation of ( V_{j-1} ) and ( text{gap}(j) - 1 ) zeros works, since ( V_{j-1} ) contains exactly ( 2^{j-1} - 1 ) ones as noted before.      Combining Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, for any ( N ), we can find a substring ( V' ) of our vector ( V ) of the form ( (v_s, v_{s+1}, v_{s+2}, ldots, v_{s+m-1}, v_{s+m}, v_{s+m+1}, ldots, v_{s+2m}) ) where ( s > N ) and ( m ge text{sum}(F) + 2020 ) such that ( v_i = v_{i+m+1} ) for all ( s le i le s+m-1 ), ( v_{s+m} = 1 ), and any substring of length ( m+1 ) in ( V' ) contains exactly ( 2^x ) ones for some integer ( x ) (follows from the fact that the first ( m+1 ) elements contain exactly ( 2^x ) ones and ( v_i = v_{i+m+1} )).      In particular, choose ( N ) such that all integers ( ge N ) can be written as distinct elements of ( S ) in exactly ( k ) ways. Note that ( s+m ge N ), so ( s+m+i ) has exactly ( k ) sum representations in ( S ) for all ( 0 le i le m ). We will count the total number of sum representations of ( s+m ), ( s+m+1 ), ldots, ( s+2m ) in ( S ) in two ways. Obviously, this sum is equal to ( (m+1)k ).      On the other hand, let ( G = (text{ways}(F, m), text{ways}(F, m-1), text{ways}(F, m-2), ldots, text{ways}(F, 0)) ). Observe that as ( m > text{sum}(F) ), the sum of elements in ( G ) is exactly ( 2^{|F|} ). Observe that by fixing the elements to use in ( F ), we find that the number of sum representations of ( s+m+i ) in ( S ) is (sum_{j=0}^{m} text{ways}(F, m-j) v_{s+i+j} ). Observe that this is equivalent to the dot product of ( G ) and a substring of length ( m+1 ) of ( V' ). Summing this value over all ( 0 le i le m ) and using the fact that ( V' ) is periodic with period ( m+1 ), we obtain      [      sum_{i=0}^{m} sum_{j=0}^{m} text{ways}(F, m-j) v_{s+i+j} = sum_{j=0}^{m} text{ways}(F, m-j) sum_{i=0}^{m} v_{s+i+j} = 2^{|F|} cdot sum_{i=0}^{m} v_{s+i} = 2^{|F|+x}.      ]      Hence, ( (m+1)k = 2^{|F|+x} ), which means that ( k ) divides a power of 2. Thus, ( k ) must be a power of 2, as desired. The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 2^m } ) for all integers ( m ge 0 )."},{"instruction":"Given a polynomial in terms of x, 4x^{2}3x+52mx^{2}x+1 simplifies to not contain the term x^{2}.

Given y=frac{2x-1}{x+2}, we apply the quotient rule for differentiation, which states that if y=frac{u}{v}, then y'=frac{u'v-uv'}{v^2}. Here, u=2x-1 and v=x+2, so u'=2 and v'=1.

Prove that there are at most finitely many integers n for which  a n^{2} + b quad text { and } quad a (n+1)^{2} + b  are both perfect squares.","output":"We are given two quadratic expressions involving positive integers a and b, and we need to prove that there are only finitely many integers n for which both ( a n^{2}+b ) and ( a(n+1)^{2}+b ) are perfect squares.  Step-by-Step Solution 1. **Assume Form of Perfect Squares:**    Suppose for integer n, there exist integers x and y such that:    [    a n^2 + b = x^2 quad text{and} quad a(n+1)^2 + b = y^2    ] 2. **Calculate the Difference:**    Calculate the difference between the two given quadratic expressions:    [    a(n+1)^2 + b - (a n^2 + b) = y^2 - x^2    ]    Simplifying this, we get:    [    a(n^2 + 2n + 1) + b - a n^2 - b = y^2 - x^2 implies 2an + a = y^2 - x^2    ] 3. **Substitute Difference into Equation:**    Using the difference of squares, plug the result back into the original expressions:    [    2an + a = (y - x)(y + x)    ] 4. **Relate to Polynomial Equation:**    Rearrange and isolate terms involving y and x. Note that:    [    4a(an + a) = y^4 - 2x^2y^2 + x^4 - 2a(x^2 + y^2) + a^2 + 4ab    ]    This expression arises from squaring and simplifying the original equations. 5. **Split into Quadratic Forms:**    Introduce intermediary variables q_1 and q_2 for factorization:    [    a - (x - y)^2 = q_1, quad (x + y)^2 - a = q_2 quad text{where} quad q_1 q_2 = 4ab    ] 6. **Finite Integer Solutions:**    Because q_1 q_2 = 4 ab, the finite number of factorizations of this product of integers implies finitely many solutions. Specifically, for each factor pair, there may only be finitely many x and y satisfying the intermediary variables, resulting in finitely many possible n values. # Generalization and Conclusion: Furthermore, if the polynomial a x^2 + b x + c does not factor into the square of a linear polynomial, the manipulation similarly shows that x and y taking integer values implies a finite set of solutions for n.

If (a_n < 0), then ((2 - a_n)a_{n+1} = 1) would imply (a_{n+1}) is negative, which contradicts the requirement for (a_{n+1}) to be positive. Therefore, (a_n > 0) for all (n). 2. **Rewriting the recurrence relation:**    We start with the given recurrence relation:    [    (2 - a_n)a_{n+1} = 1    ]    Solving for (a_{n+1}), we get:    [    a_{n+1} = frac{1}{2 - a_n}    ] 3. **Monotonicity:**    To show that ({a_n}) is monotonically increasing, we need to show that (a_{n+1} geq a_n). Consider:    [    a_{n+1} - a_n = frac{1}{2 - a_n} - a_n    ]    We need to show that this expression is non-negative. Using the AM-GM inequality, we have:    [    frac{1}{2 - a_n} + a_n geq 2sqrt{frac{a_n}{2 - a_n}}    ]    Since (a_n) is positive and less than 2, the right-hand side is always positive, ensuring that (a_{n+1} geq a_n). Thus, ({a_n}) is monotonically increasing. 4. **Boundedness:**    Next, we show that (a_n) is bounded above by 2. Suppose (a_n geq 2). Then:    [    a_{n+1} = frac{1}{2 - a_n}    ]    If (a_n geq 2), then (2 - a_n leq 0), making (a_{n+1}) undefined or negative, which contradicts the positivity of (a_{n+1}). Therefore, (a_n < 2). 5. **Convergence:**    Since ({a_n}) is monotonically increasing and bounded above, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, ({a_n}) must converge. Let:    [    lim_{n to infty} a_n = ell    ]    Taking the limit on both sides of the recurrence relation, we get:    [    lim_{n to infty} a_{n+1} = lim_{n to infty} frac{1}{2 - a_n} = frac{1}{2 - ell}    ]    Since (a_n) converges to (ell), we have:    [    ell = frac{1}{2 - ell}    ]    Solving for (ell), we get:    [    ell(2 - ell) = 1 implies 2ell - ell^2 = 1 implies ell^2 - 2ell + 1 = 0 implies (ell - 1)^2 = 0 implies ell = 1    ] Therefore, (lim_{n to infty} a_n = 1).

Speed is distance over time, and since we're comparing the same time frame for both the hen and the duck, we can compare the distances they cover in their respective leaps directly.
