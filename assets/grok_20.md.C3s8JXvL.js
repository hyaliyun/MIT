Вот как изменение размера пакета с 32 на 64 может повлиять на обучение: 1. **Увеличение размера пакета**: - **Преимущества**: Увеличение размера пакета (например, с 32 на 64) может ускорить процесс обучения, поскольку большие пакеты могут обрабатывать больше данных за один проход через модель. Это может увеличить скорость обучения, особенно на устройствах с мощным аппаратным обеспечением. - **Недостатки**: Увеличение размера пакета может требовать больше памяти GPU или CPU, что может привести к ограничениям по памяти на вашем оборудовании. Большие пакеты также могут замедлить обучение на устройствах с ограниченным ресурсами. 2. **Влияние на стабильность обучения**: - Большие пакеты (например, 64) могут привести к более стабильному обновлению весов модели (меньше \\"шума\\" в градиентах), что в конечном итоге может поддержать более стабильное обучение, особенно при использовании методов оптимизации, таких как SGD. 3. **Влияние на обобщающую способность модели**: - Изменение размера пакета может также повлиять на способность модели к обобщению. Например, использование больших размеров пакетов может уменьшить способность модели к обобщению (возможно, немного переобучив модель). Итак, если вы увеличит-те размер пакета с 32 до 64, будете это делать на свой страх и риск. Вам может понадобиться провести несколько экспериментов с разными размерами пакетов, чтобы определить оптимальный размер пакета для вашей конкретной задачи и условий обучения."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

This instability in the atomic nucleus comes from an imbalance in the number of protons and neutrons, which disrupts the nuclear forces holding the nucleus together. To reach a more stable state, these isotopes undergo radioactive decay, transforming into other elements or isotopes of the same element but with a different number of neutrons. The process of decay continues until a stable isotope is formed. Radioactive decay occurs in several ways, including alpha decay (emission of alpha particles), beta decay (transformation of a neutron into a proton or vice versa, accompanied by the emission of a beta particle), and gamma decay (emission of high-energy photons). Each unstable isotope has a characteristic half-life, which is the time required for half of the atoms in a given sample to decay. Half-lives can range from fractions of a second to billions of years, depending on the isotope. Unstable isotopes have a variety of applications across different fields: - In medicine, they are used in diagnostic imaging and cancer treatment, for example, radioactive iodine (I-131) in thyroid disease treatment. - In archaeology and geology, carbon-14 dating is used to determine the age of organic materials. - In environmental science, isotopes help trace the sources of pollutants and study climate change effects. - In industry, they are used for inspecting welding seams, controlling thickness of materials, and sterilizing medical equipment.

If the OS will be Linux or Windows? To have the executable run via wine on Linux as well as simply on Windows. Also, the output should be broadcast asynchronously","output":"Running an executable multiple times without opening the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux) window, and interpreting the output in a custom manner using Python, involves utilizing Python's \`subprocess\` module for executing the command and controlling its input/output streams. To achieve asynchronous execution and compatibility across platforms (Linux with Wine for Windows executables and native Windows), the solution involves some nuances. Here’s a guide on how to achieve this: # Cross-platform Execution 1. **On Windows**: You will run the executable directly. 2. **On Linux**: If the executable is a Windows binary, you'll use Wine to run it. # Prerequisites: - **Linux**: Ensure \`wine\` is installed. - **Both Platforms**: Python installed. # Python Script Example: This example demonstrates how to run the executable, capture its output, and use it asynchronously. It uses \`asyncio\` for asynchronous operations and \`subprocess\` to run the commands. \`\`\`python import asyncio import sys import os async def run_executable(executable_path, args=[]): if sys.platform == \\"win32\\": cmd = [executable_path] + args else: # Prepends wine to the command if not on Windows. cmd = [\\"wine\\", executable_path] + args # Running the executable without opening a terminal window proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec( *cmd, # Capture output and error stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE, stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE) stdout, stderr = await proc.communicate() if proc.returncode == 0: print(f'[{executable_path}]: Success') return stdout else: print(f'[{executable_path}]: Failed with error: {stderr.decode()}') return stderr async def main(): executable = \\"path/to/your/executable.exe\\" # Example running the executable 3 times with different arguments tasks = [ run_executable(executable, [\\"arg1\\", \\"arg2\\"]), run_executable(executable, [\\"arg3\\", \\"arg4\\"]), run_executable(executable, [\\"arg5\\", \\"arg6\\"]), ] results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks) for result in results: # Interpret the output in your way custom_output_handler(result.decode()) def custom_output_handler(output): # Define how you want to handle/interpret the output here print(output) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` This script demonstrates running an executable with different arguments three times asynchronously. \`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec\` is used for non-blocking execution, and the output is handled in a custom function (\`custom_output_handler\`). # Execution without opening CMD/Terminal windows: - **Windows**: The script above does not open a CMD window since it runs the processes in the background. - **Linux**: Running commands through \`asyncio\` and \`subprocess\` with Wine does not open a terminal window. # Note: - Ensure the paths and arguments are correctly set according to your specific requirements. - The script must be modified if the executable requires interactive input. - The error handling is basic and might need to be expanded based on the executable's possible error outputs and behaviors."},{"instruction":"When running an executable file the argument to the path to the .txt configuration is used. is it possible to apply the config without editing its text variant each time the same file is run. PROHIBITED: EDIT CONFIG, BUT THE SETTINGS MUST BE APPLIED TO THE EXECUTABLE FILE.","output":"If you have an application that requires a configuration file (e.g., \`config.txt\`), but you're constrained from modifying the file itself while still needing to apply different settings each time the application runs, you have a few strategies at your disposal. These methods revolve around manipulating the environment in which the executable runs to control its configuration without directly editing the configuration file. Here are some strategies, with a focus on a Python-based solution for generality and cross-platform capability: # 1. Temporarily Replace the Configuration File You can temporarily swap the configuration file with another one just for the duration of the executable's run. This approach involves: 1. **Backing up** the original configuration file. 2. **Replacing** it with your custom configuration file. 3. **Running** the executable. 4. **Restoring** the original configuration after execution. This approach doesn't \\"edit\\" the original configuration but uses different configurations when needed. # 2. Manipulate the Filesystem If the executable looks for its configuration file in a default directory or via a specific path, you can use filesystem links (symbolic or hard links) to point to different configuration files based on your needs. This approach will depend on the operating system's capabilities: - **Windows:** Use \`mklink\` to create symbolic links. - **Linux/Unix:** Use \`ln -s\` for symbolic links. # 3. Use Virtual File Systems or Containerization For advanced uses, especially on Linux, you can leverage virtual file systems (VFS) or containerization technologies (like Docker) to mount a different configuration file at the path the application expects. This method is more complex but very powerful: - **Containers** can encapsulate the entire runtime environment, including specific configuration files, without affecting the host system's state. # 4. Modify the Application Environment Some applications select configuration files based on environment variables. If your application supports it, you can change an environment variable to point to a different configuration path before launching the application. # Python Example for Approach 1: Here is a simplified Python script demonstrating the first strategy with backup and replace: \`\`\`python import os import shutil import subprocess import sys def run_executable_with_temp_config(executable_path, original_config_path, temp_config_path): # Ensure paths are absolute original_config_path = os.path.abspath(original_config_path) temp_config_path = os.path.abspath(temp_config_path) # Backup original configuration config_backup_path = original_config_path + \\".backup\\" shutil.copy2(original_config_path, config_backup_path) try: # Replace the original config with temporary one shutil.copy2(temp_config_path, original_config_path) # Run the executable (modify for Linux/Windows compatibility if needed) if sys.platform == \\"win32\\": subprocess.run([executable_path], check=True) else: # Example: Using wine on Linux subprocess.run([\\"wine\\", executable_path], check=True) finally: # Restore the original configuration, no matter what shutil.move(config_backup_path, original_config_path) # Usage example executable = \\"path/to/your/application.exe\\" original_config = \\"path/to/original/config.txt\\" temporary_config = \\"path/to/temporary/config.txt\\" run_executable_with_temp_config(executable, original_config, temporary_config) \`\`\` # Considerations: - **Permissions:** Ensure you have the correct filesystem permissions to create/remove/replace files. - **Race Conditions:** Be cautious in environments where the application might run concurrently with other instances or where multiple users are involved. - **Security:** Be aware of the security implications, especially when handling executable paths and temporary files. This Python script demonstrates temporarily replacing a configuration file, but remember, it's crucial to adapt the script to handle any specific requirements or error handling your use case might demand."},{"instruction":"Implement the function to send a command to a specific window, since the executable is a console","output":"For Windows environments, sending a command to a specific console window (for example, an application console that's already running) can be particularly challenging due to the nature of how console input/output is handled. However, this can be addressed using the Windows API. We can leverage Python libraries such as \`pywinauto\` or \`ctypes\` to interact with these APIs. The task involves finding the window of the executable console and then sending keystrokes or commands to that window. This example will guide you through a method using \`pywinauto\`, a powerful library for automating Windows GUIs, which can also be used to interact with console applications. First, ensure you have \`pywinauto\` installed, or install it via pip: \`\`\` pip install pywinauto \`\`\` Here's how to use \`pywinauto\` to find a console window by its title and send a command to it: \`\`\`python from pywinauto import application import time def send_command_to_console(title, command): # Connect to the application by its window title try: app = application.Application().connect(title=title) dlg = app.window(title=title) # Make sure the window is active before sending keys. dlg.set_focus() # Sending command. Note: 'n' is used to simulate pressing ENTER key. dlg.type_keys(command + \\"n\\", with_spaces=True) except Exception as e: print(f\\"An error occurred: {e}\\") # Example usage console_title = \\"Your Console Title\\" command_to_send = \\"echo Hello, world!\\" send_command_to_console(console_title, command_to_send) \`\`\` # Points to consider: 1. **Title Matching**: Ensure the title you provide matches exactly with your console window's title. Pywinauto can also match using partial titles or regular expressions if exact titles are hard to maintain. 2. **Command Sending**: The \`type_keys\` method is used to simulate keyboard inputs. It’s effective for most console applications but might not work in every case depending on how the application processes input. 3. **Administrator Privileges**: In some cases, especially when interacting with system-level consoles or consoles running with elevated privileges, your Python script might also need to be run as an administrator. # Alternative Approaches: - **\`ctypes\` with Windows API**: For lower-level control or more specific use cases not supported by \`pywinauto\`, you might directly use the \`ctypes\` module to call Windows API functions. This requires a deeper understanding of the Windows API. - **Subprocess Interaction**: If you're starting the console application from Python, you can interact with it directly via \`subprocess.Popen\` and communicate with its stdin/stdout. This does not work for attaching to an already running console. # Limitations and Considerations: - This method primarily works on Windows due to the use of Windows-specific libraries and APIs. - The effectiveness of sending commands can vary based on the application's input handling and whether it reads from the standard input buffer in an expected manner. - Consider the security implications of sending commands to an application programmatically, especially if those commands come from user input or untrusted sources. It is essential to test thoroughly and consider alternative strategies if this approach does not meet all requirements for interacting with your specific console application."},{"instruction":"comment mettre en place une barre de recherche en respectant l'architecture, je veux que la barre de recherche actualise ce qui se trouve sur ma page donc en fonction de l'url (personnages, armes, armures) actualise en direct les élements sur la page, a noter que je souhaite aussi qu'un sous menu apparaisse sous la barre de recherche avec le résultat des recherches pour tout type d'objets : // Instantiate API import PersonnagesProvider from \\"../../services/PersonnagesProvider.js\\"; import FavoriteManager from '../../services/FavoriteManager.js'; // In Home.js export default class Home { async render() { let personnages = await PersonnagesProvider.FetchPersonnages(); let html = personnages .map( (personnage) => /*html*/ \` <div class=\\"col\\"> <div class=\\"card shadow-sm\\"> <svg class=\\"bd-placeholder-img card-img-top\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"225\\" xmlns=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\" role=\\"img\\" aria-label=\\"Placeholder: Thumbnail\\" preserveAspectRatio=\\"xMidYMid slice\\" focusable=\\"false\\"><title>Placeholder</title><rect width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" fill=\\"#55595c\\"/><text x=\\"50%\\" y=\\"50%\\" fill=\\"#eceeef\\" dy=\\".3em\\">{personnage.nom}</text></svg> <div class=\\"card-body\\"> <p class=\\"card-text\\">{personnage.nom}</p> <p>Force: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.force}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.force}/500</p> <p>Dextérité: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.dextérité}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.dextérité}/500</p> <p>Intelligence: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.intelligence}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.intelligence}/500</p> <p>Santé: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.santé}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.santé}/500</p> <p>Mana: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.mana}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.mana}/500</p> <p>Defense: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.defense}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.defense}/500</p> <div class=\\"d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\\"> <div class=\\"btn-group\\"> <a href=\\"#/personnage/{personnage.id}\\" class=\\"btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary\\">+ détail sur {personnage.nom}</a> </div> <small class=\\"text-body-secondary\\">{personnage.id}</small> <a id=\\"favori-{personnage.id}\\" onclick=\\"FavoriteManager.toggleFavorites('{personnage.id}');\\"> {FavoriteManager.isFavorite(personnage.id) ?

Ce guide utilise des concepts de JavaScript moderne, la programmation asynchrone avec \`async/await\` et les fetch API pour les requêtes HTTP. # 1. Création d'un composant de barre de recherche Tout d'abord, vous devez créer un composant \`SearchBar\` qui sera responsable de prendre l'entrée de l'utilisateur et d'afficher les résultats correspondants. \`\`\`javascript // Dans src/components/SearchBar.js export default class SearchBar { constructor() { this.element = document.createElement(\\"div\\"); this.element.className = \\"search-bar\\"; } onSearch = async (query) => { // Ici, vous pouvez appeler une fonction de recherche ou faire une requête API en fonction de \`query\` console.log(\`Recherche pour: {query}\`); // Vous devez remplacer ceci par la logique de recherche réelle pour vos personnages, armes, etc. }; render() { this.element.innerHTML = /*html*/\` <input type=\\"text\\" placeholder=\\"Recherche...\\" oninput=\\"this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('search', {detail: this.value}))\\"> <div class=\\"search-results\\" style=\\"display:none;\\"></div> \`; this.element.querySelector(\\"input\\").addEventListener(\\"search\\", (event) => { this.onSearch(event.detail); // Afficher les résultats dans .search-results }); return this.element; } } \`\`\` # 2. Intégration de la barre de recherche dans votre page Dans votre fichier \`Home.js\` ou toute autre page où vous souhaitez inclure la barre de recherche, instanciez et affichez le composant \`SearchBar\`. \`\`\`javascript import SearchBar from \\"../components/SearchBar.js\\"; export default class Home { async render() { // Votre code existant const searchBar = new SearchBar(); // Attacher la barre de recherche à un élément spécifique ou au début de la page document.body.prepend(searchBar.render()); // Ajoutez votre logique pour appeler la fonction \`onSearch\` du searchBar avec la requête } } \`\`\` # 3. Mettre en place la logique de recherche Dans la méthode \`onSearch\` du composant \`SearchBar\`, vous devrez implémenter la logique qui prend la requête de recherche, appelle votre backend (ou recherche dans les données localement disponibles si elles sont chargées dans le navigateur) pour les personnages, armes, armures, etc. correspondants et affiche les résultats dans le sous-menu (\`.search-results\`). # 4. Gérer la mise à jour de l'URL Pour que la recherche puisse actualiser le contenu de la page en fonction de l'URL, vous pourriez utiliser la \`pushState\` de l'API History pour mettre à jour l'URL sans recharger la page, puis écouter les changements d'URL (par exemple, avec \`window.addEventListener('popstate', handler)\`), pour actualiser le contenu de la page en conséquence. # 5. Afficher les résultats de recherche Quand des résultats sont disponibles après une recherche, vous devriez les insérer dans le sous-menu \`.search-results\`. Cela peut impliquer de rendre cet élément visible et de remplir son contenu avec les données de recherche formatées, typiquement sous forme de liste. N'oubliez pas de faire le lien entre chaque résultat de recherche et son contenu détaillé. Par exemple, cliquer sur un résultat de personnage pourrait mettre à jour l'URL pour naviguer vers la page de ce personnage précis. C'est un processus assez impliqué et peut nécessiter des ajustements spécifiques à votre projet, en particulier en ce qui concerne la connexion entre le component \`SearchBar\`, votre logique de routage et la récupération / affichage des données recherchées."},{"instruction":"j'ai décomposé avec dossier models, services, views","output":"Avec votre projet structuré en dossiers \`models\`, \`services\`, et \`views\`, vous pouvez appliquer l'architecture MVC (Modèle-Vue-Contrôleur) pour organiser votre code plus efficacement, particulièrement pour la mise en place d'une barre de recherche dynamique.

The world of art, with its vast traditions, techniques, and emotions, is a realm that machines can mimic but never truly replicate. The genuine touch of an artist, the personal experiences that influence their work, and the years of honed skill and emotion they pour into each piece are unparalleled.My goal in creating this guide is to empower individuals and publishers who may be operating with limited resources. For small teams or independent creators, sometimes all that’s needed is a fitting visual accompaniment to elevate their written content or event page.In such scenarios, tools that generate images act as a bridge, offering a quick solution to a common challenge. Think of it as having a customizable stock image generator at your fingertips, allowing you to craft that ideal featured image for a blog post or event within minutes.It’s crucial to understand that while these tools offer convenience, they aren’t a replacement for the artistry and expertise that professionals bring to the table. Nobody should be under the illusion of receiving accolades or recognition for merely generating an image via these platforms.I view these generated images as a canvas for further enhancement. When paired with advanced editing tools like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Canva, and others, the possibilities are endless. For example, while DALL-E 3 is much better at generating specifics and even accurate text (occasionally), it doesn’t always get it right.In the example below, I took the image that DALL-E 3 generated, brought it into Adobe Photoshop, and replaced the garbled generated text with actual words and phrases.Left: DALL-E 3 generated image. Right: The final result after some editing in Adobe Photoshop.Ultimately, this guide should be seen as a stepping stone — a starting point to help you get beyond the blank canvas — aiming to introduce and inspire curious creatives to new tools that can broaden their horizons in the world of graphics and illustrations.More about this style galleryEach art style in this guide is accompanied by a description, providing insights into its essence and characteristics, and a series of useful keywords to augment your initial prompts. To aid users in creating visuals using DALL-E 3, specific prompts and keywords have been crafted for each style.You can access Midjourney through the Discord app (with a paid account), and you can access DALL-E via ChatGPT Plus (paid account) or for free at bing.com/create.When using this guide, it’s essential to approach it with an experimental mindset. DALL-E 3’s strength lies in its ability to interpret prompts in novel ways, so don’t hesitate to be creative with your inputs. Whether you’re looking to produce a traditional piece reminiscent of the Renaissance or dive into the pixelated realms of Digital Art, I hope this guide will be your compass, pointing you in the right direction on your creative journey.These prompts should serve as a starting point, and I encourage users to tweak them, add their personal touch, or even combine styles to produce unique and bespoke illustrations. I plan to continue adding examples, styles, and techniques to the guide as I come across them.⭐ Click here or click the image below to view the full gallery for free.Click the image to view the full gallery.⚡ Click here to view the gallery version and click here to view the spreadsheet version.A few tips + tricks to get the most out of DALL-E 3Use descriptive prompts: Be as detailed and descriptive as possible in your prompts.

éléments sur la page en fonction de l'URL (personnages, armes, armures) et qui montre un sous-menu avec les résultats pour tout type d'objets, voici une approche structurée en plusieurs étapes : # 1. Création de la barre de recherche Commencez par ajouter la structure HTML de la barre de recherche et du sous-menu à votre page (typiquement dans \`Home.js\` ou un composant différent si vous gérez la barre de recherche globalement) : \`\`\`html <div class=\\"search-container\\"> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"searchInput\\" placeholder=\\"Recherche...\\"> <div id=\\"searchResultsContainer\\" class=\\"search-results-container\\"></div> </div> \`\`\` # 2. Écoute des événements du champ de recherche Dans votre script (par exemple à la fin de votre méthode \`render\` dans \`Home.js\`), ajoutez un écouteur d'événement sur le champ de recherche : \`\`\`javascript document.getElementById('searchInput').addEventListener('input', (event) => { const searchTerm = event.target.value.trim(); if (searchTerm.length > 0) { search(searchTerm); // Fonction à définir pour la recherche. } else { clearSearchResults(); // Fonction pour nettoyer les résultats de recherche. } }); \`\`\` # 3. Implémentation de la fonction de recherche La fonction \`search\` devrait être capable de consulter vos données (personnages, armes, armures, etc.), de filtrer en fonction du terme de la recherche, et d'afficher les résultats dans le sous-menu. À titre d'exemple, voici une approche simplifiée pour les personnages : \`\`\`javascript async function search(searchTerm) { let personnages = await PersonnagesProvider.FetchPersonnages(); let filteredResults = personnages.filter(personnage => personnage.nom.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())); displaySearchResults(filteredResults); } \`\`\` # 4. Afficher les résultats dans le sous-menu La fonction \`displaySearchResults\` devrait prendre les résultats filtrés et les afficher sous la barre de recherche : \`\`\`javascript function displaySearchResults(results) { const container = document.getElementById('searchResultsContainer'); container.innerHTML = ''; // Nettoyage des résultats précédents. results.forEach(result => { const resultElement = document.createElement('div'); resultElement.textContent = result.nom; // Ou autre format selon le besoin. container.appendChild(resultElement); }); } \`\`\` # 5. Nettoyage des résultats de recherche La fonction \`clearSearchResults\` sera appelée pour effacer les résultats précédents : \`\`\`javascript function clearSearchResults() { document.getElementById('searchResultsContainer').innerHTML = ''; } \`\`\` # 6. Gestion des clics sur les résultats Vous pouvez ajouter des écouteurs d'événements \`click\` sur chaque élément des résultats pour diriger les utilisateurs vers la page ou l'URL correspondante, peut-être en modifiant l'URL actuelle ou en affichant plus de détails sur ce qu'ils ont choisi. # 7. Bonus : Améliorations possibles - **Debouncing :** Ajouter du debouncing sur la recherche pour limiter les appels. - **Highlighting :** Mettre en évidence le terme de recherche dans les résultats. - **Types de résultats :** Ajoutez des onglets ou des indicateurs de section dans le sous-menu de résultats pour différencier les personnages, les armes, et les armures. Ce guide vous fournit les étapes de base pour intégrer une barre de recherche dynamique. Vous devrez bien sûr l'adapter à la structure précise et aux besoins de votre projet."},{"instruction":"cela veut dire que je vais devoir mettre le search container a chaque page, y-a t-il moyen de faire en sorte de pas répéter tout le code a chaque fois (et également pour la navbar) dans le but d'avoir du code bien strcuturée dans les views ?// Instantiate API import PersonnagesProvider from \\"../../services/PersonnagesProvider.js\\"; import FavoriteManager from '../../services/FavoriteManager.js'; // In Home.js export default class Home { async render() { let personnages = await PersonnagesProvider.FetchPersonnages(); let html = personnages .map( (personnage) => /*html*/ \` <div class=\\"col\\"> <div class=\\"card shadow-sm\\"> <svg class=\\"bd-placeholder-img card-img-top\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"225\\" xmlns=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\" role=\\"img\\" aria-label=\\"Placeholder: Thumbnail\\" preserveAspectRatio=\\"xMidYMid slice\\" focusable=\\"false\\"><title>Placeholder</title><rect width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" fill=\\"#55595c\\"/><text x=\\"50%\\" y=\\"50%\\" fill=\\"#eceeef\\" dy=\\".3em\\">{personnage.nom}</text></svg> <div class=\\"card-body\\"> <p class=\\"card-text\\">{personnage.nom}</p> <p>Force: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.force}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.force}/500</p> <p>Dextérité: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.dextérité}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.dextérité}/500</p> <p>Intelligence: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.intelligence}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.intelligence}/500</p> <p>Santé: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.santé}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.santé}/500</p> <p>Mana: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.mana}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.mana}/500</p> <p>Defense: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.defense}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.defense}/500</p> <div class=\\"d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\\"> <div class=\\"btn-group\\"> <a href=\\"#/personnage/{personnage.id}\\" class=\\"btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary\\">+ détail sur {personnage.nom}</a> </div> <small class=\\"text-body-secondary\\">{personnage.id}</small> <a id=\\"favori-{personnage.id}\\" onclick=\\"FavoriteManager.toggleFavorites('{personnage.id}');\\"> {FavoriteManager.isFavorite(personnage.id) ?

L'idée est d'isoler le code de la barre de recherche et de la navbar dans des modules séparés et de les inclure où vous en avez besoin. Voici comment vous pouvez le faire : # 1. Créer des modules pour les composants réutilisables Créez des fichiers séparés pour vos composants réutilisables. Par exemple, vous pouvez avoir \`SearchComponent.js\` et \`NavbarComponent.js\` : **SearchComponent.js** \`\`\`javascript export default class SearchComponent { static render() { return /*html*/\` <div class=\\"search-container\\"> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"searchInput\\" placeholder=\\"Recherche...\\"> <div id=\\"searchResultsContainer\\" class=\\"search-results-container\\"></div> </div> \`; } static afterRender() { // Ajoutez ici l'écouteur d'événements et toute autre logique nécessaire après le rendu du composant de recherche. } } \`\`\` **NavbarComponent.js** \`\`\`javascript export default class NavbarComponent { static render() { return /*html*/\` <nav> <ul> <div class=\\"left-part\\"> <li><a href=\\"/\\">Personnages</a></li> <li><a href=\\"#/armes\\">Armes</a></li> <li><a href=\\"#/armures\\">Armures</a></li> </div> <li>Mes favoris</li> </ul> <nav> \`; } // Ajoutez ici toute logique spécifique après le rendu si nécessaire. } \`\`\` # 2. Inclure et utiliser les composants dans vos vues Dans chaque vue où vous souhaitez inclure la barre de recherche et/ou la navbar, vous importez ces composants et les utilisez dans la méthode \`render\` de la vue. **Exemple dans Home.js:** \`\`\`javascript import NavbarComponent from \\"../components/NavbarComponent.js\\"; import SearchComponent from \\"../components/SearchComponent.js\\"; export default class Home { async render() { // Utilisez ici PersonnagesProvider pour obtenir vos données comme avant let navbar = NavbarComponent.render(); let searchbar = SearchComponent.render(); return /*html*/\` {navbar} {searchbar} <!-- Le reste de votre HTML spécifique à Home --> \`; } async afterRender(){ // Il s'agit d'une fonction que vous appellerez après le rendu de votre vue pour initialiser les écouteurs d'événements de vos composants. SearchComponent.afterRender(); } } \`\`\` **Note :** Assurez-vous d'appeler \`afterRender\` pour les composants qui nécessitent une initialisation après le rendu. Vous pouvez le faire dans une méthode \`afterRender\` des vues qui incluent ces composants, et assurez-vous que cette méthode est appelée après que le contenu de la vue soit ajouté au DOM. # 3.

Here's a simple and tasty recipe to make your own electrolyte drink at home: # Ingredients: - 4 cups (about 1 liter) of water (you can use coconut water for extra electrolytes and flavor) - 1/4 cup (about 60 ml) of lemon juice or lime juice (for taste and additional vitamins) - 1/4 teaspoon of Himalayan pink salt or sea salt (for sodium and trace minerals) - 2 tablespoons of natural sweetener (honey, maple syrup, or agave nectar are good natural options) - (Optional) 1/2 teaspoon of magnesium citrate powder or natural Calm supplement (for magnesium) # Instructions: 1. **Start with the Base**: Pour the 4 cups of water or coconut water into a large pitcher or bottle. 2. **Add Citrus Juice**: Squeeze the juice of 1-2 fresh lemons or limes into the water. Not only just for taste, these add Vitamin C and additional electrolytes. 3. **Mix in Sweetener**: Add your choice of natural sweetener. Start with 2 tablespoons, adjust to taste. Remember, the goal is light sweetness and effective hydration, not a sugary beverage. 4. **Add Salt**: Mix in the 1/4 teaspoon of Himalayan pink salt or high-quality sea salt. This provides sodium and other minerals. It may seem small, but it's a crucial component of homemade electrolyte solutions. 5. **(Optional) Add Magnesium**: If you're including magnesium for an extra electrolyte boost, add it now. This step is optional but can be beneficial, especially for athletes or those with magnesium deficiency. 6. **Stir Thoroughly**: Mix all ingredients until the salt and sweetener have completely dissolved. 7. **Taste Test**: Give it a taste and adjust any ingredient according to your preference. More sweetener if it’s too tart, or more lemon/lime juice if it’s too sweet. 8. **Chill & Serve**: Refrigerate until cool or add ice to serve immediately. Enjoy this hydrating, replenishing drink. # Tips: - Feel free to experiment with flavors by adding crushed mint leaves, ginger, or a splash of your favorite fruit juice. - Be mindful of the sweetener and salt. Adjust according to your dietary needs and preferences. - For those who are physically active or sweat a lot, having this drink post-workout can help restore lost electrolytes and improve recovery time. Remember, while this homemade electrolyte drink is beneficial for hydration and mineral replenishment, it is not a medical treatment. For severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, consult a healthcare professional."},{"instruction":"Can someone drink this electrolyte if they're experiencing diarrhoea","output":"Yes, an electrolyte drink can be beneficial for someone experiencing diarrhea, as diarrheal episodes can lead to significant fluid and electrolyte loss. Replacing these lost fluids and electrolytes is crucial for preventing dehydration and restoring the body's electrolyte balance. The homemade electrolyte solution described can help with hydration, but there are several points to consider for someone dealing with diarrhea: # Adaptations for Diarrhea: - **Sugar Content**: While natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup are beneficial under normal circumstances, during diarrhea, high sugar content can potentially exacerbate the condition by drawing more water into the intestines. Consider reducing the sweetener or using a sugar-free alternative if necessary. - **Salt Concentration**: The recipe's salt concentration helps replace lost sodium, which is crucial during episodes of diarrhea. However, ensure the concentration is not too high to avoid any potential negative effects. - **Gentle Flavors**: The stomach might be more sensitive during this time, so consider using milder flavors. Lemon or lime juice is generally okay, but if they’re irritating, using just coconut water (which is naturally rich in electrolytes) and a small amount of salt might be more tolerable. - **BRAT Diet Consideration**: Sometimes, sticking to the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) is recommended during diarrhea due to its bland nature. Incorporating an electrolyte solution can complement this diet by ensuring adequate hydration. # Important Considerations: 1. **Severity and Duration**: If the diarrhea is severe (e.g., very frequent episodes, signs of dehydration, lasting more than a couple of days), it’s important to seek medical attention. Children and the elderly are particularly at risk of dehydration. 2. **Electrolyte Products**: Over-the-counter oral rehydration solutions (ORS) like Pedialyte are specifically formulated with an optimal balance of sugars and electrolytes for conditions such as diarrhea, and might be more suitable than homemade recipes in some cases. 3. **Consult a Doctor**: Especially in the case of young children, the elderly, or if the condition persists or is severe, consulting a healthcare professional is crucial. They may recommend specific types of rehydration solutions or treatments. 4. **Warning Signs**: If you or someone experiencing diarrhea shows signs of severe dehydration (such as dizziness, confusion, very dark urine, or reduced urination), seek medical attention immediately. In summary, while a homemade electrolyte drink can be helpful for managing mild cases of diarrhea by promoting hydration and electrolyte balance, attention must be paid to the condition's severity and the individual's overall health. Adjustments to the recipe and medical consultation may be necessary depending on these factors."},{"instruction":"Got it","output":"I'm glad you found the information helpful! Remember, staying hydrated and maintaining electrolyte balance is crucial, especially during illness or after intense physical activity. If you have any more questions, whether they're about hydration strategies, dietary tips, or anything else, feel free to ask. Stay healthy and hydrated!"},{"instruction":"How to make a perfect and extremely delicious creme caramel?","output":"Creating the perfect and extremely delicious crème caramel (also known as flan) is about simplicity, precision, and using quality ingredients. This classic dessert combines silky smooth custard with a layer of amber-colored caramel. Follow this detailed recipe to make a crème caramel that will delight your taste buds. # Ingredients For the Caramel: - 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar - 1/4 cup (60ml) water For the Custard: - 4 large eggs - 2 cups (480ml) whole milk (or a combination of milk and cream for a richer custard) - 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (or 1 vanilla bean, scraped) # Instructions Prepare the Caramel: 1. **Prepare Ramekins**: Arrange 6 ramekins or a single larger baking dish in a deep roasting pan. The pan should be large enough to accommodate a water bath later. 2. **Cook the Sugar**: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 1 cup of sugar with 1/4 cup water. Stir until the sugar is mostly dissolved. 3. **Caramelize**: Continue cooking without stirring, but you can gently swirl the pan to ensure even caramelization. Cook until the sugar turns a deep amber color (about 5-7 minutes). Watch carefully to avoid burning the caramel. 4. **Pour into Ramekins**: Quickly and carefully pour the hot caramel into the bottom of each ramekin, swirling to coat the bottoms evenly. Set aside to cool and harden. Make the Custard: 1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). 2. **Warm Milk**: In a saucepan, gently warm the milk (and cream, if using) with the vanilla extract or vanilla bean until hot but not boiling. Remove from heat. 3. **Beat Eggs and Sugar**: In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and 1/2 cup sugar together until well mixed but not frothy. 4. **Combine**: Gradually whisk the warm milk into the egg mixture, taking care to pour slowly and mix gently to avoid creating too many air bubbles. 5. **Strain**: Strain the custard mixture through a fine sieve into a large measuring cup or pitcher. This step ensures a smooth texture. 6. **Pour Over Caramel**: Carefully pour the custard into the ramekins, over the hardened caramel. Bake with a Water Bath: 1. **Prepare Water Bath**: Boil a kettle of water. Place the roasting pan with the filled ramekins in the preheated oven. Carefully pour the hot water into the roasting pan until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins. 2. **Bake**: Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the custards are set around the edges but still slightly wobbly in the center. The baking time will depend on the size of your ramekins or baking dish. 3. **Cool and Chill**: Remove the ramekins from the water bath and let them cool to room temperature. Cover each ramekin with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight. To Serve: 1. **Unmold**: To serve, run a knife around the edge of each ramekin. Place a dessert plate upside down over the ramekin and quickly invert it, giving a slight shake if necessary. The crème caramel should drop onto the plate, with the caramel sauce flowing over. 2. **Enjoy**: Your crème caramel is now ready to be enjoyed. The beauty of crème caramel lies in its simplicity and the contrast between the slightly bitter caramel and the creamy custard. Enjoy the process, and feel proud to serve this classic dessert."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is renowned for its unique characters, intricate plots, and diverse settings that span various times and places. I'd love to hear more about the setting you've chosen for your manga. What time period does it take place in? Which locations have you decided on, and how do they influence the story? Are there any specific themes or elements from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure that inspired the setting of your manga? Please share more details."},{"instruction":"The setting takes place in 2012 in Japan, referred to as Realm 111 in the story. In this world, countries and cities are refferred to as realms and a number. Chromosomes are sort of like a elite currency, like the golden eagles from War Thunder. Some odd beings in this world are the Peace Lords. They aren't seen but are mentioned. They are a mysterious group of multidimensional beings who maintain peace within the universe.","output":"Your setting sounds fascinating and quite innovative, blending elements familiar to fans of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure with fresh concepts. Setting the story in 2012 Japan but with the twist of it being referred to as \\"Realm 111\\" instantly creates a sense of a parallel or alternate universe, which is a theme that can resonate well with the creative landscapes seen in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. This numerical system for countries and cities introduces a structured, perhaps dystopian or otherworldly hierarchy, which could add layers of intrigue and exploration to your story. The concept of chromosomes being used as an elite currency is particularly intriguing, as it introduces a biological aspect to societal status and wealth. This could allow for a range of narrative possibilities, including ethical dilemmas, the commodification of life, and perhaps even genetic engineering or manipulation themes. It’s reminiscent of how JoJo's uses unique sources of power and societal structures, but with a wholly original twist. The Peace Lords introduce an element of cosmic or supernatural oversight that feels very much in the spirit of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's larger-than-life stakes and entities with grand powers. However, your concept of them being multidimensional beings who are more heard of than seen adds a mysterious layer to the narrative, suggesting that their influence or interventions in the world could be pivotal to the plot, yet enigmatic and potentially morally ambiguous. For your manga, considering how rich and complex your setting is, you might want to think about the following: 1. **Character Development**: How do characters within Realm 111 interact with the unique aspects of your world? Are there rebels who oppose the Peace Lords or the societal norms? How do the unique elements of your world (like the chromosomes as currency) affect their goals, motivations, and growth? 2. **World-building Details**: Flesh out how the numerical realm system came to be and how realms are classified or distinguished from one another. Does the number have significance in terms of status, power, or resources? 3. **Peace Lords' Influence**: Though they aren't seen, their presence and decisions could serve as a critical plot device. You may explore how their decisions affect the realms, perhaps through prophecies, chosen ones, or indirect influence on events. 4. **Cultural and Social Commentary**: Your setting offers a ripe ground for exploring themes like the value of life, the nature of peace and who gets to define it, and the consequences of societal structures based on biological wealth. Drawing inspiration from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, you could also incorporate Stand-like abilities or other unique powers into your world, fitting with the chromosomal wealth theme—perhaps abilities are influenced or determined by one's genetic 'wealth.' Your manga has the potential to be a rich, thought-provoking narrative that explores complex themes through an adventurous, mysterious story. I'm eager to see how your setting and concepts evolve into a full-fledged story. Feel free to share more details or ask for advice as you continue to develop your project!"},{"instruction":"comment ne pas répéter ce code return /*html*/ \` <nav> <ul> <div class=\\"left-part\\"> <li><a href=\\"/\\">Personnages</a></li> <li><a href=\\"#/armes\\">Armes</a></li> <li><a href=\\"#/armures\\">Armures</a></li> </div> <li>Mes favoris</li> </ul> <nav> <div class=\\"row row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 row-cols-md-3 g-3\\"> {html} </div> \`; } sur tout les pages ou je veux une barre de navigation tout en gardant une conception clean ? // Instantiate API import PersonnagesProvider from \\"../../services/PersonnagesProvider.js\\"; import FavoriteManager from '../../services/FavoriteManager.js'; // In Home.js export default class Home { async render() { let personnages = await PersonnagesProvider.FetchPersonnages(); let html = personnages .map( (personnage) => /*html*/ \` <div class=\\"col\\"> <div class=\\"card shadow-sm\\"> <svg class=\\"bd-placeholder-img card-img-top\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"225\\" xmlns=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\" role=\\"img\\" aria-label=\\"Placeholder: Thumbnail\\" preserveAspectRatio=\\"xMidYMid slice\\" focusable=\\"false\\"><title>Placeholder</title><rect width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" fill=\\"#55595c\\"/><text x=\\"50%\\" y=\\"50%\\" fill=\\"#eceeef\\" dy=\\".3em\\">{personnage.nom}</text></svg> <div class=\\"card-body\\"> <p class=\\"card-text\\">{personnage.nom}</p> <p>Force: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.force}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.force}/500</p> <p>Dextérité: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.dextérité}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.dextérité}/500</p> <p>Intelligence: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.intelligence}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.intelligence}/500</p> <p>Santé: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.santé}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.santé}/500</p> <p>Mana: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.mana}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.mana}/500</p> <p>Defense: <progress value=\\"{personnage.statistiques.defense}\\" max=\\"500\\"></progress>{personnage.statistiques.defense}/500</p> <div class=\\"d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\\"> <div class=\\"btn-group\\"> <a href=\\"#/personnage/{personnage.id}\\" class=\\"btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary\\">+ détail sur {personnage.nom}</a> </div> <small class=\\"text-body-secondary\\">{personnage.id}</small> <a id=\\"favori-{personnage.id}\\" onclick=\\"FavoriteManager.toggleFavorites('{personnage.id}');\\"> {FavoriteManager.isFavorite(personnage.id) ?

Почему двуногое хождение, увеличение объема головного мозга, всеядное питание и стадный образ жизни расценивают как предпосылки возникновения человека?ASSISTANT: Двуногое хождение, увеличение объема головного мозга, всеядное питание и стадный образ жизни считаются ключевыми факторами в эволюции человека по нескольким причинам:<br/><br/>1. Двуногое хождение: Освобождение рук от необходимости использования для передвижения позволило нашим предкам использовать их для манипулирования предметами, что, в свою очередь, стимулировало развитие инструментальной деятельности и, как следствие, большего интеллекта. Кроме того, двуногое передвижение эффективно для движения по открытым пространствам, что стало актуальным при выходе из лесных зон.<br/><br/>2. Увеличение объема головного мозга: Это достижение эволюции обеспечило повышение когнитивных способностей, что позволило развивать сложные формы общения и социального поведения, создавать сложные инструменты, использовать символы и развивать культуру.<br/><br/>3. Всеядное питание: Гибкость в выборе пищи дала возможность приспособиться к различным экологическим нишам и переживать периоды скарцевания конкретных пищевых ресурсов. Это также могло способствовать развитию социального поведения и кооперативной охоты.<br/><br/>4. Стадный образ жизни: Живя в группах, ранние гоминиды могли лучше защищаться от хищников, эффективной охотиться и собирать пищу, а также заботиться о потомстве. Социальные взаимодействия стали основой для развития языка и культуры.<br/><br/>В целом, эти аспекты в совокупности создали условия, при которых повышение интеллекта и социальное поведение стали значительными эволюционными преимуществами, что в конечном итоге привело к возникновению Homo sapiens.USER: Ответь на вопрос. Какие этапы становления человека подтверждены палеонтологическими данными ? Каковы прогрессивные тенденции их развития ?ASSISTANT: Этапы становления человека, подтвержденные палеонтологическими данными, включают:<br/><br/>1. Австралопитеки (около 4-2 миллионов лет назад): Одни из самых ранних известных представителей человеческой линии, характеризующиеся уже двуногим передвижением, но по-прежнему небольшим объемом головного мозга по сравнению с современными людьми.<br/><br/>2. Род Homo, который включает виды, такие как Homo habilis (около 2,4-1,4 миллиона лет назад) и Homo erectus (около 1,9 миллиона - 143 тысяч лет назад). Эти виды демонстрируют увеличение объема мозга и более сложное использование каменных инструментов.<br/><br/>3. Появление Homo heidelbergensis (около 600-200 тысяч лет назад) и в дальнейшем возникновение неандертальцев (около 400-40 тысяч лет назад) и Homo sapiens (около 300 тысяч лет назад до настоящего времени). Эти виды имеют ещё более крупные мозги и развивают более софистицированные навыки, например, строительство жилья, использование огня, искусство и ритуалы.<br/><br/>Прогрессивные тенденции их развития включают:<br/><br/>1. Увеличение объема и сложности головного мозга, особенно в областях, отвечающих за мышление, планирование и коммуникацию.<br/><br/>2. Усовершенствование каменных инструментов и развитие технологий, включая контролируемое использование огня.<br/><br/>3. Изменения в структуре скелета, в том числе утончение костей и изменения в форме таза, свидетельствующие о более эффективном двуногом передвижении.<br/><br/>4. Питание: переход от вегетарианства к всеядности, повышение пищевой гибкости, что способствовало выживанию в различных окружающих условиях.<br/><br/>5. Социальные аспекты: развитие языка, создание социальных структур, развитие искусства и ритуалов.<br/><br/>Эти аспекты в целом отражают эволюционный прогресс, в результате которого люди стали высоко социальными, интеллектуальными существами, способными к культурному разнообразию и технологическим инновациям.USER: Ответь на вопрос. На основании каких признаков можно предположить, что неандертальцы в эволюционном плане занимали более высокое положение , чем питекантропы?ASSISTANT: Неандертальцы считаются более продвинутыми в эволюционном плане по сравнению с питекантропами (Homo erectus) на основании следующих признаков:<br/><br/>1. Морфология мозга: Неандертальцы имели больший средний объем головного мозга по сравнению с питекантропами. Это указывает на более развитые когнитивные способности.<br/><br/>2. Сложность инструментальной культуры: Неандертальцы использовали более разнообразный и продвинутый набор инструментов, что свидетельствует об их более высоком уровне технических знаний.<br/><br/>3. Поведение и образ жизни: У неандертальцев были свидетельства захоронения умерших, что может указывать на наличие религиозных верований, а также уход за больными и стариками, отражающий социальные связи и эмпатию в их обществах.<br/><br/>4. Стратегии выживания: Неандертальцы адаптировались к холодным климатическим условиям, что потребовало от них разработки стратегий для обеспечения теплом и пищей, включая охоту на крупных млекопитающих, использование одежды и контролируемое использование огня.<br/><br/>5. Анатомические особенности: Неандертальцы имели более массивное телосложение с короткими конечностями, что являлось приспособлением к жизни в холодных условиях и отражает эволюционное развитие в ответ на окружающую среду.<br/><br/>Все эти признаки позволяют предположить, что неандертальцы занимали более высокое положение в эволюционном плане, чем питекантропы, отражая большую приспособленность к сложным условиям окружающей среды и более развитые общественные структуры.USER: Ответь на вопрос. По каким признакам кроманьонцев относят к людям современного типа ?ASSISTANT: Кроманьонцев относят к людям современного типа, то есть к Homo sapiens, по следующим основным признакам:<br/><br/>1. Анатомические характеристики: Кроманьонцы обладали современными пропорциями и чертами скелета, включая прямохождение, утонченные лицевые кости, подбородочный выступ, и тонкие стенки черепа.<br/><br/>2. Размер мозга: Кроманьонцы имели большой объем мозга, сопоставимый с современными людьми, что указывало на развитие интеллектуальных способностей и сложных форм мышления.<br/><br/>3. Инструментальная культура: Кроманьонцы изготавливали сложные каменные инструменты из разных материалов, включая кремень, кость, и рог, а также использовали сложные определенные методы обработки.<br/><br/>4. Искусство: Наличие художественных выражений, таких как наскальная живопись и изготовление статуэток, указывает на развитую культуру, символическое мышление и социальную кооперацию.<br/><br/>5. Социальные структуры: Сложные социальные структуры, свидетельствующие о наличии организации общества, включая захоронения, возможно с проявлениями ритуальных действий и обрядов.<br/><br/>6. Стратегии выживания: Кроманьонцы были приспособлены к различным средам обитания, охотились на разнообразных животных и занимались собирательством, что свидетельствует об их способности к широкому приспособлению и выживанию в разных условиях.<br/><br/>Эти и многие другие отличительные черты позволяют отнести кроманьонцев к анатомически современным людям (анатомически современный Homo sapiens), представителей нашего вида, живших в период верхнего палеолита.USER: написать определения: радикализм, экстремизм, фанатизм и чем они отличаются друг от другаASSISTANT: Радикализм: Радикализм можно определить как стремление к коренным, фундаментальным изменениям в политической, экономической или социальной системе. Радикалы могут выступать за полную перестройку существующих устоев, но не обязательно прибегают к насилию для достижения своих целей. Радикализм характеризуется желанием значительного обновления или революционных изменений.<br/><br/>Экстремизм: Экстремизм – это придерживание или поддержка крайних политических или религиозных взглядов, часто ассоциируется с неприятием компромиссов и крайней нетерпимостью к отличающимся взглядам. Экстремисты могут прибегать к насилию и терроризму как средствам достижения своих целей. Их взгляды находятся на маргинальных позициях относительно общего спектра мнений в обществе.<br/><br/>Фанатизм: Фанатизм является формой экстремизма, которая характеризуется безрассудной страстью, иррациональной приверженностью к какой-либо идее, вере или движению. Фанатики часто не склонны к переосмыслению или критическому взгляду на свои убеждения и могут проявлять агрессию или презрение к тем, кто разделяет иные взгляды. Фанатизм может быть религиозным, политическим и т.д.<br/><br/>Основное отличие радикализма заключается в стремлении к глубоким изменениям системы, не обязательно сопровождающимся насилием. Экстремизм часто повлечет за собой применение насилия и радикального отказа от компромиссов на фоне крайних взглядов. Фанатизм отличается неконтролируемой страстью и непреклонностью в отстаивании своих убеждений, включая нежелание слушать альтернативные позиции.USER: Вычисли синус 735 и тангенс 5пи/12ASSISTANT: Для вычисления синуса и тангенса этих углов, используем основные формулы тригонометрии и тот факт, что тригонометрические функции периодичны. <br/><br/>Сначала вычислим синус 735 градусов:<br/><br/>Учитывая, что синус - это периодическая функция с периодом 360 градусов, можно вычесть 360 градусов несколько раз, до тех пор пока значение не окажется в интервале от 0 до 360 градусов. <br/><br/>[ sin(735^circ) = sin(735^circ - 360^circ times 2) = sin(15^circ) ]<br/><br/>Таким образом, (sin(735^circ) = sin(15^circ)). Используя знание специфических значений или таблицу, можно найти, что значение (sin(15^circ)) может быть рассчитано через формулы половинного угла, но в данной задаче это значение не приведено напрямую, однако его можно узнать из специальных таблиц или калькулятора.<br/><br/>Теперь вычислим тангенс (5pi/12):<br/><br/>Значение угла (5pi/12) радиан не является одним из стандартных углов, для которых легко найти значение тангенса. Однако его можно рассчитать через выражение, позволяющее произвести вычисления, используя стандартные значения тангенса углов. Угол (5pi/12) радиан можно представить как сумму или разность других углов, для которых значение тангенса известно, например (frac{pi}{4} + frac{pi}{6}):<br/><br/>[ tanleft(frac{5pi}{12}right) = tanleft(frac{pi}{4} + frac{pi}{6}right) ]<br/><br/>Используя формулу для тангенса суммы двух углов:<br/><br/>[ tan(A + B) = frac{tan A + tan B}{1 - tan A cdot tan B} ]<br/><br/>Таким образом, <br/><br/>[ tanleft(frac{pi}{4} + frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{tan(frac{pi}{4}) + tan(frac{pi}{6})}{1 - tan(frac{pi}{4}) cdot tan(frac{pi}{6})} ]<br/><br/>[ = frac{1 + frac{1}{sqrt{3}}}{1 - 1 cdot frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} ]<br/><br/>[ = frac{sqrt{3} + 1}{sqrt{3} - 1} cdot frac{sqrt{3} + 1}{sqrt{3} + 1} ]<br/><br/>[ = frac{2 + sqrt{3}}{2 - sqrt{3} + 2 + sqrt{3}} ]<br/><br/>[ = 2 + sqrt{3} ]<br/><br/>Таким образом, (tan(5pi/12) = 2 + sqrt{3}).USER: ASSISTANT: Я бы занялся плаванием, потому что это не только укрепляет все группы мышц, но и развивает выносливость и дисциплину. Вода успокаивает мой разум, придавая мне ощущение легкости и свободы. Плавание - это спорт, который подходит людям любого возраста и способствует улучшению дыхательной системы. Это также хороший способ расслабиться после трудного дня. Кроме того, плавание снижает риск травм по сравнению с контактными видами спорта. Занятия плаванием можно комбинировать с другими видами тренировок для всестороннего развития физических качеств. Этот вид спорта инклюзивен и доступен для людей с различными физическими ограничениями. Наконец, плавание обучает самодисциплине и целеустремленности, так как требует регулярных и последовательных тренировок для достижения результатов.USER: Коля весь день либо говорит только правду, либо только лжёт. в один день он сказал ровно четыре из пяти представленных ниже фраз какую фразу он мог сказать в этот день: а )я лгал вчера и буду лгать завтра б) я говорю правду сегодня и буду говорить правду завтра в )2024 делится на 11 г) вчера была среда д)завтра будет субботаASSISTANT: Для определения, какая из фраз могла быть сказана Колей в день, когда он либо говорил только правду, либо только лгал, необходимо исключить противоречивые утверждения.<br/><br/>а) “Я лгал вчера и буду лгать завтра.” Это утверждение не может быть истинным, если говорил истину (так как в этом случае он не может говорить правду о лжи), и не может быть ложным, если он говорил ложь (поскольку это предполагает правдивость заявления о лжи в другие дни).<br/><br/>б) “Я говорю правду сегодня и буду говорить правду завтра.” Если Коля говорит правду в этот день, это утверждение не может быть проверено, потому что завтрашний день еще не наступил. Если он лжет, то утверждение невозможно, так как оно не может быть ложным целиком.<br/><br/>в) “2024 делится на 11.” Это утверждение можно легко проверить с математической точки зрения. 2024 на 11 не делится без остатка (2024 делится на 11 с остатком), так что это утверждение явно ложное.<br/><br/>г) “Вчера была среда.” и д) “Завтра будет суббота.” Если сегодня четверг (основываясь на утверждении г), то утверждение д) подразумевает, что сегодня пятница, что делает оба эти утверждения взаимоисключающими и непроверяемыми без знания конкретного дня.<br/><br/>Исходя из данных утверждений, без конкретной информации о дне недели, можно сказать, что утверждение в) о 2024 годе и его делимости на 11 не зависит от других переменных (дней недели или Колиного поведения в разное время) и является математическим утверждением, которое может быть явно опровергнуто. Таким образом, Коля мог сказать утверждение в), если в этот день он говорил только ложь, так как 2024 год не делится на 11 нацело.USER: ASSISTANT: Извините, но я не могу помочь с определением содержимого изображения.USER: ASSISTANT: К сожалению, я не могу предоставить помощь по вопросам, связанным с текстом на изображении.

Moreover, unlike quantization, the compressed linear layers remain fully differentiable and all the parameters trainable, while being able to leverage the existing highly efficient kernels over floating point matrices. We study the potential to compress Large Language Models (LLMs) for monolingual Code generation via LOw Rank Decomposition (LoRD) and observe that ranks for the linear layers in these models can be reduced by upto 39.58% with less than 1% increase in perplexity. We then use LoRD to compress StarCoder 16B to 13.2B parameter with no drop and to 12.3B with minimal drop in HumanEval Pass@1 score, in less than 10 minutes on a single A100. The compressed models speeds up inference by up to 22.35% with just a single line of change in code over huggingface’s implementation with pytorch backend. LoRD models remain compatible with state of the art near-lossless quantization method such as SpQR, which allows leveraging further compression gains of quantization. Lastly, QLoRA over LoRD model further reduces memory requirements by as much as 21.2% over vanilla QLoRA while offering similar gains from parameter efficient fine tuning. Our work shows LOw Rank Decomposition (LoRD) as a promising new paradigm for LLM compression. 1 1 INTRODUCTION Code LLMs have become an integral component of Copilots that boost developer productivity (Peng et al., 2023) and in LLM based agents (Wang et al., 2023a). These Code LLMs are as large as 34 Billion parameters for the publicly available models Roziere et al. (2023) and more than 175 Billion \` parameter for closed source ones Chen et al. (2021a). There is not only a pressing need for reducing model size and running models at a lower cost, but also for increasing the inference speed. The latter is especially significant for Copilot based applications. Recently, several methods have been proposed to compress and speed up inference of LLMs. Quantization (Frantar et al., 2023; Dettmers et al., 2023b) reduces the number of bits required per weight parameter of LLM by lowering the precision, and has shown significant model compression as well as speedups in low-batch decoding phases of LLMs Kim et al. (2023a). Quantization has also been shown to generalize well to quantized models Shen et al. (2023). Pruning (Sun et al., 2023a; Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) has offered another means of compression by removing connections from the neural network and hence sparsifying the weight matrices of the neural networks. Distillation Gu et al. 1We will release LoRDCoder at https://huggingface.co/nolanoAI 1 arXiv:2309.14021v1 [cs.CL] 25 Sep 2023 Preprint: Work in Progress (2023); Agarwal et al. (2023); Jung et al. (2023) method enables one to train a smaller model using a larger teacher model for supervision. While quantization and pruning methods that do not require re-training are viable means of compressing the model, distillation involves a significant amount of compute for retraining a smaller LLM, often from scratch. Here, we consider another compression paradigm of LOw Rank Decomposition (LoRD) , that does not require expensive retraining as in the case of distillation and covers up several deficiencies of the quantization and pruning compression method. Low Rank Decomposition factorizes a dense matrix of a neural network as a product of two smaller dense matrices. The LoRD model can leverage the highly optimized floating-point dense matrix multiplication kernels (NVIDIA, 2007; Blackford et al., 2002) that have been written over modern hardware. In contrast, quantized models require specialized kernels to be written, often different for each hardware backend in order to enable fast inference. Moreover, the neural network remaining fully-differentiable and all the parameters remaining trainable even after compression, unlike quantization. The LoRA Hu et al. (2022) layers of tuned models are also easier to merge back into floating point matrices compared to the quantized ones. Pruned models produce sparse matrix weights in the neural network. Matrix multiplication over sparse matrices is much slower than the resulting dense matrices in LoRD on most GPUs. Dense matrices, in addition avoid representation format overhead that sparse matrices incur from parameter reduction 2 and often requires specialized kernels for reducing this overhead Dettmers et al. (2023b). Dense matrix multiplication is also easier to implement than sparse matrix multiplication, especially over quantized models. Several previous works have attempted to apply matrix decomposition methods like SVD, Tucker or Kronecker decomposition for compression (Ben Noach & Goldberg, 2020; Tahaei et al., 2022; Edalati et al., 2022). However, these have been limited to small language models like Bert (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT2 (Radford et al., 2019), and have shown success only on narrow task-specific use cases or after retraining, often only with teacher-guided distillation supervision. These works have observed that weight matrices are not low rank and adapt methods like Singular Value Decomposition for data-aware decomposition of weights (Chen et al., 2021b; Hsu et al., 2022; Yu & Wu, 2023). We, adapt these approaches for Large Language Models (Billion+ Parameters) over python code, and show that these models can be low-rank decomposed to compress and speed up inference without the need for retraining with little to no performance degradation. We study low-rank decomposition across two families of code LLMs - StarCoder and CodeGen (§2) for varying parameter sizes and establish the potential for reducing rank of models through decomposition. We then study these trends across different kinds of linear layers in a transformer block and observe the potential for upto 39.58% rank reduction with less than 1% change in perplexity. We propose various considerations for compressing the models and to achieve inference speedup on GPUs (§3.1). Using these, we achieve compression of the StarCoder 16B model offering 31.67 HumanEval Chen et al. (2021a) Pass@1 score down to 13.2B parameter with similar performance of 31.57 HumanEval and down to 12.3B parameter with 29.22 HumanEval score (§3.2). LoRD models, offer an inference speedup of as high as 22.35% with just one line of change in huggingface’s (§3.3). These LoRD models can be further compressed via the near-lossless quantization method of SpQR Dettmers et al. (2023b) to reduce it’s precision to 8 and 4 bits without any further reduction in HumanEval performance (§4.1). Finally, these decomposed models also reduce the memory requirements of adapter finetuning by 21.2% over QLoRA (§4.2). 2This overhead in sparse matrix occurs from having to store indices/bitmasks to indicate which values are present and not. This can be very significant at low levels of sparsity. PyTorch’s sparse formats (CSR, CSC, COO) all store indices at int64 format, and for moderate levels of sparsity (<50%), the sparse matrix takes up more space than a dense matrix with zero-ed out values. 2 Preprint: Work in Progress 2 CODE LLMS ARE LOW RANK DECOMPOSABLE 2.1 BACKGROUND Let an linear layer L of an LLM M with weight W ∈ R d1×d2 and bias b ∈ R d1×1 . Let dmin = minimum(d1, d2) and dmax = maximum(d1, d2) A Low Rank Decomposition or Low Rank Factorization of a layer L would give us a new layer L˜ with two weight matrices A ∈ R r×d2 and B ∈ R d1×r , and a bias ˜b ∈ R d1×1 , where r << dmin such that for a n batch of input vectors X ∈ R d2×n the batch of output vectors Y ∈ R d1×n is, Y = L˜(X) = BAX + ˜b ≈ L(X) = W X + b (1) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) offers the best r-rank approximation of matrix W ∈ R d1×d2 . First W can be decomposed as W = USV T , where U ∈ R d1×d2 and V ∈ R d2×d2 are orthogonal matrix and S ∈ R d1×d2 is a diagonal matrix with entries in decreasing order. Then, by taking top-k rank, we can decompose W as a product of two low ranked matrices W ≈ BA as follows W = (U:,:rS:r,:r) | {z } B∈Rd1×r (V:r,:) | {z } A∈Rr×d2 (2) where :a,:b denotes a slice operation over a matrix that gives its first a rows and b columns. Eigendecomposition is another decomposition method applicable to symmetric matrices. We can represent the eigendecomposition of a symmetric matrix W ∈ R d1×d1 as W = QΛQT . Here Q ∈ R d1×d1 is an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of W, and Λ ∈ R d1×d1 is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of W sorted in decreasing order. Similar to SVD, we can decompose W as a product of two low ranked matrices W ≈ BA by retaining only the largest r eigenvalues (and corresponding eigenvectors) as follows: W = (Q:,:rΛ:r,:r) | {z } B∈Rd1×r (Q T :r,: ) | {z } A∈Rr×d1 (3) Since Q is orthonormal and the eigenvalues Λ is sorted in descending order, Q:,:rQT :,:r ≈ I where I is identity matrix of dimension d1. While SVD gives the optimal low-rank decomposition of matrix, in terms of Frobenius norm, but does not take input and output data distribution into account. Approaches like weighted SVD (Hsu et al., 2022) and SVD over both weight and data (Chen et al., 2021b) have been proposed but are prohibitively expensive to scale to larger models for their requirement of backpropagation over calibration dataset. SVD over very large weight matrices is also very computationally expensive. So, we instead leverage the observation that activations in transformers are low-ranked (Feng et al., 2022) and adapt the more heuristically driven approach of Atomic Feature Mimicking (AFM) (Yu & Wu, 2023) that creates low rank matrices conditioned on a small amount of calibration data. Specifically, consider the eigen-decomposition of Covariance over Y as E[yyT ] − E[y]E[y] T = QˆΛˆQˆT (4) Here Qˆ is a matrix of its eigenvectors, hence Qˆ :,:rQˆT :,:r ≈ I. Using this, we can write the output vector Y as Y ≈ Qˆ :,:rQˆT :,:rY . By writing Y in terms of W, X and b from Equation 1, we have: Y ≈ Qˆ :,:rQˆT :,:rW X + Qˆ :,:rQˆT :,:r b (5) Comparing to Equation 1, this gives us B = Qˆ :,:r ∈ R d1×r , A = QˆT :,:rW ∈ R r×d2 and ˜b = Qˆ :,:rQˆT :,:r b ≈ b. This approach is also straightforward to adapt for LLMs like LLaMa (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023), CodeLLaMa (Roziere et al., 2023) which do not have a \` bias term in the linear layer by setting ˜b to zero vector. 3 Preprint: Work in Progress 2.2 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS We take our python calibration dataset from the stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022) and consider the corresponding subset of the stack smol (Bigcode, 2022) as validation data. We filter out those sequences which are less than 1024 tokens or 10240 characters in length. We consider CodeGen and StarCoder model family of models. CodeGen mono models are present across 350M, 2B, 6B and 16B parameters and are CodeGen models that were further trained on only python code. StarCoder 16B is the StarCoderBase 16B model further trained on only python code from the stack dataset’s train split. We also consider StarCoderBase at 3B and 7B parameter sizes in StarCoder family due to the lack of their monolingual counterparts. All our experiments were performed on a single A100 GPU in under an hour for each run. For studying the trends of increase in perplexity for a reduction in rank across difference model sizes, we set a fixed low-rank r for all the layers. Later we discuss how to achieve compression and inference speedup via low-rank decomposition in §3 2.3 CHANGE IN PERPLEXITY ACROSS REDUCTION IN RANK Figure 1a and 1b show the trends of increase in perplexity across reduction in rank of the weight matrix of CodeGen and StarCoder models. For the largest models in both families, we observe only about a 1% increase in perplexity for 10% reduction in rank, and upto 35% reduction in rank for less than 10% increase in perplexity. The smallest model, CodeGen Mono 350M, however, can only be decomposed to 35% rank reduction for a similar drop in perplexity. We observe that the perplexity changes much slower for larger models as the % rank reduces, and hence can be compressed mode, similar to observations in quantization and pruning (Li et al., 2020). It should be noted that for most models, more than 50% leads to significant output quality degradation. (a) Perplexity vs % Rank Reduction for CodeGen Models. (b) Perplexity vs % Rank Reduction for StarCoder Models. Figure 1: Perplexity vs %Reduction in Rank for Different Models. 3 COMPRESSION AND SPEEDUP THROUGH DECOMPOSITION In this section, we discuss how we adapt the LOw Rank Decomposition (LoRD) for reducing the size of model and achieving inference speedup without a significant reduction in the output quality of the model. Following (Kim et al., 2023a), we assume memory bandwidth is the bottleneck for inference, and thus speedups for decoding are directly proportional to the size of the transformer model. 3.1 ACHIEVING COMPRESSION AND INFERENCE SPEEDUP Threshold for size reduction across rank reduction: Consider a weight matrix W ∈ R d1×d2 of a transformer layer with low rank decomposed A ∈ R r×d2 and B ∈ R d1×r . The number of parameters before and after decomposition respectively are d1d2 and r(d1 + d2). Therefore, if 4 Preprint: Work in Progress r > d1d2 (d1+d2) , (i.e a decomposition with small rank reduction), then the size of the model after decomposition can even be higher than the original models. Ideally, we would want the rank r << d1d2 (d1+d2) or r << dmin. Matrix Aspect Ratio and Compression: Let the ratio of the smaller dimension to the larger dimension of the matrix (i.e. the aspect ratio) be α = dmin dmax . For square matrix, α = 1 and for tall or fat matrices α << 1. We can rewrite, the percentage change in parameters from decomposition, in terms of percent change in rank %∆r = 100 ∗ dmin−r dmin % and aspect ratio as: 100 ∗ r(dmax + dmin) − dmaxdmin dmaxdmin = 100α − (1 + α)%∆r (6) It should be noted that change in parameters from decomposition can either be positive (the number of parameters increased after decomposition), or negative (the number of parameters decreased after decomposition). In order to achieve model compression and consequently inference speedups, one would want a very high negative percentage change in parameters. Figure 2: Parity Point across various aspect ratios (α) of the different linear layers in transformers. Parity Point for Compression across Rank Reduction: Using Eq. 6, one can observe that little reduction in rank, may lead to increase in model parameters instead of decreasing. For instance, square matrices (α = 1) will have 100% increase (i.e doubling in size), then %∆r → 0+ and only after the rank is reduced by more than 50%, will the Parity Point of the rank reduction be reached, that offers same or lesser number of a parameter in the decomposed layer as the original matrix. This parity point for tall or fat matrices (α → 0+), can be achieved with a very small percent reduction in rank and can start giving a reduction in model size. For compression to be achieved, we would want to reduce the rank by an amount to cross this parity point threshold. However, reducing the rank by a lot can degrade performance significantly. So we must take the aspect ratio into account, in order to achieve compression without much reduction in rank (and hence no significant degradation in output quality) A transformer model had different aspect ratios across its various linear layers, α = 1.00 for output projection after attention, α = 0.96 for Multi-query attention (Shazeer, 2019) projections, α = 0.25 for typical MLP projections with intermediate expansion factor of 4 as in the original transformer and as low as α = 0.12 for the embedding and language model head projection of CodeGen 16B with 51200 vocab size. Figure 2 plots the % change in the size of the model across % reduction in rank for matrices with different aspect ratios. For square matrices and near square matrices, a small rank reduction doubles the size of the linear layer after decomposition, and only after its parity point of 50% reduction is the size after decomposition, the same as original matrix. By this extent of rank decomposition, the performance starts to significantly degrade, as seen in §2.3. All the previous works on smaller models, address this by retraining the model (Yu & Wu, 2023; Chen et al., 2021b; Hsu et al., 2022; Ben Noach & Goldberg, 2020), often via knowledge distillation supervision (Hinton et al., 2015; Sanh et al., 2019) on specific narrow tasks. However, retraining is infeasible for larger models. Thus, we skip matrices with very high aspect ratios such as output projection or multi-query attention for decomposition. In contrast, the weights in MLP achieve parity at only 20% rank reduction. While embeddings and LM Head can be compressed through decomposition, as they have been for smaller transformer models (Baevski & Auli, 2019; Lan et al., 2020), they contribute only a very small portion of the weight of the model. So, we do not consider decomposing these matrices. In order to reduce the aspect ratio of matrices, we group layers with the same input vector to have the same bottleneck matrix after decomposition. Doing so, enables re-use of computation, and sharing of weights, as well as bringing the aspect ratio down to achieve compression as lower rank reduction. Candidate layers for grouping include the query, key and value projection matrices 5 Preprint: Work in Progress in multi-headed attention with aspect ratio reduced to α = 0.33 and the gating layer in SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020) with first linear linear of MLP in models like LLaMa (Touvron et al., 2023) with α = 0.1875. (a) CodeGen 16B. (b) StarCoder 16B. Figure 3: Parameter Reduction vs perplexity for decomposition across various layers. Trends across different layers in a transformer block: In addition to considering the parity point into account for deciding which layers to decompose, we also additionally study the sensitivity of each of these layers to low rank decomposition across the large model in the two model families. Figure 3 shows the increase in perplexity vs reduction in model parameters for the two models. For both models, decomposing all the linear layers achieves the parity point much later than any one of these linear layers with low aspect ratio. For CodeGen, the attention weight matrix (query, key and values projection) offers least increase in perplexity for the biggest drop in parameter count, make this layer the most suitable candidate to be decomposed. It shows less than 1% increase in perplexity even after 39.58% rank reduction. We observe the mlp 2 (downscaling mlp) to be a better candidate for decomposition than mlp 1 (upscaling mlp) across both models. This makes mlp 2 to be a good candidate for low-rank decomposition over the StarCoder model. Hardware Considerations: On modern hardware accelerators like GPU and their corresponding software stack, matrix multiplication kernels are faster if their dimensions are divisible by a high factor of 2. So, we consider ranks at a reduction of approximately every 10%, rounded off to the nearest multiple of 128 in our experiments. 3.2 PERFORMANCE OF COMPRESSED MODELS We consider the largest models of StarCoder and CodeGen family (16B) and perform low-rank decomposition on both with varying ranks. We consider decomposing layers that offers most parameter reduction (§3.1) with least increase in perplexity - mlp 2 for StarCoder and attention for CodeGen. We report the Pass@1 and Pass@10 scores over the Human Eval dataset (Chen et al., 2021a) using the code-eval GitHub repo (Bacaj, 2023) in Table 1. We observe that StarCoder models can be low rank decomposed to 13.2B parameters (50% rank reduction) with no drop in Pass@1 performance and upto 12.3B parameters (62.5% rank reduction) with very little drop. CodeGen models shows similar trend in drop in Human Eval performance when measured in terms of rank reduction. However, in terms of parameter reduction count, while showing very little perplexity change with large reduction in rank (Fig. 3a), shows much more drop in its HumanEval score when measured in terms of parameter count reduction due to a higher aspect ratio of the matrix being decomposed. It should be noted that for certain compressed models, the Pass@1 even slightly improves over the base model. Similar trend of slight improvements from compression across various metrics and benchmarks has been observed in the case of other compression attempts (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023; Cerebras, 2022). 6 Preprint: Work in Progress Starcoder 16B CodeGen 16B Mono Model Type Rank HumanEval Score Model Type Rank HumanEval Score Pass @ 1 Pass @ 10 Pass @ 1 Pass @ 10 Base Model 6144 31.67 48.28 Base Model 6144 29.02 46.34 LoRDCoder 14.9B 4480 33.18 48.41 LoRDCoder 15.9B 4480 29.08 46.95 LoRDCoder 14.5B 4096 31.69 45.12 LoRDCoder 15.6B 4096 28.90 46.24 LoRDCoder 13.8B 3584 30.90 47.56 LoRDCoder 15.1B 3584 28.54 45.73 LoRDCoder 13.2B 3072 31.57 45.36 LoRDCoder 14.7B 3072 27.99 43.29 LoRDCoder 12.6B 2560 29.84 42.31 LoRDCoder 14.3B 2560 27.32 45.12 LoRDCoder 12.3B 2304 29.22 40.12 LoRDCoder 14.1B 2304 27.07 41.46 Table 1: Human Eval Score of LoRD across StarCoder and CodeGen. 3.3 SPEEDUP FROM LORD We next consider accessing the inference speedup (forward pass) of the models over the standard cuBLAS floating point kernels. We consider the standard Huggingface implementation (Wolf et al., 2020) of Starcoder with pytorch backend (Paszke et al., 2019) utilizing standard cuBLAS kernels on A100 GPUs. LoRD decomposed models were implemented by modifying just one line of code to replace an MLP with an extra linear layer 3 . We benchmark over 1024 tokens and 512 tokens sequence, averaged across 10 runs with warm up of 3 runs. We plot relative time taken and model size across reduction in rank in Figure Figure 4: Time and Model size of StarCoder 16B across ranks. 4. Inference speedups as high as 22.35% are observed for decomposed models. The lines in the graph are generally downward sloping, Therefore reduction in rank beyond 25% generally implies less inference time and reduction in model size. However, the underlying hardware (and pertaining software kernels) also significantly affect the speedup gains. We notice huge gains, whenever the rank is rounded off to a multiple of a very high power of 2 (like 4096 and 2560 at 33% and 58% rank reduction), despite very little reduction in model size. In contrast, for certain ranks which are multiples of a lesser power of 2 (like 3584 and 2304 at 41% and 62% rank reduction) are slower than those at slightly higher ranks. It is worth noting that affect of hardware inefficient matrix shape is less significant for longer tokens sequence of 1024 because the O(n 2 ) attention overhead starts becoming more significant, especially in the absence of SoTA attention implementation techniques (Rabe & Staats, 2021; Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) as in the case of Huggingface’s implementations. 4 COMBINING LORD WITH QUANTIZATION AND LORA 4.1 QUANTIZATION While LoRD enables compression at same precision level, we study whether the decomposed models can be further compressing through quantization. Table 2 shows the HumanEval pass@1 results for the different LoRDCoder across 8 and 4 bit quantization levels, using the near lossless quantization technique of SpQR (Dettmers et al., 2023b). We observe that the LoRD models can be combined with quantization for further compression, showing no performance drop for 8-bit and very little performance drop on 4-bit quantization for most models. Slight increase in HumanEval after quantization is also observed, similar to Pangu-Coder2 (Shen et al., 2023). 4.2 PARAMETER EFFICIENT TUNING OF LORD MODELS 3 nn.Linear(in, out) -> nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(in, rank), nn.Linear(rank, out)) 7 Preprint: Work in Progress Model Pass@1@FP16 Pass@1@8-bit Pass@1@4-bit LoRDCoder 14.9B 33.18 33.17 32.01 LoRDCoder 14.5B 31.69 31.58 32.74 LoRDCoder 13.8B 30.90 31.10 30.73 LoRDCoder 13.2B 31.57 31.52 32.01 LoRDCoder 12.6B 29.84 29.87 30.22 LoRDCoder 12.3B 29.22 29.14 29.45 Table 2: Human Eval score of quantized LoRDCoder models. d x d d x r’ r’ x d d x r’ r’ x d d x r r x d d r’ h x d r’ h x r LoRD Weights a) LoRA b) LoRD + LoRA Pr e t r a i n ed W e i g h t s A R X R Y R W R X R Y R B R Figure 5: LoRA vs LoRD + LoRA. We next test the potential for using LoRD to further reduce the memory usage over existing parameterefficient techniques. We consider the code instruction dataset (Chaudhary, 2023) and filter those examples that pertains to python programming language. We use QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023a), which is an even more memory efficient version of LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) storing the weights in quantized format, for fine-tuning for 1 epoch. We compare results from fine-tuning two of the decomposed models LoRDCoder 13.2B and LoRDCoder 12.3B model to the StarCoder model. We observe a HumanEval pass@1 of 37.80 and 37.62 across LoRDCoder 13.2B and LoRDCoder 12.3B fine-tuning, competitive to the performance of 37.74 offered by StarCoder model. 5 RELATED WORK There is a growing interest in compressing pretrained Large Language Models. Several recent attempts have been dedicated to the quantization of weights of LLMs (Frantar et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Park et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023b; Chee et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a) with tricks such as outlier separation (Dettmers et al., 2022; Dettmers & Zettlemoyer, 2022; Dettmers et al., 2023c; Wei et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023a; Lee et al., 2023). Some attempts also quantize the activations (intermediate representations) in addition to weights to speed up computation time (Shao et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023). The works in quantization that are closest to us is the LowRank Compensation (LoRC) Strategy (Yao et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023), where the difference of the quantized matrix to the original matrix is approximated by a product of low-rank matrices. Our work decomposes the entire matrix for compression. Pruning neural networks Liang et al. (2021), unlike quantization, reduces the number of parameters in a model by removing unimportant weights or connections. Several techniques have been proposed to scale pruning methods for LLMs (Sun et al., 2023a; Frantar & Alistarh, 2023; Ma et al., 2023). However, pruning as a means of compression is yet to become viable due to no speedups over sparse matrices without significant performance drop at extreme levels of sparsity or structured sparsity (Zhu et al., 2023). With low-rank decomposition, we propose an alternate method for reducing model parameters that offer speedup even at a little reduction in parameter count. Certain works have also attempted to (Ren & Zhu, 2023; Li et al., 2023b) to split a dense matrix as a sum of lowrank matrices and a sparse matrix. However, these methods require retraining and have been shown to work only for Language Models of less than a billion parameters. Low rank decomposition has been proposed for smaller language models like Bert or GPT2 before using SVD decomposition (Ben Noach & Goldberg, 2020) and Kronecker decompositions (Tahaei et al., 2022; Edalati et al., 2022). Hsu et al. (2022) modified SVD to be data aware based on approximate second-order gradient information. A better weighted SVD was proposed by (Hua et al., 2022). Chen et al. (2021b) proposed a data aware decomposition method with a provably optimal closed-form solution, utilizing a large amount of data points over specific tasks to decompose. Sev8 Preprint: Work in Progress eral recent works (Yu & Wu, 2023; Feng et al., 2022) have shown that while the weight matrix of neural networks is not inherently low-rank, the intermediate representations are, thus propose to decompose based on representations. All these works have focused on small language models and require re-training. We proposed low-rank decomposition for compressing neural networks without the need for retraining. The factorization has also been used just for the embedding layers (Baevski & Auli, 2019; Lan et al., 2020), as they are good candidates due to their very low aspect ratio of 0.015, where a reduction of rank by even 5% would lead to reduction in number of parameters after decomposition. There is also a growing interest in fine-tuning large language models Taori et al. (2023); Chiang et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023b); Sun et al. (2023b). With the large memory requirements for finetuning full parameters of the LLM, the more parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) are getting widely adopted. These methods freeze the original LLM weights, and attach two low-rank matrices or adapters, in a skip-connection (He et al., 2016) to the linear layers of the model. These parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches have seen improvements in lower activation memory (Zhang et al., 2023) or by keeping non-trainable model weights at 4-bit precision (Dettmers et al., 2023a). Our work, while focused on compression through low-rank decomposition, can also enable more efficient fine-tuning, especially in conjunction with existing methods. 6 CONCLUSION We studied the compression of monolingual code generation models through a novel one-shot compression paradigm of low-rank decomposition. We analyse the change in perplexity with change in rank across the model families of StarCoder and CodeGen as well as their individual layers and observe that the rank of these models can be reduced by upto 39.58% with less than 1% change in perplexity. We then proposed considerations for one-shot compressing these models through LOw Rank Decomposition (LoRD) in under 10 minutes. Consequently, we compress StarCoder 16B to 13.2B with no drop in HumanEval pass@1 and very little drop in HumanEval pass@1 to 12.3B parameters. With a minimal change in code over huggingface’s default inference code of just one line, we gain speedups of up to 22.35%. The LoRD models are also compatible with near lossless quantization techniques of SpQR, which offers gains of quantization based compression in addition to ones from decomposition. The LoRD models also reduce memory requirements by as much as 21.2% over vanilla QLoRA fine-tuning. 7 BROADER IMPACT AND FUTURE WORK Our work on LoRD, compresses code LLMs which enables them to run on smaller GPUs including as consumer grade GPUs. This is especially of pressing importance for the next few years when the shortage of GPU supply is relative to the increasing demand in today’s market. Moreover, faster inference helps reduce the GPU cycles, enabling lower running costs and lower power consumption for LLM inference. Our work helps reduce the carbon emissions incurred and moves towards a greener NLP. Through compression, our work also promotes inference at the edge, and therefore opening room for applications involving strict privacy requirements. Lower latency will also help improve the User Experience in applications like CoPilots where lag between suggestions can impact developer’s productivity. Several of these benefits of LoRD such as lower cost and energy consumption are also applicable for fine-tuning use cases of LLMs. Our work opens up a new paradigm for compression via Low Rank Decomposition over Large Language Models in a single shot without the need for retraining. Since, LoRD models can leverage existing floating point kernels across BLAS and cuBLAS, in contrast to quantization, these are much easier to implement and reap inference benefits. Our study on hardware considerations for speedup also opens up the potential for tuning the rank of decomposed models to fit best on the target hardware and the accompanying GEMM kernels. While our study is limited to monolingual code LLMs, the low rank decomposition technique is general and not specific to code domain. Thus exploring its applicability to more general purpose models like LLaMa is a promising direction for the compression of transformer LLMs beyond quantization. Another interesting unexplored question is whether the LoRA or QLoRA modules fine-tuned on original models, can be plugged in as-is for the LoRD models without any performance drop\\"\\"","output":"Alright, let's simplify this down to the basics. Imagine you have a giant room full of filing cabinets, and each cabinet represents a piece of information needed for a computer program to understand and produce code, like creating software. This room is like a model that helps developers by suggesting or writing code. As you can imagine, a room that big takes a lot of time and energy to search through, not to mention the space it occupies! Now, suppose we find a clever way to organize this room. Instead of having all these separate, bulky filing cabinets, we rearrange them into fewer, smaller cabinets but in such a way that we can still find all the information we need, just as quickly – if not faster. This rearrangement process is kind of what Ayush Kaushal and their team have done with computer programs used in coding, specifically, a kind called Large Language Models (LLMs) that are trained to understand and generate code. Their method is called \\"LOw Rank Decomposition\\" (LoRD), which is a fancy way of saying they found a smart way to compress or shrink down the model without losing its effectiveness. Just like how rearranging the filing room makes it easier, quicker, and cheaper to find the files you need, LoRD makes these LLMs faster, smaller, and less expensive to run. Why does this matter? Well, smaller and faster models mean they can work on less powerful computers, making this technology accessible to more people. It also means they can operate more efficiently, saving on electricity and contributing less to carbon emissions, which is better for our planet. Moreover, because these compressed models still understand and produce code just as well, developers can use them without having to go through a lengthy process of teaching the model all over again, which saves a tremendous amount of time and resources. They even showed that we could squeeze these models down pretty significantly – making them up to 39.58% smaller! – with little to no loss in their ability to generate code effectively. Finally, the team found these slimmed-down models could work even better when combined with other techniques (quantization and fine-tuning methods), making them even more efficient and adaptable. In essence, this research opens the door to making powerful coding-assist tools more accessible and environmentally friendly, bringing the benefits of AI to more people while conserving valuable resources."},{"instruction":"I stumbled across a Github repo for \\"Low-Rank adapter extraction for fine-tuned transformers model. This repository contains code for extracting LoRA adapters from finetuned transformers models, using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models. The technique presented here allows extracting PEFT compatible Low-Rank adapters from full fine-tunes or merged model. A bit more about PEFT. PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a library for efficiently adapting large pretrained models to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all of a model’s parameters because it is prohibitively costly. PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters - significantly decreasing computational and storage costs - while yielding performance comparable to a fully fine-tuned model. This makes it more accessible to train and store large language models (LLMs) on consumer hardware. PEFT is integrated with the Transformers, Diffusers, and Accelerate libraries to provide a faster and easier way to load, train, and use large models for inference. Now, I found a huggingface profile that has a Low-rank decomposition of ezelikman's (original paper author) quietstar-8-ahead model using mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 as a base.

The pretrained model’s original weight matrix is frozen and only the smaller matrices are updated during training. This reduces the number of trainable parameters, reducing memory usage and training time which can be very expensive for large models. There are several different ways to express the weight matrix as a low-rank decomposition, but Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the most common method. The PEFT library supports several other LoRA variants, such as Low-Rank Hadamard Product (LoHa), Low-Rank Kronecker Product (LoKr), and Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation (AdaLoRA). You can learn more about how these methods work conceptually in the Adapters guide. If you’re interested in applying these methods to other tasks and use cases like semantic segmentation, token classification, take a look at our notebook collection! This guide will show you how to quickly train an image classification model - with a low-rank decomposition method - to identify the class of food shown in an image. Some familiarity with the general process of training an image classification model would be really helpful and allow you to focus on the low-rank decomposition methods. If you’re new, we recommend taking a look at the Image classification guide first from the Transformers documentation. When you’re ready, come back and see how easy it is to drop PEFT in to your training! Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed. Copied pip install -q peft transformers datasets Dataset In this guide, you’ll use the Food-101 dataset which contains images of 101 food classes (take a look at the dataset viewer to get a better idea of what the dataset looks like). Load the dataset with the load_dataset function. Copied from datasets import load_dataset ds = load_dataset(\\"food101\\") Each food class is labeled with an integer, so to make it easier to understand what these integers represent, you’ll create a label2id and id2label dictionary to map the integer to its class label. Copied labels = ds[\\"train\\"].features[\\"label\\"].names label2id, id2label = dict(), dict() for i, label in enumerate(labels): label2id[label] = i id2label[i] = label id2label[2] \\"baklava\\" Load an image processor to properly resize and normalize the pixel values of the training and evaluation images. Copied from transformers import AutoImageProcessor image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(\\"google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k\\") You can also use the image processor to prepare some transformation functions for data augmentation and pixel scaling. Copied from torchvision.transforms import ( CenterCrop, Compose, Normalize, RandomHorizontalFlip, RandomResizedCrop, Resize, ToTensor, ) normalize = Normalize(mean=image_processor.image_mean, std=image_processor.image_std) train_transforms = Compose( [ RandomResizedCrop(image_processor.size[\\"height\\"]), RandomHorizontalFlip(), ToTensor(), normalize, ] ) val_transforms = Compose( [ Resize(image_processor.size[\\"height\\"]), CenterCrop(image_processor.size[\\"height\\"]), ToTensor(), normalize, ] ) def preprocess_train(example_batch): example_batch[\\"pixel_values\\"] = [train_transforms(image.convert(\\"RGB\\")) for image in example_batch[\\"image\\"]] return example_batch def preprocess_val(example_batch): example_batch[\\"pixel_values\\"] = [val_transforms(image.convert(\\"RGB\\")) for image in example_batch[\\"image\\"]] return example_batch Define the training and validation datasets, and use the set_transform function to apply the transformations on-the-fly. Copied train_ds = ds[\\"train\\"] val_ds = ds[\\"validation\\"] train_ds.set_transform(preprocess_train) val_ds.set_transform(preprocess_val) Finally, you’ll need a data collator to create a batch of training and evaluation data and convert the labels to torch.tensor objects.

This guide uses the google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k model, but you can use any image classification model you want. Pass the label2id and id2label dictionaries to the model so it knows how to map the integer labels to their class labels, and you can optionally pass the ignore_mismatched_sizes=True parameter if you’re finetuning a checkpoint that has already been finetuned. Copied from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained( \\"google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k\\", label2id=label2id, id2label=id2label, ignore_mismatched_sizes=True, ) PEFT configuration and model Every PEFT method requires a configuration that holds all the parameters specifying how the PEFT method should be applied. Once the configuration is setup, pass it to the get_peft_model() function along with the base model to create a trainable PeftModel. Call the print_trainable_parameters() method to compare the number of parameters of PeftModel versus the number of parameters in the base model! LoRA decomposes the weight update matrix into two smaller matrices. The size of these low-rank matrices is determined by its rank or r. A higher rank means the model has more parameters to train, but it also means the model has more learning capacity. You’ll also want to specify the target_modules which determine where the smaller matrices are inserted. For this guide, you’ll target the query and value matrices of the attention blocks.

AdaLoRA has an update_and_allocate() method that should be called at each training step to update the parameter budget and mask, otherwise the adaptation step is not performed.

Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results.

In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities.\\"\\"","output":"Given your intention surrounding the \\"QuietStar 8 ahead lora\\" folder and its relation to the Quiet-STaR paper by Eric Zelikman et al., it looks like you're interested in leveraging advanced modeling techniques to enhance a model's reasoning capabilities by teaching it to \\"think before speaking.\\" This methodology represents a significant leap towards more intelligent and reasoning-based language models, moving beyond simply predicting the next token to generating and utilizing internal rationales for better decision-making. If you're aiming to utilize the given folder contents (e.g., \`adapter_model.safetensors\`, \`adapter_config.json\`) for such a model, here’s a simplified guide on how you might proceed, considering your objective is to apply and experiment with the concepts of Quiet-STaR leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters extracted from fine-tuned transformers models: # Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment Ensure your environment is correctly set up by installing necessary libraries like Transformers, Datasets, and any other dependencies required for handling safetensors and model configurations. If you haven’t already: \`\`\`bash pip install transformers datasets safetext safetensors \`\`\` # Step 2: Loading the Adapter Model The \`adapter_model.safetensors\` file presumably contains the fine-tuned model parameters, and \`adapter_config.json\` contains configuration for Low-Rank Adaptation. You would utilize these files to load the model along with its configuration. Assuming you’re working with the Hugging Face’s Transformers library, you might proceed as follows, adjusting for specific function names and paths: \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoModel import safetensors.torch as st # Load the configuration config_path = \\"path/to/adapter_config.json\\" model_path = \\"path/to/adapter_model.safetensors\\" # Assuming the config requires custom handling, adjust as necessary with open(config_path, 'r') as f: config = json.load(f) # Load the model model_state_dict = st.load(model_path) model = AutoModel.from_config(config) model.load_state_dict(model_state_dict) \`\`\` # Step 3: Experimenting with Reasoning Abilities Given that Quiet-STaR improves a language model by effectively generating internal 'thoughts' or rationales for better predictions, you’d want to experiment with these capabilities. You might want to: - Generate rationales for unseen data to observe how the model reasons. - Compare the prediction outcomes with and without the use of these generated rationales. - Fine-tune or further experiment with the model on specific reasoning tasks to measure improvements over baselines or previous approaches. # Step 4: Evaluation Evaluate the model's performance improvements on tasks known for requiring sophisticated reasoning, like CommonsenseQA or GSM8K, as mentioned in the paper. Track metrics such as accuracy improvements, perplexity reductions, or other relevant KPIs to quantify the impact of your model's reasoning abilities. # Step 5: Share and Collaborate Considering the novelty and potential advancements your experiments might bring, consider sharing your findings, models, or even newly trained adapters via platforms such as the Hugging Face Hub to foster further research and collaboration in the area of reasoning-based language models. Remember, the essence of experimenting with Quiet-STaR and similar advanced language models lies in iteration, rigorous testing, and open collaboration to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI and machine reasoning."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"coffee in shop with flower\\"","output":"\\"coffee in shop with flower\\""},{"instruction":"中文回答","output":"没问题，请问您有什么问题？我会尽我的能力给您提供中文回答。"},{"instruction":"炉石传说迷你系列是什么？尽量详细","output":"《炉石传说》（Hearthstone）是由暴雪娱乐开发并发行的一款数字式集换卡牌游戏。自从2014年发布以来，它迅速成为了全球最受欢迎和最成功的数字卡牌游戏之一。为了保持游戏的新鲜感和玩家的兴趣，《炉石传说》定期推出新的内容扩展包和更新，其中就包括所谓的“迷你系列”。 # 迷你系列的概念 - **定义与目的**：迷你系列是指在《炉石传说》的每个扩展周期中，除了主扩展包外，还会发布的一小批额外卡牌集合。迷你系列的目的是为了在两个主要扩展包发布周期之间给游戏注入新鲜元素，提供新的策略和玩法，从而维持玩家的兴趣和游戏的活跃度。 - **内容与特点**：一般来说，每个迷你系列包括35张左右的新卡牌。这些卡牌设计上旨在补足当前扩展包的主题，同时引入新的策略考量，增加玩法多样性。迷你系列的卡牌可以通过购买专门的包裹获得，也可以像其他卡牌一样用游戏内货币或真实货币购买。 - **发行时间与频率**：迷你系列通常在大扩展包的中间时期发布。考虑到《炉石传说》一年发布三个大扩展包，迷你系列的更新频率大约是每隔几个月就会有一次。 # 迷你系列的影响 迷你系列的发布通常会对游戏的竞技环境产生显著影响，引入新的卡牌组合和策略，挑战现有的玩法格局。这种更新方式在玩家之间普遍受到好评，因为它在较短的时间内提供了内容更新，使得游戏保持了持续的新鲜感和动态变化。 # 结论 总体而言，迷你系列是《炉石传说》内容更新和玩家体验增强的重要部分。它不仅为游戏带来新的卡牌和玩法，还有助于维持游戏的平衡和多样性，增加了游戏的长期吸引力。通过迷你系列，暴雪娱乐展示了对玩家需求和游戏健康状态的持续关注，以及推动游戏不断进步和发展的决心。"},{"instruction":"Which of the following must be known to program a circular interpolation move?

Moreover, unlike quantization, the compressed linear layers remain fully differentiable and all the parameters trainable, while being able to leverage the existing highly efficient kernels over floating point matrices. We study the potential to compress Large Language Models (LLMs) for monolingual Code generation via LOw Rank Decomposition (LoRD) and observe that ranks for the linear layers in these models can be reduced by upto 39.58% with less than 1% increase in perplexity. We then use LoRD to compress StarCoder 16B to 13.2B parameter with no drop and to 12.3B with minimal drop in HumanEval Pass@1 score, in less than 10 minutes on a single A100. The compressed models speeds up inference by up to 22.35% with just a single line of change in code over huggingface’s implementation with pytorch backend. LoRD models remain compatible with state of the art near-lossless quantization method such as SpQR, which allows leveraging further compression gains of quantization. Lastly, QLoRA over LoRD model further reduces memory requirements by as much as 21.2% over vanilla QLoRA while offering similar gains from parameter efficient fine tuning. Our work shows LOw Rank Decomposition (LoRD) as a promising new paradigm for LLM compression. 1 1 INTRODUCTION Code LLMs have become an integral component of Copilots that boost developer productivity (Peng et al., 2023) and in LLM based agents (Wang et al., 2023a). These Code LLMs are as large as 34 Billion parameters for the publicly available models Roziere et al. (2023) and more than 175 Billion <br/>parameter for closed source ones Chen et al. (2021a). There is not only a pressing need for reducing<br/>model size and running models at a lower cost, but also for increasing the inference speed. The latter<br/>is especially significant for Copilot based applications.<br/>Recently, several methods have been proposed to compress and speed up inference of LLMs. Quantization (Frantar et al., 2023; Dettmers et al., 2023b) reduces the number of bits required per weight<br/>parameter of LLM by lowering the precision, and has shown significant model compression as well<br/>as speedups in low-batch decoding phases of LLMs Kim et al. (2023a). Quantization has also been<br/>shown to generalize well to quantized models Shen et al. (2023). Pruning (Sun et al., 2023a; Frantar<br/>& Alistarh, 2023) has offered another means of compression by removing connections from the neural network and hence sparsifying the weight matrices of the neural networks. Distillation Gu et al.<br/>1We will release LoRDCoder at https://huggingface.co/nolanoAI<br/>1<br/>arXiv:2309.14021v1 [cs.CL] 25 Sep 2023<br/>Preprint: Work in Progress<br/>(2023); Agarwal et al. (2023); Jung et al. (2023) method enables one to train a smaller model using<br/>a larger teacher model for supervision. While quantization and pruning methods that do not require<br/>re-training are viable means of compressing the model, distillation involves a significant amount of<br/>compute for retraining a smaller LLM, often from scratch. Here, we consider another compression<br/>paradigm of LOw Rank Decomposition (LoRD) , that does not require expensive retraining as in the<br/>case of distillation and covers up several deficiencies of the quantization and pruning compression<br/>method.<br/>Low Rank Decomposition factorizes a dense matrix of a neural network as a product of two smaller<br/>dense matrices. The LoRD model can leverage the highly optimized floating-point dense matrix<br/>multiplication kernels (NVIDIA, 2007; Blackford et al., 2002) that have been written over modern<br/>hardware. In contrast, quantized models require specialized kernels to be written, often different<br/>for each hardware backend in order to enable fast inference. Moreover, the neural network remaining fully-differentiable and all the parameters remaining trainable even after compression, unlike<br/>quantization. The LoRA Hu et al. (2022) layers of tuned models are also easier to merge back into<br/>floating point matrices compared to the quantized ones.<br/>Pruned models produce sparse matrix weights in the neural network. Matrix multiplication over<br/>sparse matrices is much slower than the resulting dense matrices in LoRD on most GPUs. Dense<br/>matrices, in addition avoid representation format overhead that sparse matrices incur from parameter<br/>reduction 2<br/>and often requires specialized kernels for reducing this overhead Dettmers et al. (2023b).<br/>Dense matrix multiplication is also easier to implement than sparse matrix multiplication, especially<br/>over quantized models.<br/>Several previous works have attempted to apply matrix decomposition methods like SVD, Tucker<br/>or Kronecker decomposition for compression (Ben Noach & Goldberg, 2020; Tahaei et al., 2022;<br/>Edalati et al., 2022). However, these have been limited to small language models like Bert (Devlin<br/>et al., 2019) and GPT2 (Radford et al., 2019), and have shown success only on narrow task-specific<br/>use cases or after retraining, often only with teacher-guided distillation supervision. These works<br/>have observed that weight matrices are not low rank and adapt methods like Singular Value Decomposition for data-aware decomposition of weights (Chen et al., 2021b; Hsu et al., 2022; Yu & Wu,<br/>2023).<br/>We, adapt these approaches for Large Language Models (Billion+ Parameters) over python code, and<br/>show that these models can be low-rank decomposed to compress and speed up inference without<br/>the need for retraining with little to no performance degradation. We study low-rank decomposition<br/>across two families of code LLMs - StarCoder and CodeGen (§2) for varying parameter sizes and<br/>establish the potential for reducing rank of models through decomposition. We then study these<br/>trends across different kinds of linear layers in a transformer block and observe the potential for<br/>upto 39.58% rank reduction with less than 1% change in perplexity.<br/>We propose various considerations for compressing the models and to achieve inference speedup<br/>on GPUs (§3.1). Using these, we achieve compression of the StarCoder 16B model offering 31.67<br/>HumanEval Chen et al. (2021a) Pass@1 score down to 13.2B parameter with similar performance of<br/>31.57 HumanEval and down to 12.3B parameter with 29.22 HumanEval score (§3.2). LoRD models,<br/>offer an inference speedup of as high as 22.35% with just one line of change in huggingface’s (§3.3).<br/>These LoRD models can be further compressed via the near-lossless quantization method of SpQR<br/>Dettmers et al. (2023b) to reduce it’s precision to 8 and 4 bits without any further reduction in<br/>HumanEval performance (§4.1). Finally, these decomposed models also reduce the memory requirements of adapter finetuning by 21.2% over QLoRA (§4.2).<br/>2This overhead in sparse matrix occurs from having to store indices/bitmasks to indicate which values are<br/>present and not. This can be very significant at low levels of sparsity.

Approaches like weighted SVD (Hsu<br/>et al., 2022) and SVD over both weight and data (Chen et al., 2021b) have been proposed but<br/>are prohibitively expensive to scale to larger models for their requirement of backpropagation over<br/>calibration dataset. SVD over very large weight matrices is also very computationally expensive.<br/>So, we instead leverage the observation that activations in transformers are low-ranked (Feng et al.,<br/>2022) and adapt the more heuristically driven approach of Atomic Feature Mimicking (AFM) (Yu<br/>& Wu, 2023) that creates low rank matrices conditioned on a small amount of calibration data.<br/>Specifically, consider the eigen-decomposition of Covariance over Y as<br/>E[yyT<br/>] − E[y]E[y]<br/>T = QˆΛˆQˆT<br/>(4)<br/>Here Qˆ is a matrix of its eigenvectors, hence Qˆ<br/>:,:rQˆT<br/>:,:r ≈ I. Using this, we can write the output<br/>vector Y as Y ≈ Qˆ<br/>:,:rQˆT<br/>:,:rY . By writing Y in terms of W, X and b from Equation 1, we have:<br/>Y ≈ Qˆ<br/>:,:rQˆT<br/>:,:rW X + Qˆ<br/>:,:rQˆT<br/>:,:r<br/>b (5)<br/>Comparing to Equation 1, this gives us B = Qˆ<br/>:,:r ∈ R<br/>d1×r<br/>, A = QˆT<br/>:,:rW ∈ R<br/>r×d2 and ˜b =<br/>Qˆ<br/>:,:rQˆT<br/>:,:r<br/>b ≈ b. This approach is also straightforward to adapt for LLMs like LLaMa (Touvron<br/>et al., 2023), Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023), CodeLLaMa (Roziere et al., 2023) which do not have a bias term in the linear layer by setting ˜b to zero vector. 3 Preprint: Work in Progress 2.2 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS We take our python calibration dataset from the stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022) and consider the corresponding subset of the stack smol (Bigcode, 2022) as validation data. We filter out those sequences which are less than 1024 tokens or 10240 characters in length. We consider CodeGen and StarCoder model family of models. CodeGen mono models are present across 350M, 2B, 6B and 16B parameters and are CodeGen models that were further trained on only python code. StarCoder 16B is the StarCoderBase 16B model further trained on only python code from the stack dataset’s train split. We also consider StarCoderBase at 3B and 7B parameter sizes in StarCoder family due to the lack of their monolingual counterparts. All our experiments were performed on a single A100 GPU in under an hour for each run. For studying the trends of increase in perplexity for a reduction in rank across difference model sizes, we set a fixed low-rank r for all the layers. Later we discuss how to achieve compression and inference speedup via low-rank decomposition in §3 2.3 CHANGE IN PERPLEXITY ACROSS REDUCTION IN RANK Figure 1a and 1b show the trends of increase in perplexity across reduction in rank of the weight matrix of CodeGen and StarCoder models. For the largest models in both families, we observe only about a 1% increase in perplexity for 10% reduction in rank, and upto 35% reduction in rank for less than 10% increase in perplexity. The smallest model, CodeGen Mono 350M, however, can only be decomposed to 35% rank reduction for a similar drop in perplexity. We observe that the perplexity changes much slower for larger models as the % rank reduces, and hence can be compressed mode, similar to observations in quantization and pruning (Li et al., 2020). It should be noted that for most models, more than 50% leads to significant output quality degradation. (a) Perplexity vs % Rank Reduction for CodeGen Models. (b) Perplexity vs % Rank Reduction for StarCoder Models. Figure 1: Perplexity vs %Reduction in Rank for Different Models. 3 COMPRESSION AND SPEEDUP THROUGH DECOMPOSITION In this section, we discuss how we adapt the LOw Rank Decomposition (LoRD) for reducing the size of model and achieving inference speedup without a significant reduction in the output quality of the model. Following (Kim et al., 2023a), we assume memory bandwidth is the bottleneck for inference, and thus speedups for decoding are directly proportional to the size of the transformer model. 3.1 ACHIEVING COMPRESSION AND INFERENCE SPEEDUP Threshold for size reduction across rank reduction: Consider a weight matrix W ∈ R d1×d2 of a transformer layer with low rank decomposed A ∈ R r×d2 and B ∈ R d1×r . The number of parameters before and after decomposition respectively are d1d2 and r(d1 + d2). Therefore, if 4 Preprint: Work in Progress r > d1d2 (d1+d2) , (i.e a decomposition with small rank reduction), then the size of the model after decomposition can even be higher than the original models. Ideally, we would want the rank r << d1d2 (d1+d2) or r << dmin. Matrix Aspect Ratio and Compression: Let the ratio of the smaller dimension to the larger dimension of the matrix (i.e. the aspect ratio) be α = dmin dmax . For square matrix, α = 1 and for tall or fat matrices α << 1. We can rewrite, the percentage change in parameters from decomposition, in terms of percent change in rank %∆r = 100 ∗ dmin−r dmin % and aspect ratio as: 100 ∗ r(dmax + dmin) − dmaxdmin dmaxdmin = 100α − (1 + α)%∆r (6) It should be noted that change in parameters from decomposition can either be positive (the number of parameters increased after decomposition), or negative (the number of parameters decreased after decomposition). In order to achieve model compression and consequently inference speedups, one would want a very high negative percentage change in parameters. Figure 2: Parity Point across various aspect ratios (α) of the different linear layers in transformers. Parity Point for Compression across Rank Reduction: Using Eq. 6, one can observe that little reduction in rank, may lead to increase in model parameters instead of decreasing. For instance, square matrices (α = 1) will have 100% increase (i.e doubling in size), then %∆r → 0+ and only after the rank is reduced by more than 50%, will the Parity Point of the rank reduction be reached, that offers same or lesser number of a parameter in the decomposed layer as the original matrix. This parity point for tall or fat matrices (α → 0+), can be achieved with a very small percent reduction in rank and can start giving a reduction in model size. For compression to be achieved, we would want to reduce the rank by an amount to cross this parity point threshold. However, reducing the rank by a lot can degrade performance significantly. So we must take the aspect ratio into account, in order to achieve compression without much reduction in rank (and hence no significant degradation in output quality) A transformer model had different aspect ratios across its various linear layers, α = 1.00 for output projection after attention, α = 0.96 for Multi-query attention (Shazeer, 2019) projections, α = 0.25 for typical MLP projections with intermediate expansion factor of 4 as in the original transformer and as low as α = 0.12 for the embedding and language model head projection of CodeGen 16B with 51200 vocab size. Figure 2 plots the % change in the size of the model across % reduction in rank for matrices with different aspect ratios. For square matrices and near square matrices, a small rank reduction doubles the size of the linear layer after decomposition, and only after its parity point of 50% reduction is the size after decomposition, the same as original matrix. By this extent of rank decomposition, the performance starts to significantly degrade, as seen in §2.3. All the previous works on smaller models, address this by retraining the model (Yu & Wu, 2023; Chen et al., 2021b; Hsu et al., 2022; Ben Noach & Goldberg, 2020), often via knowledge distillation supervision (Hinton et al., 2015; Sanh et al., 2019) on specific narrow tasks. However, retraining is infeasible for larger models. Thus, we skip matrices with very high aspect ratios such as output projection or multi-query attention for decomposition. In contrast, the weights in MLP achieve parity at only 20% rank reduction. While embeddings and LM Head can be compressed through decomposition, as they have been for smaller transformer models (Baevski & Auli, 2019; Lan et al., 2020), they contribute only a very small portion of the weight of the model. So, we do not consider decomposing these matrices. In order to reduce the aspect ratio of matrices, we group layers with the same input vector to have the same bottleneck matrix after decomposition. Doing so, enables re-use of computation, and sharing of weights, as well as bringing the aspect ratio down to achieve compression as lower rank reduction. Candidate layers for grouping include the query, key and value projection matrices 5 Preprint: Work in Progress in multi-headed attention with aspect ratio reduced to α = 0.33 and the gating layer in SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020) with first linear linear of MLP in models like LLaMa (Touvron et al., 2023) with α = 0.1875. (a) CodeGen 16B. (b) StarCoder 16B. Figure 3: Parameter Reduction vs perplexity for decomposition across various layers. Trends across different layers in a transformer block: In addition to considering the parity point into account for deciding which layers to decompose, we also additionally study the sensitivity of each of these layers to low rank decomposition across the large model in the two model families. Figure 3 shows the increase in perplexity vs reduction in model parameters for the two models. For both models, decomposing all the linear layers achieves the parity point much later than any one of these linear layers with low aspect ratio. For CodeGen, the attention weight matrix (query, key and values projection) offers least increase in perplexity for the biggest drop in parameter count, make this layer the most suitable candidate to be decomposed. It shows less than 1% increase in perplexity even after 39.58% rank reduction. We observe the mlp 2 (downscaling mlp) to be a better candidate for decomposition than mlp 1 (upscaling mlp) across both models. This makes mlp 2 to be a good candidate for low-rank decomposition over the StarCoder model. Hardware Considerations: On modern hardware accelerators like GPU and their corresponding software stack, matrix multiplication kernels are faster if their dimensions are divisible by a high factor of 2. So, we consider ranks at a reduction of approximately every 10%, rounded off to the nearest multiple of 128 in our experiments. 3.2 PERFORMANCE OF COMPRESSED MODELS We consider the largest models of StarCoder and CodeGen family (16B) and perform low-rank decomposition on both with varying ranks. We consider decomposing layers that offers most parameter reduction (§3.1) with least increase in perplexity - mlp 2 for StarCoder and attention for CodeGen. We report the Pass@1 and Pass@10 scores over the Human Eval dataset (Chen et al., 2021a) using the code-eval GitHub repo (Bacaj, 2023) in Table 1. We observe that StarCoder models can be low rank decomposed to 13.2B parameters (50% rank reduction) with no drop in Pass@1 performance and upto 12.3B parameters (62.5% rank reduction) with very little drop. CodeGen models shows similar trend in drop in Human Eval performance when measured in terms of rank reduction. However, in terms of parameter reduction count, while showing very little perplexity change with large reduction in rank (Fig. 3a), shows much more drop in its HumanEval score when measured in terms of parameter count reduction due to a higher aspect ratio of the matrix being decomposed. It should be noted that for certain compressed models, the Pass@1 even slightly improves over the base model. Similar trend of slight improvements from compression across various metrics and benchmarks has been observed in the case of other compression attempts (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023; Cerebras, 2022). 6 Preprint: Work in Progress Starcoder 16B CodeGen 16B Mono Model Type Rank HumanEval Score Model Type Rank HumanEval Score Pass @ 1 Pass @ 10 Pass @ 1 Pass @ 10 Base Model 6144 31.67 48.28 Base Model 6144 29.02 46.34 LoRDCoder 14.9B 4480 33.18 48.41 LoRDCoder 15.9B 4480 29.08 46.95 LoRDCoder 14.5B 4096 31.69 45.12 LoRDCoder 15.6B 4096 28.90 46.24 LoRDCoder 13.8B 3584 30.90 47.56 LoRDCoder 15.1B 3584 28.54 45.73 LoRDCoder 13.2B 3072 31.57 45.36 LoRDCoder 14.7B 3072 27.99 43.29 LoRDCoder 12.6B 2560 29.84 42.31 LoRDCoder 14.3B 2560 27.32 45.12 LoRDCoder 12.3B 2304 29.22 40.12 LoRDCoder 14.1B 2304 27.07 41.46 Table 1: Human Eval Score of LoRD across StarCoder and CodeGen. 3.3 SPEEDUP FROM LORD We next consider accessing the inference speedup (forward pass) of the models over the standard cuBLAS floating point kernels. We consider the standard Huggingface implementation (Wolf et al., 2020) of Starcoder with pytorch backend (Paszke et al., 2019) utilizing standard cuBLAS kernels on A100 GPUs. LoRD decomposed models were implemented by modifying just one line of code to replace an MLP with an extra linear layer 3 . We benchmark over 1024 tokens and 512 tokens sequence, averaged across 10 runs with warm up of 3 runs. We plot relative time taken and model size across reduction in rank in Figure Figure 4: Time and Model size of StarCoder 16B across ranks. 4. Inference speedups as high as 22.35% are observed for decomposed models. The lines in the graph are generally downward sloping, Therefore reduction in rank beyond 25% generally implies less inference time and reduction in model size. However, the underlying hardware (and pertaining software kernels) also significantly affect the speedup gains. We notice huge gains, whenever the rank is rounded off to a multiple of a very high power of 2 (like 4096 and 2560 at 33% and 58% rank reduction), despite very little reduction in model size. In contrast, for certain ranks which are multiples of a lesser power of 2 (like 3584 and 2304 at 41% and 62% rank reduction) are slower than those at slightly higher ranks. It is worth noting that affect of hardware inefficient matrix shape is less significant for longer tokens sequence of 1024 because the O(n 2 ) attention overhead starts becoming more significant, especially in the absence of SoTA attention implementation techniques (Rabe & Staats, 2021; Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) as in the case of Huggingface’s implementations. 4 COMBINING LORD WITH QUANTIZATION AND LORA 4.1 QUANTIZATION While LoRD enables compression at same precision level, we study whether the decomposed models can be further compressing through quantization. Table 2 shows the HumanEval pass@1 results for the different LoRDCoder across 8 and 4 bit quantization levels, using the near lossless quantization technique of SpQR (Dettmers et al., 2023b). We observe that the LoRD models can be combined with quantization for further compression, showing no performance drop for 8-bit and very little performance drop on 4-bit quantization for most models. Slight increase in HumanEval after quantization is also observed, similar to Pangu-Coder2 (Shen et al., 2023). 4.2 PARAMETER EFFICIENT TUNING OF LORD MODELS 3 nn.Linear(in, out) -> nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(in, rank), nn.Linear(rank, out)) 7 Preprint: Work in Progress Model Pass@1@FP16 Pass@1@8-bit Pass@1@4-bit LoRDCoder 14.9B 33.18 33.17 32.01 LoRDCoder 14.5B 31.69 31.58 32.74 LoRDCoder 13.8B 30.90 31.10 30.73 LoRDCoder 13.2B 31.57 31.52 32.01 LoRDCoder 12.6B 29.84 29.87 30.22 LoRDCoder 12.3B 29.22 29.14 29.45 Table 2: Human Eval score of quantized LoRDCoder models. d x d d x r’ r’ x d d x r’ r’ x d d x r r x d d r’ h x d r’ h x r LoRD Weights a) LoRA b) LoRD + LoRA Pr e t r a i n ed W e i g h t s A R X R Y R W R X R Y R B R Figure 5: LoRA vs LoRD + LoRA. We next test the potential for using LoRD to further reduce the memory usage over existing parameterefficient techniques. We consider the code instruction dataset (Chaudhary, 2023) and filter those examples that pertains to python programming language. We use QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023a), which is an even more memory efficient version of LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) storing the weights in quantized format, for fine-tuning for 1 epoch. We compare results from fine-tuning two of the decomposed models LoRDCoder 13.2B and LoRDCoder 12.3B model to the StarCoder model. We observe a HumanEval pass@1 of 37.80 and 37.62 across LoRDCoder 13.2B and LoRDCoder 12.3B fine-tuning, competitive to the performance of 37.74 offered by StarCoder model. 5 RELATED WORK There is a growing interest in compressing pretrained Large Language Models. Several recent attempts have been dedicated to the quantization of weights of LLMs (Frantar et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Park et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023b; Chee et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a) with tricks such as outlier separation (Dettmers et al., 2022; Dettmers & Zettlemoyer, 2022; Dettmers et al., 2023c; Wei et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023a; Lee et al., 2023). Some attempts also quantize the activations (intermediate representations) in addition to weights to speed up computation time (Shao et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023). The works in quantization that are closest to us is the LowRank Compensation (LoRC) Strategy (Yao et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023), where the difference of the quantized matrix to the original matrix is approximated by a product of low-rank matrices. Our work decomposes the entire matrix for compression. Pruning neural networks Liang et al. (2021), unlike quantization, reduces the number of parameters in a model by removing unimportant weights or connections. Several techniques have been proposed to scale pruning methods for LLMs (Sun et al., 2023a; Frantar & Alistarh, 2023; Ma et al., 2023). However, pruning as a means of compression is yet to become viable due to no speedups over sparse matrices without significant performance drop at extreme levels of sparsity or structured sparsity (Zhu et al., 2023). With low-rank decomposition, we propose an alternate method for reducing model parameters that offer speedup even at a little reduction in parameter count. Certain works have also attempted to (Ren & Zhu, 2023; Li et al., 2023b) to split a dense matrix as a sum of lowrank matrices and a sparse matrix. However, these methods require retraining and have been shown to work only for Language Models of less than a billion parameters. Low rank decomposition has been proposed for smaller language models like Bert or GPT2 before using SVD decomposition (Ben Noach & Goldberg, 2020) and Kronecker decompositions (Tahaei et al., 2022; Edalati et al., 2022). Hsu et al. (2022) modified SVD to be data aware based on approximate second-order gradient information. A better weighted SVD was proposed by (Hua et al., 2022). Chen et al. (2021b) proposed a data aware decomposition method with a provably optimal closed-form solution, utilizing a large amount of data points over specific tasks to decompose. Sev8 Preprint: Work in Progress eral recent works (Yu & Wu, 2023; Feng et al., 2022) have shown that while the weight matrix of neural networks is not inherently low-rank, the intermediate representations are, thus propose to decompose based on representations. All these works have focused on small language models and require re-training. We proposed low-rank decomposition for compressing neural networks without the need for retraining. The factorization has also been used just for the embedding layers (Baevski & Auli, 2019; Lan et al., 2020), as they are good candidates due to their very low aspect ratio of 0.015, where a reduction of rank by even 5% would lead to reduction in number of parameters after decomposition. There is also a growing interest in fine-tuning large language models Taori et al. (2023); Chiang et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023b); Sun et al. (2023b). With the large memory requirements for finetuning full parameters of the LLM, the more parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) are getting widely adopted. These methods freeze the original LLM weights, and attach two low-rank matrices or adapters, in a skip-connection (He et al., 2016) to the linear layers of the model. These parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches have seen improvements in lower activation memory (Zhang et al., 2023) or by keeping non-trainable model weights at 4-bit precision (Dettmers et al., 2023a). Our work, while focused on compression through low-rank decomposition, can also enable more efficient fine-tuning, especially in conjunction with existing methods. 6 CONCLUSION We studied the compression of monolingual code generation models through a novel one-shot compression paradigm of low-rank decomposition. We analyse the change in perplexity with change in rank across the model families of StarCoder and CodeGen as well as their individual layers and observe that the rank of these models can be reduced by upto 39.58% with less than 1% change in perplexity. We then proposed considerations for one-shot compressing these models through LOw Rank Decomposition (LoRD) in under 10 minutes. Consequently, we compress StarCoder 16B to 13.2B with no drop in HumanEval pass@1 and very little drop in HumanEval pass@1 to 12.3B parameters. With a minimal change in code over huggingface’s default inference code of just one line, we gain speedups of up to 22.35%. The LoRD models are also compatible with near lossless quantization techniques of SpQR, which offers gains of quantization based compression in addition to ones from decomposition. The LoRD models also reduce memory requirements by as much as 21.2% over vanilla QLoRA fine-tuning. 7 BROADER IMPACT AND FUTURE WORK Our work on LoRD, compresses code LLMs which enables them to run on smaller GPUs including as consumer grade GPUs. This is especially of pressing importance for the next few years when the shortage of GPU supply is relative to the increasing demand in today’s market. Moreover, faster inference helps reduce the GPU cycles, enabling lower running costs and lower power consumption for LLM inference. Our work helps reduce the carbon emissions incurred and moves towards a greener NLP. Through compression, our work also promotes inference at the edge, and therefore opening room for applications involving strict privacy requirements. Lower latency will also help improve the User Experience in applications like CoPilots where lag between suggestions can impact developer’s productivity. Several of these benefits of LoRD such as lower cost and energy consumption are also applicable for fine-tuning use cases of LLMs. Our work opens up a new paradigm for compression via Low Rank Decomposition over Large Language Models in a single shot without the need for retraining. Since, LoRD models can leverage existing floating point kernels across BLAS and cuBLAS, in contrast to quantization, these are much easier to implement and reap inference benefits. Our study on hardware considerations for speedup also opens up the potential for tuning the rank of decomposed models to fit best on the target hardware and the accompanying GEMM kernels. While our study is limited to monolingual code LLMs, the low rank decomposition technique is general and not specific to code domain. Thus exploring its applicability to more general purpose models like LLaMa is a promising direction for the compression of transformer LLMs beyond quantization. Another interesting unexplored question is whether the LoRA or QLoRA modules fine-tuned on original models, can be plugged in as-is for the LoRD models without any performance drop”” Alright, let’s simplify this down to the basics. Imagine you have a giant room full of filing cabinets, and each cabinet represents a piece of information needed for a computer program to understand and produce code, like creating software. This room is like a model that helps developers by suggesting or writing code. As you can imagine, a room that big takes a lot of time and energy to search through, not to mention the space it occupies! Now, suppose we find a clever way to organize this room. Instead of having all these separate, bulky filing cabinets, we rearrange them into fewer, smaller cabinets but in such a way that we can still find all the information we need, just as quickly – if not faster. This rearrangement process is kind of what Ayush Kaushal and their team have done with computer programs used in coding, specifically, a kind called Large Language Models (LLMs) that are trained to understand and generate code. Their method is called “LOw Rank Decomposition” (LoRD), which is a fancy way of saying they found a smart way to compress or shrink down the model without losing its effectiveness. Just like how rearranging the filing room makes it easier, quicker, and cheaper to find the files you need, LoRD makes these LLMs faster, smaller, and less expensive to run. Why does this matter? Well, smaller and faster models mean they can work on less powerful computers, making this technology accessible to more people. It also means they can operate more efficiently, saving on electricity and contributing less to carbon emissions, which is better for our planet. Moreover, because these compressed models still understand and produce code just as well, developers can use them without having to go through a lengthy process of teaching the model all over again, which saves a tremendous amount of time and resources. They even showed that we could squeeze these models down pretty significantly – making them up to 39.58% smaller! – with little to no loss in their ability to generate code effectively. Finally, the team found these slimmed-down models could work even better when combined with other techniques (quantization and fine-tuning methods), making them even more efficient and adaptable. In essence, this research opens the door to making powerful coding-assist tools more accessible and environmentally friendly, bringing the benefits of AI to more people while conserving valuable resources. I stumbled across a Github repo for “Low-Rank adapter extraction for fine-tuned transformers model. This repository contains code for extracting LoRA adapters from finetuned transformers models, using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models. The technique presented here allows extracting PEFT compatible Low-Rank adapters from full fine-tunes or merged model. A bit more about PEFT. PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a library for efficiently adapting large pretrained models to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all of a model’s parameters because it is prohibitively costly. PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters - significantly decreasing computational and storage costs - while yielding performance comparable to a fully fine-tuned model. This makes it more accessible to train and store large language models (LLMs) on consumer hardware. PEFT is integrated with the Transformers, Diffusers, and Accelerate libraries to provide a faster and easier way to load, train, and use large models for inference. Now, I found a huggingface profile that has a Low-rank decomposition of ezelikman’s (original paper author) quietstar-8-ahead model using mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 as a base.

I have a potential guide located here: ““LoRA methods A popular way to efficiently train large models is to insert (typically in the attention blocks) smaller trainable matrices that are a low-rank decomposition of the delta weight matrix to be learnt during finetuning. The pretrained model’s original weight matrix is frozen and only the smaller matrices are updated during training. This reduces the number of trainable parameters, reducing memory usage and training time which can be very expensive for large models. There are several different ways to express the weight matrix as a low-rank decomposition, but Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the most common method. The PEFT library supports several other LoRA variants, such as Low-Rank Hadamard Product (LoHa), Low-Rank Kronecker Product (LoKr), and Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation (AdaLoRA). You can learn more about how these methods work conceptually in the Adapters guide. If you’re interested in applying these methods to other tasks and use cases like semantic segmentation, token classification, take a look at our notebook collection! This guide will show you how to quickly train an image classification model - with a low-rank decomposition method - to identify the class of food shown in an image. Some familiarity with the general process of training an image classification model would be really helpful and allow you to focus on the low-rank decomposition methods. If you’re new, we recommend taking a look at the Image classification guide first from the Transformers documentation. When you’re ready, come back and see how easy it is to drop PEFT in to your training! Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed. Copied pip install -q peft transformers datasets Dataset In this guide, you’ll use the Food-101 dataset which contains images of 101 food classes (take a look at the dataset viewer to get a better idea of what the dataset looks like). Load the dataset with the load_dataset function. Copied from datasets import load_dataset ds = load_dataset(“food101”) Each food class is labeled with an integer, so to make it easier to understand what these integers represent, you’ll create a label2id and id2label dictionary to map the integer to its class label. Copied labels = ds[“train”].features[“label”].names label2id, id2label = dict(), dict() for i, label in enumerate(labels): label2id[label] = i id2label[i] = label id2label[2] “baklava” Load an image processor to properly resize and normalize the pixel values of the training and evaluation images. Copied from transformers import AutoImageProcessor image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(“google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k”) You can also use the image processor to prepare some transformation functions for data augmentation and pixel scaling. Copied from torchvision.transforms import ( CenterCrop, Compose, Normalize, RandomHorizontalFlip, RandomResizedCrop, Resize, ToTensor, ) normalize = Normalize(mean=image_processor.image_mean, std=image_processor.image_std) train_transforms = Compose( [ RandomResizedCrop(image_processor.size[“height”]), RandomHorizontalFlip(), ToTensor(), normalize, ] ) val_transforms = Compose( [ Resize(image_processor.size[“height”]), CenterCrop(image_processor.size[“height”]), ToTensor(), normalize, ] ) def preprocess_train(example_batch): example_batch[“pixel_values”] = [train_transforms(image.convert(“RGB”)) for image in example_batch[“image”]] return example_batch def preprocess_val(example_batch): example_batch[“pixel_values”] = [val_transforms(image.convert(“RGB”)) for image in example_batch[“image”]] return example_batch Define the training and validation datasets, and use the set_transform function to apply the transformations on-the-fly. Copied train_ds = ds[“train”] val_ds = ds[“validation”] train_ds.set_transform(preprocess_train) val_ds.set_transform(preprocess_val) Finally, you’ll need a data collator to create a batch of training and evaluation data and convert the labels to torch.tensor objects. Copied import torch def collate_fn(examples): pixel_values = torch.stack([example[“pixel_values”] for example in examples]) labels = torch.tensor([example[“label”] for example in examples]) return {“pixel_values”: pixel_values, “labels”: labels} Model Now let’s load a pretrained model to use as the base model. This guide uses the google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k model, but you can use any image classification model you want. Pass the label2id and id2label dictionaries to the model so it knows how to map the integer labels to their class labels, and you can optionally pass the ignore_mismatched_sizes=True parameter if you’re finetuning a checkpoint that has already been finetuned. Copied from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained( “google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k”, label2id=label2id, id2label=id2label, ignore_mismatched_sizes=True, ) PEFT configuration and model Every PEFT method requires a configuration that holds all the parameters specifying how the PEFT method should be applied. Once the configuration is setup, pass it to the get_peft_model() function along with the base model to create a trainable PeftModel. Call the print_trainable_parameters() method to compare the number of parameters of PeftModel versus the number of parameters in the base model! LoRA decomposes the weight update matrix into two smaller matrices. The size of these low-rank matrices is determined by its rank or r. A higher rank means the model has more parameters to train, but it also means the model has more learning capacity. You’ll also want to specify the target_modules which determine where the smaller matrices are inserted. For this guide, you’ll target the query and value matrices of the attention blocks. Other important parameters to set are lora_alpha (scaling factor), bias (whether none, all or only the LoRA bias parameters should be trained), and modules_to_save (the modules apart from the LoRA layers to be trained and saved). All of these parameters - and more - are found in the LoraConfig. Copied from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model config = LoraConfig( r=16, lora_alpha=16, target_modules=[“query”, “value”], lora_dropout=0.1, bias=“none”, modules_to_save=[“classifier”], ) model = get_peft_model(model, config) model.print_trainable_parameters() “trainable params: 667,493 || all params: 86,543,818 || trainable%: 0.7712775047664294” Training For training, let’s use the Trainer class from Transformers. The Trainer contains a PyTorch training loop, and when you’re ready, call train to start training. To customize the training run, configure the training hyperparameters in the TrainingArguments class. With LoRA-like methods, you can afford to use a higher batch size and learning rate. AdaLoRA has an update_and_allocate() method that should be called at each training step to update the parameter budget and mask, otherwise the adaptation step is not performed. This requires writing a custom training loop or subclassing the Trainer to incorporate this method. As an example, take a look at this custom training loop. Copied from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer account = “stevhliu” peft_model_id = f”{account}/google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k-lora” batch_size = 128 args = TrainingArguments( peft_model_id, remove_unused_columns=False, evaluation_strategy=“epoch”, save_strategy=“epoch”, learning_rate=5e-3, per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size, gradient_accumulation_steps=4, per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size, fp16=True, num_train_epochs=5, logging_steps=10, load_best_model_at_end=True, label_names=[“labels”], ) Begin training with train. Copied trainer = Trainer( model, args, train_dataset=train_ds, eval_dataset=val_ds, tokenizer=image_processor, data_collator=collate_fn, ) trainer.train() Share your model Once training is complete, you can upload your model to the Hub with the push_to_hub method. You’ll need to login to your Hugging Face account first and enter your token when prompted. Copied from huggingface_hub import notebook_login notebook_login() Call push_to_hub to save your model to your repositoy. Copied model.push_to_hub(peft_model_id) Inference Let’s load the model from the Hub and test it out on a food image. Copied from peft import PeftConfig, PeftModel from transfomers import AutoImageProcessor from PIL import Image import requests config = PeftConfig.from_pretrained(“stevhliu/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k-lora”) model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained( config.base_model_name_or_path, label2id=label2id, id2label=id2label, ignore_mismatched_sizes=True, ) model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, “stevhliu/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k-lora”) url = “https://huggingface.co/datasets/sayakpaul/sample-datasets/resolve/main/beignets.jpeg” image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw) image Convert the image to RGB and return the underlying PyTorch tensors. Copied encoding = image_processor(image.convert(“RGB”), return_tensors=“pt”) Now run the model and return the predicted class!

The process can be outlined in a few structured steps, adapted from your description: # Step 1: Environment Preparation Ensure your environment is ready by installing necessary libraries: pip install -q peft transformers datasets # Step 2: Dataset Preparation For your task, you’re focusing on an image classification model. Load the specified dataset: from datasets import load_dataset ds = load_dataset(“food101”) Set up label dictionaries for easy reference: labels = ds[“train”].features[“label”].names label2id, id2label = {label: i for i, label in enumerate(labels)}, {i: label for i, label in enumerate(labels)} # Step 3: Image Processor Setup Prepare your image data correctly by setting up an image processor: from transformers import AutoImageProcessor image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(“google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k”) Implement the necessary transformations: from torchvision.transforms import Compose, Resize, CenterCrop, ToTensor, Normalize, RandomResizedCrop, RandomHorizontalFlip # Define your train and validation transformations here based on the example provided in the guide. Apply transformations to your dataset: # Apply preprocess_train and preprocess_val functions on your train and validation datasets. # Step 4: Model Loading and PEFT Configuration Load a pre-trained model that will serve as your base for fine-tuning: from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained( “google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k”, label2id=label2id, id2label=id2label ) Configure your LoRA settings: from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model config = LoraConfig( r=16, # Rank of the decomposition target_modules=[“query”, “value”], # Specifying where the LoRA adapters will be inserted. lora_alpha=16, bias=“none”, modules_to_save=[“classifier”] # Specify if any other module needs to be saved along with LoRA adapters. ) model = get_peft_model(model, config) # Step 5: Training Set up your training arguments: from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer args = TrainingArguments( # Define your training arguments here. ) Initiate the training with the Trainer class: trainer = Trainer( model=model, args=args, train_dataset=train_ds, eval_dataset=val_ds, data_collator=collate_fn, ) trainer.train() # Step 6: Model Sharing To share your fine-tuned model, first log in to Hugging Face: from huggingface_hub import notebook_login notebook_login() Push your model to the Hub: model.push_to_hub(“your-model-name-here”) # Step 7: Inference For performing inference, ensure you load the correct model and configuration from the Hub. Then, pass an image through the model to get predictions. Ensure you adapt each step’s example codes to your specific scenario, especially modifying the paths and model names as necessary. This comprehensive approach will allow you to fine-tune a model on the Food-101 dataset with LoRA and possibly other PEFT techniques, share it and perform inference efficiently. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # New conversation : I am actually trying to use the LORD repo to understand how i can implement the main idea from this paper: \\"\\" Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking Eric Zelikman Stanford University Georges Harik Notbad AI Inc Yijia Shao Stanford University Varuna Jayasiri Notbad AI Inc Nick Haber Stanford University Noah D. Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results. We evaluate the extent to which the model trained with Quiet-STaR generalizes to directly answering problems that require reasoning. The left plot (a) shows the zero-shot accuracy on GSM8K, while the right plot (b) shows the zero-shot accuracy on CommonsenseQA, without any fine-tuning. In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities.\\"\\"","output":"Implementing the concepts from the \\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking\\" paper to improve a model's reasoning capabilities involves several intricate steps tied to model training, rationale generation, and integrating meta-tokens. The paper proposes a methodology where a large language model (LLM) generates intermediate \\"thoughts\\" or rationales for better prediction accuracy on subsequent tokens, thus simulating a process of \\"thinking\\" similar to human reasoning. Below is a simplified guide on potentially implementing these concepts based on understanding from the paper, structured to address your goal of understanding and applying key strategies from this research: # 1. **Understanding the Framework** At the core of Quiet-STaR is the process of generating rationales or \\"thoughts\\" after every token to aid in the prediction of future text. This is a departure from traditional LLM usage where output is generated based on the immediate prior tokens. The steps involved include: - **Thinking**: Generating internal rationales for each token. - **Talking**: Combining predictions from the LLM with and without the generated rationale. - **Learning**: Improving the rationale generation process over time based on its effectiveness in aiding predictions. # 2. **Parallel Rationale Generation** You will need to modify your model to allow for the parallel generation of rationales. The model should be capable of generating and evaluating multiple potential rationales for each token position in your input sequence, doing so in a way that limits the computational overhead typically associated with generating large numbers of potential outputs. # 3. **Meta-token Insertion** Incorporate special meta-tokens indicating the start and end of a thought. These tokens help segment the generated rationales from the rest of the text and are crucial for the model to understand when a rationale begins and ends. The optimization of these tokens' representations is essential for efficient rationale generation. # 4. **Mixing Heads for Prediction** Implement \\"mixing heads\\" in your model to dynamically weigh the influence of generated thoughts on next-token predictions. These are essentially decision layers that determine how much the rationale (if generated) should influence the prediction of the next token. # 5. **Reward-based Learning for Rationale Effectiveness** Use a reward-based learning approach (e.g., REINFORCE) to improve the generation of rationales over time. Rationales that lead to better predictions of future tokens should be rewarded, thereby encouraging the model to generate more effective thoughts in subsequent training iterations. # 6. **Practical Application Guide** - Start with a pre-trained large language model as your base. - Implement a system to generate parallel rationales (\\"thoughts\\") at each token position. Utilize efficient computational strategies to limit overhead. - Integrate meta-token optimization for the start and end of thoughts. - Develop mixing heads to evaluate and apply generated rationales to improve next-token predictions. - Apply a reward-based system to iteratively improve the generation of effective rationales. # 7. **Considerations for Implementation** Implementing Quiet-STaR involves dealing with several intricate details, especially around parallel processing and the dynamic application of generated thoughts. The process also requires careful consideration of computational resources due to the potential overhead from generating multiple rationales per token. In practical terms, applying these concepts involves a substantial modification to the architecture and training process of existing LLMs, highlighting the need for robust computational resources, efficient parallel processing techniques, and sophisticated reward mechanisms to iteratively refine the rationale generation process."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coffee in Shop with Flower | Versatile Art for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Unique Home Decor &amp; Fashion Statement.

The given data consists of more than 9 thousand rows of 4 input variables and 1 output variable. In the dataset the variables are well defined and you don’t really need any knowledge of the underlying domain physics; just be aware that the relationships between the inputs and outputs are quite complicated; hence successful (i.e. highly accurate) acquisition of the same by your ANN will demonstrate the capability of these machine learning mechanisms to capture complicated functional relationships that characterize a process and are encapsulated within data generated by the running process. Building up the software from scratch (except for available Python libraries like numpy, matplotlib, etc., do not use Deep Learning libraries for this assignment) to productively-operating levels will also give you the confidence of having mastered the nuts and bolts of this complex machine learning mechanism; in future you will be using high-level libraries but not as a semi-ignoramus just using these like black boxes. Importantly, if your self-built software is indeed generating good (i.e. accurate) results at efficient speeds – it is like your property which you can use for multiple applications in diverse domains! Regarding each of the crucial ANN development aspects, you are to broadly follow the approaches outlined below: Guidelines: 1. Data Splitting: Ideally, split the available data into 72 : 18 : 10 for training : validation : testing. While your training and validation data should be interspersed all across your given data set, your test data should be one or two continuous chunks from one or the other end of your data set. Your program should be written such that every epoch of training is followed by a run over all the validation data samples so that you get both the training error and validation error at every epoch. You may wonder why the numbers 72 : 18 – reason is that you should first pull out the 10% (testing) chunk, and what remains you can easily split into 80 : 20, i.e. create a loop where index divisible by 5 is sent to “validation data” while all else is sent to “training data”. Note you can also use Python libraries for performing this task. 2. ANN architecture: Apart from the fact that the number of nodes in the input layer equals the number of input variables, and correspondingly for output layer, and that there has to be at least one hidden layer, the rest is your creation. Just remember one rule of thumb, the number of unknowns should not be more than half the number of training data samples. So one hidden layer will have some number of neurons, and if you increase the number of hidden layers then the nodes per layer will reduce by the above rule. 3. Back-propagation equations: As given in equations (A – F). The operative aspects of these should be clear by now. Definitely use vectorization operations as they easily reduce computation times by two orders of magnitude. You can take a call on whether you want to do away with a for loop over the samples by using eqs. (F) and (E1) with complete vectorization, or continue to use a for loop to traverse through the samples using partial vectorization as in eqs. (D)-(E). Ideally, do both in two alternate programs, and then check the timings and accuracies for the same input data and network architecture. 4. Granulation of training data: Use mini-batches between sizes 64 and 256. However, at extreme ends, you should test with batch sizes of 1 (effectively SGD) and the full batch. Also, shuffle the order of presentation of mini-batches across epochs. Observe the impact of mini-batch sizes on training and validation convergence histories. Take the four sizes 1, 64, 256 and then full batch. 5. Activation functions: Use tanh, logistic and ReLU. Start with tanh, and then experiment with the others. Note that the output layer activations should not be ReLU, it has to be either of the other two, and preferably only logistic. Ensure that all nodes in a layer are using the same activation function. 6. I/O Normalization: Definitely normalize inputs and outputs between -1 and +1. If using logistic function at output nodes, then the outputs have to scaled between 0 and 1. Follow the matter on slide #39 as closely as possible. Errors or misjudgement in normalization and denormalization (at output nodes for test cases when you convert from range 0 to 1 to actual dimensions of the variable) can severely impact your program. The easiest way to normalize is to arrange each variable’s data in ascending order, evaluate the min. and max values, and then map these values to about 10% above -1 and 10% below +1. An equation you can use for linear normalization from actual range to -1 and +1. Note that x and X represent actual and normalized values. You will need to work out how to map actual minimum to -0.9 instead of to -1, and actual maximum to +0.9 instead of +1. That is a small exercise you have to do. A practical way is to create a virtual xmin 5% of the original range below the actual xmin, and a virtual xmax 5% of the original range above the actual xmax, and then use these virtual xmin and xmax in the above equation in place of the actual ones. 7. Weight Initialization: Capping the abs values of weights at a level (say +1) is a basic but crude form of regularization which must be implemented even if you are unable to implement L2 Regularization (below). 8. Learning rate parameter and L2 Regularization: Take learning rate as 0.001. This is easy to implement, the complexity comes from the value of lambda and its coupling with the value of learning rate. Very difficult to provide a ball-park figure. Easier thing to do is to freeze all other parameters, and then generate a series of solutions with the value of lambda increasing from 0, then 0.1 to 0.95 in three steps, and then plot the convergence histories (error values vs. epochs (could be semi-log plots of error)) for each case. Such a combined plot will give you insight into the impact of increasing bias (high regularization) on the solution. Independently, you can freezem lambda at 0, and then see the impact of using learning rate= 0.01, and 0.0001, on convergence histories. 9. Momentum term: Use eq. (K) in slide 46, with β as 0.9. When using L2 regularization, note that the second term of (K) is actually the eqn. 10. Stopping of training and final error calculation of test data: The importance of concurrently observing both the training and validation convergence histories has been stressed before and is necessary for critically analysing your ANN performance. This is also important for stopping of training at the lowest level of overfitting. Since the data set considered here is realistic noisy data, the approach should work. After observing the stoppage point as described in the slide, you should run once again with the maximum number of epochs set at the stopping value. You should write the computed weights at the end of training into a file in your hard disk properly maintaining the multiple layer and then matrix structure. When running test data, you should read from this file and perform only the forward calculations, and then extract the rms error of this test data, between actual and predicted outputs. So your code should be able to run in both modes – forward-plus-backward-training mode, and forward-only mode. For calculating errors in prediction on validation or test data, use the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Hence you shall have a MAPEval and a MAPEtest. Your submission should be a folder containing your code, and a word doc (PDF) containing your step-by-step algorithm, detailed comparisons of the impact of different parametric variations stated in italics in items # 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10. You should also explicitly state the best combination of parameters that work on each data set, and the corresponding MAPE’s. Note: 1. Do not try out Batch Normalization. Do not try out more than 3 hidden layers. 2. For a good software which will stand the test of time, all these experimentations should be performable using hyper-parameters that the program reads at start of execution. You should not have to change code internally for each of the above experimentations. 3. Run the code on the DGX-1 machine, rather than your laptops. Try to use the GPUs for parallelism. Check out speed-ups you may have obtained when compared to serial runs. 4. Under no circumstances should you use any of the high-level libraries for Deep Learning like Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch or any other. You should be writing your own Python codes, translating the given formulation in the slides to working program. However, you can use numpy, pandas, matplotlib and other regular Python libraries. Also, your team should do the work yourself without taking help from any other group.","output":"Considering the comprehensive guidelines provided, below is a summary of how to design and implement an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for regression on the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset without using high-level deep learning libraries.

The input and output layers should correspond to the features and the target variable of the dataset respectively. Keep the rule of thumb regarding the number of unknowns and training samples in mind. - **Initialize weights** carefully, with values not exceeding absolute values of 1 as a simple form of regularization. - **Choose activation functions** for your layers, starting with tanh and experimenting with logistic and ReLU for the hidden layers while keeping the output activation suitable for regression tasks. # Step 3: Training the Model - **Implement the back-propagation algorithm** to adjust the weights based on the error between the predicted and actual outputs. Use vectorization where possible for efficiency. - **Use mini-batch gradient descent** with various batch sizes to observe its impact on the training and validation processes. Shuffle the mini-batches each epoch. - **Apply momentum** with β=0.9 to the weight updates to help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions. - **Implement L2 regularization** and experiment with different lambda values to find the right balance that reduces overfitting without overly biasing the model. # Step 4: Model Evaluation and Testing - **Define a stopping criterion** based on the observation of training and validation errors to prevent overfitting. - **Calculate MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)** on both validation and test datasets to evaluate the model's performance and predictive accuracy. - **Save and load the model weights** for testing to simulate a real-world application where training and prediction are done separately. # Step 5: Experimentation and Optimization - **Systematically change hyperparameters** like the number of neurons, layers, learning rate, regularization strength, and activation functions to observe their impact on the model's performance. - **Document all findings** in a structured manner, highlighting how each variation affects the model and identifying the best set of parameters for the power plant dataset. # Step 6: Reporting - Prepare a detailed report (or PDF) containing: - The step-by-step algorithm of your implementation. - Comparisons of the impact of different parametric variations. - The best combination of parameters and their corresponding MAPE values for both validation and test sets. # Technical Considerations and Tools - Utilize Python and its libraries like \`numpy\` for numerical operations, \`pandas\` for data handling, and \`matplotlib\` for visualization. - Although not required, leveraging GPU resources for training can significantly speed up the process. Although you're advised to use a DGX-1 machine, ensure your code can also run on other environments for broader applicability. # Final Note Adhere strictly to the instruction not to use high-level Deep Learning libraries.

'소년법'을 예로 들어 이러한 관점이 어떻게 반영되고 부딪히고 있는지 정리해 보자","output":"오늘날 형벌의 목적에는 크게 두 가지가 있습니다. 하나는 '죄의 대가', 다시 말해 범죄에 대한 응보적 목적이고, 다른 하나는 미래를 위한 '예방', 즉 범죄의 재발을 방지하고자 하는 목적입니다. 이러한 관점은 소년법을 통해 잘 드러나며, 여기서는 두 목적 사이의 조화를 찾으려는 다양한 시도가 반영되고, 때로는 이 두 가지 접근법이 충돌하기도 합니다. # 소년법이란? 소년법은 소년(보통 10~19세 미만을 지칭하지만 국가마다 다를 수 있음)의 범죄행위에 대해 적용되는 특별한 법률입니다. 이는 성인에게 적용되는 일반 형사법률과는 다릅니다. 소년법의 기본 원칙은 소년이 법적, 심리적으로 미성숙하므로 범죄에 대한 처벌보다는 교화와 재활을 우선시한다는 데 있습니다. # 죄의 대가 vs. 예방 1. **죄의 대가**: 이 관점에서 소년법은 소년이 저지른 범죄에 대한 책임을 인정하고, 그에 상응하는 처분을 내려 응보적 정의를 실현하려 합니다. 이를 통해 사회적 정의를 구현하고 범죄에 대한 일반적인 경고 메시지를 보내고자 합니다. 그러나 소년의 경우, 이러한 응보는 그들의 미성숙한 상태와 재활 가능성을 감안해 상대적으로 완화된 형식을 취합니다. 2. **예방**: 소년법은 재활과 교육을 강조함으로써 소년이 장래에 법을 준수하는 건전한 사회 구성원으로 성장할 수 있도록 돕습니다. 이는 개인 예방뿐 아니라 사회적 예방 측면에서도 중요한 역할을 합니다. 소년을 지원하는 프로그램, 보호 관찰, 가정 내 또는 대안 학교에서의 교육 등은 범죄의 재발을 방지하고 더 넓은 사회적 차원에서 예방적 효과를 기대할 수 있도록 합니다. # 반영과 충돌 소년법에서 이 두 가지 관점은 동시에 반영됩니다. 범죄에 대해 적절한 법적 반응을 보이는 한편, 소년의 미래를 고려하여 교육과 재활에 중점을 둡니다. 하지만, 사건의 심각성, 피해자의 요구, 사회적 분위기 등에 따라 응보와 예방이 충돌하기도 합니다. 일부는 더 엄격한 처벌을 요구하며 소년법의 유화적 접근을 비판할 수 있습니다. 반면, 다른 이들은 장기적인 사회 통합과 소년의 개인적 성장에 더 중점을 두면서 예방적 접근과 재활을 강조합니다. 결국, 소년법은 죄의 대가와 미래 예방 사이의 균형을 찾으려는 지속적인 시도입니다. 이 과정에서 법, 정책, 그리고 사회의 변화와 발전에 따라 조정되며, 사회의 가치와 기대에 부응하는 방향으로 나아갈 것입니다."},{"instruction":"학교폭력 예방 및 대책에 관한 법률'에 명시된 '학교폭력'의 정의를 '장소/대상/피해를 중 심으로 정리해 보고, 이에 대한 해석이 형법과 다른 점은 무엇인지 말해 보자.","output":"# 학교폭력의 정의 '학교폭력 예방 및 대책에 관한 법률'(이하 '학폭법')에서는 학교폭력을 다음과 같이 정의합니다. 이 법률에서 규정하는 학교폭력은 학교 내외에서 이루어지는 신체적, 정신적 폭력 행위를 말하며, 이러한 폭력 행위는 학생들 사이에서 발생하는 것을 주 대상으로 합니다. 구체적으로 학교폭력의 정의는 아래와 같은 세 가지 주요 요소로 분석할 수 있습니다: 장소, 대상, 피해. 1. **장소**: 학폭법은 학교 내뿐만 아니라 학교 외에서 이루어지는 폭력 행위도 포함하여 광범위하게 적용됩니다. 학교 외 장소에는 학교 관련 활동이나 행사가 열리는 곳, 학생들이 주로 사용하는 통학로, 온라인 공간(사이버 공간) 등이 포함될 수 있습니다. 2. **대상**: 학폭법은 학생들 간에 발생하는 폭력 행위를 규정의 중심에 두고 있습니다. 이는 학생이 다른 학생에게 가하는 신체적, 정신적 폭력뿐 아니라 괴롭힘, 따돌림, 사이버 불링 등도 포함합니다. 3. **피해**: 학폭법에서 규정하는 피해는 신체적 또는 정신적 피해를 모두 포함합니다. 이는 학생의 정서 및 심리 상태에 미치는 영향을 고려하여 가해 학생의 행위로 인해 발생한 정신적 고통도 학교폭력의 범주 안에 들어갑니다. # 형법과의 차이점 학교폭력의 법적 처리에 있어서 학폭법과 형법 사이에는 몇 가지 중요한 차이점이 있습니다: 1. **목적과 적용 범위**: 학폭법의 주목적은 학교폭력의 예방 및 피해 학생의 보호에 있습니다. 이는 교육적, 보호적 조치에 보다 중점을 두고 있으며, 사건을 학교 및 교육 기관에서 처리할 수 있는 기반을 마련합니다. 반면 형법은 일반적인 범죄에 대해 처벌을 목적으로 하며 범죄 행위에 대한 국가적 제재를 정의하고 적용하는 것에 중점을 둡니다. 2. **처벌 및 대응**: 학폭법 하에서의 대응 조치는 보다 교육적이거나 복원적인 접근을 포함할 수 있으며, 이는 가해 학생의 재활과 피해 학생의 심리적 회복을 지원하는 데 초점을 맞춥니다. 이에 반해 형법은 위법 행위에 대한 법적 책임을 묻고 해당 범죄 행위에 대한 형사 처벌(예: 벌금, 징역 등)을 규정합니다. 3. **절차**: 학폭법 하에서의 처리 절차는 학교폭력대책자치위원회와 같은 학교 내 기구를 통해 이루어지며, 이 과정에서 교사, 상담가, 외부 전문가 등이 참여할 수 있습니다. 형법에 따른 처리는 일반적으로 수사 기관과 법원을 통해 이루어지며, 형사 소송 절차에 따라 진행됩니다. 이러한 차이점은 학교폭력에 대응하는 방식과 관련 정책의 설계에 있어서 학폭법이 형법보다는 더 신속하고 유연한 대응이 가능하며, 학생들의 복지와 교육적 재활을 우선시하는 점을 반영합니다."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Pode solicitar apoio ao seu Power Account Manager, ou ver o video formativo abaixo com duração de 3 min. Diferença de horario, simples, bi-horario e tri-horario \\"Tarifa Simples - Esta tarifa é a mais contratada pelas famílias lusas. Todas as comercializadoras de energia oferecem este tipo de tarifa, que consiste em cobrar sempre o mesmo preço, independentemente do horário, tanto de termo fixo como de termo de consumo. Tarifa Bi-horaria - As tarifas bi-horárias podem ser de ciclo diário ou semanal, onde o preço do termo fixo (potência ou aluguer contador) é igual, mas o termo de consumo varia segundo a hora do dia. Nas horas de vazio o preço do termo de consumo é mais baixo, nas horas fora de vazio, os preços aumentam. Os clientes que usam electricidade principalmente entre as 22:00 e as 8:00, ou aos domingos, no caso do ciclo semanal, são altamente beneficiados por esta tarifa. Horas de Vazio: horas em que geralmente o consumo é mais baixo e o preço da energia é mais baixo (até 50% do preço regulado pela ERSE) Horas Fora de Vazio: limite horário em que o consumo geralmente é maior, pelo que o preço da energia é mais alto. Tarifa Tri-horária - Esta modalidade tarifária, tal como a anterior, pode ser de ciclo diário ou semanal. Nela, cada período divide-se em três partes, com preços diferentes no termo de consumo. Horas Ponta: são as horas que têm um preço maior. Horas Cheias: estas horas apresentam um preço médio, mas mais alto que o da tarifa simples. Hora Vazio: são as horas mais económicas da tarifa. Se o cliente usar a energia em horários considerados como de menor consumo, esta tarifa será ideal para si. O motivo para esta tarifa é reduzir o consumo energético nos horários de pico, quando a maioria do país estiver a usar energia, e incrementar o uso desta nos horários de menor consumo. A tarifa tri-horária é recomendável para empresas de grande porte, dado que estas não terão uso continuo energético e podem programar-se para gastar no horário mais económico, o horário de vazio, e evitar o uso nos horários mais caros, as horas de ponta e cheias. Além de dividir o dia ou a semana em três partes, esta tarifa estabelece diferencias entre o horário de verão e horário de inverno. http://www.erse.pt/pt/electricidade/tarifaseprecos/periodoshorarios/Paginas/default.aspx A decisão de contratar a tarifa simples vai depender das circunstâncias individuais de cada cliente. Ainda que esta modalidade seja a mais fácil de organizar e calcular os gastos, poderá resultar numa factura de luz mais cara.\\" Como simular uma fatura com valores de Tarifa Social? \\"Actualmente o simulador não considera o desconto da tarifa social. Ainda assim é possível fazer uma comparação, pelo que deve introduzir todos os dados da factura original e depois de simular, comparar o preço da Cashback Power com o da factura original sem o desconto social. O desconto social é transversal a todas as comercializadoras pelo que não será pelo facto de mudar de comercializadora que irá perder este direito.\\"","output":"Fiz uma simulação e verifiquei um valor mais elevado no tarifário Power Light da cbpower, porquê? É provável que o consumo dessa instalação seja muito baixo relativamente à média de consumo do escalão de potência que tem contratado. Na generalidade, observa-se que o cliente tem contratada uma potência excessiva face ao seu perfil de consumo, pelo que poderá optar por um contrato com uma potência mais reduzida e economizar também por esta via. Os pedidos de alteração de potência não têm custos para o cliente e podem ser solicitados a qualquer momento. Onde posso simular potências contratadas superiores a 41.40 kW/h? Para situações onde a potência contratada é superior a 41.40 kW/h, deve enviar uma fatura recente, completa, em formato PDF, para o apoio ao cliente e solicitar uma proposta específica.

Utilize uma fatura que reflita o seu consumo médio mensal, sem abatimentos/acertos, para uma estimativa mais precisa. No campo do desconto, pode colocar tanto valor absoluto como percentagem. Ao simular, não encontro na lista disponível a empresa que me presta o serviço atualmente. Como proceder? Nesses casos, pode selecionar a opção \\"Outra\\". Esta escolha tem propósitos meramente estatísticos e não afetará a simulação dos seus potenciais benefícios ao tornar-se cliente cbpower. Como se utiliza o simulador online do tarifário Power Light? Para informações sobre como utilizar o simulador ou quaisquer dúvidas sobre o tarifário Power Light, pode solicitar apoio ao seu Power Account Manager ou consultar o vídeo formativo disponível no site, com uma duração aproximada de 3 minutos. Diferença entre tarifário simples, bi-horário e tri-horário As tarifas variam conforme o horário de consumo: a Tarifa Simples oferece um preço constante qualquer que seja a hora; a Tarifa Bi-horária tem preços diferentes para as horas de vazio (menor consumo e custo) e fora de vazio; e a Tarifa Tri-horária, recomendável particularmente para empresas, discrimina ainda mais os períodos de consumo, definindo horas de ponta (mais caras), cheias e de vazio (mais económicas). Como simular uma fatura com valores de Tarifa Social? De momento, o simulador da cbpower não contempla diretamente o desconto da Tarifa Social.

Com a entrada em vigor, a 1 de julho de 2016, das alterações ao Decreto-Lei nº 138-A/2010 e ao Decreto-Lei nº 101/2011, efetuadas pela Lei nº 7-A/2016, de 30 de março (Orçamento do Estado para 2016), artigo 121º, o acesso ao benefício da tarifa social da energia elétrica e do gás natural passou a ser realizado através de um mecanismo de reconhecimento automático. A lista de beneficiários é elaborada pela DGEG com base nos dados de clientes finais recebidos dos agentes do setor após verificação das condições de elegibilidade dos clientes junto da Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira e da Segurança Social. (https://www.tarifasocial.dgeg.gov.pt/)\\" Tenho a «tarifa social» atualmente. Se contratar com a Cashback-Power perco esse direito? \\"Não. A Tarifa Social é um desconto adicional na electricidade e/ou no gás natural que se destina aos consumidores economicamente vulneráveis e é acumulável com qualquer oferta da Cashback Power. A Direção Geral de Energia e Geologia (DGEG) é quem atribui, de maneira automática, as tarifas sociais a todos aqueles que reúnam as condições necessárias para tal, desde o dia 1 de julho de 2016. O desconto da Tarifa Social de Electricidade, com valor de 33,8% é aplicado sobre a tarifa transitória, antes do acréscimo do IVA, do mercado regulado energético. No entanto, mesmo que o cliente já tenha passado ao mercado livre de electricidade, ele poderá beneficiar do desconto, caso seja elegível para tal, graças a uma metodologia estipulada pela Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços Energéticos. A ERSE designou que o desconto seja feito sobre as tarifas de acesso às redes (uma componente comum a todas as comercializadoras), tanto no termo de potência quanto no termo de consumo. O factor principal para ser beneficiário da tarifa social de electricidade é que o consumidor deve encontrar-se numa situação de carência sócio-económica comprovada pelo sistema de Segurança Social. Inclusivamente já deverá estar a receber algum destes outros tipos de prestações sociais: Complemento Solidário para Idosos; Rendimento Social de Inserção; Subsídio social de Desemprego; Abono de Família; Pensão social de invalidez; Pensão social de velhice. Também poderão ser beneficiários todos aqueles clientes que integrem um agregado familiar com renda total inferior a 5.808€ anuais. A este limite serão acrescidos 50% por cada elemento do agregado que não aufira qualquer rendimento. É imprescindível que o possível beneficiário seja o titular do contrato de fornecimento de energia eléctrica, que a potência contratada não seja superior a 6,9 kVA e que o seu uso seja exclusivamente doméstico.\\" Quantos dias são necessários desde a elaboração do contrato até receber a primeira fatura da Cashback-Power Depende de vários factores, contudo poderá levar até 45 dias.

Futuramente será uma das funcionalidades da área de cliente. Recentemente contratei com uma comercializadora mas pretendo mudar para a cashback-power. Como proceder? Dentro dos primeiros 15 dias (período de reflexao) pode realizar o contrato com a Cashback-Power que o contrato anterior fica automaticamente resolvido, de qualquer modo é sempre ideal informar a comercializadora oficialmente dentro deste período. Caso tenha excedido os 15 dias, deverá esperar pela primeira fatura e confirmar se tem ou não fidelização no ato do contrato. Os contratos domésticos não têm fidelização. Actualmente tenho contrato de energia eléctrica e gás natural. Posso mudar o contrato de energia eléctrica continuar com o gás natural na actual comercializadora? Sim. Contudo deverá enviar um email para a sua antiga comercializadora a informar que pretende manter o fornecimento de gás. A fatura não tem IVA porquê? O seu contrato de energia está estabelecido com uma comercializadora com sede fora de Portugal, pelo que desse modo as facturas são apresentadas sem IVA. Estas comercializadoras têm um período limitado para poderem operar desta forma. Posso ter mais que um contrato no mesmo nome? Sim. Poderá também associar o seu email a todos os contratos dos quais seja o titular. o sistema ao reconhecer que é o mesmo titular, devolve campos do formulário de contratação preenchidos automaticamente. A partir do momento em que contrato fico logo fidelizado, qual o período de fidelização do contrato? Os contratos domésticos e empresariais até 41,40 Kva, não têm fidelização, apenas uma garantia de condições durante 12 meses. Os contratos acima da potência de 41,40 Kva têm um período de fidelização de 24 meses. A fidelização acontece a partir do momento em que o contrato esteja activo, que pode demorar entre 5 a 20 dias úteis, desde a celebração do contrato. Como posso verificar em que estado está o meu contrato? \\"No actualmente no backoffice de \\"\\"PAM\\"\\" poderá verificar o estado de todos os seus contratos. Caso não seja \\"\\"PAM\\"\\" deve solicitar a informação ao \\"\\"PAM \\"\\" que lhe realizou o contrato ou solicitar informação através do email de apoio ao cliente. * Power Account Manager - \\"\\"PAM\\"\\"\\" Não tenho nenhuma factura do recente ou antiga da instalação.

Для разных инструментов, включая золото (XAUUSD), базовый размер лота может отличаться в зависимости от брокера и платформы. В MetaTrader 5 (MT5), который является одной из самых популярных платформ для торговли на рынке Forex и других финансовых инструментах, стандартный лот для золота (XAUUSD) часто составляет 100 унций золота на лот. Однако, это не жесткое правило, и у разных брокеров могут быть свои условия. Некоторые брокеры предлагают торговлю микро и мини лотами для золота, что делает вход на рынок доступным для широкого круга трейдеров с разным торговым капиталом. Микро и мини лоты позволяют торговать меньшими объемами, что уменьшает риски и требования к марже. - Стандартный лот: 100 унций золота (XAU) - Мини лот: обычно 10 унций золота (XAU) - Микро лот: обычно 1 унция золота (XAU) Важно уточнить условия торговли у вашего брокера, так как они могут отличаться от общепринятых стандартов. Перед началом торговли проконсультируйтесь с представителями брокера или ознакомьтесь с документацией на их официальном сайте.

Pipe system call Ø Don’t mix fd[0] and fd[1] with the file description table indexes","output":"In operating systems, the concept of pipes is crucial for inter-process communication, allowing one process to communicate with another, usually in a parent-child relationship. The pipe system call is used to create a pipe—an unidirectional data channel—that can be used for communication. The data written by one process can be read by another. It's a way of passing information without writing to a file or using external memory. When you use the \`pipe()\` system call in an operating system like Unix or Linux, it creates a pipe and provides two file descriptors: \`fd[0]\` and \`fd[1]\`. These file descriptors are stored in an array \`fd[]\` of size 2. - \`fd[0]\` is used for reading from the pipe. - \`fd[1]\` is used for writing to the pipe. It's crucial not to mix these descriptors up because they serve very distinct functions: - Writing to \`fd[0]\` or trying to read from \`fd[1]\` will not work as expected because these operations go against the design of the pipe's unidirectional data flow. - Attempting to use these file descriptors as indexes into some other table or array (like a file description table), unrelated to their purpose in a pipe, is a misunderstanding of their use. They are not indexes, but rather references to the ends of the pipe that must be used with the respective read and write operations. The caution \\"Don’t mix fd[0] and fd[1] with the file description table indexes\\" serves as a reminder that these descriptors are specific to the pipe's operation and not general indexes into the file descriptor table maintained by the operating system for a process. Each open file (or pipe, in this case) is assigned a file descriptor, which is an integer, but the purpose and functionality are context-specific. Mixing these concepts or misusing these descriptors could lead to bugs or unintended behavior in a program."},{"instruction":"what is a file descriptor table","output":"A file descriptor table is a crucial data structure used by an operating system (OS) to manage open files for a process. It essentially serves as a lookup table that keeps track of all the files a process is currently using. When a program runs and opens files, sockets, pipes, or other entities capable of performing I/O operations, the operating system assigns a unique file descriptor (FD) to each. These descriptors are non-negative integers acting as handles or references to these open files or resources. # Key Points of a File Descriptor Table: - **Per-Process Basis:** Each process has its own file descriptor table. This isolation ensures that file descriptors in one process do not interfere with those in another process. - **Indexing:** The file descriptor is used as an index into the table to access information about the corresponding file or resource. The entries in this table store metadata about the file or resource, such as how to access it, its current position (for files), permissions, and flags. - **Standard Descriptors:** By convention, the first three entries in every process's file descriptor table are reserved for standard input (stdin, FD=0), standard output (stdout, FD=1), and standard error (stderr, FD=2). These are automatically opened for processes by most operating systems. - **Resource Tracking:** The table is used by the operating system to track which resources are in use, preventing resource leaks and ensuring that resources are properly closed and released when no longer needed or when the process terminates. - **Maximum Limit:** There's typically a limit to the number of file descriptors a process can have open at any time. This limit can often be adjusted but serves to prevent a single process from exhausting the system's resources. # Operations and Use: - **Opening Files/Pipes/Sockets:** When a process opens a file, creates a pipe, or establishes a socket connection, the operating system creates an entry in the file descriptor table for this process and returns the index (the file descriptor) to the process. - **Reading/Writing/Closing:** To perform operations on an open file or resource, the process must specify the file descriptor (like in \`read(fd, buffer, size)\`, \`write(fd, buffer, size)\`, or \`close(fd)\`). The operating system then uses this descriptor to look up the relevant details in the file descriptor table. - **Duplication and Redirection:** Functions like \`dup()\` and \`dup2()\` allow for duplicating or redirecting file descriptors, which can be useful for redirecting output/input streams within processes. Understanding the file descriptor table is fundamental when working with low-level I/O operations in operating systems, providing a clear and efficient method for managing a process's resources."},{"instruction":"what was the porpous of this function: execvp?","output":"The \`execvp\` function in Unix-like operating systems is part of the \`exec\` family of functions, which are used for process control. Specifically, the purpose of \`execvp\` is to replace the current process image with a new process image. This involves loading the program contained in the specified file into the current process's memory space and executing it, effectively replacing the executing program entirely with the new program. The original process ceases to exist, and the newly loaded program starts executing from its main function. # Key Characteristics of \`execvp\`: - **Path Resolution:** The \\"v\\" in \`execvp\` stands for \\"vector,\\" referring to the C programming concept of an array of strings. The \\"p\\" indicates that this function takes the *path* of the executable as an argument. Unlike some other \`exec\` functions that require an absolute or relative path, \`execvp\` uses the current environment's *PATH* variable to find the executable if a relative or no path is provided. This makes it convenient for executing programs without needing to know their absolute path. - **Arguments Passing:** Following the filename or command, \`execvp\` allows for arguments to be passed to the starting program. These arguments are passed as an array of null-terminated strings (a vector), with the array itself also being null-terminated. - **Environment Inheritance:** The new program inherits the environment of the calling process. This means that all environment variables set in the parent process will be available to the program started by \`execvp\`. # Typical Usage: \`\`\`c #include <unistd.h> #include <stdio.h> int main() { char *args[] = {\\"echo\\", \\"Hello, World!\\", NULL}; execvp(\\"echo\\", args); // If execvp returns, there was an error perror(\\"execvp\\"); return 1; } \`\`\` In this example, the \`execvp\` function is used to replace the current process with a call to the \\"echo\\" program, which prints \\"Hello, World!\\" to the terminal. If \`execvp\` succeeds, it does not return; the original program is terminated, and the new program takes over. The return statement after \`execvp\` will only be executed if there's an error, such as if the executable cannot be found. # Purpose: The primary purpose of \`execvp\` and its siblings (\`execl\`, \`execle\`, \`execlp\`, \`execv\`, \`execve\`) is to allow a running process to execute another program. This is fundamentally important in Unix-like operating systems for process management, allowing for the development of shell programs that can start other programs, control job execution, implement pipelines, and more."},{"instruction":"what are named semaphores","output":"Named semaphores are a type of semaphore used in inter-process communication (IPC) to synchronize access to shared resources between different processes. Unlike unnamed semaphores, which are typically used for synchronization among threads of the same process or among processes that have a parent-child relationship and share some memory space, named semaphores have a unique name in the system's namespace. This naming feature allows processes that do not share memory and may not be related to each other to synchronize their actions by referring to the semaphore by its name. Here are some key points about named semaphores: # System-Wide Scope: Named semaphores are visible throughout the operating system and can be accessed by any process that has permission and knows the name of the semaphore. This system-wide scope makes them particularly useful for IPC. # Persistence: Because of their visibility at the system level, named semaphores can also have persistence beyond the lifetime of the process that created them. This means a named semaphore can remain in existence until it is explicitly removed, which makes cleanup an important consideration. # Naming Convention: The names of named semaphores usually follow a specific convention, often starting with a forward slash (\`/\`) and followed by a character-string name. This convention might vary slightly depending on the operating system. # Usage in POSIX: In POSIX-compliant systems, named semaphores are created and manipulated using specific API functions: - \`sem_open()\`: Opens a named semaphore. If the semaphore does not exist, depending on the flags provided, this function can also create it. - \`sem_wait()\`, \`sem_trywait()\`, \`sem_post()\`: Operations to decrement (wait) or increment (post) the semaphore's value, affecting the synchronization behavior. - \`sem_close()\`: Closes a named semaphore. - \`sem_unlink()\`: Removes the named semaphore from the system, cleaning up its resources. # Example Use Case: Imagine a scenario where multiple processes need to write to a single log file. To avoid corruption of data or lost writes, access to the file must be synchronized. A named semaphore can be used to ensure that only one process writes to the file at a time. Each process, knowing the name of the semaphore, can \\"wait\\" on it before writing to the file and \\"post\\" it after finishing the write operation. This ensures that writes to the file are serialized among the different processes. # Advantages and Disadvantages: - **Advantage**: Allows easy synchronization between unrelated processes and could be more straightforward to use when processes are dynamically created and destroyed. - **Disadvantage**: Requires careful cleanup (\`sem_unlink()\`) to avoid resource leaks, and the naming requires a convention to avoid conflicts. Named semaphores offer a powerful mechanism for synchronizing access to shared resources among unrelated processes in a multi-process application, essential for creating robust and concurrent systems."},{"instruction":"explain named semaphores based on this explanation: Process synchronisation: named semaphores Ø Same behaviour as thread semaphores, but between processes. Ø Wait: Wait if the semaphore is 0, otherwise pass and decrease by 0. Ø Post: increment the value of semaphore by one, let a waiting process pass, if any Ø Allocated as files in the file system, instead of in memory Ø Alternative: thread semaphore in shared memory (next session)","output":"Named semaphores offer a mechanism for process synchronization, similar to how semaphores work for threads, but their scope and usage extend beyond single-process contexts to synchronize actions between multiple processes. Here's an explanation based on the key points mentioned: # Behavior Mimicking Thread Semaphores: - **Semaphores** are traditionally used for controlling access to a resource by multiple threads in a concurrent system. They maintain a count (typically representing resource availability) and provide two atomic operations: **wait** (or **P**, for *proberen*, Dutch for \\"test\\" or \\"decrease\\") and **post** (or **V**, for *verhogen*, Dutch for \\"increase\\"). - Named semaphores extend this concept from intra-process (threads) communication to inter-process communication, allowing processes to synchronize their actions similarly to how threads within the same process would. # Operations: - **Wait**: This operation on a semaphore checks if its count is greater than 0. If it is, the process proceeds, and the semaphore's count is decreased by 1, reflecting the acquisition of the resource. If the semaphore's count is 0, indicating that no resources are available, the calling process is blocked until the count becomes greater than 0. - In the context provided, there might be a slight error in the explanation. The typical behavior is to decrease the semaphore's count by 1 if it's not 0, rather than decreasing by 0, which would effectively mean no operation. - **Post**: This operation increments the semaphore's count by 1. This increment can signal to one (or more, depending on the semaphore implementation and current blocked processes) waiting processes that the resource is now available, allowing one of the blocked processes to proceed. # Allocation: - Named semaphores are uniquely identifiable across the entire system by names and are often implemented under the hood as special files or objects in the filesystem. This differs from memory-based semaphores primarily used for thread synchronization within the same process space. By using the filesystem, named semaphores achieve persistence and visibility across process boundaries, making them suitable for inter-process synchronization. # Compared to Thread Semaphores in Shared Memory: - As an alternative to using filesystem-based named semaphores for process synchronization, one could utilize thread semaphores placed in a region of shared memory. In the next session likely referred to, this approach would allow semaphores to be accessed by multiple processes, assuming those processes have access to the same shared memory segment. This method still leverages the semaphore concept but requires explicit arrangement for shared memory access, contrasting with the more standalone, namespaced approach of named semaphores. Named semaphores thus provide a powerful and flexible mechanism for ensuring safe, controlled access to shared resources or synchronization points across independent processes, leveraging familiar semaphore semantics but adapted for inter-process communication and synchronization needs."},{"instruction":"explain this: Main Memory Protection - each process loaded into memory -ensure a separate process memory space -this protection is hardware supported","output":"Main Memory Protection is a crucial aspect of modern operating systems designed to ensure the safe and efficient execution of multiple processes. When multiple processes are loaded into memory, the operating system needs to ensure that each process operates within its allocated memory space and cannot inadvertently or maliciously access or alter the memory space of another process. This separation is vital for system stability, security, and data integrity. Here’s a breakdown of how main memory protection works: # Each Process Loaded into Memory: - In multitasking environments, the operating system manages the execution of numerous processes concurrently. Each process requires a portion of the system's memory to store its code, data, stack, and heap segments. - The operating system is responsible for allocating memory space for each process and ensuring that the process runs within its allocated space. # Ensure a Separate Process Memory Space: - To prevent processes from interfering with each other, the operating system enforces a strict separation of process memory spaces. Each process is given a virtual address space, which is mapped to the physical memory of the system. - This virtual memory abstraction allows every process to act as if it has its own, isolated memory, even though the physical memory is shared among all processes. # This Protection is Hardware Supported: - The enforcement of memory protection requires support at the hardware level, typically through the use of a Memory Management Unit (MMU). - The MMU translates virtual addresses into physical addresses and checks every memory access against a set of permissions associated with the memory region being accessed. - When a process attempts to access memory, the MMU ensures that the memory access falls within the process's allocated memory region. If a process tries to access memory outside its designated space (e.g., trying to access another process's memory or restricted system memory), the MMU can generate a fault, and the operating system can take appropriate actions such as terminating the process or delivering a segmentation fault signal. - Hardware support also includes features like segmentation and paging: - **Segmentation** divides the memory into variable-sized segments according to logical divisions of a program (like code, data, and stack) and provides a mechanism for assigning different permissions (read, write, execute) to each segment. - **Paging** divides memory into fixed-size pages and manages them in a page table, which tracks the mapping between a process's virtual pages and the physical frames in memory. # Conclusion: Main Memory Protection is fundamental to the secure and reliable operation of computer systems. Through a combination of hardware mechanisms and operating system management, each process is allocated its private memory space, safeguarding against unauthorized access and ensuring that processes cannot adversely affect each other's execution. This results in a stable environment where multiple processes can execute concurrently without compromising the system's integrity or security."},{"instruction":"therefore if a process forks into a child process that child process will have a given memory region that is different from the father although they have the same content right? So the pointers of the father ar not the same as the pointers of its son","output":"Yes, your understanding is essentially correct. When a process forks to create a child process, the operating system typically employs a mechanism known as \\"copy-on-write\\" (though the exact mechanism can depend on the OS). At the moment of forking, both the parent (father) and child process appear to have identical memory contents, including the values of pointers. However, these contents are indeed separate for each process, and modifications in one process's memory space do not reflect in the other's. Here's a more detailed breakdown: # Memory Separation after Forking: - **Separate Memory Spaces:** Upon forking, both processes (parent and child) will have their separate memory spaces allocated by the operating system. This ensures that one process cannot directly access or modify the memory of another process. - **Copy-on-Write (COW):** Initially, to optimize for performance and memory usage, the operating system might not make a full, immediate copy of the parent's memory for the child. Instead, it uses a technique called copy-on-write, where both processes initially share the same physical memory pages (read-only). Only when one of the processes attempts to write to a shared page, the operating system makes a copy of that page, ensuring that the modifications are isolated to the writing process. This mechanism maintains the efficiency of the fork operation while ensuring the separation of memory spaces. # Pointers and Memory Addresses: - **Virtual Address Space:** Both parent and child processes operate within their virtual address space, which the operating system and hardware (through the Memory Management Unit, MMU) map to physical memory. As a result, a pointer in the parent process and a corresponding pointer in the child process, at the moment of forking, could reference what appears to be the same virtual address, but these addresses are managed independently by the OS and refer to potentially different physical locations once a write operation necessitates copying. - **Independence of Pointers:** After a fork, even though pointers in the parent and child may have the same value (e.g., the same virtual address), these pointers are independent. A change to the object pointed to by a pointer in the parent will not affect the content of the object in the child process after a copy has been made (due to copy-on-write), and vice versa. This independence upholds the integrity and isolation of each process's memory space. In conclusion, forking creates a child process with a separate and independent memory space, maintaining conceptual similarity and initial content mirroring through mechanisms like copy-on-write but ensuring isolation and independence in actual memory operations. This isolation includes the separation of pointers, where identical virtual addresses in parent and child processes refer to independent memory areas post-fork, especially once modifications trigger copying."},{"instruction":"i didn't fully understand how does paging work","output":"Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory, thereby efficiently and flexibly utilizing the computer's RAM. It plays a crucial role in enabling virtual memory, where physical memory can be abstracted and extended onto disk storage. Here's a simplified explanation of how paging works: # Basic Concept: Memory is divided into small, fixed-sized blocks, known as \\"pages,\\" in the logical memory (virtual memory) space, and \\"frames\\" in the physical memory (RAM) space. The size of a page in logical memory corresponds directly to the size of a frame in physical memory, making them interchangeable in terms of data storage. Common page/frame sizes include 4KB, 2MB, or 1GB, depending on the system configuration and the needs of the application. # The Paging Process: 1. **Virtual Address Space:** Each process is given a private virtual address space by the operating system. This address space is divided into pages. The process is unaware of the actual physical memory layout; it only deals with virtual addresses. 2. **Physical Memory Division:** Physical memory (RAM) is divided into frames of the same size as the pages. 3. **Mapping Pages to Frames:** The operating system maintains a page table for each process, mapping its pages to frames in physical memory. When a process references a memory address, this reference is actually to a virtual address. The operating system, with the help of the Memory Management Unit (MMU), translates this virtual address into a physical address in RAM according to the page table. 4. **Page Table:** A page table contains entries for each page of the process's virtual address space, indicating the frame in physical memory (if any) to which that page is mapped. If a process accesses a page that is not currently in physical memory (a condition known as a \\"page fault\\"), the operating system must load that page from disk storage into RAM, potentially evicting another page to make space, and update the page table to reflect the new mapping. 5. **Address Translation:** Each virtual address can be divided into two parts: the page number and the offset within that page. The page number is used to index into the page table and finds the corresponding frame in physical memory. The offset specifies the exact location within the page/frame. By combining the frame number from the page table with the offset from the virtual address, the MMU constructs the physical address that is used to access the actual memory cell in RAM. # Advantages of Paging: - **Simplifies Memory Allocation:** Paging simplifies memory allocation by dealing with fixed-sized blocks, which can significantly reduce fragmentation issues. - **Supports Virtual Memory:** It allows systems to use disk space as an extension of RAM, enabling processes to run with more memory than is physically available. - **Isolates Processes:** Each process operates in its own virtual address space, improving security and stability by preventing processes from accidentally manipulating each other's data. - **Efficient Memory Use:** Paging allows for the non-contiguous allocation of memory, so memory can be used more flexibly and efficiently. In summary, paging is a foundational technology for modern operating systems, providing an efficient mechanism for memory management and enabling features like virtual memory and process isolation. By abstracting the details of physical memory allocation, paging allows programs to operate as if they have access to a large, continuous block of memory, while in reality, their data can be scattered across different physical memory locations."},{"instruction":"explaint this: Shared Memory Ø Shared memory is an Inter Process Communication mechanism to share main memory between two different processes. shmid = shmget(shmkey, SHM_SIZE, 0666 | IPC_CREAT); int *shmpointer = shmat(shmid, NULL, 0); … shmdt(shmpointer); shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, 0);","output":"Shared memory is a method of inter-process communication (IPC) that allows multiple processes to access the same portion of physical memory. This is an efficient way for processes to communicate or share data because it avoids the overhead of message passing or other IPC mechanisms. In Unix-like systems, the shared memory API provides a set of functions for creating, accessing, and managing shared memory segments. Let's break down the main steps and elements involved in using shared memory based on the provided code snippets: # 1. **Creating/Accessing a Shared Memory Segment** \`\`\`c shmid = shmget(shmkey, SHM_SIZE, 0666 | IPC_CREAT); \`\`\` - \`shmget\` is a function used to create a new shared memory segment or access an existing one. - \`shmkey\` is a key that uniquely identifies a shared memory segment; processes that wish to share memory must use the same key. - \`SHM_SIZE\` is the size of the shared memory segment that you want to create or access. - \`0666\` are the permissions (similar to file permissions) that specify who can access the shared memory. The example given allows read and write permissions to the owner, group, and others. - \`IPC_CREAT\` is a flag that tells the \`shmget\` function to create a new shared memory segment if one with the specified key doesn't already exist. - \`shmid\` is the shared memory ID returned by \`shmget\`. It is a non-negative integer that uniquely identifies the shared memory segment on the system and will be used in subsequent calls to refer to this segment. # 2. **Attaching the Shared Memory Segment to the Process's Address Space** \`\`\`c int *shmpointer = shmat(shmid, NULL, 0); \`\`\` - \`shmat\` is used to attach the shared memory segment identified by \`shmid\` to the process's address space, effectively giving the process access to the memory. - The second argument (\`NULL\` in this example) specifies the address in the process's address space where the shared memory segment should be attached. Specifying \`NULL\` lets the system choose a suitable (unused) address. - The third argument is a set of flags influencing the operation. In this example, \`0\` is used, indicating no special options. - \`shmpointer\` is a pointer to the beginning of the shared memory segment in the process's address space. This pointer can be used by the process to read from and write to the shared memory. # 3. **Detaching the Shared Memory Segment from the Process's Address Space** \`\`\`c shmdt(shmpointer); \`\`\` - \`shmdt\` detaches the shared memory segment from the process's address space. - After this call, the memory region pointed to by \`shmpointer\` should no longer be accessed because it no longer belongs to the process's address space. # 4. **Removing the Shared Memory Segment** \`\`\`c shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, 0); \`\`\` - \`shmctl\` with the command \`IPC_RMID\` is used to mark the shared memory segment for deletion. - The shared memory segment is not immediately removed but is marked for deletion. The segment will be removed after the last process detaches from it (i.e., when it's no longer attached to any process). - The last argument is used with some commands for passing additional data but is not required with \`IPC_RMID\` and thus set to \`0\`. In summary, the provided code demonstrates how a process can create/access, attach, detach, and then mark for deletion a shared memory segment for IPC in Unix-like operating systems.

Here's a breakdown of the parameters: # 1. \`char* name\` This parameter specifies the pathname of the file or device to be opened. It can be an absolute path, starting from the root directory (e.g., \`/home/user/file.txt\`), or a relative path, based on the current working directory of the process (e.g., \`../docs/example.txt\`).

The \`flags\` argument can include one of the following access modes: - \`O_RDONLY\`: Open for reading only. - \`O_WRONLY\`: Open for writing only. - \`O_RDWR\`: Open for reading and writing. In addition to an access mode, one or more of the following flags can be combined using the bitwise OR operator (\`|\`) to modify the behavior of \`open\`: - \`O_CREAT\`: If the file does not exist, it will be created. Using this flag requires specifying the \`perm\` parameter to set the permissions for the newly created file. - \`O_EXCL\`: When combined with \`O_CREAT\`, ensures the call fails if the file already exists. It's useful for ensuring that the call creates the file to avoid unintended overwriting. - \`O_APPEND\`: Writes to the file will always be appended to its end. - \`O_TRUNC\`: If the file already exists and is a regular file, and the file is successfully opened \`O_RDWR\` or \`O_WRONLY\`, its length will be truncated to 0, effectively clearing its contents. - \`O_NONBLOCK\` or \`O_NDELAY\`: The file is opened in non-blocking mode.

This ID can be used later in other pthreads functions, such as \`pthread_join\` or \`pthread_detach\`. 2. **\`const pthread_attr_t *attr\`**: - A pointer to a \`pthread_attr_t\` structure that specifies various thread attributes, such as stack size, scheduling policy, and detach state. If this parameter is \`NULL\`, then default attributes are used. To customize thread attributes, one would first initialize a \`pthread_attr_t\` object with \`pthread_attr_init()\`, modify it with the appropriate attribute-setting functions, and then pass a pointer to it to \`pthread_create\`. 3. **\`void *(*start_routine) (void *)\`**: - The function that the thread will execute once it is created. This parameter is a pointer to the function, which should return a \`void *\` and take a single \`void *\` argument. This allows the function to receive any type of argument via a pointer, and return any type of result. It's a flexible way to pass both simple and complex data structures in and out of the thread function. 4. **\`void *arg\`**: - A pointer to the argument that will be passed to the \`start_routine\` function. This parameter allows you to pass custom data or parameters to the thread function. If the function needs to receive multiple parameters, typically a struct is created to hold all the parameters, and a pointer to it is passed as this argument.

You have to use GPUs for parallelisation. You can use regular python libraries but not deep learning ones like pytorch, keras or tensorflow. Calculate error using MAPE. b.You will first train and validate your ANN on the toy problem of learning the mathematical function y = sin(x), where -2pi <=x<=2pi. Unless you can complete the toy problem successfully, do not get into the more complex regression functions mentioned below. The steps of this toy problem are the following: b1.Extract 1000 (x, y) pairs equally distributed within the domain --2pi <=x<=2pi. The total domain is 4pi, split it equally into 4 parts and extract 250 points from each, again with equal intervals. Use this for training your ANN – note that you have only 1 input and 1 output b2.Extract 300 points randomly within the same range -2pi <=x<=2pi., using some uniform-distribution random-number generator in Python (numpy). Note you are creating only the x-values; your ANN will generate the y-values as outputs. This will be the validation data b3.Plot the x-y curves extracted from the data in b1 on the same plot extracted from the outputs of your ANN in b2. The two plots should be almost sitting on each other, for proving correctness of your ANN The data set is an excel files with 5 sheets with more than 9 thousand rows of 4 input and 1 output variable.(5 sheets each containing that many). split the available data into 72 : 18 : 10 for training : validation : testing. Apart from the fact that the number of nodes in the input layer equals the number of input variables, and correspondingly for output layer, and that there has to be at least one hidden layer, the rest is your creation. Just remember one rule of thumb, the number of unknowns should not be more than half the number of training data samples. So one hidden layer will have some number of neurons, and if you increase the number of hidden layers then the nodes per layer will reduce by the above rule. Activation function is tanh. Use mini-batches between sizes 64 and 256. However, at extreme ends, you should test with batch sizes of 1 (effectively SGD) and the full batch. Also, shuffle the order of presentation of mini-batches across epochs. Observe the impact of mini-batch sizes on training and validation convergence histories. Take the four sizes 1, 64, 256 and then full batch. Normalise inputs and outputs between -1 and 1. Take learning rate parameter as 0.001 and do L2 regularization. DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN 3 HIDDEN LAYERS. There should also be stopping of training.","output":"Creating a full ANN with backpropagation without using deep learning libraries, while ensuring GPU acceleration, is a complex task. The explanation below outlines the architecture and main components of such a network in Python, but will not include the detailed GPU acceleration code. Incorporating GPU acceleration usually involves using CUDA through PyCUDA (a Python wrapper for CUDA) or similar libraries. However, those details go beyond a simple script and require a deep understanding of both CUDA programming and the specific algorithms to be parallelized. Here we will focus on the ANN structure, backpropagation, and other aspects of the setup without delving deep into GPU specifics. For the GPU part, one could utilize libraries like \`cupy\` that mimic \`numpy\` but execute on NVIDIA GPUs. Note that a deep integration with CUDA for custom operations would typically require using lower-level APIs, which is complex and out of scope for this explanation. Let's start with the architecture of a simple ANN for the given toy problem (y = sin(x)): 1. **Data Preparation**: Synthesize and prepare the data as described. 2. **ANN Structure**: Create a class for the ANN, including initialization, forward pass, and backpropagation methods. 3. **Training and Validation**: Implement training and validation with MAPE as the error metric.

However, you can incorporate such a feature by monitoring the validation metric over epochs and stopping the training when the metric ceases to improve. Due to the constraints and for brevity, several simplifications were made in this example.

Below, I show how to read the Excel file and conduct preprocessing required for a neural network.

Adjust \`xl.sheet_names[0]\` if you're targeting a different sheet. Now, you need to adapt the neural network inputs accordingly to handle multiple inputs and potentially a single output if you're predicting a single variable from your Excel file. **Remember**: When you're using this data with the ANN structure I described earlier, you need to adjust the network's input and output layer sizes according to the processed dataset. For example, if your processed \`X_train\` has 4 features, the input size of your ANN must be 4. Similarly, adjust the output size based on your prediction goal (e.g., 1 for a single regression output). The training invocation (\`ann.train(...)\`) will also change to use the actual datasets (\`X_train, y_train\`, etc.) instead of the synthesized dataset. Keep the algorithmic details (forward pass, backpropagation) the same, but ensure the data structures fed into the ANN correctly match the dimensions of your dataset.

Here's how you can adapt the code to work with CSV files. First, convert your Excel file to CSV. Most spreadsheet software, including Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice Calc, allows you to save your Excel file as a CSV.

Skip to main content LoRD.ipynb LoRD.ipynb_ Extracting LoRA adapters from model diff using SVD Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a popular technique for parameter efficient training (PEFT) of neural networks. It is usually used together with gradient descent in order to fine-tune models to perform specific task. However it can be also derived from already trained weights using a technique called Singular value decomposition. Inspired by an already existing technique for Stable Diffusion, we implement LoRA extraction for transformers language models. First, let's choose a base model and a target model we want to extract a LoRA adapter from. I think it's probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) [ ] base_model_id = 'teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B' target_model_id = 'valine/OpenSnark' setup enviroment [ ] !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Requirement already satisfied: torch in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.1.0+cu118) Requirement already satisfied: transformers in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.37.2) Requirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.20.3) Requirement already satisfied: bitsandbytes in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.42.0) Requirement already satisfied: accelerate in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.27.2) Requirement already satisfied: peft in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.8.2) Requirement already satisfied: sentencepiece in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.1.99) Requirement already satisfied: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.25.2) Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (6.0.1) Requirement already satisfied: safetensors in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.4.2) Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.66.2) Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.9.0) Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (4.4.0) Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (1.12) Requirement already satisfied: networkx in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.0) Requirement already satisfied: jinja2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: fsspec in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2024.2.0) Requirement already satisfied: triton==2.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2.1.0) Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (1.24.1) Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (23.2) Requirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2023.12.25) Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2.31.0) Requirement already satisfied: tokenizers<0.19,>=0.14 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (0.15.2) Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bitsandbytes) (1.12.0) Requirement already satisfied: psutil in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from accelerate) (5.9.6) Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from jinja2->torch) (2.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.1.1) Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.4) Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.26.13) Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2022.12.7) Requirement already satisfied: mpmath>=0.19 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from sympy->torch) (1.3.0) WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

Imagine you have a very complicated recipe book (a machine learning model) that helps you cook exactly what you want (generate text, recognize images, etc.). However, this book is huge, and you only want to cook something very specific. Copying the entire book would be too much work and not necessary. Instead, you find a clever way to copy only the necessary parts to tweak your existing recipes slightly and achieve the new dish you're aiming for. This method of copying only what's needed and integrating it with your current recipes is known as Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Here's how the code you shared works, using this analogy: 1. **Choosing the Recipe Books**: It starts by selecting two recipe books - a base book ('teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B'), which you already know, and a target book ('valine/OpenSnark'), which has the new recipe you want. 2. **Preparation**: Before you start, you ensure you have all the tools and ingredients ready (\`pip install\`... is like making sure you have all the kitchen tools and ingredients). 3. **Downloading the Books**: The code then downloads these recipe books from a huge library (Hugging Face Hub). 4. **Identifying Special Ingredients**: It looks through the books to find the special ingredients and methods ('linear and embedding layers') that make the new recipe unique. 5. **Getting the New Ingredients**: The code downloads the target book with the new recipe. 6. **Reading the Ingredients**: It reads through the books to understand the ingredients and methods used ('loading tensors'). 7. **Creating a New Recipe**: The most magical part comes next - the code combines ingredients from both books to create a new, simplified recipe. This process is called low-rank decomposition, which is a fancy way of saying it finds a simpler way to combine the complex methods. 8. **Extracting the Essence**: The new recipe is then saved ('Extract the LoRAs') in a simple format so you can use it without the entire book. 9. **Testing the Dish**: To make sure the new recipe works, the code tries it out by cooking something ('Testing the result'). 10. **Sharing Your Recipe**: Happy with the new dish? The code then helps you share this recipe with others by uploading it to the library ('Hugging Face Hub') so others can try it too. So, essentially, this code cleverly extracts a specific \\"taste\\" or \\"style\\" from one big recipe book (model) and makes it easy to apply to your dishes without needing to copy the entire book!"},{"instruction":"What if I already have a Low-rank decomposition of a model (specifically, a model called 'quietstar-8-ahead' which uses 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1' as a base) It was Created using LoRD.

Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results.

The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}.

She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part?

She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment.

So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers' market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day!

A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same.

We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","output":"Given the extensive information provided, your document seems to be a research paper titled \\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking,\\" authored by Eric Zelikman and colleagues from Stanford University alongside contributors from Notbad AI Inc. This paper introduces an advanced technique aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models without explicit task-specific training. Here's a simplified overview of the core aspects covered in your document: # What is \\"Quiet-STaR\\"? - Quiet-STaR stands for \\"Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner.\\" - It's a technique designed for language models, enabling them to generate internal thoughts or rationales that help improve their predictions on future text output. This is akin to how humans sometimes pause to think or plan their next words based on context. - The method builds upon the idea that reasoning, or the thought process happening beneath the surface of communication, is crucial for understanding and generating coherent text. # How Does It Work? Quiet-STaR operates through a distinctive three-step process during model training: 1. **Think**: The model generates thoughts in parallel after every token. These are not external predictions but internal conjectures about what comes next based on the current context. 2. **Talk**: Based on these generated thoughts, the model either moves forward with making a prediction or adjusts its thought process. It learns to balance between its initial prediction and its \\"thought\\" to make the next move. 3. **Learn**: The model is trained using a reinforcement approach, essentially rewarding thoughts that lead to more accurate predictions or useful outcomes. This step iterates over the process, allowing the model to adapt and improve its reasoning capabilities over time. # Benefits and Innovations - **Efficient Reasoning**: By generating and utilizing internal thoughts, the model learns to reason more effectively, improving its ability to handle complex language tasks without direct instruction on those tasks. - **Adaptable Learning**: Quiet-STaR allows models to adapt their learning process based on the richness and complexity of tasks present in natural language, providing a scalable approach to enhancing their reasoning capabilities. - **Generality**: This approach aims to teach models general reasoning skills that can be applied across various tasks, moving beyond task-specific learning models. # Testing and Results The document details experiments that demonstrate how Quiet-STaR improves model performance on reasoning tasks. It shows significant improvements in language tasks that traditionally require intricate reasoning, such as question-answering and mathematical problem-solving. # Ethical Consideration and Future Directions The paper acknowledges potential ethical concerns related to model reasoning and the accuracy of generated reasoning processes. It also outlines future research directions, including exploring dynamic rationale generation and extending this approach to larger models for improved reasoning capabilities."},{"instruction":"given x1 = e^t [(cos(4t) - 3sin(4t)), (2cos(4t) + 2sin(4t))] is a solution to x' = Ax, find the solution with x(0) = [(7), (-2)]","output":"Given the system (x' = Ax), where a specific solution is [ x_1 = e^t begin{bmatrix} cos(4t) - 3sin(4t) 2cos(4t) + 2sin(4t) end{bmatrix}, ] we need to find the solution (x(t)) that satisfies the initial condition (x(0) = begin{bmatrix} 7 -2 end{bmatrix}). Let's start by setting up our solution. Generally, for a system (x' = Ax), if we have a complex solution of the form (e^{lambda t}[cos(mu t) mathbf{v}_1 + sin(mu t) mathbf{v}_2]), where (mathbf{v_1}) and (mathbf{v_2}) are real vector constants, we can build a general solution from linear combinations of such solutions. For our particular solution, [ x_1 = e^t begin{bmatrix} cos(4t) - 3sin(4t) 2cos(4t) + 2sin(4t) end{bmatrix} ] it suggests that candidates for (mathbf{v}_1) and (mathbf{v}_2) are involved, with (lambda = 1) and (mu = 4). Here, (mathbf{v}_1 = begin{bmatrix} 1 2 end{bmatrix}) and (mathbf{v}_2 = begin{bmatrix} -3 2 end{bmatrix}), thus decomposing (x_1) into its real and imaginary part (so to speak), even though it's all real due to sine and cosine involvement. Given the initial condition (x(0) = begin{bmatrix} 7 -2 end{bmatrix}), let's note: At (t = 0), (cos(0) = 1) and (sin(0) = 0), so [ x_1(0) = e^0 begin{bmatrix} 1 2 end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 1 2 end{bmatrix} ] Given only (x1), it seems we may only have this solution directly related. However, generally, there would be (x2) part of the solution too if we were to decompose or find solutions based on Eigenvalues or say a multi-dimensional complex solution. For the given (x1), if it's the sole basis for our solution space, we aim to scale and shift this function to meet our initial conditions. However, in the format provided, without a second independent solution (which typically would exist in such systems), we directly work only with what's given. Since we're asked to determine a specific solution without further details on the entire solution space or a method to derive it (like Eigenvalues or Eigenvectors provided directly or methodology), and the question seems to point towards utilizing just the provided specific solution to meet initial conditions, I'll clarify fundamentally how one might approach the continuity in such scenarios with this being the direct solution: Given (x_1 = e^t begin{bmatrix} cos(4t) - 3sin(4t) 2cos(4t) + 2sin(4t) end{bmatrix}), if treated as a component of a fundamental set of solutions, we would normally consider linear combinations of independent solutions to meet the initial conditions (x(0) = begin{bmatrix} 7 -2 end{bmatrix}). Ideally, this would involve setting up equations from the initial condition that match a linear combination of solutions at (t=0) to the provided initial vectors. However, without an explicit couple (second linearly independent solution), we focus on what scaling or direct transformation could lead us from our known (x_1(0)) to the desired (x(0)). Directly, based on the information given, (x_1) uniquely doesn't scale to the initial condition (x(0)) without considering the possibility of a missing piece or a mathematical misinterpretation of the provided structure. For educational or conjectural works, verification would require revisiting the system's derivation, the second solution, or reconstructing assumptions about the provided dynamics or solving approach (e.g., Eigen decomposition)."},{"instruction":"One of the strongest arguments that proponents of the New Deal make was that it saved Depression-plagued America from the radical right-wing or left-wing dictatorships that seized power in much of Europe.

However, it is worth considering the historical context of the time. During the Great Depression, there was certainly a rise in extremist ideologies in the United States, as evidenced by the popularity of figures like Father Coughlin and the growth of organizations like the Silver Legion of America (the Silver Shirts) and the American Nazi Party. Additionally, there were also communist sympathizers and organizers who sought to promote socialist ideals and challenge the capitalist system. While these movements did exist, it is debated how much of a threat they posed to the democratic system in the U.S. Some argue that the American political and social institutions were strong enough to resist any potential slide into authoritarianism, while others suggest that without the New Deal and Roosevelt's leadership, the country could have been more susceptible to radical ideologies. Ultimately, it is difficult to predict what could have happened if the New Deal had not been implemented or if Roosevelt had failed. However, many historians argue that the policies of the New Deal did help to stabilize the economy, provide relief to those suffering from the effects of the Depression, and prevent the rise of extremist movements in the U.S. This in turn may have helped to preserve American democracy during a turbulent time in history."},{"instruction":"Write an comedy anime scene about a young man writing a essay on why Twilight is better than 50 Shades of Grey.

He periodically stops to dramatically gaze into the distance as if channeling Edward Cullen's vampire prowess. BOB (to himself) Edward Cullen, guide my fingers to defend your honor and Bella's choice. For in the face of love, who wouldn't want immortality and super strength? Bob's ROOMMATE, DAVE, an average Joe with no interest in vampire lore or romantic literature, walks in. He looks baffled at the scene before him. DAVE What are you doing, Bob? And why does it look like you raided a costume shop's clearance bin? BOB (enthused) I'm writing the ultimate defense for why \\"Twilight\\" is a million times better than \\"50 Shades of Grey\\". It's for my Lit class. This cape gives me strength. DAVE (raising an eyebrow) Twilight? Really? Isn't that for teenage girls? BOB (indignantly) I'll have you know, Dave, \\"Twilight\\" transcends age and gender. It's a saga of love, choice, and facing one's demons — both metaphorical and literal. Besides, Bella making the choice to become a vampire is the ultimate act of agency. She chose power, immortality, and love. What does \\"50 Shades\\" offer? Elevators and bad contracts? Dave, clearly amused, decides to play along. DAVE I guess I haven't looked at it that way. But Bob, how will you convince your professor? BOB Easy. Exhibit A: Vampires. Exhibit B: Werewolves. Exhibit C: A love that withstands immortal odds. What does \\"50 Shades\\" have? A guy who's too into his own hardware store purchases. DAVE (laughing) Can't argue with that logic. Bob, feeling inspired, types even more furiously. Dave shakes his head, smiling, and grabs a gaming controller. DAVE Well, while you save Bella's honor, I'll be in the living room. Don't stay up too late with your vampire buddies. BOB (saluting with a determined expression) No promises, Dave. This essay will be my magnum opus. For Bella. For Edward. For every misunderstood vampire out there. Dave exits, still chuckling as Bob turns back to his laptop, passionate and undeterred. He begins to passionately argue about the depth of Bella and Edward's relationship compared to the shallow dynamics of \\"50 Shades.\\" Fade to black as Bob's typing becomes a fervent cacophony, intermixed with passionate mutterings about true love, vampire rights, and the importance of well-written characters. The night wears on, a testament to one man's love for a tale of vampires and forbidden love. END SCENE"},{"instruction":"One of the strongest arguments that proponents of the New Deal make was that it saved Depression-plagued America from the radical right-wing or left-wing dictatorships that seized power in much of Europe. Was the United States ever in danger of turning to fascism or communism if there had been no New Deal or if Roosevelt and his policies had failed? Take a side, answer very shortly.","output":"No, the United States was not in danger of turning to fascism or communism even without the New Deal. The American political system and society were fundamentally different from those in Europe, making such extreme ideologies less likely to take hold."},{"instruction":"Create a picture about a tree with a monkey","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't directly create or display images. However, I can guide you on how to draw a picture of a tree with a monkey in it. Here's a step-by-step description you can follow: # What You'll Need - Paper - Pencil - Eraser - Coloring tools (optional) # Drawing the Tree 1. **Start with the Trunk**: Draw a wide base that narrows as you go up, making the trunk slightly curved for a natural look. 2. **Add Tree Texture**: Add vertical lines along the trunk to create the tree bark texture. 3. **Sketch the Branches**: From the top and sides of the trunk, extend out several branches. Make them fork out in different directions and taper to a point. 4. **Leaves and Canopy**: On the branches, draw clusters of leaves. You can do this by sketching cloud-like shapes for a fuller look. Make sure the canopy is dense and lively. # Drawing the Monkey 1. **Shape the Body**: On one of the branches, sketch an oval for the monkey’s body, and a smaller circle for its head. 2. **Facial Features**: On the circle (head), draw two small eyes, a little nose, and a curved line for the mouth. Add little arcs above the eyes for eyebrows. 3. **Limbs**: Draw two long, curved arms extending from the sides of the body. Remember, monkeys have very flexible limbs, so one arm can be reaching out or hanging down. Add two legs, showing the monkey sitting or crouching on the branch. 4. **Tail**: Add a long, curved tail that loops around the branch or hangs down artistically. 5. **Details**: Give the monkey some fingers and toes to cling onto the branch, and don’t forget the monkey’s ears on the sides of its head. # Final Touches - Add some texture to the monkey’s fur by drawing short strokes along its body. - You can add more elements to the background, like more trees, birds, or even a setting sun. - Once you’re satisfied with your drawing, you can go over it with a pen or marker and erase any unnecessary pencil marks. - Coloring the drawing adds more life to it. Give the tree green leaves, a brown trunk, and color the monkey accordingly, depending on its species. And voila, you now have a completed picture of a tree with a monkey! Remember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if your first attempt isn't exactly how you want it. Keep practicing!"},{"instruction":"GPT-4 Turbo: Research Preview (128K token limit, Short-Term Availability) If this app doesn't respond, it's likely due to our API key hitting the daily limit of our organization.

It is usually used together with gradient descent in order to fine-tune models to perform specific task. However it can be also derived from already trained weights using a technique called Singular value decomposition.

Imagine you have a very complicated recipe book (a machine learning model) that helps you cook exactly what you want (generate text, recognize images, etc.). However, this book is huge, and you only want to cook something very specific. Copying the entire book would be too much work and not necessary. Instead, you find a clever way to copy only the necessary parts to tweak your existing recipes slightly and achieve the new dish you’re aiming for. This method of copying only what’s needed and integrating it with your current recipes is known as Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Here’s how the code you shared works, using this analogy: 1. Choosing the Recipe Books: It starts by selecting two recipe books - a base book (‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’), which you already know, and a target book (‘valine/OpenSnark’), which has the new recipe you want. 2. Preparation: Before you start, you ensure you have all the tools and ingredients ready ( pip install … is like making sure you have all the kitchen tools and ingredients). 3. Downloading the Books: The code then downloads these recipe books from a huge library (Hugging Face Hub). 4. Identifying Special Ingredients: It looks through the books to find the special ingredients and methods (‘linear and embedding layers’) that make the new recipe unique. 5. Getting the New Ingredients: The code downloads the target book with the new recipe. 6. Reading the Ingredients: It reads through the books to understand the ingredients and methods used (‘loading tensors’). 7. Creating a New Recipe: The most magical part comes next - the code combines ingredients from both books to create a new, simplified recipe. This process is called low-rank decomposition, which is a fancy way of saying it finds a simpler way to combine the complex methods. 8. Extracting the Essence: The new recipe is then saved (‘Extract the LoRAs’) in a simple format so you can use it without the entire book. 9. Testing the Dish: To make sure the new recipe works, the code tries it out by cooking something (‘Testing the result’). 10. Sharing Your Recipe: Happy with the new dish? The code then helps you share this recipe with others by uploading it to the library (‘Hugging Face Hub’) so others can try it too. So, essentially, this code cleverly extracts a specific “taste” or “style” from one big recipe book (model) and makes it easy to apply to your dishes without needing to copy the entire book! CONTINUE CONVERSATION: What if I already have a Low-rank decomposition of a model (specifically, a model called 'quietstar-8-ahead' which uses 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1' as a base) It was Created using LoRD. For context, the 'quietstar-8-ahead' model is a result of this paper: \\"\\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking Eric Zelikman Stanford University Georges Harik Notbad AI Inc Yijia Shao Stanford University Varuna Jayasiri Notbad AI Inc Nick Haber Stanford University Noah D. Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results. We evaluate the extent to which the model trained with Quiet-STaR generalizes to directly answering problems that require reasoning. The left plot (a) shows the zero-shot accuracy on GSM8K, while the right plot (b) shows the zero-shot accuracy on CommonsenseQA, without any fine-tuning. In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2 OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part? You have Third Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment. Our net wealth will be 12-5*12 = 24 dollars. Is that correct? Fourth Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, Jane's ducks lay 16 eggs perday. So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers' market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day!

What do we know? - Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. - She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. From these two facts, we can conclude at least that Janet needs at least seven eggs for consumption per day. And what do we need to find exactly? - We need to find how much in dollars Janet makes every day at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation and solve it to find the answer. We know: - (16-3-4=9) So our daily profit is 9 times 2, or (9times2=18) Hence her profits at market on a given day are (18). Answer: (18).

A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same.

May 15 '17 at 19:35 hint In your last line, factor by sin (theta), replace sin^2(theta) by 1-cos^2 (theta) Figure 8: Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","output":"This complex discussion centers on a technique known as Quiet-STaR for extracting \\"LoRA adapters\\" from pre-trained machine learning models for more efficient fine-tuning on new tasks. LoRA, or Low-rank Adaptation, is a method for adapting neural network models with minimal additional computation, allowing for task-specific adjustments without fully retraining the model. This is particularly useful for models that have been extensively trained on large datasets and for which retraining is computationally expensive. The process involves several key steps: 1. **Setting Up**: The environment is prepared with necessary software libraries. Two models are identified: a base model from which adaptations will be extracted, and a target model that has been fine-tuned from the base model for a specific task. 2. **Model Download**: Utility functions are defined for downloading these models from Hugging Face Hub, favoring models saved in a more efficient format when available. 3. **Identifying Relevant Layers**: The layers within the transformer models that are relevant for LoRA adapters are identified. These are typically the linear and embedding layers where adaptations can have the most significant impact. 4. **Decomposing Weights**: The core technical contribution of the technique is the decomposition of differences in weights (delta weights) between the base and target models into low-rank matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This allows representing the changes needed to adapt the base model to perform like the target model in a more parameter-efficient way. 5. **Storing and Applying LoRA Adapters**: The decomposed weights are saved, and a configuration for applying these adapters to the base model is created. This essentially modifies the base model to behave like the target model for specific tasks without the need for extensive retraining. 6. **Evaluation and Sharing**: The modified base model is assessed to ensure it behaves similarly to the target model when generating responses. The configuration for applying the LoRA adapters, along with any extracted adapters, can then be uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub for others to use. This method appreciates the efficiency in adapting large, pre-trained models to new tasks without the need for extensive computational resources. It leverages the underlying structure of the models and the specific adaptations learned during fine-tuning, preserving the intricate relationships learned through initial training while introducing task-specific nuances."},{"instruction":"Steven needs a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes to eat in a restaurant.

Continuer nécessite de la planification, de la conception, et une implementation bien réfléchies des fonctionnalités. Comme ce projet est hypothétique et destiné à titre d'apprentissage, il convient de noter que des décisions de conception spécifiques, des gestionnaires d'état (comme Svelte stores ou RecoilJS si vous mélangez avec React), et une authentification sécurisée sont critiques pour un projet réel. # Étape 5: Intégration de l'API pour le service de messagerie 1. **Choisissez une API de service de messagerie**: Par exemple, si vous utilisez Gmail, vous auriez besoin d'intégrer l'API Gmail. Cela nécessitera de configurer un projet dans Google Cloud Platform, de créer des identifiants OAuth 2.0, et d'intégrer l'SDK Google API dans votre application. 2. **Authentification**: Utilisez OAuth 2.0 pour l'authentification avec le service de messagerie choisi. L'authentification se fait généralement via une fenêtre de navigateur séparée qui demande à l'utilisateur d'accorder des permissions à votre application. 3. **Fetch et Envoi des E-mails**: Après l'authentification, utilisez l'API du service de messagerie pour fetch les e-mails de l'utilisateur et permettre l'envoi de nouveaux e-mails. Vous aurez à traiter des réponses JSON, les décomposer et les afficher dans votre UI. # Étape 6: Amélioration de l'interface utilisateur (UI) Cette étape comprend la conception de l'interface pour l'affichage de la liste des e-mails, la lecture d'un e-mail spécifique, et la composition de nouveaux e-mails. Implémentez des fonctionnalités supplémentaires comme la recherche et le filtrage des e-mails. 1. **Liste des Emails**: Créez une vue qui liste tous les e-mails. Utilisez \`fetch\` avec sa méthode appropriée pour récupérer les e-mails auprès de l'API et les afficher. 2. **Lecture et Envoi d'E-mails**: Permettez aux utilisateurs de cliquer sur un e-mail pour le lire dans une nouvelle vue et de composer puis envoyer des e-mails depuis une autre vue. # Étape 7: Sécurité et Stockage Local La gestion des données d'authentification et le stockage local sécurisé des données sensibles sont cruciaux. 1. **Stockage Sécurisé**: Tauri offre des fonctionnalités de stockage sécurisé pour les jetons d'authentification et autres données sensibles. Assurez-vous de les utiliser pour protéger les informations de l'utilisateur. 2. **Refresh Tokens**: Implémentez une logique pour rafraîchir les tokens d'accès de manière transparente pour l'utilisateur, garantissant que les sessions ne se terminent pas de manière inattendue. # Étape 8: Packaging et Distribution Une fois votre application développée et testée, utilisez les outils fournis par Tauri pour empaqueter votre application pour différentes plateformes (Windows, MacOS, Linux). 1. **Packaging**: Suivez la documentation de Tauri pour packager votre application. Cela implique généralement l'exécution d'une suite de commandes pour créer des builds pour les plateformes ciblées. 2. **Testez Votre Application**: Avant la distribution, assurez-vous de tester l'application sur différentes plateformes pour identifier et résoudre les problèmes de compatibilité ou de performance. # Conclusion et Ressources Cette exploration vous donne une vue d'ensemble de la manière d'approcher le développement d'une application de messagerie minimaliste utilisant Svelte et Tauri.

Ces étapes impliquent généralement : 1. **Authentification OAuth 2.0 :** S'enregistrer auprès du service pour obtenir les identifiants nécessaires, et mettre en œuvre le flux OAuth dans l'application pour permettre aux utilisateurs de se connecter avec leur compte de service de messagerie. 2. **Utilisation de l'API de Messagerie :** Après l'authentification, utiliser l'API pour interagir avec les e-mails. Avec Gmail par exemple, cela signifie utiliser l'API Gmail pour récupérer, envoyer, et gérer les e-mails. Il est important de lire attentivement la documentation de l'API que vous prévoyez d'utiliser, car chaque service aura ses propres spécificités, exigences et meilleures pratiques. # Gestion de l'État La gestion de l'état dans une application Svelte peut devenir complexe à mesure qu’elle grandit. Considérez les solutions suivantes : - **Svelte Stores :** Utilisez le mécanisme intégré de gestion d’état de Svelte, les Stores, pour gérer les états tels que les données utilisateur, les e-mails récupérés, et l’état de connexion. - **Chargement et Erreur États :** Pour une UX améliorée, gérez les états de chargement et d'erreur lorsque vous récupérez des données à partir des API. # Sécurité Lorsque vous travaillez avec des données sensibles telles que les e-mails, la sécurité devient primordiale. - **Stockage Sécurisé des Tokens :** Utilisez Tauri pour stocker de manière sécurisée les tokens d'authentification et les renouveler lorsque nécessaire. - **Prévention des Fuites de Données :** Assurez-vous que votre application n'expose pas de données sensibles, par exemple en vérifiant le stockage local du navigateur et les cookies. - **Protocoles de Sécurité :** Suivez les meilleures pratiques de sécurité pour les applications web et desktop, y compris l'utilisation de HTTPS pour toutes les communications externes. # Conclusion et Vers Où Aller à Partir d'Ici Pour transformer ce concept en une application de messagerie électronique fonctionnelle et sécurisée, voici quelques recommandations sur les prochaines étapes à suivre : - **Prototypage et Test d'UI/UX :** Créez des mockups détaillés de votre application et testez-les auprès des utilisateurs potentiels pour recueillir des feedbacks. Cela vous aidera à peaufiner l'interface utilisateur et l'expérience utilisateur. - **Développement Itératif :** Utilisez une approche itérative pour le développement. Commencez avec un MVP (produit minimal viable) et ajoutez progressivement des fonctionnalités en fonction des retours des utilisateurs. - **Tests :** Implémentez des tests unitaires et d'intégration pour garantir la fiabilité de votre code et pour identifier rapidement toute régression à mesure que vous développez de nouvelles fonctionnalités. - **Documentation et Support :** Préparez une documentation détaillée pour les utilisateurs et envisagez des canaux de support pour aider vos utilisateurs à tirer le meilleur parti de votre application.

Cela peut être utile pour effectuer des opérations plus complexes ou pour accéder à des fonctionnalités du système d'exploitation qui ne sont pas exposées par les API JavaScript. 1. **Définir une Commande en Rust** Dans le fichier \`src-tauri/src/main.rs\` : \`\`\`rust #[tauri::command] fn my_custom_command(message: String) { println!(\\"Message reçu de Tauri: {}\\", message); } fn main() { tauri::Builder::default() .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![my_custom_command]) .run(tauri::generate_context!()) .expect(\\"error while running tauri application\\"); } \`\`\` 2. **Appeler la Commande depuis Svelte/JavaScript** Utilisez le module \`@tauri-apps/api/tauri\` pour appeler la commande. \`\`\`javascript import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/tauri'; async function callRustCommand() { try { await invoke('my_custom_command', { message: 'Hello from JavaScript' }); console.log('Commande exécutée avec succès.'); } catch (error) { console.error('Erreur lors de l'appel de la commande Rust', error); } } \`\`\` # Conclure Félicitations ! Vous avez maintenant une compréhension de base de la façon de commencer à créer une application Tauri avec un frontend Svelte, y compris la manière d'interagir avec le système de fichiers et d'exécuter des commandes personnalisées. Tout en étant une vue d'ensemble plutôt qu'un tutoriel détaillé complet, ce guide devrait vous donner un bon point de départ pour explorer plus avant les possibilités qu'offrent Svelte et Tauri ensemble. Explorant davantage les fonctionnalités de Tauri, consultez la [documentation officielle de Tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/all-features/) pour une couverture complète de ce que vous pouvez faire avec ce framework excitant. Bon développement !"},{"instruction":"fait une intégration avec gmail","output":"L'intégration avec Gmail pour une application de bureau développée avec Tauri et Svelte est une tâche relativement avancée. Elle nécessite d'authentifier les utilisateurs via OAuth2, de récupérer les tokens d'accès, et de les utiliser pour faire des requêtes à l'API Gmail. **Note importante**: L'intégration OAuth2 dans une application de bureau peut être complexe notamment en raison des besoins en sécurité et des politiques strictes de Google concernant les flux OAuth pour les applications de bureau. # Étapes générales pour l'intégration Gmail 1. **Créer un projet dans Google Cloud Platform**: - Rendez-vous dans [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). - Créez un nouveau projet. - Accédez à \\"APIs & Services\\" > \\"OAuth consent screen\\" et configurez l'écran de consentement. - Dans \\"Credentials\\", créez des identifiants OAuth2 pour obtenir votre \`Client ID\` et \`Client Secret\`. 2. **Implémentation de l'authentification OAuth2 dans votre application Tauri**: - Implémenter un flux d'authentification OAuth2 peut être assez délicat, surtout pour s'assurer que cela est fait de manière sécurisée. - Vous devrez ouvrir un navigateur externe pour que l'utilisateur puisse se connecter à son compte Google et consentir à votre application d'accéder à ses données Gmail. - Google renverra un code d'authentification qui sera échangé contre un token d'accès à utiliser avec l'API Gmail. 3. **Utiliser l'API Gmail**: - Une fois authentifié, vous pouvez utiliser le token d'accès pour faire des requêtes à l'API Gmail, par exemple pour lister les e-mails, lire des e-mails spécifiques, envoyer des e-mails, etc. # Exemple code pour une intégration de base Cet exemple illustre uniquement ce à quoi ressembleraient les appels à l'API depuis le côté JavaScript de l'application, en supposant que l'authentification OAuth2 a déjà été gérée et que vous avez un token d'accès valide. **Lister les E-mails avec l'API Gmail**: \`\`\`javascript async function listEmails() { const accessToken = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'; // Remplacez avec un vrai token d'accès try { const response = await fetch('https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages', { headers: { Authorization: \`Bearer {accessToken}\`, }, }); if (!response.ok) { throw new Error(\`Error: {response.status}\`); } const data = await response.json(); console.log(data); } catch (error) { console.error('Failed to fetch emails', error); } } \`\`\` # Notes de sécurité - **Sécurité de l'authentification**: Lors de l'implémentation de l'authentification OAuth2, assurez-vous de sécuriser les tokens d'accès et les identifiants client. Ne les exposez jamais dans votre frontend et utilisez des échanges de code sécurisés. - **Stockage sécurisé des tokens**: Les tokens d'accès et de rafraîchissement doivent être stockés de manière sécurisée. Tauri offre des mécanismes pour sécuriser ces informations sensibles. # Conclusion Comme vous pouvez le voir, intégrer une application Tauri/Svelte avec l'API Gmail est un processus qui implique plusieurs étapes et une préoccupation sérieuse pour la sécurité et l'authentification des utilisateurs. Bien que ce guide fournisse une vue d'ensemble de haut niveau de cette intégration, chaque application peut avoir des exigences et des complexités uniques. Pour une application réelle, vous devrez plonger plus profondément dans les documentations de Google OAuth2, Gmail API, et Tauri pour assurer que vous respectez toutes les meilleures pratiques en matière de sécurité et d'expérience utilisateur."},{"instruction":"Assume this is a code I wrote in google colab: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- \\"\\"\\"test_model.ipynb Automatically generated by Colaboratory.

This guide will outline how to structure the repository, what contents and files to include, and best practices for clarity and usability. # Step 1: Repository Setup 1. **Create a New Repository:** - Go to GitHub and create a new repository. - Name it in a clear, descriptive manner, e.g., \`audio-diffusion-models\`. - Add a brief description, such as \\"Exploring audio generation through diffusion models.\\" 2. **Initialize with Essentials:** - Choose to initialize the repository with a README, \`.gitignore\` (there's usually a Python template available), and a license if you're ready to select one. For open-source projects, MIT or Apache 2.0 are common choices. # Step 2: Structuring the Repository 1. **Clone the Repository:** - Clone the newly created repository to your local machine. 2. **Directory Structure:** - Create a structure that separates the source code, notebooks, requirements, etc. For your project, it might look something like this: \`\`\` audio-diffusion-models/ ├── notebooks/ │ └── test_model.ipynb ├── src/ │ └── audiodiffusion/ │ └── [your_python_code].py ├── requirements.txt ├── LICENSE └── README.md \`\`\` 3. **Populate the \`src\` Directory:** - Place any Python scripts or modules associated with your project in the \`src\` directory. - If your project relies on a package structure, make sure to include an \`__init__.py\` file in your directories. 4. **Notebook Adjustments:** - Include your Google Colab notebook in the \`notebooks\` directory. - If there are absolute paths or Colab-specific code, consider adding comments or alternative paths for users who might run the notebooks locally. # Step 3: Documentation 1. **README.md:** - The README is the first thing users see. It should clearly explain what the project does, how to use it, and how to contribute. - Sections to include: - **Introduction:** Briefly explain the project's purpose. - **Installation:** Steps to install dependencies, ideally just running \`pip install -r requirements.txt\`. - **Usage:** How to run the scripts or notebooks, including how to open notebooks in Colab with a direct link. - **Contribution Guidelines:** Encourage contributions and outline how to contribute. - **License:** State the project's license. - **Acknowledgments:** Credit any sources, inspirations, or datasets used. 2. **requirements.txt:** - List all Python dependencies here. This allows users to replicate your environment easily. # Step 4: Maintaining the Repository 1. **Version Control for Notebooks:** - Since Jupyter notebooks can be difficult to diff in version control, consider using tools like \`nbdime\` for easier diffing. 2. **Issues and Pull Requests:** - Monitor and respond to issues and pull requests to foster a community around your project. 3. **Continuous Integration:** - If your project includes tests, consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing. # Step 5: Community Engagement 1. **Discussions:** - Enable the Discussions tab on GitHub to allow users to ask questions, share ideas, or discuss topics related to your project. 2. **Releases:** - Use GitHub Releases to distribute new versions, especially if you make substantial changes or improvements. Creating a professional GitHub repository not only makes your project more accessible and usable to others, but it also demonstrates your capabilities in software development and open-source contributions."},{"instruction":"Now create a comprehensive code that generartes audio from text using audio diffusion models","output":"Creating audio from text using audio diffusion models involves several components, including text-to-speech (TTS) to convert the text into speech and then, optionally, applying audio transformation or enhancement through an audio diffusion model for unique effects. Since ready-made, comprehensive solutions for using audio diffusion directly on text are limited and highly specialized, we'll outline a simplified, conceptual approach here. The process can be broken up into two main parts: 1. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Convert the input text into speech/audio. This could be achieved using various TTS libraries or APIs, such as \`gTTS\` (Google Text-to-Speech), which is a simple, accessible choice. 2. **Audio Processing**: Process the generated audio using an audio diffusion model to achieve desired effects, enhancements, or transformations. This part is more experimental and depends on the availability and capabilities of audio diffusion models. # Step 1: Text-to-Speech using gTTS \`gTTS\` provides a way to convert text into audio using Google's Text-to-Speech API. First, you'll need to install \`gTTS\` and an audio library to play the audio, like \`pydub\`. \`\`\`bash pip install gTTS pydub \`\`\` The following Python script demonstrates how to convert text to audio and save the audio file: \`\`\`python from gtts import gTTS from pydub import AudioSegment from pydub.playback import play import os def text_to_speech(text, lang='en'): tts = gTTS(text=text, lang=lang) output_file = \\"output.mp3\\" tts.save(output_file) return output_file def play_audio(file_path): audio = AudioSegment.from_mp3(file_path) play(audio) # Example usage text = \\"Hello, welcome to our audio diffusion demonstration.\\" audio_file_path = text_to_speech(text) print(\\"Playing generated audio...\\") play_audio(audio_file_path) \`\`\` # Step 2: Processing Audio with an Audio Diffusion Model Next, you would process the generated audio file from the TTS phase using an audio diffusion model. Since most audio diffusion models work with specific data types or formats, and there's a variety of potential models (each with its own APIs and expected inputs), this step is more conceptual. You would need a trained audio diffusion model or a platform that provides access to such models. Then, load your audio file, convert it to the required format (e.g., a spectrogram), and process it through the model. # Note Due to the complexity and variety of audio diffusion models and the lack of a standardized, easily accessible API for audio generation, integrating an audio diffusion model directly into this script goes beyond a general example and would require specific details about the model being used, including its input and output format, library dependencies, and runtime environment. Exploration in this area often involves profound research and experimentation, especially if looking to push the boundaries of audio generation quality or achieve particular effects. Advanced users might delve into recent academic papers or repositories on platforms like GitHub to find cutting-edge models and techniques, bridging the gap between TTS and sophisticated audio processing. # Final Thoughts While the above provides a starting point for generating and playing text-based audio, incorporating an audio diffusion model effectively requires more specific model details. As the field evolves, we may see more integrated solutions that streamline this process."},{"instruction":"Make sure the code works end to end in a notebook","output":"Certainly! To provide an end-to-end working example in a notebook, I'll simplify the process into the following steps, focusing on text-to-speech using \`gTTS\` for its simplicity and accessibility. For the audio diffusion part, due to the complexity and the specificity required by most diffusion models, I'll guide you through generating and playing back speech from text, given the broad and experimental nature of integrating audio diffusion directly. Let's focus on setting up a Google Colab notebook that converts text to speech as an illustrative starting point. # Google Colab Notebook Setup First, you'll need to install dependencies. Paste the following commands into the first cell of your Colab notebook to install the \`gTTS\` library for text-to-speech conversion and \`ffmpeg-python\` to handle audio files: \`\`\`python !pip install gTTS ffmpeg-python \`\`\` Next, create a function to convert text to speech and save it as an audio file. Add this in the next cell: \`\`\`python from gtts import gTTS import IPython.display as ipd def text_to_speech(text, lang='en'): \\"\\"\\"Converts text to speech and plays the audio.\\"\\"\\" tts = gTTS(text=text, lang=lang) output_file = \\"/content/output.mp3\\" tts.save(output_file) return output_file text = \\"Hello, welcome to our demonstration. This is an example of text converted to speech.\\" output_mp3 = text_to_speech(text) \`\`\` Finally, to play the generated audio directly within the Colab notebook, use the \`IPython.display.Audio\` function. Paste the following code in another cell: \`\`\`python ipd.Audio(output_mp3) \`\`\` Running these cells in sequence will convert the specified text to speech, save it as an MP3 file, and play it back directly in your Colab notebook. # Extensions and Limitations This example provides a starting point for text-to-speech generation in a Colab notebook. Integrating an audio diffusion model to further process the generated speech is a more complex and specialized task. It involves: 1. **Model Selection:** Identifying a suitable audio diffusion model that fits your project goals. 2. **Data Preparation:** Converting the TTS-generated audio into a format accepted by the diffusion model. 3. **Model Integration:** Running the prepared audio through the audio diffusion model to apply the desired effects or transformations. 4. **Output Handling:** Converting the model's output back into an audio format and evaluating the results. Each of these steps requires careful consideration of the model's capabilities, data formats, and computational requirements. Advanced use cases may also involve fine-tuning the model on specific datasets, which adds additional complexity. # Conclusion The above guide provides a straightforward approach to generating speech from text in a Colab notebook, suitable for demonstrations or initial explorations of TTS. Integrating audio diffusion for advanced audio processing opens up exciting possibilities but requires a deeper dive into specific models and more complex implementation."},{"instruction":"Create a comprehesive gihub repo with code and showcase your deep knowledge in audio diffusion models","output":"Creating a GitHub repository that showcases a deep understanding of audio diffusion models involves several steps, from planning the repository structure to creating detailed documentation and examples. This guide will provide a framework for setting up such a repository, focusing on clarity, comprehensiveness, and ease of use for the community. # Step 1: Plan the Repository Structure Your repository should be structured in a way that is immediately understandable to new users, yet comprehensive enough for advanced developers. A potential structure might look like this: \`\`\` audio-diffusion-exploration/ ├── notebooks/ │ ├── TextToSpeechAudioDiffusion.ipynb │ └── AdvancedAudioEffects.ipynb ├── src/ │ ├── audio_diffusion/ │ │ ├── __init__.py │ │ ├── models.py │ │ ├── transforms.py │ │ └── utils.py │ ├── tts/ │ │ ├── __init__.py │ │ └── gTTS_wrapper.py ├── examples/ │ ├── simple_example.mp3 │ └── transformed_example.mp3 ├── requirements.txt ├── LICENSE └── README.md \`\`\` # Step 2: Populate the Repository 1. **Notebooks**: Create Jupyter notebooks (\`TextToSpeechAudioDiffusion.ipynb\`, \`AdvancedAudioEffects.ipynb\`) that provide a tutorial-like exploration of text-to-speech and audio diffusion models. These should include commentary on what each section does, why certain choices were made, and what results to expect. 2. **Source Code**: The \`src\` directory contains your project's Python code. - In the \`audio_diffusion\` subdirectory, place the source code related to the audio diffusion model such as model definitions (\`models.py\`), data transforms (\`transforms.py\`), and utility functions (\`utils.py\`). - The \`tts\` subdirectory could contain wrappers or utility functions around TTS libraries, such as a custom wrapper for \`gTTS\` (\`gTTS_wrapper.py\`) that integrates seamlessly with your audio processing pipeline. 3. **Examples**: Include audio examples (\`simple_example.mp3\`, \`transformed_example.mp3\`) showcasing the capabilities of your project. These could be original audio clips before and after applying your audio diffusion models. 4. **Requirements**: The \`requirements.txt\` file should list all the dependencies needed to run your project. 5. **License and Readme**: - **LICENSE**: Choose an appropriate license for your code, such as MIT or Apache 2.0, and include the full license text here. - **README.md**: This is your project's homepage on GitHub. It should include: - **Project Overview**: An introduction to your project and the problems it aims to solve. - **Installation Instructions**: Steps to install the project and its dependencies, ideally with code blocks (\`pip install -r requirements.txt\`). - **Usage Guide**: Clear examples of how to use your project, including running the notebooks and scripts. - **Contributing**: Guidelines for how others can contribute to your project. - **Examples and Results**: Summaries of what's in the \`examples\` directory, perhaps with audio embeds or links. - **Citations**: References to papers, datasets, or codebases you used or were inspired by. # Step 3: Engage with the Community - **Commit Early and Often**: Start committing your initial structure and iteratively update your repository. Small, frequent updates are easier to manage and track. - **Issues and Pull Requests**: Monitor and respond actively. Use issues to track bugs or feature requests, and review pull requests from contributors. - **Discussions**: If GitHub Discussions is available for your repository, use it to engage with your project's users and contributors more interactively. # Step 4: Promote Your Project Once your repository is populated and documented, share it on social platforms, relevant communities, and perhaps write a blog post to walk through the project's goals, achievements, and potential uses. Feedback can significantly guide future development. # Conclusion Building a comprehensive GitHub repository around a complex theme like audio diffusion models not only showcases your expertise but also contributes to the community's knowledge.

The shadows are moving!” Gloopy: “They seem to like our glow. Hey there, shadows, we come in peace and sparkles!” Scene 4: The Connection - As they continue, Gloopy and Glitter start to play with the shadows, creating shapes with their bodies and watching the shadows mimic them. - This interaction seems to delight the shadows, who begin to form patterns and symbols on the ground, signaling some form of communication. Glitter (excitedly): “Gloopy, they’re smart! Let’s see if we can understand them.” Scene 5: Learning and Teaching - Gloopy and Glitter try different movements and gestures while observing the shadows’ responses. - After some time, a rudimentary form of dialogue emerges—through the language of light and shadow, they begin to understand one another. Gloopy (nodding thoughtfully): “They’re telling us they haven’t seen light like ours in ages. They’ve missed it.” Glitter: “And they’re saying they want to help us fix the ship! How incredible!” Scene 6: Cooperation - With guidance from the shadows, Gloopy and Glitter locate the necessary materials scattered around the barren planet. - The shadows playfully assist, enveloping objects in darkness to highlight them against the gray backdrop. Gloopy: “Thanks, friends! This sure is teamwork of a whole new shade!” Glitter: “Your turn to shine, my little shadows!” Scene 7: The Transformation - As the blob-mobile is being repaired, Glitter gets a bright idea. She gathers her potions and concocts a special mixture of her glitter and Gloopy’s goo. - Spreading the mixture onto the landscape, a remarkable transformation occurs. The dull terrain begins to sparkle, and the shadows start to dance with color. Glitter (with a heart full of glee): “A little bit of Gloopy, a little bit of Glitter, and voilà!” Scene 8: A World Reborn - The lifeless planet comes to life, bursting with colors as the shadows reflect the newfound light from every shimmering rock and sparkling crevice. - The shadows, now intertwined with the light, create an ethereal glow that stretches as far as the eye can see. Gloopy (in awe): “We didn’t just find a new world—we helped create one.” Glitter: “And we’ve made new friends who taught us the beauty that lies in the shadows.” Scene 9: Farewell and Forward - With the blob-mobile repaired and the memories of a once barren planet now teeming with prismatic hues, Gloopy and Glitter bid their new friends goodbye. - The shadows wave in their own fluid, graceful way as the duo blasts off, leaving behind a legacy of light in the darkness. Voiceover: “And with their hearts a little fuller, Gloopy and Glitter continue their odyssey amongst the stars, forever seeking to brighten the cosmos, one rejuvenated world at a time.” - The screen fades to black, with the echoes of Gloopy and Glitter’s laughter trailing off, the barren planet they left now aglow with vibrant shadows and radiant sparkles. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign! Stay toony, and let’s look forward to positive news about our favorite show’s return!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns.

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new. Each show brings something different to the lineup, so let’s keep an open mind. Who knows? We might just find a new favorite among these newcomers! Write a tweet in late July where WOQ is the 2nd most popular show, and state what 1 is 🌟 Incredible news, #ToonFans! 📊 “World of Quest” has risen to become the 2nd most popular show on Kids’ WB this July, trailing right behind the unstoppable “Code Lyoko” at #1! 🎮🗺️ Talk about an adventure-packed summer!

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up.

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra! Extra!/The Magic Trick/Treasure Hunt/The Forgotten Memory (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:00 Ultimate Muscle: Making The Cut (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:30 Code Lyoko: Guided Missile - 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown: Finding Omi - 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: The Barren Planet of Shadows/Lost in Gloopiter - 10:00 Sonic X: Satellite Swindle (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya: Un-Reality TV (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 11:00 Johnny Test: Johnny To The Centre of the Earth/Phat Johnny - 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man: Why I Hate Gym Forum Thread Title: “The Shift to CW4KIDS.tv - Observing Website Updates & Pokémon Episode Airings” User1: WebWizKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:47 AM Have you all checked out cw4kids.com lately? Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped!

User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast.

User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu's Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are!

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history. Meanwhile, let’s celebrate our top-rated shows—they’re shaping the new legacy of CW4Kids. Keep the conversations and your passion for the toons flowing! User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

Big news just dropped about the late-winter lineup change happening on February 17th. We’re getting “GoGoRiki,” “Kirby: Right Back At Ya,” and “Ultimate Muscle” making their debuts! 🎉 And here’s a bit you’ll REALLY find interesting, especially if you were a Kids WB regular late last year: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are coming back! Seems like CW4Kids is mixing nostalgia with fresh new content. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMornSage Posted on February 1, 2024, at 8:45 AM Excited for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” and “Ultimate Muscle” – those are some solid classics! As for “GoGoRiki,” I’m intrigued. But the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”?! That’s unexpected yet pleasantly surprising. It’s great to see CW4Kids bringing back a show that had a rather abrupt ending on Kids WB. Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix. And “Ultimate Muscle” brings back so many childhood memories of wrestling madness! CW4Kids is really upping its game with this lineup. User4: NewEraNick Posted on February 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM I’m pumped for the new additions, but “Gloopy and Glitter’s” return has me the most excited. It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids not just wiping the slate clean but also honoring some of what made Kids WB special in its final days. Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait! Moderator: CW4KidsCaretaker Posted on February 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for our upcoming late-winter lineup and the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”!

August 2024 From September, some new shows are headed to CW4Kids: First is Redakai: Conquer the Kairu, Vampire Hunters (Dub of Demon Slayer, censored for kids) and Chaotic: Reloaded (Sequel series to Chaotic) Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Upcoming Fall Lineup – New Show Speculation!” User1: ToonTrekker Posted on August 20, 2024, at 10:30 AM Big news, cartoon crew! Starting in September, CW4Kids is adding some spicy shows to the mix, and I for one am stoked! “Redakai: Conquer the Kairu” sounds epic, and did anyone else hear about “Vampire Hunters”? It’s supposed to be a kid-friendly version of “Demon Slayer.” And then there’s “Chaotic: Reloaded,” a sequel to the original “Chaotic,” which I’m hoping will carry on the legacy. Anybody else got thoughts or hopes for these new additions? User2: DigitalDive Posted on August 20, 2024, at 10:50 AM Whoa, a dub of “Demon Slayer” for kids? That’s ambitious! CW4Kids really isn’t afraid to push the boundaries, are they? Sounds like they’ll need to get creative with the censorship, but I’m intrigued. And “Redakai” should fit right in with the action-packed vibes of the channel. User3: MysticToonMage Posted on August 20, 2024, at 11:15 AM “Chaotic: Reloaded” is where it’s at for me! I lost countless hours to the original series, and I’m thrilled to jump back into that world. As for “Vampire Hunters,” CW4Kids has always been good at adapting shows for their audience, so I’m keen to see how they handle it. User4: SaturdayAMSuperfan Posted on August 20, 2024, at 11:45 AM Excited and curious to see how “Redakai” performs. It has big shoes to fill with the current lineup, but the premise sounds action-packed. As for “Vampire Hunters,” color me intrigued. It’s a bold move for CW4Kids, but if done right, it could be a hit! User5: RetroToonRewinder Posted on August 20, 2024, at 12:05 PM “Chaotic: Reloaded”? Count me in! The original was a blast.

This conversion process depends on understanding what each term represents: - **Left**: The x-coordinate of the leftmost edge of the bounding box. - **Right**: The x-coordinate of the rightmost edge of the bounding box. - **Top**: The y-coordinate of the top edge of the bounding box. (In some coordinate systems, this might be the lower value if the origin (0,0) is at the bottom left.) - **Bottom**: The y-coordinate of the bottom edge of the bounding box. (In some coordinate systems, this might represent the higher value if the origin (0,0) is at the bottom left.) - **x**: The x-coordinate where you want your bounding box to start (typically this is the left edge). - **y**: The y-coordinate where you want your bounding box to start (typically this is the top edge, but remember the coordinate system orientation). - **w (width)**: The width of the bounding box. - **h (height)**: The height of the bounding box. # Conversion Given the definitions above, you can convert from left, right, top, bottom to x, y, w, h using the following formulas: \`\`\`plaintext x = left y = top w = right - left h = bottom - top \`\`\` These formulas assume a coordinate system where (0,0) is at the top-left corner, which is common in computer graphics and image processing. In this system, \`x\` and \`y\` coordinates increase as you move right and down, respectively. # Example If you have a bounding box with the following coordinates: - Left: 100 - Right: 300 - Top: 50 - Bottom: 200 Then, using the conversion formulas: - **x** = 100 - **y** = 50 - **w** = 300 - 100 = 200 - **h** = 200 - 50 = 150 So, your converted bounding box in x, y, w, h format would be (100, 50, 200, 150). If your coordinate system is such that (0,0) is at the bottom left (less common in pure image processing contexts but possible in other graphics or geospatial systems), adjust the formulas for \`y\` and \`h\` to reflect your system's orientation."},{"instruction":"then convert into xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax","output":"To convert from the x, y, width (w), height (h) format back to xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax (which corresponds to left, right, top, bottom respectively in the initial question), you essentially have to reverse the process described before. Given that: - **x** is the x-coordinate of the starting point (typically the left edge), - **y** is the y-coordinate of the starting point (typically the top edge), - **w** is the width of the bounding box, - **h** is the height of the bounding box, The conversion would go as follows: # Conversion Formula - **xmin** (left) = x - **xmax** (right) = x + w - **ymin** (top) = y - **ymax** (bottom) = y + h # Example Revisited Let's take the converted bounding box we got earlier: - **x** = 100 - **y** = 50 - **w** = 200 - **h** = 150 Applying the formulas for the conversion back to xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax: - **xmin** = x = 100 - **xmax** = x + w = 100 + 200 = 300 - **ymin** = y = 50 - **ymax** = y + h = 50 + 150 = 200 So, the converted bounding box coordinates in xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax format would be xmin=100, xmax=300, ymin=50, ymax=200, which aligns with the original left, right, top, bottom values we started with. This demonstrates a full round trip of conversions between the two formats and ensures a clear understanding of the relationship between each representation of a bounding box."},{"instruction":"What is yolo format of annotation","output":"The YOLO (You Only Look Once) format of annotation is specifically designed for the YOLO object detection algorithm. This annotation format is different from more traditional formats like Pascal VOC (which uses XML files) or COCO (JSON format). The YOLO format simplifies annotations into a straightforward, space-delimited text format that is easy to read and write programmatically. In the YOLO annotation format, each object within an image is described by one line in a text file. Each of these lines provides the object class and the bounding box coordinates. However, the coordinates are normalized to fall between 0 and 1, making the annotations independent of the image size. This normalization allows the model to be applied to images of different sizes more flexibly. Each line in a YOLO annotation file contains five values separated by spaces: \`\`\` <class> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height> \`\`\` Here's what each of these values represents: 1. **class**: The class ID of the object, usually an integer starting from 0. 2. **x_center** and **y_center**: The x and y coordinates of the center of the bounding box. These values are normalized to fall between 0 and 1, with respect to the width and height of the image respectively. 3. **width** and **height**: The width and height of the bounding box. Just like the center coordinates, these values are normalized to fall between 0 and 1 relative to the image's width and height. # How To Normalize Bounding Box Coordinates Assuming you have the absolute coordinates of the bounding box in the format \`(x_min, y_min, width, height)\` and the dimensions of the image are \`(image_width, image_height)\`, you would calculate the YOLO format values as follows: \`\`\`python x_center_normalized = (x_min + width / 2) / image_width y_center_normalized = (y_min + height / 2) / image_height width_normalized = width / image_width height_normalized = height / image_height \`\`\` # Example Consider an image with dimensions \`1920x1080\` pixels, and there's an object of class \`1\` with a bounding box at \`(480, 300)\` of width \`960\` and height \`540\`. The normalized YOLO format annotation would look like this: \`\`\` 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 \`\`\` In this example, \`(0.5, 0.5)\` is the normalized center of the bounding box, and \`(0.5, 0.5)\` represents the normalized width and height of the bounding box, signifying that the object occupies half the width and half the height of the entire image. This YOLO format is particularly useful for the training process of YOLO object detection models, as it provides a compact and efficient way to represent object annotations."},{"instruction":"in c#, come posso scrivere la query verso mongo DB evitando il ciclo for? --- public IFetchedJob Dequeue(string[] queues, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { if (queues == null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(queues)); } if (queues.Length == 0) { throw new ArgumentException(\\"Queue array must be non-empty.\\", nameof(queues)); } var filter = Builders<JobQueueDto>.Filter; var fetchConditions = new[] { filter.Eq(_ => _.FetchedAt, null), filter.Lt(_ => _.FetchedAt, DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(_storageOptions.InvisibilityTimeout.Negate().TotalSeconds)) }; var fetchConditionsIndex = 0; var options = new FindOneAndUpdateOptions<JobQueueDto> { IsUpsert = false, ReturnDocument = ReturnDocument.After }; JobQueueDto fetchedJob = null; while (fetchedJob == null) { cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); var fetchCondition = fetchConditions[fetchConditionsIndex]; foreach (var queue in queues) { fetchedJob = _connection .JobGraph .OfType<JobQueueDto>() .FindOneAndUpdate( fetchCondition & filter.Eq(_ => _.Queue, queue), Builders<JobQueueDto>.Update.Set(_ => _.FetchedAt, DateTime.UtcNow), options, cancellationToken); if (fetchedJob != null) { break; } } if (fetchedJob == null) { // No more jobs found in any of the requested queues... if (fetchConditionsIndex == fetchConditions.Length - 1) { // ...and we are out of fetch conditions as well. // Wait for a while before polling again. cancellationToken.WaitHandle.WaitOne(_storageOptions.QueuePollInterval); cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); } } // Move on to next fetch condition fetchConditionsIndex = (fetchConditionsIndex + 1) % fetchConditions.Length; } return new MongoFetchedJob(_connection, fetchedJob.Id, fetchedJob.JobId, fetchedJob.Queue); } ---","output":"Per evitare l'uso del ciclo \`foreach\` nella tua query a MongoDB e al tempo stesso mantenere una logica che permetta di cercare su più code (\`queues\`), puoi modificare la query affinché usi l'operatore \`in\` di MongoDB.

I think it’s probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) [ ] base_model_id = ‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’ target_model_id = ‘valine/OpenSnark’ setup enviroment [ ] !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Requirement already satisfied: torch in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.1.0+cu118) Requirement already satisfied: transformers in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.37.2) Requirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.20.3) Requirement already satisfied: bitsandbytes in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.42.0) Requirement already satisfied: accelerate in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.27.2) Requirement already satisfied: peft in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.8.2) Requirement already satisfied: sentencepiece in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.1.99) Requirement already satisfied: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.25.2) Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (6.0.1) Requirement already satisfied: safetensors in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.4.2) Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.66.2) Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.9.0) Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (4.4.0) Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (1.12) Requirement already satisfied: networkx in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.0) Requirement already satisfied: jinja2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: fsspec in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2024.2.0) Requirement already satisfied: triton==2.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2.1.0) Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (1.24.1) Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (23.2) Requirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2023.12.25) Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2.31.0) Requirement already satisfied: tokenizers<0.19,>=0.14 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (0.15.2) Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bitsandbytes) (1.12.0) Requirement already satisfied: psutil in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from accelerate) (5.9.6) Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from jinja2->torch) (2.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.1.1) Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.4) Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.26.13) Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2022.12.7) Requirement already satisfied: mpmath>=0.19 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from sympy->torch) (1.3.0) WARNING: Running pip as the ‘root’ user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

Imagine you have a very complicated recipe book (a machine learning model) that helps you cook exactly what you want (generate text, recognize images, etc.). However, this book is huge, and you only want to cook something very specific. Copying the entire book would be too much work and not necessary. Instead, you find a clever way to copy only the necessary parts to tweak your existing recipes slightly and achieve the new dish you’re aiming for. This method of copying only what’s needed and integrating it with your current recipes is known as Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Here’s how the code you shared works, using this analogy: 1. Choosing the Recipe Books: It starts by selecting two recipe books - a base book (‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’), which you already know, and a target book (‘valine/OpenSnark’), which has the new recipe you want. 2. Preparation: Before you start, you ensure you have all the tools and ingredients ready ( pip install … is like making sure you have all the kitchen tools and ingredients). 3. Downloading the Books: The code then downloads these recipe books from a huge library (Hugging Face Hub). 4. Identifying Special Ingredients: It looks through the books to find the special ingredients and methods (‘linear and embedding layers’) that make the new recipe unique. 5. Getting the New Ingredients: The code downloads the target book with the new recipe. 6. Reading the Ingredients: It reads through the books to understand the ingredients and methods used (‘loading tensors’). 7. Creating a New Recipe: The most magical part comes next - the code combines ingredients from both books to create a new, simplified recipe. This process is called low-rank decomposition, which is a fancy way of saying it finds a simpler way to combine the complex methods. 8. Extracting the Essence: The new recipe is then saved (‘Extract the LoRAs’) in a simple format so you can use it without the entire book. 9. Testing the Dish: To make sure the new recipe works, the code tries it out by cooking something (‘Testing the result’). 10. Sharing Your Recipe: Happy with the new dish? The code then helps you share this recipe with others by uploading it to the library (‘Hugging Face Hub’) so others can try it too. So, essentially, this code cleverly extracts a specific “taste” or “style” from one big recipe book (model) and makes it easy to apply to your dishes without needing to copy the entire book! CONTINUE CONVERSATION: What if I already have a Low-rank decomposition of a model (specifically, a model called 'quietstar-8-ahead' which uses 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1' as a base) It was Created using LoRD. For context, the 'quietstar-8-ahead' model is a result of this paper: \\"\\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking Eric Zelikman Stanford University Georges Harik Notbad AI Inc Yijia Shao Stanford University Varuna Jayasiri Notbad AI Inc Nick Haber Stanford University Noah D. Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results. We evaluate the extent to which the model trained with Quiet-STaR generalizes to directly answering problems that require reasoning. The left plot (a) shows the zero-shot accuracy on GSM8K, while the right plot (b) shows the zero-shot accuracy on CommonsenseQA, without any fine-tuning. In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2 OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part? You have Third Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment. Our net wealth will be 12-5*12 = 24 dollars. Is that correct? Fourth Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, Jane's ducks lay 16 eggs perday. So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers' market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day! (Note: Step 3 and Step 8 are repeating, but the (3,7) term in Step 8 is not the same as the (3,7) term in Step 3. ) Fifth Response <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at 20 the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. What do we know? - Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. - She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. From these two facts, we can conclude at least that Janet needs at least seven eggs for consumption per day. And what do we need to find exactly? - We need to find how much in dollars Janet makes every day at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation and solve it to find the answer. We know: - (16-3-4=9) So our daily profit is 9 times 2, or (9times2=18) Hence her profits at market on a given day are (18). Answer: (18).

A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same. Where do I make te mistake? Thanks for any help! ;) • Have you tried use cos^2theta+sin^2theta =1 – Fan May 15 '17 at 19:13 • You didn't err. You just didn't finish. May 15 '17 at 19:35 hint In your last line, factor by sin (theta), replace sin^2(theta) by 1-cos^2 (theta) Figure 8: Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","output":"Given the complex task of summarizing and clarifying the extensive information provided, it's important to focus on the key points and innovations detailed across the segments, mainly surrounding the Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for transformers, the techniques employed including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and how these are applied for extracting LoRA adapters, comparisons with other models and approaches, and considerations on the compute efficiency and potential instability during training. # Simplified Summary Imagine you're giving a kid a box of Lego pieces (the base language model) to build a certain model. Now, this kid has learned over time that by combining some unique smaller sets (LoRA adapters) in different ways, they can quickly modify the big model to look like a spaceship, a car, or a house without having to rebuild it from scratch. These small sets are like smart shortcuts that add specific new features or abilities to the base model. Researchers now have a smart method to find these unique sets in a more efficient way. They use a special magnifying glass (Singular Value Decomposition or SVD) to look into the big Lego model and identify which smaller sets were added to make it behave in a certain new way (such as making it more knowledgeable about weather or sports). This way, instead of teaching the Lego model from scratch, they can quickly tweak it to be good at new tasks, saving time and effort. However, finding these sets and making sure they fit well without causing the model to become unstable or forget its previous cool tricks (like being good at general conversation) can be tricky. The researchers developed and tested methods to ensure these new sets integrate well without causing issues, even though it requires careful handling and sometimes might require more computing resources. In essence, they're making these intelligent Lego models more adaptable and quicker to learn new tricks by efficiently identifying and integrating these magical small sets, making them even smarter and more versatile, like having a Lego model that can easily transform between being a race car to a spaceship, depending on what you need. # Key Innovations & Takeaways - **LoRA and SVD**: This technique is about efficiently tuning large language models to perform new tasks without having to train them from scratch. - **Extraction and Integration**: The focus is on cleverly identifying and integrating adapters to fine-tune models efficiently for specific tasks. - **Compute Efficiency**: While effective, these techniques can be computation-intensive, highlighting a balance between enhancing model performance and managing compute resources. - **Stability in Learning**: Ensuring that introducing these adapters doesn’t destabilize the model or detract from its original capabilities is a crucial consideration. # Conclusion The work described explores advanced methods to make AI models more versatile and quicker to adapt, akin to giving them a 'shortcut' to learn new things. This not only makes AI more powerful but also more accessible, by reducing the need for extensive retraining. However, it requires careful balance and handling to ensure these 'shortcuts' integrate well without negative side effects, underlining the ongoing challenge in the field of AI to manage trade-offs between performance, stability, and resource efficiency."},{"instruction":"what is yolo format of annotation","output":"The YOLO (You Only Look Once) format of annotation is designed for use with the YOLO object detection system, which is a popular framework for performing object detection tasks in real-time by looking at the image only once. This format is notably simple and efficient, catering to the YOLO algorithm's need for speed and accuracy. Annotations in YOLO format are typically used to train and evaluate the YOLO model, allowing it to recognize and localize objects within images. In YOLO format, annotations for each object in an image are usually stored in a separate text file with the same name as the image file but with a \`.txt\` extension. Each line in the file corresponds to one object and contains five values separated by spaces. These values are: 1. **Object class ID**: An integer that represents the class of the object (e.g., 0 for person, 1 for bicycle). The specific integers for each object class are defined based on the ordering of classes in a separate class names file. 2. **Center x coordinate**: The x coordinate of the center of the bounding box, normalized by the width of the image (i.e., the x coordinate divided by the image width). This value should be between 0 and 1. 3. **Center y coordinate**: The y coordinate of the center of the bounding box, normalized by the height of the image (i.e., the y coordinate divided by the image height). This value should also be between 0 and 1. 4. **Width of the bounding box**: The width of the bounding box, normalized by the width of the image. Like the other normalized values, this should be between 0 and 1. 5. **Height of the bounding box**: The height of the bounding box, normalized by the height of the image, and should also be between 0 and 1. Here is an example line from a YOLO annotation file, representing an object annotation: \`\`\` 0 0.50625 0.39444444444444443 0.2125 0.4222222222222222 \`\`\` In this example, the first value (\`0\`) indicates the object class ID. The next values (\`0.50625\` and \`0.39444444444444443\`) specify the normalized x and y coordinates of the bounding box center. The last two values (\`0.2125\` and \`0.4222222222222222\`) indicate the normalized width and height of the bounding box, respectively. This format is widely appreciated for its simplicity and efficiency, making it well-suited for training objects detection models like YOLO that require high-speed processing."},{"instruction":"In the context of a hypothetical, Where does the M231 go, other than the Port of Newhaven ?","output":"In a hypothetical scenario, envisioning where the M231 might go aside from the Port of Newhaven requires a bit of creative interpretation. The M231 refers to a specific item or place, and without specific context, it could refer to multiple things.

Let's assume the goal of the M231 is to enhance transportation efficiency, reduce traffic congestion, and improve access from the Port of Newhaven to the broader motorway network in the UK. # Starting Point: Port of Newhaven, Sussex The Port of Newhaven is situated on the coast of Sussex, England, and serves as a vital point for ferry services and cargo. The starting point of the M231 would logically be close to this port to facilitate direct access for transport and haulage services. # Direction and Key Features The hypothetical M231 would likely head northwards from Newhaven to bypass Brighton to the east. The motorway would aim to connect with the existing motorway network with minimal disruption to the South Downs, an area of outstanding natural beauty and considerable ecological and cultural importance. # Possible Route 1. **Leaving Newhaven:** The motorway would start near the port, strategically placed to handle both passenger and freight traffic efficiently. 2. **Bypassing Brighton and Hove:** Instead of going through the urban areas of Brighton and Hove, the M231 could run to the east of these cities, potentially following a route somewhat parallel to the A27 but with a more direct trajectory to allow for faster travel. Care would be taken to mitigate environmental impact, possibly involving tunnel sections or viaducts to preserve the landscape and local ecosystems. 3. **Northward Towards the M23:** Continuing its route north, the M231 could aim to intersect with the A23 first, providing an indirect link to Brighton and other towns. The ultimate goal would be to join the M23 motorway, which serves as a main artery to London and connects with the wider UK motorway network. 4. **Interconnection with M23:** A logical point of merger could be planned north of the existing M23 terminus near Pease Pottage, avoiding major urban centers and instead focusing on creating a seamless transition from the M231 to the M23 for traffic bound for London or the M25 London Orbital Motorway, facilitating broader network access. # Implications - **Economic Growth:** Improved motorway access could significantly boost economic growth in Newhaven and surrounding areas by enhancing logistics and transport efficiency. - **Environmental Considerations:** The construction of a new motorway would necessitate careful environmental assessment, particularly to address concerns related to the South Downs. - **Infrastructure Development:** This project would likely spur additional infrastructure development, including service areas, junction improvements, and possibly new housing or commercial developments near interchanges.
