Any number ( n ) will have a corresponding number directly opposite to it, which can be calculated using the circular characteristics and properties. 2. **Half-Way Point Calculation:** [ text{Number of positions on the circle} = 200 ] Since the numbers are equally spaced, the number directly opposite to any particular number ( n ) can be calculated using the formula: [ text{Opposite number} = (n + 100) mod 200 ] This ensures that we are calculating the position 100 steps ahead in the circle, looping back to the start if the result exceeds 200. 3. **Apply the Formula for 113:** [ text{Opposite number of 113} = (113 + 100) mod 200 = 213 mod 200 = 13 ] However, there seems to be a misunderstanding here – (113 + 100 = 213).

However, the figure will still have reflection symmetry along the diagonals, which we don't want. - **Non-Corner Edge Squares:** Changing one non-corner edge square to white means having to change the opposite edge square to white as well, again leading to reflection symmetry along the middle lines. 5. **Exploring Different Configurations:** - To avoid reflective symmetry while maintaining rotational symmetry, we need a balanced approach. - The next possible configuration is to change more squares. 6. **Configuration That Meets Criteria:** - Let's invert four squares strategically: - Change two opposite corners and two opposite edges. For instance, if we change the top-left corner, we also change the bottom-right corner. - Similarly, change one pair of opposite sides, such as left-center and right-center. 7. **Validation and Conclusion:** - Upon changing the indicated numbers of squares: - The design retains rotational symmetry since the pattern looks the same when rotated 180 degrees. - The design does not have reflective symmetry because no line divides the pattern into two identical halves. Here is one valid configuration: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|} hline W & B & W hline B & B & B hline W & B & W hline end{array} ] In this configuration, we have 5 black squares and 4 white squares.

To convert this to meters per second, we first convert the distance to meters and the time to seconds: 12 km = 12,000 meters 5 minutes = 5 x 60 seconds = 300 seconds Now we can calculate the speed of the bus: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = 12,000 meters / 300 seconds Speed = 40 meters/second The bus takes 5 seconds to pass a telegraph post, so the length of the bus is the distance it covers in that time at its speed: Length of the bus = Speed x Time Length of the bus = 40 meters/second x 5 seconds Length of the bus = 200 meters However, a bus that is 200 meters long is not realistic. It's likely that there was a mistake in the calculation or the given information.

Each player in turn takes a card and places it on the board until all the cards have been played. The first player wins if the sum of the numbers in the first and third rows is greater than the sum in the first and third columns, loses if it is less, and draws if the sums are equal. Which player wins and what is the winning strategy?","output":"The first player, denoted as Player F, will always win if they employ the correct strategy. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy and why it ensures a win. Let's denote the 3 x 3 board as follows: \`\`\` F . S . . . S . F \`\`\` We refer to the squares marked F as F-squares, those marked S as S-squares, and the remaining ones as neutral squares. Player F wins if the sum of the numbers in the two F-squares (1st and 3rd rows) is greater than the sum in the two S-squares (1st and 3rd columns). Conversely, Player S wins if their sum is greater, and the game is a draw if both sums are equal. The key idea is to use the sums of pairs of highest and lowest valued cards. Let the cards be labeled as (a_1 > a_2 > dots > a_9). Define the sums: [ t_1 = a_1 + a_9 ] [ t_2 = a_2 + a_8 ] [ t_3 = a_3 + a_7 ] [ t_4 = a_4 + a_6 ] We analyze different cases based on the values of ( t_1, t_2, t_3, ) and ( t_4 ). Case 1: ( t_1 > t_2 ) Player F's strategy is to secure a total ( t_1 ) or better on the F-squares and force Player S to get a lower score on the S-squares. **Step-by-Step:** 1. **First Move:** Player F plays ( a_1 ) to an F-square. 2. **Response by Player S:** To prevent F from getting a total of at least ( a_1 + a_3 ) or better (which would win), S must play ( a_9 ) to the remaining F-square achieving ( t_1 ). 3. **Next Moves:** - Player F will now aim to force player S into a sum worse than ( t_1 ). - Example: F plays ( a_8 ) to an S-square (assuming ( a_9 ) was played there already). - S then might try to counter with placing ( a_2 ) strategically but is cornered because the next placements by players will lock in high values for F on non-S squares. Case 2: ( t_1 = t_2 > t_3 ) Player F still attempts to get a sum of ( t_1 ) and ensure Player S cannot match or exceed it. **Step-by-Step:** 1. **First Move:** Player F plays ( a_1 ) to an F-square. 2. **Response by Player S:** S must play ( a_9 ) to the other F-square to force a draw at worst. 3. **Next Moves:** - Player F plays ( a_2 ) to a neutral square. - Player F then places ( a_3 ) to force S onto scores summed worse than ( t_1 ). Case 3: ( t_1 = t_2 = t_3 geq t_4 ) The strategy remains similar, ensuring Player S never secures better sums than ( t_4 ). **Step-by-Step:** 1. **First Move:** Player F plays ( a_1 ) to an F-square. 2. **Response by Player S:** S must play ( a_9 ) to another crucial spot. 3. **Handling neutral plays:** Follow previously discussed moves, forcing S to react sub-optimally. Case 4: ( t_1 = t_2 = t_3 = t_4 ) In such a balanced case, the strategy employs careful positioning to keep ( t_4 ) central. **Step-by-Step:** 1. **First Move:** Player F plays a key high value card (e.g., ( a_1 )) to a central neutral square. 2. **Player S forced plays:** S must prevent combinations leading to ( t_4 )-lower scores on crucial F-spots. Conclusion: By observing the choices of high-low card allocations, the strategic play ensures the first player F always maneuver to keep totals in a winning bracket or force S into subsol optimal finish placings. boxed{text{The first player always wins with the described strategy}}"},{"instruction":"The amount 3.7 is split into two nonnegative real numbers uniformly at random.

We can manipulate the equation to look like this: [ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 y^2 implies 1 + z^2 = x^2 y^2 - x^2 - y^2 + 1 = (x^2 - 1)(y^2 - 1) ] 2. **Check for Parity:** We will first investigate the parity (odd or even nature) of both sides of the equation [ 1 + z^2 = (x^2 - 1)(y^2 - 1) ] If ( z ) is even, then ( z^2 ) is even, making ( 1 + z^2 ) odd. If ( z ) is odd, then ( z^2 ) is of the form ( 4k + 1 ) for some integer ( k ), thus making ( 1 + z^2 ) of the form ( 4k + 2 ), which is even. Suppose the left-hand side is even (( 1 + z^2 )), which implies ( z^2 ) and hence ( z ) must be odd. Since ( z ) is odd, ( z^2 ) is of the form ( 4k + 1 ), so ( 1 + z^2 ) will be of the form ( 4k + 2 ). On the right-hand side, ((x^2 - 1)) and ((y^2 - 1)) are even if ( x ) and ( y ) are odd, making the product ((x^2 - 1)(y^2 - 1)) divisible by 4. Thus, the equation's two sides have contradictory parities because ( 4k + 2 ) is not divisible by 4. Therefore, if ( (x^2 - 1)(y^2 - 1) ) is also even, one of these factors must be even. But if either ( x ) or ( y ) is even, then ( x^2 ) or ( y^2 ) will be congruent to 0 mod 4, thus making ( (x^2 - 1) ) or ( (y^2 - 1) ) congruent to 3 mod 4, and their product won't be divisible by 4. Therefore, ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) must all be odd. 3. **Express ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) in Terms of Odd Numbers:** Let us set [ x=2^alpha cdot t, quad y=2^beta cdot u, quad z=2^gamma cdot v ] where ( alpha, beta, gamma geq 1 ) and ( t, u, v ) are odd numbers. 4. **Substitution and Simplification:** Substitute these into the original equation which becomes: [ 2^{2alpha} cdot t^2 + 2^{2beta} cdot u^2 + 2^{2gamma} cdot v^2 = 2^{2alpha+2beta} cdot t^2 u^2 ] 5. **Divide by ( 2^{2alpha} ):** Divide by ( 2^{2alpha} ) (assuming ( alpha leq beta ) and ( alpha leq gamma )), we get: [ t^2 + 2^{2(beta - alpha)} cdot u^2 + 2^{2(gamma - alpha)} cdot v^2 = 2^{2beta} cdot t^2 u^2 ] 6. **Analyze Parities Again:** Since ( t^2 ) is odd (because ( t ) is odd), the left side must again be odd: - ( t^2 ) is odd. - ( 2^{2(beta - alpha)} cdot u^2 ) is even. - ( 2^{2(gamma - alpha)} cdot v^2 ) is even. The left side, being a sum of an odd and two even numbers, renders it odd overall. However, we know that for the equation to be balanced, both sides should be even if ( x, y, ) and ( z ) are all odd, which contradicts our established condition of parity.

For each value of ( x ), ( y+z ) must sum up to ( n-x ). - Since both ( y ) and ( z ) are positive integers, ( y ) can range from 1 to ( n-x-1 ) because ( z = n-x-y ) must still be positive. - Hence, for each fixed ( x ), the number of possible values for ( y ) is ( n-x-1 ). The total number of distinct partitions can be calculated by summing these possibilities over all valid ( x ): [ sum_{x=1}^{n-2} (n-x-1) ] We know that this sequence is an arithmetic series where the first term is ( 1 ) and the last term is ( n-2-1 = n-3 ). Thus, the sum of this arithmetic series is given by: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-2} k = frac{(n-2)(n-1)}{2} ] Therefore, we have that the number of distinct ways is ( frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} ). 3. The second approach to the problem involves combinatorial selection: - We consider ( n ) as a sum of ( n ) ones: ( n = 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 ). - To create the sum ( x + y + z ), we need to place two addition signs (+) among these ( n ) ones, to create three groups. - The number of ways to place 2 plus signs among ( n-1 ) possible positions is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{n-1}{2} ] Using the formula for the binomial coefficient, we have: [ binom{n-1}{2} = frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} ] Hence, both approaches confirm that the number of distinct ways to partition the integer ( n ) into a sum of three positive integers is: [ boxed{frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}} ]"},{"instruction":"Which of the following operations is correct?

There are 5 attractions, so A can choose any one of the 5, and B must choose a different one, which gives us a total of 5 times 4 options for A and B to choose different attractions. Since there are 5 times 5 = 25 total ways for A and B to choose attractions (with no restrictions), the probability of event A is: P(A) = frac{{C}_{5}^{2}}{{C}_{5}^{1}{C}_{5}^{1}} = frac{5 times 4}{5 times 5} = frac{20}{25} = frac{4}{5} Next, we calculate the probability of both A and B choosing Chongyi Qiyunshan when they choose different attractions, which is event AB. Since they can't both choose Chongyi Qiyunshan and be considered as choosing different attractions, this situation is not directly feasible. Instead, we understand event AB as them having the option to choose amongst other attractions without limitations. The correct interpretation for P(AB) is the probability that one chooses Qiyunshan and the other chooses any of the remaining attractions. There are 2 ways to choose who goes to Qiyunshan and 4 choices for the second tourist, giving us 2 times 4 = 8 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, by using the properties of the GCD, specifically that the GCD of two numbers also divides their differences: [ gcd(a^m - 1, a^n - 1) = gcd(a^n(a^{m-n} - 1) + (a^n - 1), a^n - 1) ] 4. **Apply the GCD properties**: Since ( gcd(a, a^n - 1) = 1 ) (they are coprime), the equation simplifies: [ gcd(a^m - 1, a^n - 1) = gcd(a^{m-n} - 1, a^n - 1) ] 5. **Induction step**: Repeating this process, we reduce the original problem to the base case where ( n = d ). That is: [ gcd(a^{m-n} - 1, a^n - 1) = gcd(a^{m - kn} - 1, a^n - 1) ] for integers ( k ) such that ( m geq kn ). 6. **Final reduction**: Ultimately, this reduction continues until we achieve: [ gcd(a^d - 1, a^n - 1) ] which indeed equals ( a^d - 1 ) when ( d = gcd(m, n) ).

Give a procedure for determining the level of a rational number frac{p}{q} in this tree.","output":"1. **Initial Element Selection:** To ensure that the tree contains all rational numbers ( r ) with ( 0 < r < 1 ), we need to select an initial element such that every rational number in this interval can be generated by the given successor rules. The initial element should be (frac{1}{2}). This is because starting with (frac{1}{2}) and applying the successor rules (frac{a}{a+b}) and (frac{b}{a+b}) will generate all rational numbers in ((0, 1)). 2. **Generating the Tree:** Starting with (frac{1}{2}): - The successors of (frac{1}{2}) are (frac{1}{1+2} = frac{1}{3}) and (frac{2}{1+2} = frac{2}{3}). - The successors of (frac{1}{3}) are (frac{1}{1+3} = frac{1}{4}) and (frac{3}{1+3} = frac{3}{4}). - The successors of (frac{2}{3}) are (frac{2}{2+3} = frac{2}{5}) and (frac{3}{2+3} = frac{3}{5}). Continuing this process, we can generate all rational numbers in ((0, 1)). 3. **Determining the Level of a Rational Number (frac{p}{q}):** To determine the level of a rational number (frac{p}{q}) in the tree, we need to trace back to the initial element (frac{1}{2}) by finding its parent at each step. The parent of (frac{a}{b}) is (frac{min(a, b-a)}{max(a, b-a)}). - Write ( q = np + r ) with ( r in {0, 1, 2, ldots, p-1} ). - If ( r = 0 ) and since ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime, we have ( p = 1 ) and successive parents of (frac{1}{n}) are (frac{1}{n-1}, frac{1}{n-2}, ldots, frac{1}{2}). - If ( r neq 0 ), and so ( p neq 1 ), successive parents of (frac{p}{np+r}) are (frac{p}{(n-1)p+r}, frac{p}{(n-2)p+r}, ldots, frac{p}{p+r}, frac{r}{p}). 4. **Procedure to Find the Level:** - Build the strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers ( u_n ) as: ( u_1 = q ), ( u_2 = p < u_1 ), and ( u_{n+2} = u_{n+1} left{frac{u_n}{u_{n+1}}right} < u_{n+1} ). - Stop the process when ( u_n = 1 ) (which always appears just before 0). - Climbing the tree from (frac{u}{v} = frac{u_2}{u_1}), we reach in (leftlfloor frac{u_1}{u_2} rightrfloor) jumps the rational (frac{u_3}{u_2}). - When you reach (frac{u_n}{u_{n-1}} = frac{1}{u_{n-1}}), we already saw that we reach the top of the tree (frac{1}{2}) in ( u_{n-1} - 2 ) jumps. 5. **Conclusion:** - Any rational number in ((0, 1)) is indeed in the tree. - The level of (frac{p}{q}) in the tree is (left(sum_{i=2}^n leftlfloor frac{u_{i-1}}{u_i} rightrfloor right) - 1).

Let ( M ) and ( N ) be the points where the median intersects the incircle of the triangle, such that: [ BM = MN = NK = x ] 2. **Properties of the Tangent and Median:** Let ( T ) be the tangency point of the incircle with the side ( BC ). 3. **Identities in the Triangle:** From properties of the triangle, we have the following relations: [ a + c - b = 2BT ] and from Apollonius's theorem (or the median formula): [ 2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2 = 4BK^2 ] 4. **Amplifying Equations:** From these identities, and considering ( BK = 3x ), we substitute into the equations: [ 2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2 = 36x^2 ] 5. **Power of Point B with respect to the Incircle:** Utilizing the power of point ( B ) with respect to the incircle: [ BT^2 = BM cdot BN = x cdot 2x = 2x^2 ] Therefore: [ (a + c - b)^2 = 8x^2 ] 6. **Simplifying Relations:** Assume ( B ) and ( K ) are equally distanced from the center of the incircle. Hence, we approximate ( BC = KC ), which implies: [ b = 2a ] 7. **Substitute and Solve:** Substituting ( b = 2a ) in the previous equations: [ 2a^2 + 2c^2 - (2a)^2 = 36x^2 quad Rightarrow quad 2a^2 + 2c^2 - 4a^2 = 36x^2 quad Rightarrow quad c^2 - a^2 = 18x^2 ] Simplifying the relation: [ (c - a)^2 = 8x^2 ] 8. **Solve the Ratio:** Now, divide the equations: [ frac{c + a}{c - a} = frac{9}{4} ] From this, we solve: [ frac{c}{a} = frac{13}{5} ] Therefore, we get the necessary condition: [ frac{a}{5} = frac{b}{10} = frac{c}{13} ] 9. **Sufficiency Check:** By taking ( a = 5 ), ( b = 10 ), ( c = 13 ), and substituting these values back into the earlier formulas used in conditions (1) and (2), we can validate: [ BK = 6sqrt{2}, quad BT^2 = 16 = BM cdot BN ] And the inradius: [ r = frac{S}{p} = 6sqrt{14} ] 10. **Verification through Geometry:** The geometry confirms: [ B I^2 = 4^2 + r^2 = frac{2^2 times 47}{14} ] Thus confirming the median is divided into equal parts by the incircle. # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{a}{5} = frac{b}{10} = frac{c}{13}} ]"},{"instruction":"a company of 148 employees, 92 are females.

The elements 0 and 1 can be in M because 0^2=0 and 1^2=1, so including them again does not violate the condition. However, with elements 2, 3, 4, and 5, we should be more careful: - 2 cannot be with 4 (since 2^2 = 4), - 3 is fine as it doesn't have its square nor square root in the set, - 4 cannot be with 2, as already stated, and - 5 is fine for the same reason as 3. Since we can't have both 2 and 4 in the set, we can calculate the total number of sets without this restriction and subtract the sets where 2 and 4 both appear. Every element can either be included or not, so if we consider {2,3,4,5} without any restriction, there would be 2^4=16 subsets, including the empty set. However, since the set M must be non-empty, we subtract one for the empty set, leaving us with 16 - 1 = 15 potential subsets. Next, we count the number of subsets where both 2 and 4 are included.

A number is divisible by 12 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 4. 1. **Divisibility by 4**: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. Therefore, we start by examining the last two digits ( 6b ): - For ( 60 ): [ 2 + 0 + 1 + 6 + 0 + b = 9 + b ] Since 9 is already a multiple of 3, ( b ) must be ( 0, 3, 6, ) or ( 9 ) to ensure the entire sum ( 9 + b ) is divisible by 3.

The area of the semi-circle is half the area of a full circle with a diameter of 4 meters. The radius of the full circle is half the diameter, so the radius is 4 meters / 2 = 2 meters.

Part 2: ① To generalize the pattern into the nth equation, we note that each equation sums consecutive even numbers starting from 2 up to 2n, and this sum is equal to n^2 + n. Thus, the nth equation can be expressed as: 2 + 4 + 6 + ldots + 2n-2 + 2n = n^2 + n Therefore, the nth equation is: boxed{2+4+6+ldots+2n-2+2n=n^2+n}. ② To calculate 102 + 104 + 106 + ldots + 198 + 200, we recognize this as a sum of consecutive even numbers from 102 to 200. We can rewrite this sum by subtracting the sum of consecutive even numbers from 2 to 100 from the sum of consecutive even numbers from 2 to 200: 102 + 104 + 106 + ldots + 198 + 200 = (2 + 4 + 6 + ldots + 198 + 200) - (2 + 4 + 6 + ldots + 100) Using the pattern 2 + 4 + 6 + ldots + 2n = n^2 + n, we find: = 100^2 + 100 - (50^2 + 50) Calculating each part: = 10000 + 100 - 2500 - 50 = 7550 Therefore, the sum 102 + 104 + 106 + ldots + 198 + 200 is: boxed{7550}."},{"instruction":"Let ( a, b, c ) be real numbers.

Notice that if ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) are solutions, then the cyclic permutation ( x_n, x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{n-1} ) must also be a solution due to the symmetry of the equations. 2. **Given the system has a unique solution, derive properties:** Since the solution is unique, this implies that ( x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_n = x ). This makes each equation of the system reduce to: a x^{2} + b x + c = x 3. **Solving the simplified equation:** Rearrange the equation: a x^{2} + b x + c = x implies a x^{2} + (b - 1) x + c = 0 For this quadratic equation to have a unique solution ( x ), its discriminant must be zero. The discriminant ( Delta ) of the quadratic equation ( a x^{2} + (b - 1) x + c = 0 ) is given by: Delta = (b - 1)^{2} - 4ac Therefore, for the equation to have a unique solution, we must have: (b - 1)^{2} - 4ac = 0 4. **Assume ( (b-1)^{2}-4ac=0 ) and show it implies the system has a unique solution:** Now assume ( (b - 1)^{2} - 4ac = 0 ). 5. **Combining the equations:** Sum all the equations of the system: sum_{i=1}^{n} (a x_{i}^{2} + b x_{i} + c) = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} implies a sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^2 + b sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + nc = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} 6. **Relabel the function:** Notice that the function ( f(x) = a x^{2} + (b-1) x + c ) must sum to zero over all terms: sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) = a sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^2 + (b-1) sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + nc = 0 7. **Using the condition on the discriminant:** With the discriminant condition ( (b-1)^{2} - 4ac = 0 ): f(x) = a left(x + frac{b-1}{2a}right)^2 Hence for each ( i ), we have: f(x_i) = a left(x_i + frac{b-1}{2a}right)^2 = 0 8. **Solving for the unique solution ( x ):** This implies: x_i + frac{b-1}{2a} = 0 implies x_i = -frac{b-1}{2a} Therefore, all ( x_i ) are equal, and the system has a unique solution: x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_n = -frac{b-1}{2a} Thus, we have shown that ( (b-1)^{2} - 4ac = 0 ) implies the system has a unique real solution, completing the proof. # Conclusion: [ boxed{(b-1)^{2} - 4ac = 0} ]"},{"instruction":"The distance from the center of the circle (rho=4cos theta) to the line (tan (theta+ frac {pi}{2})=1) is ______.","output":"Solution: The equation of the circle (rho=4cos theta) can be written as (rho^{2}=4rhocos theta), which, in Cartesian coordinates, becomes: (x^{2}+y^{2}-4x=0), The center of the circle is at (C(2,0)), The line (tan (theta+ frac {pi}{2})=1) can be rewritten as (cot theta=1), which means ( frac {rhocos theta}{rho sin theta }=1), In Cartesian coordinates, this becomes: (x-y=0), (therefore) The distance (d) from the center (C(2,0)) to the line is (d= frac {|2-0|}{ sqrt {2}}= sqrt {2}).

Both subsets ( A ) and ( G ) contain at least three elements. 2. The elements of subset ( A ) can be arranged in an arithmetic progression. 3. The elements of subset ( G ) can be arranged in a geometric progression. Let's analyze this in a detailed step-by-step manner. 1. Let ( D_n ) be the set of all positive divisors of ( n ), and let: [ begin{aligned} A &= {a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_k}, G &= {g_1 < g_2 < cdots < g_l}, end{aligned} ] where ( k, l geq 3 ) and ( k + l = |D_n| = tau(n) ), with ( tau(n) ) representing the number of positive divisors of ( n ). 2. Without loss of generality, we assume ( g_l = n ). 3. If ( a_k = n ), since ( a_{k-1} leq frac{n}{2} ), we then have: [ a_{k-2} = 2a_{k-1} - a_k leq 2left(frac{n}{2}right) - n = 0, ] which is a contradiction as ( a_{k-2} ) must be a positive divisor of ( n ). 4. Now assume that ( a_k neq n ). Thus, ( n ) must be in ( G ) and the common ratio ( lambda ) for the geometric progression ( G ) is given by ( lambda = frac{g_l}{g_{l-1}} = frac{n}{g_{l-1}} ), which must be an integer. 5. Furthermore, ( n ) must contain at least two distinct prime factors. Suppose ( n ) is a power of a prime, say ( n = p^alpha ). Then, ( D_n = {1, p, p^2, dots, p^alpha} ). 6. For any ( 0 le u < v < w le alpha ), [ begin{aligned} p^v - p^u &= p^u(p^{v-u} - 1), p^w - p^v &= p^v(p^{w-v} - 1). end{aligned} ] Since ( p^{v-u} - 1 neq p^{w-v} - 1 ), the sequence ( {p^u, p^v, p^w} ) cannot form an arithmetic progression. Hence, ( D_n ) cannot have three numbers that form an arithmetic progression. 7. Let ( p ) be a prime factor common to ( lambda ). Then, let ( n = p^alpha m ) where ( p nmid m ). 8. Since ( G ) contains numbers forming a geometric progression with common ratio involving ( p ), and: [ v_p(g_1) < v_p(g_2) < cdots < v_p(g_l), ] we get ( l le alpha + 1 ) and ( alpha ge 2 ). 9. Given that ( n ) has at least two distinct prime factors, ( m > 1 ). Let ( q ) be a prime factor of ( m ) with ( q neq p ). 10. If ( {1, q} subset A ), it contradicts the assumption that ( A ) forms an arithmetic progression. Therefore ( 1 ) or ( q ) must belong to ( G ). 11. Assume ( 1, p, p^2, dots, p^alpha ) are exclusive divisors and belong to ( A ). Since ( q mid n ), either ( q in A ) or ( q in G ). 12. If ( q in G ) then all multiples of ( q ) must also be in ( G ). 13.

For ( tau(m) = 2 ) we need to verify when ( m = q, n = p^alpha q ). Here, ensure if ( |A| ge 2alpha ) leads to a contradiction of ( |G| le 2 ).

Given frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1} gt 0 for all x_1, x_2 in [0,2] and x_1 neq x_2, it implies that f(x) is monotonically increasing on [0,2]. Step 2: Examine the first part of the function.

Place the points D, E, F on the extensions of the sides of the triangle beyond the vertices but external to the triangle: - Place point D on the extension of the side AB beyond point B. This can be done by placing D somewhere on the line x > 1, e.g., D = (2, 0). - Place point E on the extension of the side BC beyond point C. Similarly, place E on the line x+y = 1 but where y < 0, e.g., E = (-1, 2) by continuing from C. - Place point F on the extension of the side CA beyond point A. Finally, place F on the line y < 0, e.g., F = (0, -1). 6.

Since 1 and n always divide n, we have that g(n) ge 1^2 + n^2 = n^2+1, so g(g(n)) ge n^2+2. Therefore, in order for n to be hyperdeficient, g(n) = n^2+1 and g(n^2+1) = n^2+2. If g(k) = k^2 + 1, then k must be such that the sum of the squares of its divisors is exactly one more than its square, which implies k has exactly one divisor other than itself and 1, hence k must be a prime squared. Given this, we search for k = p^2 such that p is prime, and p^2+1 has divisors whose squares sum to p^4 + 2. The only prime squares near this form are p=2, as g(4) = 1^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 = 21 and g(21) needs to be 18.

The numbers in the first row are 1, in the second row there are 3 numbers, in the third row there are 5 numbers, and so on, increasing by 2 for each subsequent row. This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 1 and the common difference d = 2. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula S_n = frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d]. Since each row starts with the next integer following the last number of the previous row, the first number of the n-th row is S_{n-1} + 1. To find the row where 2010 is located, we need to solve for n in the inequality S_{n-1} < 2010 leq S_n. Substituting the values of a_1 and d into the formula for S_n, we get S_n = frac{n}{2} [2 + (n-1)2] = n^2. Therefore, we need to find an n such that n^2 geq 2010 but (n-1)^2 < 2010. Solving these inequalities gives us n = 45. Thus, 2010 is in the 45th row. Next, to find the column where 2010 is located, we note that the first number in the 45th row is S_{44} + 1 = 44^2 + 1 = 1937. Since the numbers in each row increase by 1 from left to right, the column number for 2010 can be found by subtracting 1936 from 2010, which gives us 74.

Consider the Point and its Image under Rotation: Let ( A ) be a point on the line ( a ) such that ( (O A) perp a ). When we perform the rotation around the axis ( l ), the point ( A ) will map to ( A' ) in the plane ( alpha ), maintaining the perpendicularity to ( l ). 3.

Upon rotation, the point ( M ) maps to ( M' ), and ( M' ) lies on the image line ( a' ), which is also perpendicular to ( l ). 4. Relationships of Rotated Points: - Since ( |OM'| = |OM| ) due to the properties of the rotation preserving distances. - The rotation angle ( varphi ) between ( OA ) and ( OA' ) means that ( angle MOA = angle A'OM' = varphi ). 5.

The housewife was able to obtain 3 kgs more for Rs. 500 after a 15% reduction in price. This means that the reduced price is 85% of the original price (100% - 15% = 85%).

(4) Based on the practical meaning of the problem, on average, one person infects ⑤______ people.","output":"To solve the problem step-by-step while adhering to the specified format: (1) **Expression for the number of people infected after each round:** - After the first round, one person has infected x others, so the total number of people who have contracted the flu is the initial person plus those they infected, which gives us 1 + x. - In the second round, each of these 1 + x people infects x more people. Therefore, the total number of people infected after the second round is 1 + x + x(1 + x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x = 1 + 2x + x^2.

Since we are choosing n+1 numbers from the set {1, 2, ldots, 2n}, consider the n pairs of consecutive integers: [ (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), ldots, (2n-1, 2n) ] There are exactly n pairs, each containing two consecutive integers. According to the pigeonhole principle, if n+1 numbers are chosen from 2n possible consecutive numbers, at least one of these pairs must contain both numbers. Now, by the property of consecutive integers, any two consecutive integers are coprime. Let ( a ) and ( a+1 ) be two numbers from a chosen pair. Assume without loss of generality that ( a = 2m+1 ) and ( a+1 = 2m+2 ). To prove that ( a ) and ( a+1 ) are coprime, we consider their greatest common divisor (GCD): [ text{gcd}(a, a+1) = text{gcd}(a, a+1 - a) = text{gcd}(a, 1) = 1 ] Thus, we have shown that there exist at least two numbers among our chosen n+1 numbers that are coprime. 2. **Finding Two Numbers such that One Divides the Other:** Next, we demonstrate that among the n+1 chosen numbers, we can find two such that one divides the other.

Let's consider two such numbers: [ a = 2^{k_1}(2s+1), quad b = 2^{k_2}(2s+1) ] Without loss of generality, assume ( k_1 leq k_2 ). Clearly, [ b = 2^{k_2 - k_1} a ] implying ( a ) divides ( b ).

When the train crosses a signal pole, it only needs to cover its own length. The time it takes to pass the pole is 18 seconds, so we can write the following equation: [ L = V times 18 ] When the train crosses the platform, it needs to cover the length of itself plus the length of the platform. The time it takes to pass the platform is 42 seconds, so we can write the following equation: [ L + 400 = V times 42 ] Now we have two equations: 1. ( L = V times 18 ) 2. ( L + 400 = V times 42 ) We can solve for ( V ) using the first equation: [ V = frac{L}{18} ] Now we can substitute ( V ) in the second equation: [ L + 400 = left(frac{L}{18}right) times 42 ] Now we solve for ( L ): [ L + 400 = frac{42L}{18} ] [ L + 400 = frac{7L}{3} ] [ 3L + 1200 = 7L ] [ 1200 = 7L - 3L ] [ 1200 = 4L ] [ L = frac{1200}{4} ] [ L = 300 ] So the length of the train is boxed{300} meters."},{"instruction":"Oliver is working out in a gym.

D: Choose a random sampling survey to understand the air quality in Fuzhou in a certain year.","output":"To analyze which survey method is reasonable among the given options, let's examine each option step by step: - **Option A**: The task is to understand the lifespan of a batch of light bulbs. For such a purpose, a random sampling survey would be more practical and efficient than a comprehensive survey. This is because testing every single light bulb in the batch would be time-consuming and unnecessary when a representative sample could provide a good estimate of the average lifespan. Therefore, Option A is not the most reasonable choice. - **Option B**: The goal is to determine if a batch of bagged food contains preservatives. This situation calls for a random sampling survey rather than a comprehensive one. Testing a few samples from the batch can efficiently reveal whether preservatives are present, eliminating the need to examine every single bag. Thus, Option B is not the most reasonable choice. - **Option C**: The objective is to understand the quality of the equipment parts of \\"Tianwen-1\\". Given the critical importance and specificity of space equipment, a comprehensive survey is necessary to ensure every part meets the stringent quality standards. A random sampling method might miss defects in parts not sampled. Therefore, Option C, suggesting a random sampling survey, is not appropriate for this high-stakes context. - **Option D**: The aim is to understand the air quality in Fuzhou in a certain year. A random sampling survey, where air quality measurements are taken at various locations and times throughout the year, would be suitable for this purpose. It would provide a representative overview of the air quality without the need for continuous, comprehensive monitoring at every possible location and time. Hence, Option D is the most reasonable choice for this task.

The biker covered half the distance between the two towns in 2 hours and 30 minutes, which is 2.5 hours. Since the total distance is 140 km, half the distance is ( frac{140}{2} = 70 ) km. Using the formula ( text{distance} = text{speed} times text{time} ), we can write the equation for the first half of the journey as: [ 70 = v times 2.5 ] After that, the biker increased his speed by 2 km/hr, so his new speed is ( v + 2 ) km/hr. He covered the second half of the distance in 2 hours and 20 minutes, which is 2.33 hours (since 20 minutes is (frac{20}{60} = frac{1}{3}) of an hour). The equation for the second half of the journey is: [ 70 = (v + 2) times 2.33 ] Now we have two equations: 1. ( 70 = 2.5v ) 2. ( 70 = (v + 2) times 2.33 ) Let's solve the first equation for ( v ): [ v = frac{70}{2.5} ] [ v = 28 text{ km/hr} ] Now we know the initial speed of the biker was 28 km/hr. We can check this against the second equation to ensure it's consistent: [ 70 = (28 + 2) times 2.33 ] [ 70 = 30 times 2.33 ] [ 70 = 69.9 ] The slight discrepancy is due to rounding the time of 2 hours and 20 minutes to 2.33 hours. If we use the exact fraction, the calculation would be: [ 70 = (28 + 2) times frac{7}{3} ] [ 70 = 30 times frac{7}{3} ] [ 70 = 70 ] This confirms that the initial speed of the biker was indeed boxed{28} km/hr."},{"instruction":"Simplify the expression: frac{x^2 4x + 3}{x^2 6x + 9} div frac{x^2 6x + 8}{x^2 8x + 15} A) frac{(x1)(x5)}{(x3)(x4)(x2)} B) frac{(x2)(x5)}{(x3)(x4)(x1)} C) frac{x1}{x3} D) 1","output":"1. **Factorize each quadratic expression**: - Numerator of the first fraction: x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x-3)(x-1). - Denominator of the first fraction: x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x-3)^2. - Numerator of the second fraction: x^2 - 6x + 8 = (x-4)(x-2). - Denominator of the second fraction: x^2 - 8x + 15 = (x-5)(x-3). 2. **Rewrite the expression using these factors**: [ frac{(x-3)(x-1)}{(x-3)^2} div frac{(x-4)(x-2)}{(x-5)(x-3)} ] 3. **Simplify the expression** by canceling out common factors: - Cancel (x-3) in the numerator of the first fraction and one (x-3) in its denominator. - Cancel (x-3) in the numerator of the second fraction and the denominator.

Since one fourth of the solution was replaced, the amount of the original solution that was removed is W/4. The weight of sugar in the original solution before any was removed is 8% of W, which is 0.08W. When W/4 of the original solution is removed, the weight of sugar removed is 8% of W/4, which is 0.08(W/4) = 0.02W. The weight of sugar remaining in the container after removing W/4 of the original solution is 0.08W - 0.02W = 0.06W. Now, let's denote the concentration of sugar in the second solution as X percent. When W/4 of the second solution is added, the weight of sugar added is X% of W/4, which is (X/100)(W/4) = XW/400. The total weight of sugar in the final solution is the sum of the sugar remaining from the original solution and the sugar from the second solution, which is 0.06W + XW/400. The final solution is still W in weight because we removed W/4 and added W/4 of the second solution. The final concentration of sugar in the solution is 16%, so the weight of sugar in the final solution is 16% of W, which is 0.16W. Setting the total weight of sugar in the final solution equal to the sum of the sugar from the original and second solutions, we get: 0.16W = 0.06W + XW/400 To solve for X, we first multiply through by 400 to clear the fraction: 400 * 0.16W = 400 * 0.06W + XW 64W = 24W + XW Subtract 24W from both sides: 64W - 24W = XW 40W = XW Divide both sides by W: 40 = X Therefore, the second solution was boxed{40} percent sugar by weight."},{"instruction":"Let ABC be a triangle.

Let's start by calculating the cost per pound for the 5-pound and 10-pound bags: - 5-pound bag at 13.80: 13.80 / 5 pounds = 2.76 per pound - 10-pound bag at 20.43: 20.43 / 10 pounds = 2.043 per pound Since the 10-pound bag has a lower cost per pound, it's more cost-effective to buy as many 10-pound bags as possible. Let's see how many 10-pound bags we can buy to get close to 65 pounds without exceeding 80 pounds: - To reach at least 65 pounds, we need at least 7 bags of 10 pounds (7 x 10 = 70 pounds), which would cost 7 x 20.43 = 142.01, which is already more than 98.73, so we need to include at least one 25-pound bag. - To not exceed 80 pounds, we can have at most 8 bags of 10 pounds (8 x 10 = 80 pounds), but this would cost 8 x 20.43 = 163.44, which is again more than 98.73. Since we can't use only 10-pound bags, let's try to use one 25-pound bag and fill the rest with 10-pound bags: - 1 x 25-pound bag + 4 x 10-pound bags = 65 pounds - 1 x 25-pound bag + 5 x 10-pound bags = 75 pounds Both combinations are within the 65 to 80-pound range.

Our goal is to determine if Petya can always manipulate the polynomial to get two roots differing by 2014, regardless of Vasya's actions. 3. **Petya's First Move:** - Petya can choose to replace the free term (the constant term) with 0. This simplifies our equation to ( x^3 + ax^2 + bx = 0 ). The equation now must have a root at ( x = 0 ). 4. Now, Petya's new task is to ensure another root ( t ), such that ( t = 2014 ). This guarantees the difference 2014 since one root is zero and another is 2014. 5. **After Vasya’s Move:** - There are a few scenarios: Vasya could replace either ( ax^2 + *x = 0 ) or ( *x^2 + bx = 0 ). 6. **First Case: ( x^3 + ax^2 + *x = 0 )** - Here, Petya can choose to replace ( * ) with (-t(t+a)). - Thus, the polynomial becomes: [ x^3 + ax^2 - t(t+a)x = 0 ] Substituting ( t = 2014 ), the equation becomes: [ x^3 + ax^2 - 2014(2014 + a)x = 0 ] This gives roots at ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 2014 ). 7. **Second Case: ( x^3 + *x^2 + bx = 0 )** - In this case, Petya can choose to replace ( * ) with (frac{-(t^2 + b)}{t}). - Thus, the polynomial becomes: [ x^3 + frac{-(t^2 + b)}{t}x^2 + bx = 0 ] Substituting ( t = 2014 ): [ x^3 + frac{-(2014^2 + b)}{2014}x^2 + bx = 0 ] This also ensures ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 2014 ). 8.

Let's use the power of a point theorem to derive the condition for ( P ): [ begin{aligned} left|O_{1}P right|^{2}- left| O_{2} P right|^2 &= left( left| O_{1} K right|^{2}- left| K P right|^{2} right) - left( left| O_{2} L right|^{2}- left| L P right|^{2} right) &= R_1^2 - K P^2 - (R_2^2 - L P^2) &= R_1^2 - R_2^2 end{aligned} ] Where ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ) are the radii of the circles. This implies that point ( P ) lies on the radical axis of the two circles, excluding the midpoint and endpoints of the common chord, since these corresponding points would degenerate the rectangle. **Case b)** Consider now the rectangle ( K L M N ) such that two adjacent vertices ( K ) and ( L ) lie on one circle, and the other two vertices ( M ) and ( N ) lie on the other circle. Since the perpendiculars dropped from ( O_1 ) to ( KN ) and from ( O_2 ) to ( LM ) must bisect them, the line ( O_1 O_2 ) is the axis of symmetry of the rectangle ( K L M N ). Now assume ( R_2 < R_1 ) and let the radius ( O_2 L ) form an angle ( varphi ) with the line joining the centers. Drawing a line through ( L ) parallel to ( O_1 O_2 ), this line intersects the circle centered at ( O_1 ) at points ( K_1 ) and ( K_2 ). Thus, for point ( L ), there correspond two rectangles: ( K_1 L M N_1 ) and ( K_2 L M N_2 ). As ( varphi ) varies from ( 0 ) to ( pi / 2 ), the angle ( psi ) formed by the radius ( O_1 K_1 ) with ( O_1 O_2 ) varies from ( 0 ) to some value ( psi_0 ) and then decreases back to ( 0 ). The centers of rectangles ( K_1 L M N_1 ) will trace a segment from the midpoint of ( CD ) to the midpoint of ( BC ), excluding the end points and the intersection with the common chord. Similarly, centers of rectangles ( K_2 L M N_2 ) will fill the interval between the midpoints of ( AB ) and ( AD ), excluding the interval's endpoints. If all four vertices of the rectangle lie on one circle, then the center of the rectangle coincides with the center of that circle. In conclusion, the desired set of centers of rectangles is the union of three intervals: from the midpoint of ( AB ) to the midpoint of ( AD ), from the midpoint of ( BC ) to the midpoint of ( CD ), excluding the intersection of these intervals and also the midpoint of the common chord. The final result is given by the combination of these intervals. (boxed{text{The solution is the union of the intervals as described.}})"},{"instruction":"Let z_1 = 2 + bi and z_2 = a + i.

Substituting M into (1), we get: -frac{sqrt{3}}{6}p^2 - frac{p}{3} + p = 0. Solving for p, we get p = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}. Therefore, the answer is boxed{P = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}}.

Let ( t ) be the total time taken for Jia and Ding to meet at point ( D ), which is the midpoint of ( AB ). 2. **Analyze Jia's Movement:** - Jia first proceeds from ( A ) to ( B ) and then turns back towards ( A ). - When returning from ( B ), Jia's speed is reduced to half of the original speed. - Jia meets Yi at the point ( C ) and then continues to meet Ding at the midpoint ( D ). 3. **Analyze Yi's Movement:** - Yi meets Jia and Ding. At the point of their first meeting, Yi has already traveled 2010 meters. - This travel distance represents part of Yi's journey towards point ( C ) where he meets Jia. 4. **Apply Theorem on Distance and Speed Ratios:** - Since Jia's return speed is half of the original speed, if ( V_{text{Jia}} ) is the original speed, the speed upon returning is ( frac{1}{2} V_{text{Jia}} ). - The total distance traveled by Jia when meeting Ding is ( frac{3}{2} ) times the total distance ( S ). - The time ( t ) for both Jia and Ding to meet can be expressed in terms of distances traveled. 5. **Express the Equations with Ratios:** - Time required for Jia to travel can be expressed as: [ frac{1}{2} t V_{text{Jia}} + frac{1}{2} t cdot left(frac{1}{2}V_{text{Jia}}right) = frac{3}{4}V_{text{Jia}} t ] - Similarly, Yi's total travel equation can be expressed as: [ S_{text{Yi}} = frac{1}{2} S = V_{text{Yi}} t ] - Equating the ratios of distances and speeds: [ frac{3}{2} S: frac{1}{2} S = frac{3}{4} V_{text{Jia}} : V_{text{Yi}} implies V_{text{Jia}} : V_{text{Yi}} = 4 : 1 ] 6. **Calculate the Distance Traveled by Yi:** - Yi travels 2010 meters, we need to calculate how far Yi would travel if he continued along the path (AC) when (C) and (B) are considered.

Thus, this homothety maps each vertex of the triangle to the corresponding point on the nine-point circle. - If the circumcenter ( O ) is the center of the circumcircle, then under this homothety, the nine-point circle's center ( N ) lies on the Euler line and is the midpoint of the segment joining ( O ) to the orthocenter ( H ). 4. **Euler Line:** - The Euler line of triangle ( ABC ) is the line that passes through several important points: the orthocenter ( H ), the centroid ( G ), and the circumcenter ( O ). - The nine-point circle's center ( N ) is also on the Euler line since it is the midpoint of ( OH ). 5. **Conclusion:** Given the properties and relationships described, since the Euler line passes through both ( O ) (circumcenter) and ( G ) (centroid), and since the center of the nine-point circle ( N ) is the midpoint of segment ( OH ), we can conclusively state that the Euler line also passes through ( N ).

On this interval, g(x) is increasing. 6. **Find the Range of g(x) on [0,1)**: Calculate g(0) = frac{6}{9} = frac{2}{3} and g(1) = frac{6}{8} = frac{3}{4}. Thus, frac{2}{3} leq g(x) < frac{3}{4} for x in [0,1). 7. **Translate the Range of g(x) to the Range of m**: Since 2m = g(x), dividing the inequality by 2 gives frac{1}{3} leq m < frac{3}{8}.

Next, we determine the different possible heights by using combinations of 9'' and 17'' increments, ensuring that every increment is used at least once. To find out how many different sums can be achieved using 9'' and 17'', we observe that these numbers are co-prime. By the Frobenius Coin Problem (or Chicken McNugget Theorem for two numbers), the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of 9'' and 17'' increments is: [9 times 17 - 9 - 17 = 119] Since we must use at least one of each increment, the smallest height possible using both is 300'' + 9 + 17 = 326''. From there, we can reach every height up to the maximum possible: [98 times 3 + 1 times 12 + 1 times 20 = 306 + 12 + 20 = 338''] [100 times 20 = 2000''] Thus, we have heights ranging from 326'' to 2000'' in increments of 9'' and 17''. Counting these, we calculate: [(2000 - 326) / 9 + 1 = 1674 / 9 + 1 = 187] However, we validate 326'' to 2000'' is achievable by checking: [326, 335, 344, ..., 2000] are all divisible by 9 or 17, which they are due to their construction from 326'' onwards.

Since 1^2 + (1-1)^2 = 1 < 5, point P lies inside circle C: x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 5. Therefore, line L must intersect circle C at two distinct points. (2) The radius of the circle is r = sqrt{5}. The distance from the center of the circle to the chord (segment AB) can be found using the formula: d = sqrt{r^2 - left(frac{AB}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{5 - left(frac{sqrt{17}}{2}right)^2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. By the point-line distance formula, we have d = frac{|0-1+1-m|}{sqrt{m^2+1}}. Therefore frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{|m-1|}{sqrt{m^2+1}}. Solving for m gives m = pm sqrt{3}.

[ boxed{text{The possible slope angles are } frac{pi}{3} text{ or } frac{2pi}{3}.} ] (3) Let's denote the coordinates of point A as (x_1, mx_1 - m + 1) and point B as (x_2, mx_2 - m + 1). Since 2overrightarrow{AP} = overrightarrow{PB}, we get 2(1 - x_1, -mx_1 + m) = (x_2 - 1, mx_2 - m). This yields 2 - 2x_1 = x_2 - 1, which simplifies to 2x_1 + x_2 = 3. (Equation ①) Substituting the line equation y - 1 = m(x - 1) into the circle's equation x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 5 and simplifying results in (1 + m^2)x^2 - 2m^2x + m^2 - 5 = 0. From the properties of quadratic equations, we have x_1 + x_2 = frac{2m^2}{1 + m^2}. (Equation ②) Solving Equations ① and ②, we find x_1 = frac{3 + m^2}{1 + m^2}. Hence, the coordinates of point A are left(frac{3 + m^2}{1 + m^2}, frac{1 + 2m + m^2}{1 + m^2}right). Substituting the coordinates of point A into the circle's equation yields m^2 = 1, thus m = pm 1.

This essentially forms permutations or loops of transitions. 2. **Classify the loops:** - The problem involves breaking down the permutation into cycles or loops. Each loop signifies families cyclically switching houses among themselves. 3. **Consider cycles of even length:** - When the length of the cycle (number of families) is even, we can alternate colors along the cycle. - For example, in a cycle with 4 families ( A, B, C, D ): - Old house sequence: ( A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow D rightarrow A ) - Coloring sequence: Blue, Green, Blue, Green - Resulting transition: - Family ( A ): Blue to Green - Family ( B ): Green to Blue - Family ( C ): Blue to Green - Family ( D ): Green to Blue - In this way, no family moves into a house of the same color. 4. **Consider cycles of odd length:** - For cycles with an odd number of families, we must use a third color to avoid coloring conflicts. - For instance, in a cycle with 3 families ( A, B, C ): - Old house sequence: ( A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow A ) - Coloring sequence: Blue, Green, Red - Resulting transition: - Family ( A ): Blue to Green - Family ( B ): Green to Red - Family ( C ): Red to Blue - This technique ensures that no family moves into a house of the same color as their old house. 5. **Generalize the solution:** - Each cycle, regardless of being even or odd, can be colored following the above strategies. - Even cycles use two colors alternately. - Odd cycles use three colors with one color introduced at the start and then alternated between the other two. - Applying these coloring strategies guarantees that each family will not end up in a house having the same color as the previous one. # Conclusion: By classifying the families' house transitions into cycles and applying the appropriate coloring strategies for even and odd cycles, we can ensure that each family moves into a house of a different color than their old one.

Therefore, we get the equation (sqrt{x^2 + 2bx + b} + sqrt{x^2 2bx + b} = 2sqrt{b}). Squaring both sides, we get: (sqrt{(x^2 + b)^2 4b^2x^2} = b x^2). Squaring again, we get: (x^4 + b^2 + 2x^2b 4b^2x^2 = b^2 2bx^2 + x^4 Rightarrow b(b 1)x^2 = 0). If (b neq 0), (b neq 1), then (x = 0) is the only solution. If (b = 0), then (x = 0), meaning (x = 0) is the only solution. Finally, substituting (b = 1), we have: (sqrt{x^2 + 2x + 1} + sqrt{x^2 2x + 1} = 2 Rightarrow |x + 1| + |x 1| = 2). The solution to this equation is the interval (x in [1, 1]), so in this case, uniqueness does not hold.","output":"Step 1: Symmetry and Modulus Properties Given the problem, we note that by the properties of the modulus function, |x|=|-x|, replacing x with -x does not change the inequality provided in the problem. Thus, the region described by the inequality is symmetric relative to the y-axis. It suffices to find the area of the figure for x geq 0 and then double it. Step 2: Rewriting the Inequality for x geq 0 Focus on the inequality in the region where x geq 0. The inequality is: [ left| x - frac{y^2}{2} right| + x + frac{y^2}{2} leq 2 - y ] Step 3: Removing the Modulus We analyze the inequality by removing the modulus, producing two subcases depending on the value of the expression inside the modulus. **Case I**: x geq frac{y^2}{2} For this case, left| x - frac{y^2}{2} right| = x - frac{y^2}{2}.

The intersection points and boundaries align to form two symmetric trapezoidal regions about the y-axis. Identify trapezoidal region for x geq 0 and perform area calculation.

For P(B|A_{1}), if a red ball is taken from can A and placed into can B, can B will then have 4 + 1 = 5 red balls, 3 white balls, and 3 black balls, making a total of 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 balls. Thus, P(B|A_{1}) = frac{5}{11}. 2. For P(B|A_{2}) and P(B|A_{3}), if a white or black ball is taken from can A and placed into can B, can B will have 4 red balls out of a total of 11 balls (since adding a white or black ball doesn't change the number of red balls). Therefore, P(B|A_{2}) = P(B|A_{3}) = frac{4}{11}. Now, we calculate the overall probability of taking a red ball from can B, P(B), using the law of total probability: [P(B) = P(A_{1})P(B|A_{1}) + P(A_{2})P(B|A_{2}) + P(A_{3})P(B|A_{3})] [= frac{1}{2} times frac{5}{11} + frac{1}{5} times frac{4}{11} + frac{3}{10} times frac{4}{11} = frac{9}{22}] Therefore, option A is incorrect since P(B) neq frac{2}{5}. Since P(B|A_{1}) = frac{5}{11}, option B is correct. To check if event B is independent of event A_{1}, we compare P(B|A_{1}) with P(B). Since P(B|A_{1}) neq P(B), event B is not independent of event A_{1}, making option C incorrect. Finally, by definition, events A_{1}, A_{2}, and A_{3} are pairwise mutually exclusive since a ball cannot be red, white, and black at the same time. Therefore, option D is correct. Thus, the correct choices are boxed{BD}."},{"instruction":"f 5 / w plus some fraction = 5 / y and wx = y, then the average (arithmetic mean) of w and x is 0.5.

So: ( w = 0.5 ) ( x = 0.5 ) Now we can find y: ( y = w times x = 0.5 times 0.5 = 0.25 ) Now we can solve for F using the first equation: ( frac{5}{w} + F = frac{5}{y} ) Substitute w = 0.5 and y = 0.25: ( frac{5}{0.5} + F = frac{5}{0.25} ) ( 10 + F = 20 ) Now, solve for F: ( F = 20 - 10 ) ( F = 10 ) So the unknown fraction is boxed{10} ."},{"instruction":"A cube with side length 8 is suspended above a plane.

(i) The derivative of F(x) is F'(x)=e^{x}+(x-a-1)e^{x}-(a+1)x+a(a+1) = (x-a)left[e^{x}-(a+1)right]. If a+1 leq 0, i.e., a leq -1, then setting F'(x)=0 gives x=a. For x in (-infty, a), F'(x) < 0; for x in (a, +infty), F'(x) > 0. Therefore, F(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-infty, a) and monotonically increasing on (a, +infty).

Then h'(a)= frac{3}{2}a^{2}+a-e^{a}. Define varphi(a)=h'(a)= frac{3}{2}a^{2}+a-e^{a}. Since varphi'(a)=3a+1-e^{a} < 0 for -1 < a < -frac{3}{4}, h'(a)= frac{3}{2}a^{2}+a-e^{a} is monotonically decreasing. Evaluating at the endpoints, h'(-1)= frac{1}{2}-frac{1}{e} > 0 and h'(-frac{3}{4})= frac{3}{32}-e^{-frac{3}{4}} < 0. Thus, there exists a unique a_0 in (-1, -frac{3}{4}) such that h'(a_{0})=0. Therefore, h(a) is monotonically increasing on (-1, a_0) and monotonically decreasing on (a_0, -frac{3}{4}).

Claim: If a set S with k(n+1)-1 elements has its n-element subsets partitioned into two classes, then there must be k disjoint subsets in one of the classes. Proof: We proceed by induction on k. **Base Case (k=1):** When k=1, we have n elements in S. Any n-element subset of S is just S itself, and it belongs to one of the classes. Thus, there is one subset in one class, satisfying the claim. **Inductive Step:** Assume the claim holds for k-1. We need to show it holds for k. Consider a set S with k(n+1)-1 elements. We analyze two cases: **Case 1: Existence of an (n+1)-element subset X with n-element subsets in different classes.** - Remove X from S, leaving (k-1)(n+1)-1 elements. - By the induction hypothesis, there are k-1 disjoint n-element subsets in one class among these elements. - Since X has n-element subsets in both classes, at least one of these subsets can be paired with the k-1 disjoint subsets to form k disjoint subsets in the same class. **Case 2: All (n+1)-element subsets have all their n-element subsets in one class.** - Consider any two n-element subsets A and B of S. We can form a sequence of n-element subsets starting from A to B where each subset in the sequence differs from the previous one by exactly one element (this is possible because each (n+1)-element subset containing them is not separable). - Since all n-element subsets in each (n+1)-element subset are in the same class, it follows that A and B are in the same class. - Thus, all n-element subsets of S are in the same class, and we can certainly find k disjoint subsets among them. By the principle of mathematical induction, the claim holds for all k. Conclusion: For the specific case where k=n, we have a set S with n^2+n-1 elements. By our claim, there must be at least n pairwise disjoint n-element subsets in the same class.

These steps show that the cube has moved through space, but as we can see from these movements, it can return to its original horizontal position. However, the face orientations will likely have changed, which includes the colored face no longer being at the bottom. 3. **Verifying Positions:** - After these movements, the cube returns to its original position but with the previously colored face now positioned differently (in this scenario, it moves from the bottom to the right side). # Conclusion: Thus, through these movements, the cube returns to its original position but with a different face on the bottom, demonstrating its complete rotation over an axis without affecting its final coordinates on the plane.

We start from the given equation: sqrt[n]{p+q} = p - q To eliminate the root, raise both sides to the power of n: p + q = (p - q)^n 2. Given that p and q are prime numbers and n is a natural number, let's analyze the properties. Since both p and q are prime, we assume p > q. We can rewrite the equation: p + q =(p - q)^n 3. Let d = p - q. Then we can rewrite the equation as: p = d + q Substituting p back into the equation we get: (d + q) + q = d^n which simplifies to: d + 2q = d^n 4. Rearranging the equation to isolate terms involving d, we have: d^n - d = 2q 5. Notice from the equation above, d(p - q) (i.e., d) should divide 2q. Since q is a prime number, its divisors are 1 and q, thus 2q has divisors 1, 2, q, 2q. 6. Now we analyze each case where d = p - q might be one of these divisors: - **If** d = 1: Then p - q = 1, and substituting into the original equation: p + q = 1 which is impossible since p and q are primes and their sum cannot be 1. - **If** d = q: Then p = 2q, thus one of those numbers (either p or q) must not be prime because if q is prime and d = q, p cannot be 2q. A contradiction. - **If** d = 2q: Then p = 3q, thus p cannot be prime since 3q implies q is a prime not equal to p. - **If** d = 2: Then p = q + 2. Substituting into the simplified primary equation: (q + 2 + q) = (2)^n implies 2q + 2 = 2^n which simplifies to: q + 1 = 2^{n-1} 7.

The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = frac{x^2 - (2-a)x - 1}{x(x+1)^2} (for x > 0). Let g(x) = x^2 - (2-a)x - 1. The discriminant Delta = (2-a)^2 + 4 is always greater than zero, so g(x) has two real roots. However, since x > 0, we only consider the positive root of g(x). Let's set f'(x) = 0, which gives us the roots x_1 = frac{a-2 - sqrt{(a-2)^2 + 4}}{2} < 0 and x_2 = frac{a-2 + sqrt{(a-2)^2 + 4}}{2} > 0. Therefore, the function is decreasing on the interval (0, frac{a-2 + sqrt{(a-2)^2 + 4}}{2}) and increasing on the interval (frac{a-2 + sqrt{(a-2)^2 + 4}}{2}, +infty). 3. From (1), we know that when a > 4, the function f(x) has an extreme value on the domain (0, +infty). The condition f(x) leq (2016-a)x^3 + frac{x^2 + a - 1}{x + 1} can be rewritten as a x^3 leq x - 1 - ln x + 2016 x^3. Since x > 0, we have a leq frac{1}{x^3}(x - 1 - ln x) + 2016. Let h(x) = x - 1 - ln x (for x > 0), then h'(x) = frac{x - 1}{x}. Solving h'(x) > 0 yields x > 1, while h'(x) < 0 yields 0 < x < 1. Consequently, h(x) is decreasing on (0, 1) and increasing on (1, +infty). Therefore, for x > 0, we have h(x) geq h(1) = 0, which means frac{1}{x^3}(x - 1 - ln x) + 2016 geq 2016. Hence, we conclude that a leq 2016 and additionally a > 4. Therefore, the range of the real number a is boxed{(4, 2016]}."},{"instruction":"Given the hyperbolas (C_{1}: frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1) and (C_{2}: frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} = 1), let (P) be a point moving on (C_{2}).

The problem defines two hyperbolas: [ C_1: frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, quad C_2: frac{y^2}{b^2} - frac{x^2}{a^2} = 1 ] Let P be any point on C_2, which can be written parametrically as: [ P left( a tan theta, b sec theta right). ] 2. Line segments PA and PB are tangents from P to C_1, intersecting C_1 at points A and B respectively. For these points: [ A = (a sec alpha, b tan alpha), quad B = (a sec beta, b tan beta). ] 3. Introduce the asymptotes of hyperbola C_1 as: [ l_1: y = frac{b}{a} x, quad l_2: y = -frac{b}{a} x. ] 4. Now, calculate the slopes of tangents PA and PB. For tangent PA, the equation can be written as: [ frac{x sec alpha}{a} - frac{y tan alpha}{b} = 1. ] 5. Similarly, for tangent PB, we have: [ frac{x sec beta}{a} - frac{y tan beta}{b} = 1. ] 6. By comparing slopes, we derive the following system of equations: [ left{ begin{array}{l} tan theta sec alpha - sec theta tan alpha = 1, tan theta sec beta - sec theta tan beta = 1. end{array} right. ] 7. Which is equivalently written as: [ left{ begin{array}{l} sin theta - sin alpha = cos alpha cos theta, sin theta - sin beta = cos beta cos theta, end{array} right. ] 8. Subtracting these two equations, we get: [ cos theta = -frac{sin alpha - sin beta}{cos alpha - cos beta}. ] 9. Using trigonometric identities, we can further simplify: [ sin theta = frac{sin (beta - alpha)}{cos alpha - cos beta}. ] 10. Substitute back the expressions for sin theta and cos theta into the identity sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1, we get: [ sin^2(alpha - beta) + (sin alpha - sin beta)^2 = (cos alpha - cos beta)^2. ] 11. Simplifying both sides, we remove factor 4 sin^2 frac{alpha - beta}{2}, and get: [ cos^2 frac{alpha - beta}{2} + cos^2 frac{alpha + beta}{2} = sin^2 frac{alpha + beta}{2}. ] 12. The equation of line AB, which is the line through points A and B, using symmetrical properties, intersects the asymptotes at points C and D: [ t_1 + t_2 = lambda cos frac{alpha - beta}{2}, quad 2t_1 t_2 = lambda cos frac{alpha + beta}{2}, quad t_1 - t_2 = lambda sin frac{alpha + beta}{2}. ] 13.

Using the cosine addition formula, we want to find the range for ( cos A cos C ). Recall that: [ cos(A + C) = cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}right) ] Since ( A + C = frac{2pi}{3} ), we have: [ cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}right) = cosleft(pi - frac{pi}{3}right) = -cosleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = -frac{1}{2} ] 3. Using the product-to-sum identities, we can express ( cos A cos C ) in terms of ( cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}right) ): [ cos A cos C = frac{1}{2} left( cos(A + C) + cos(A - C) right) ] Substituting (cos(A + C) = -frac{1}{2}): [ cos A cos C = frac{1}{2} left( -frac{1}{2} + cos(A - C) right) ] 4. The range of (cos(A - C)) is ([-1, 1]), since cosine values for any angle are between -1 and 1.

We have: [ frac{1}{b} - frac{1}{a} = frac{a-b}{ab}. ] Since a > b and both a and b are negative, a-b is positive, and ab is positive (as the product of two negatives). Hence, frac{a-b}{ab} > 0, which means frac{1}{b} > frac{1}{a}. Therefore, Option A is correct. **Option B: (a+b)^2 > b^2** Given a+b < b, which implies a+b < 0 since b < 0, squaring both sides gives: [ (a+b)^2 > b^2, ] because squaring a negative number (a+b) gives a positive result, which is greater than the square of any negative number (b^2). Thus, Option B is correct. **Option C: ab > (a+b)^2** To evaluate this claim, we can use specific values that satisfy the given conditions.

Hence, Option C is incorrect. **Option D: frac{1}{b} < frac{1}{{a-b}}** Given b < a < 0, we note that frac{1}{b} < 0 because b is negative.

For Ship A: 30% of passengers had round-trip tickets. 25% of these passengers took their cars, so 0.25 * 30% = 7.5% of all passengers had round-trip tickets and took their cars. Therefore, 30% - 7.5% = 22.5% of passengers had round-trip tickets and did not take their cars. For Ship B: 50% of passengers had round-trip tickets. 15% of these passengers took their cars, so 0.15 * 50% = 7.5% of all passengers had round-trip tickets and took their cars. Therefore, 50% - 7.5% = 42.5% of passengers had round-trip tickets and did not take their cars. For Ship C: 20% of passengers had round-trip tickets. 35% of these passengers took their cars, so 0.35 * 20% = 7% of all passengers had round-trip tickets and took their cars.

The value of each basic item is hence either (1) or (-1). Let's denote the number in the (i)-th row and (j)-th column as (a_{ij}), so the sum of all basic items can be recorded as (S). 1. **Counting Basic Items and Their Distribution:** - There are (n!) basic items since one needs to choose one element from each row and column, which corresponds to a permutation of the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}). - Each element (a_{ij}) appears in exactly ((n-1)!) basic items, because we can choose any one of the remaining (n-1) elements from each other row and column independently. 2. **Changing a Sign of a Single Element:** - Assume (a_{11} = -1). - By flipping the sign of (a_{11}) and keeping all other entries fixed, all the ((n-1)!) basic items involving (a_{11}) will flip their signs. - Let (k) be the number of these ((n-1)!) basic items that were originally (1) (positive). - Therefore, there are ((n-1)! - k) basic items that were (-1) (negative). [ T = k - [(n-1)! - k] = 2k - (n-1)! ] 3. **Effect on Total Sum by Flipping a Sign:** - Flipping the sign of (a_{11}) affects the sum (S).

First, we determine some initial solutions that are obviously correct: - For the pair (n, p) = (1, p), where p is any prime number, (p-1)^1 + 1 = p and is divisible by 1^{p-1} = 1 for any prime p. Thus, (1, p) is a solution for any prime p. - For the pair (n, p) = (2, 2), we have (2-1)^2 + 1 = 2 and 2^{2-1} = 2. Since 2 divides 2, (2, 2) is also a solution. 2. For n geq 2 and p geq 3, we note that (p-1)^n + 1 is an odd number because (p-1)^n is even (as p-1 is even for p geq 3 and n geq 2 is an integer). Therefore, n must also be odd (otherwise (n, p) leq 2 p cannot hold, as n < 2p). 3. Let q be the smallest prime factor of n. Then, since q | n, we have: [ q mid (p-1)^n + 1 ] Therefore, we can write: [ (p-1)^n equiv -1 pmod{q} ] 4. Because (p-1) and q are coprime (since q does not divide p-1 and p is prime), there exists integers u and v such that: [ u cdot n + v cdot (q-1) = 1 ] This is guaranteed by Bézout's identity. 5. Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we have: [ (p-1)^{u cdot n + v cdot (q-1)} = (p-1)^{u cdot n} cdot (p-1)^{v cdot (q-1)} ] Since by assumption: [ (p-1)^n equiv -1 pmod{q} ] Then: begin{align*} (p-1)^{u cdot n} cdot (p-1)^{v cdot (q-1)} &equiv (-1)^u cdot 1^v pmod{q} &equiv (-1)^u pmod{q} end{align*} 6. Because u cdot n + v cdot (q-1) equiv 1, and since u must be an odd number, we conclude: [ p-1 equiv -1 pmod{q} ] Hence, q mid p. Since q is the smallest prime factor of n and a prime divisor of p, it must be q = p. 7. Then, since p mid n and n < 2p, the only possible value for n is p. We need to check if such n = p satisfies: [ p^{p-1} mid (p-1)^p + 1 ] Expanding by the binomial theorem: [ (p-1)^p + 1 = (p - 1)^p + 1 = p^p - binom{p}{1} p^{p-1} + binom{p}{2} p^{p-2} - dots + (-1)^{p} binom{p}{p-1} cdot p + (-1)^p + 1 ] Simplifying: [ = p^2(p^{p-2} - binom{p}{1} p^{p-3} + binom{p}{2} p^{p-4} - ldots + (-1)^{p-1} + 1) ] As p geq 3, the terms in parentheses are divisible by at least p^2, and the remaining term is simply 1. 8.

The distance d from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by: [ d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} ] Applying this formula to our scenario where (x_0, y_0) = (0, 1) and the line equation is x - 2y + m = 0 (which can be rewritten as 1cdot x + (-2)cdot y + m = 0), we get: [ d = frac{|1cdot 0 + (-2)cdot 1 + m|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2}} = frac{|-2 + m|}{sqrt{5}} ] Since d = sqrt{5} (the radius of the circle), we have: [ frac{|m - 2|}{sqrt{5}} = sqrt{5} ] Multiplying both sides by sqrt{5}, we find: [ |m - 2| = 5 ] This absolute value equation has two solutions: 1. m - 2 = 5, which gives m = 7 2. m - 2 = -5, which gives m = -3 Therefore, the real number m can be either 7 or -3.

Since these are distinct groups (you can't have a senior who is counted in both the car and motorcycle groups), we can simply add the two numbers together: Total seniors with cars or motorcycles: 120 + 15 = 135 seniors Now, let's denote the total number of students in the lower grades (freshmen, sophomores, and juniors) as X. According to the problem, 10% of these students have cars and 3% have motorcycles. So, the number of students in the lower grades with cars is 0.10X and with motorcycles is 0.03X. The total number of students in the lower grades with either a car or a motorcycle is 0.10X + 0.03X = 0.13X. We know that seniors and the lower grades combined make up 20% of the entire school population with cars or motorcycles. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as Y. So, 20% of Y is the total number of students with cars or motorcycles: 0.20Y = 135 (seniors with cars or motorcycles) + 0.13X (lower grades with cars or motorcycles) We also know that the seniors are part of the total school population, so Y = 300 (seniors) + X (lower grades). Now, let's solve for X using the information we have: 0.20(300 + X) = 135 + 0.13X 60 + 0.20X = 135 + 0.13X 0.20X - 0.13X = 135 - 60 0.07X = 75 X = 75 / 0.07 X = 1071.43 Since the number of students must be a whole number, we can round to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are approximately boxed{1071} students in the lower grades (freshmen, sophomores, and juniors) at Morse High School."},{"instruction":"Given that left{a_{n}right} is an infinite sequence composed of nonnegative integers, where the maximum value of the first n terms of the sequence is denoted as A_{n}, and the minimum value of the terms a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, ldots after the nth term is denoted as B_{n}, and d_{n}=A_{n}B_{n}.

(Ⅱ) Proving the Necessary and Sufficient Condition - **Sufficiency**: - If left{a_{n}right} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of d, then a_{n} = a_{1} + (n-1)d. - Therefore, A_{n} = a_{n} = a_{1} + (n-1)d and B_{n} = a_{n+1} = a_{1} + nd. - It follows that d_{n} = A_{n} - B_{n} = (a_{1} + (n-1)d) - (a_{1} + nd) = -d. - **Necessity**: - Assuming d_{n} = A_{n} - B_{n} = -d for n=1,2,3,ldots. - If a_{k} - a_{k-1} < 0, then d_{k} = A_{k} - B_{k} = a_{k-1} - B_{k} geq a_{k-1} - a_{k} > 0, which contradicts d_{n} = -d leq 0. - Hence, left{a_{n}right} must be a non-decreasing sequence, and d_{n} = a_{n} - a_{n+1} = -d implies a_{n+1} - a_{n} = d. - Therefore, left{a_{n}right} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of d. (Ⅲ) Proving the Terms of left{a_{n}right} Can Only Be 1 or 2 - If a_{1} = 2 and d_{n} = 1 for all n, the terms cannot be zero or exceed 2. - Assuming a term a_{m} > 2, contradiction arises because it implies the existence of a term a_{i} = 1 before a_{m}, leading to d_{i} = 2 - B_{i} leq 0, which contradicts d_{n} = 1. - If there were a last term equal to 1, say a_{k}, then d_{k} = A_{k} - B_{k} = 2 - 2 = 0, contradicting d_{n} = 1. - Therefore, the terms of left{a_{n}right} can only be 1 or 2, and there must be infinitely many terms equal to 1. boxed{text{The terms of } left{a_{n}right} text{ can only be } 1 text{ or } 2, text{ and there are infinitely many terms equal to } 1.}"},{"instruction":"As shown in the figure, there are 2 pots of flowers on each side of Han Mei's house.

Case 1: Pots Moved from the Same Side - If Han Mei moves the first two pots from the same side, she has 2 options: - Move both from the left side. - Move both from the right side. - For **each** of these options, since she is required to move the pot that is closest to the house each time, there is exactly 1 specific order to follow: move the nearest one first, then the next nearest one. - Therefore, there are 2 ways to choose which side to start with and 1 unique way to move them on that chosen side. Hence, total ways in this case are: [ 2 times 1 = 2 text{ ways} ] Case 2: Pots Moved from Different Sides - In this scenario, Han Mei moves one pot from the left side and one pot from the right side in the first two moves.

Each sequence here also has only 1 specific order remaining (the nearest one first, then the next nearest one). - Therefore, for each choice of the first two moves, there is exactly 1 resulting order.

Thus: [ 11k leq m < 10(k+1) ] 5. **Count the integers in the range:** The number of integers ( m ) in the range ( 11k leq m < 10(k+1) ) is: [ 10(k+1) - 11k = 10k + 10 - 11k = 10 - k ] 6. **Sum the counts for all ( k ):** We need to find the sum of the counts for all possible values of ( k ). The value of ( k ) ranges from 0 to the largest integer ( k ) such that ( 11k < 10(k+1) ), which simplifies to ( k < 10 ). Therefore, ( k ) ranges from 0 to 9. For each ( k ) from 0 to 9, the number of integers ( m ) is ( 10 - k ).

To find the interval for x, we analyze the factors: - The expression x(x-2) < 0 implies that the product of x and (x-2) is negative. - The roots of the quadratic equation are x = 0 and x = 2. The sign of the product changes at the roots, so we test intervals to determine where the product is negative: - For x < 0, both factors are negative, so their product is positive. - For 0 < x < 2, x is positive but x-2 is negative, making their product negative. - For x > 2, both factors are positive, so their product is positive. Thus, the solution for A is in the interval where 0 < x < 2. So, A={x|0 < x < 2}. 2. **Determining Set B and Its Complement**: The condition for B is x-1 leqslant 0, which simplifies to x leqslant 1.

Eventually, we reduce to a set of minimal 1-tuples. 7. **Contradiction**: Since 1-tuples are just positive integers and there is only one minimal positive integer in any set of positive integers (the smallest one), this contradicts our initial assumption of having infinitely many minimal elements. Conclusion: Hence we proved by contradiction that our initial assumption was false, thereby demonstrating that the set can only contain finitely many minimal n-tuples. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Someone asked Uncle Wang: How many pots of flowers are there in your flower garden?

Then, the distance between the foci is 2c = 2sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = 2sqrt{9^2 - 4^2} = 2sqrt{65}. Since P is a point on the ellipse, the sum of the distances from P to the foci is constant and equal to the major axis, i.e., |overrightarrow{F_1P}| + |overrightarrow{F_2P}| = 2a. Now, we want to find the range of values for the dot product overrightarrow{F_1P} cdot overrightarrow{F_2P}. Using the formula for the dot product, we have: overrightarrow{F_1P} cdot overrightarrow{F_2P} = |overrightarrow{F_1P}||overrightarrow{F_2P}|costheta, where theta is the angle between the vectors overrightarrow{F_1P} and overrightarrow{F_2P}. Since the maximum value of costheta is 1, we have: max(overrightarrow{F_1P} cdot overrightarrow{F_2P}) = |overrightarrow{F_1P}||overrightarrow{F_2P}|max(costheta) = |overrightarrow{F_1P}||overrightarrow{F_2P}| = frac{(|overrightarrow{F_1P}| + |overrightarrow{F_2P}|)^2 - c^2}{2} = frac{(2a)^2 - c^2}{2} = frac{36}{2} = 18. However, this maximum value is not achievable because it would require theta = 0, which would mean that the point P coincides with one of the foci, and this is not possible since P is a point on the ellipse. Therefore, the maximum value of the dot product is less than 18. Now let's find the minimum value. The minimum value of costheta is -1, so we have: min(overrightarrow{F_1P} cdot overrightarrow{F_2P}) = |overrightarrow{F_1P}||overrightarrow{F_2P}|min(costheta) = -|overrightarrow{F_1P}||overrightarrow{F_2P}| = -frac{(|overrightarrow{F_1P}| + |overrightarrow{F_2P}|)^2 - c^2}{2} = -frac{(2a)^2 - c^2}{2} = -frac{36}{2} = -18. Again, this minimum value is not achievable because it would require theta = pi, which would mean that the point P is at infinity, and this is not possible since P is a point on the ellipse. Therefore, the minimum value of the dot product is greater than -18. Now, let's find the possible extreme values of overrightarrow{F_1P} cdot overrightarrow{F_2P}. Since the ellipse is symmetric about the x-axis and y-axis, the extreme values occur when P is at one of the vertices of the ellipse. When P is at the vertex (a, 0), we have: overrightarrow{F_1P} = (a - c, 0) qquad text{and} qquad overrightarrow{F_2P} = (a + c, 0), and their dot product is: overrightarrow{F_1P} cdot overrightarrow{F_2P} = (a - c)(a + c) = a^2 - c^2 = 9^2 - 4^2 = 65. When P is at the vertex (-a, 0), we have: overrightarrow{F_1P} = (-a + c, 0) qquad text{and} qquad overrightarrow{F_2P} = (-a - c, 0), and their dot product is: overrightarrow{F_1P} cdot overrightarrow{F_2P} = (-a + c)(-a - c) = a^2 - c^2 = 9^2 - 4^2 = 65. When P is at one of the vertices (0, b) or (0, -b), we have: overrightarrow{F_1P} = (0, b - sqrt{a^2 - b^2}) qquad text{and} qquad overrightarrow{F_2P} = (0, b + sqrt{a^2 - b^2}), or overrightarrow{F_1P} = (0, -b - sqrt{a^2 - b^2}) qquad text{and} qquad overrightarrow{F_2P} = (0, -b + sqrt{a^2 - b^2}), respectively, and their dot product is: overrightarrow{F_1P} cdot overrightarrow{F_2P} = (0)(0) + (b - sqrt{a^2 - b^2})(b + sqrt{a^2 - b^2}) = b^2 - (a^2 - b^2) = 2b^2 - a^2 = 2 cdot 4^2 - 9^2 = -11. Thus, the possible extreme values of overrightarrow{F_1P} cdot overrightarrow{F_2P} are -11 and 65.

Firstly, the condition (x_1 - x_2) [f(x_1) - f(x_2)] < 0 suggests that f(x) is a decreasing function on mathbb{R}. This is derived from the fact that for x_1 > x_2, we must have f(x_1) < f(x_2) for the inequality to hold. Since f(x+1) is an odd function, it implies that f(-x-1) = -f(x+1). Given that the function passes through the point (0,0), meaning f(1) = 0, we can say that the function f(x) passes through the point (1, 0) as well. Combining these two conclusions: if x>1, then f(x)<0 since f(x) is decreasing. Therefore, for the inequality f(1-x) < 0, we transform it as follows: 1 - x > 1 Rightarrow x < 0.

Choose such a set of integers ( x, y, z ) such that the quantity (alpha = |x| + |y| + |z| ) is minimal and positive, i.e., ( alpha ) takes the smallest natural number value. 4. Notice that for any integer ( n in mathbb{Z} ), the following is true: - If ( n = 2k ) (for some ( k in mathbb{Z} )), then [ n^2 = 4k^2 equiv 0 pmod{4} ] - If ( n = 2k + 1 ) (for some ( k in mathbb{Z} )), then [ n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 equiv 1 pmod{4} ] 5.

On the other hand, the remainder of ( 3z^2 ) when divided by 4 can only be 0 or 3 because: - If ( z = 2k ), then [ z^2 = 4k^2 equiv 0 pmod{4} ] and thus [ 3z^2 equiv 0 pmod{4} ] - If ( z = 2k + 1 ), then [ z^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 equiv 1 pmod{4} ] and thus [ 3z^2 equiv 3 pmod{4} ] 7. For the equation ( x^2 + y^2 = 3z^2 ) to hold, the remainders must match modulo 4. This implies: - The remainder of ( x^2 + y^2 ) must be either 0 or 1 or 2. - The remainder of ( 3z^2 ) must be either 0 or 3.

The time taken by J to walk 24 km is ( t_J = frac{24}{v_J} ) hours, and the time taken by P to walk 24 km is ( t_P = frac{24}{v_P} ) hours. We are given that the sum of the time taken by them is 14 hours, so: ( t_J + t_P = 14 ) Substituting the expressions for ( t_J ) and ( t_P ) we get: ( frac{24}{v_J} + frac{24}{v_P} = 14 ) Now, we can use the fact that ( v_J + v_P = 7 ) to express ( v_P ) in terms of ( v_J ): ( v_P = 7 - v_J ) Substituting this into the time equation: ( frac{24}{v_J} + frac{24}{7 - v_J} = 14 ) To solve for ( v_J ), we need to find a common denominator and combine the fractions: ( frac{24(7 - v_J) + 24v_J}{v_J(7 - v_J)} = 14 ) Expanding the numerator: ( 168 - 24v_J + 24v_J = 14v_J(7 - v_J) ) Since ( -24v_J + 24v_J ) cancels out, we are left with: ( 168 = 14v_J(7 - v_J) ) Divide both sides by 14 to simplify: ( 12 = v_J(7 - v_J) ) Expanding the right side: ( 12 = 7v_J - v_J^2 ) Rearranging the terms to form a quadratic equation: ( v_J^2 - 7v_J + 12 = 0 ) Factoring the quadratic equation: ( (v_J - 3)(v_J - 4) = 0 ) So, ( v_J ) can be either 3 or 4 km/h.

If the distance between points A and B, |AB|, equals 2, find the value of a.","output":"To find the distance between two points in a spatial coordinate system, we can use the distance formula: |AB| = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2} For points A and B given as A(-1, 1, -a) and B(-a, 3, -1), the coordinates align as follows: x_1 = -1, y_1 = 1, z_1 = -a, and x_2 = -a, y_2 = 3, z_2 = -1. Plugging these into the distance formula: begin{align*} |AB| &= sqrt{(-a - (-1))^2 + (3 - 1)^2 + (-1 - (-a))^2} &= sqrt{(a+1)^2 + 2^2 + (a-1)^2} &= sqrt{a^2 + 2a + 1 + 4 + a^2 - 2a + 1} &= sqrt{2a^2 + 6} end{align*} Given |AB| = 2, we set the expression under the square root equal to 4, since 2^2 = 4. Hence, we solve for a: begin{align*} sqrt{2a^2 + 6} &= 2 2a^2 + 6 &= 4 2a^2 &= 4 - 6 2a^2 &= -2 a^2 &= frac{-2}{2} a^2 &= -1 end{align*} There seems to be a problem as a^2 cannot be negative. Let's double-check the original formula to ensure that there were no mistakes: |AB| = 2 = sqrt{2a^2 + 6} Let’s try squaring both sides of the equation again: begin{align*} (|AB|)^2 &= (sqrt{2a^2 + 6})^2 2^2 &= 2a^2 + 6 4 &= 2a^2 + 6 2a^2 &= 4 - 6 2a^2 &= -2 end{align*} The re-verification shows that the same step leads to the same issue - a square of a real number cannot be negative. This indicates that the initial equation to solve might contain an error. Reexamining the initial setup: begin{align*} |AB| &= sqrt{(a+1)^2 + 2^2 + (a-1)^2} &= sqrt{a^2 + 2a + 1 + 4 + a^2 - 2a + 1} end{align*} After carefully reevaluating the terms, we can see that the correct formula for the sum under the square root should be: begin{align*} |AB| &= sqrt{(a+1)^2 + 4 + (a-1)^2} &= sqrt{a^2 + 2a + 1 + 4 + a^2 - 2a + 1} &= sqrt{2a^2 + 6} end{align*} The above steps are correct and the same as before, leading to a negative under the square root which is not possible for real numbers a. However, realizing the distance between two points must be positive and non-zero, we have likely made a mistake in the calculations. In the step of expanding (a-1)^2, it looks like we subtracted 2a instead of adding it. Let's correct the equation: begin{align*} |AB| &= sqrt{(a+1)^2 + 2^2 + (a-1)^2} &= sqrt{a^2 + 2a + 1 + 4 + a^2 + 2a + 1} &= sqrt{2a^2 + 4a + 6} end{align*} Now this aligns better with the expectation of positive distances. Let us solve the equation again with this adjustment: Given |AB| = 2, the equation simplifies to: begin{align*} 2 &= sqrt{2a^2 + 4a + 6} 4 &= 2a^2 + 4a + 6 2a^2 + 4a + 6 &= 4 2a^2 + 4a + 2 &= 0 a^2 + 2a + 1 &= 0 (a + 1)^2 &= 0 end{align*} We can now see that a + 1 = 0, so a = -1. The negative solution does not contribute to a negative distance, as we are merely finding a position in the coordinate system.

When the sweater is sold at a 40% discount, the merchant still makes a 30% profit on the wholesale cost. This means the sale price at 40% discount is 130% of the wholesale cost. Let's denote the normal retail price of the sweater as R. The sale price at 40% discount is 60% of the normal retail price (since 100% - 40% = 60%). So we have: Sale price at 40% discount = 60% of R = 130% of W Now, we can set up an equation to solve for R in terms of W: 0.6R = 1.3W To find the markup percentage from wholesale to the normal retail price, we need to express R in terms of W and then calculate the percentage increase from W to R. R = (1.3W) / 0.6 R = 2.1667W (approximately) The markup from wholesale to normal retail price is R - W, so the markup is: Markup = R - W Markup = 2.1667W - W Markup = 1.1667W To find the percentage markup, we divide the markup by the wholesale cost and multiply by 100: Percentage Markup = (Markup / W) * 100 Percentage Markup = (1.1667W / W) * 100 Percentage Markup = 1.1667 * 100 Percentage Markup = 116.67% So the sweater is marked up by approximately boxed{116.67%} from the wholesale cost at its normal retail price."},{"instruction":"Given that ( 2^{2013} < 5^{867} < 2^{2014} ), how many pairs of integers ((m, n)) satisfy: [ 5^n < 2^m < 2^{m+2} < 5^{n+1} ] where ( 1 leq m leq 2012 ).","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find how many pairs of integers (m, n) satisfy the condition 5^{n} < 2^{m} < 2^{m+2} < 5^{n+1} for 1 leq m leq 2012. We are given the inequalities 2^{2013} < 5^{867} < 2^{2014}. 1. **Analyzing the Intervals:** We need to consider the intervals left(5^{n}, 5^{n+1}right) for n = 0, 1, ldots, 866. We want to check how many powers of 2 fit in these intervals such that the inequalities in the given condition hold. 2. **What Happens in Each Interval:** Suppose we are in the interval left(5^n, 5^{n+1}right). For these intervals, there are two possibilities: - Either the interval has exactly two powers of 2. - Or the interval has exactly three powers of 2. To illustrate: - If left(5^n, 5^{n+1}right) has exactly two powers of 2, then we would have 5^n < 2^a < 2^{a+1} < 5^{n+1}. This would be valid if we assume a and a+1 fit snugly between 5^n and 5^{n+1}. - If the interval has exactly three powers of 2, it would be the case where 5^n < 2^a < 2^{a+1} < 2^{a+2} < 5^{n+1}. Considering the given inequality 2^{2013} < 5^{867} < 2^{2014} means this interval, specifically, has three powers of 2 (namely, 2^{2013}, 2^{2013+1}=2^{2014}, 2^{2014+1}=2^{2015}). 3. **Establishing the System of Equations:** Let m represent the number of intervals left(5^n, 5^{n+1}right) that contain exactly three powers of 2, and let k = 867 - m represent the number of intervals with exactly two powers of 2. Given the fact there are 867 pairs, we can set up the following equations: [ begin{cases} m + n = 867 3m + 2n = 2013 end{cases} ] 4. **Solving the System of Equations:** To find m and n, we can use these two equations: Subtracting the first from the second: [ (3m + 2n) - (2m + 2n) = 2013 - 2 times 867 ] Given: [ 3m + 2n = 2013 m + n = 867 ] Simplifying the subtraction leads to: [ m = 3(2013 - 2 times 867) = 3 times 279 = 279 ] 5. **Conclusion:** Thus, the number of pairs (m, n) that satisfies 5^{n} < 2^{m} < 2^{m+2} < 5^{n+1} for 1 leq m leq 2012 is: [ boxed{279} ]"},{"instruction":"A certain clothing store introduced a new sportswear.

The formula for permutations of n items taken r at a time is A_n^r = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}. Applying this formula, we have: A_2^2 = frac{2!}{(2-2)!} = frac{2!}{0!} = 2 So, there are 2 ways to arrange athletes A and B in the middle two legs. 2. **Arrangement of the Remaining Two Legs:** For the remaining two legs, we have 4 athletes to choose from, and we need to select 2 of them. The number of ways to arrange these 2 athletes in 2 positions is given by A_4^2. Using the formula for permutations: A_4^2 = frac{4!}{(4-2)!} = frac{4!}{2!} = frac{24}{2} = 12 Thus, there are 12 ways to arrange the remaining 4 athletes in the two legs. 3. **Total Arrangements for Part 1:** The total number of different ways for athletes A and B to run the middle two legs, considering the arrangement of the remaining athletes, is the product of the arrangements of A and B and the arrangements of the remaining athletes: A_2^2 times A_4^2 = 2 times 12 = 24 # Part 2: Athletes A and B Must Run Adjacent Legs 1. **Arrangement of A and B:** As in Part 1, the arrangement of A and B running the adjacent two legs has A_2^2 ways, which we've already calculated as 2 ways. 2. **Combining A and B with Two Other Athletes:** To form a team of 4 including A and B, we select 2 athletes from the remaining 4 athletes, which can be done in C_4^2 ways. The formula for combinations of n items taken r at a time is C_n^r = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}. Applying this formula: C_4^2 = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = frac{4!}{2!2!} = frac{24}{4} = 6 So, there are 6 ways to select 2 athletes from the remaining 4. 3. **Arrangement of the Selected Athletes:** After selecting the 2 athletes, we need to arrange them with A and B to form a sequence of 3 elements (considering A and B as one element since they run adjacent legs). This can be done in A_3^3 ways: A_3^3 = frac{3!}{(3-3)!} = frac{3!}{0!} = 6 4. **Total Arrangements for Part 2:** The total number of different ways for athletes A and B to be selected and run the adjacent two legs, considering the selection and arrangement of the other athletes, is the product of the arrangements of A and B, the combinations of selecting 2 athletes, and the arrangement of these elements: A_2^2 times C_4^2 times A_3^3 = 2 times 6 times 6 = 72 Therefore, the final answers are: - For athletes A and B running the middle two legs, there are boxed{24} different ways. - For athletes A and B running adjacent legs, there are boxed{72} different ways."},{"instruction":"Consider all the rectangles for which each side touches a given ellipse.

The equation of the tangent line can be written as: [ y = m(x - u) + v. ] 3. **Forming the system of equations:** Substitute (y = m(x - u) + v) into the ellipse equation: [ frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{(m(x - u) + v)^2}{b^2} = 1. ] 4. **Simplifying the equation:** This substitution leads to the following quadratic equation: [ frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{(m^2x^2 - 2mux + m^2u^2 + 2mvx - 2muv + v^2)}{b^2} = 1, ] or [ b^2x^2 + a^2(m^2x^2 + 2m(v - mu)x + (m^2u^2 + a^2v^2 - 2muv - a^2b^2)) = 0. ] 5. **Forming the quadratic equation:** Rearranging and combining like terms, we obtain: [ (b^2 + a^2m^2)x^2 + 2a^2m(v - mu)x + (a^2m^2u^2 + a^2v^2 - 2a^2muv - a^2b^2) = 0. ] 6. **Condition for tangency:** For the line to be a tangent, the discriminant of the quadratic equation in (x) must be zero. Therefore, the discriminant is: [ 0 = (2a^2m(v - mu))^2 - 4(b^2 + a^2m^2)(a^2m^2u^2 + a^2v^2 - 2a^2muv - a^2b^2). ] 7. **Simplifying the discriminant:** Simplify this discriminant condition: [ 0 = 4a^2b^2 left[ (a^2 - u^2)m^2 + 2uvm + b^2 - v^2 right]. ] 8. **Roots of the quadratic in (m):** Since the tangents from point (P) are perpendicular, the product of the slopes (m_1) and (m_2) must be (-1). This implies: [ frac{b^2 - v^2}{a^2 - u^2} = -1, ] leading to: [ u^2 + v^2 = a^2 + b^2. ] Thus, the vertices (P(u, v)) of the rectangles lie on the circle: [ x^2 + y^2 = a^2 + b^2. ] 9. **Maximizing and minimizing the perimeter:** Now we need to select from the rectangles inscribed in this circle which ones have the largest and smallest perimeters. - For rectangles inscribed in a circle, the smallest perimeter rectangle is one that has sides parallel to the ellipse’s axes and has one side equal to the minor axis (2b). - The largest perimeter will occur when the rectangle is a square because, in a square, the side lengths are equal to the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse. 10. **Conclusion:** The rectangle with the smallest perimeter is such that its sides are parallel to the axes of the ellipse and one side equals the minor axis. The rectangle with the largest perimeter is a square. Therefore, the rectangles with the extremes in the perimeter are: boxed{}heartsQED"},{"instruction":"Let n be a prime number. Show that there is a permutation a_1,a_2,...,a_n of 1,2,...,n so that a_1,a_1a_2,...,a_1a_2...a_n leave distinct remainders when divided by n","output":"1. **Initial Setup and Assumptions:** Let ( n ) be a prime number. We need to show that there exists a permutation ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) of ( 1, 2, ldots, n ) such that the products ( a_1, a_1a_2, ldots, a_1a_2 cdots a_n ) leave distinct remainders when divided by ( n ). 2. **Handling the Case When ( a_i = n ):** Suppose ( a_i = n ) for some ( i < n ). Then, the product ( a_1a_2 cdots a_i ) is divisible by ( n ). Similarly, the product ( a_1a_2 cdots a_{i+1} ) will also be divisible by ( n ) since it includes ( a_i = n ). This would mean that two of the products leave the same remainder (0) when divided by ( n ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( a_n = n ). 3. **Considering the Remaining Elements:** Since ( a_n = n ), we need to consider the permutation of the remaining elements ( 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ). We need to ensure that the products ( a_1, a_1a_2, ldots, a_1a_2 cdots a_{n-1} ) leave distinct remainders when divided by ( n ). 4. **Using Factorial Property:** The product ( a_1a_2 cdots a_{n-1} ) is equal to ((n-1)!). By Wilson's Theorem, we know that for a prime ( n ), ((n-1)! equiv -1 pmod{n}). This implies that ((n-1)!) is not divisible by ( n ). 5. **Constructing the Permutation:** For ( n = 4 ), we can take the permutation ( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 3, a_3 = 2, a_4 = 4 ). We can verify that the products ( 1, 1 cdot 3 = 3, 1 cdot 3 cdot 2 = 6 equiv 2 pmod{4}, 1 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 4 = 24 equiv 0 pmod{4} ) leave distinct remainders ( 1, 3, 2, 0 ). 6. **General Case for Prime ( n ):** For a prime ( n ), consider the permutation ( a_1 = 1, a_n = n ), and ( a_i = 1 + (i-1)^{-1} ) for ( 2 leq i leq n-1 ), where ((i-1)^{-1}) is the modular inverse of ( i-1 ) modulo ( n ). This ensures that each product ( a_1a_2 cdots a_i ) leaves a distinct remainder modulo ( n ). 7. **Verification:** We can verify that the products ( a_1, a_1a_2, ldots, a_1a_2 cdots a_{n-1} ) leave distinct remainders modulo ( n ) by checking that each intermediate product is distinct and non-zero modulo ( n ).

This is a fundamental property of triangles that relates the sides of a triangle to the sines of its angles. 2. **Given equation transformation**: The given equation is (a-2b)cos C = c(2cos B - cos A). By substituting the Law of Sines into this equation, we get (sin A - 2sin B)cos C = sin C(2cos B - cos A). This substitution is based on the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the sines of its angles. 3. **Simplifying the equation**: The equation simplifies to sin Acos C + sin Ccos A = 2(sin Bcos C + cos Bsin C). This simplification uses trigonometric identities to combine and simplify terms. 4. **Applying sum-to-product identities**: The equation further simplifies to sin(A+C) = 2sin(B+C). This step uses the sum-to-product identities in trigonometry, which help in simplifying expressions involving trigonometric functions. 5. **Deriving a relationship between sin B and sin A**: From the simplified equation, we deduce that sin B = 2sin A. This step involves understanding the implications of the trigonometric identities and the given conditions. 6. **Area of triangle ABC**: The area of triangle ABC is given as a^2sinfrac{A+B}{2}.

This step involves solving for sinfrac{C}{2} based on the given conditions. 9. **Finding the value of C**: From sinfrac{C}{2} = frac{1}{2}, we deduce that frac{C}{2} = frac{pi}{6}.

(Ⅱ) If for every positive integer n, the inequality S_n + a_n > m is always true, determine the range of values for the constant m.","output":"(Ⅰ) Since b_1, a_2, b_2 form an arithmetic sequence, we can deduce that a_2 is the mean of b_1 and b_2. Therefore, we have: a_2 = frac{b_1 + b_2}{2} Rightarrow 2a_2 = b_1 + b_2 Rightarrow 2a_2 = 2 + b_2 Rightarrow a_2 = 1 + frac{b_2}{2}. We also know that a_2, b_2, a_3 + 2 form a geometric sequence. This implies that a_2^2 = b_2(a_3 + 2). Using the relationship for a_2 from above, we get: left(1 + frac{b_2}{2}right)^2 = b_2(a_3 + 2). Expanding the left-hand side and simplifying, we obtain: 1 + b_2 + frac{b_2^2}{4} = b_2(a_3+2) Rightarrow b_2^2 + 4b_2 + 4 = 4b_2(a_3 + 2). Since we know a_2 = 1 + frac{b_2}{2} and a_2 = a_1 + (n - 1)d where d is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence, we get: 1 + frac{b_2}{2} = 1 + (2 - 1)d Rightarrow d = frac{b_2}{2}. Therefore, the general term for the arithmetic sequence {a_n} is: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d = 1 + (n - 1)frac{b_2}{2}. Similarly, for the geometric sequence, we have that the ratio r can be expressed by using b_2 = b_1 cdot r = 2r.

Substituting b_2 = 2r into the above equation and solving for r gives us the common ratio of the geometric sequence: b_2^2 = 4r^2 Rightarrow r = pm sqrt{b_2}. Since b_n > 0, we only consider the positive square root: r = sqrt{b_2} = sqrt{2r}, which means: r = 3.

Since ( f(f(x) - f(y)) = x^2 - y^2 + a ) and ( f(f(y)) = y^2 + a ), we can see that ( f ) must be surjective. This is because for any real number ( z ), there exists some ( y ) such that ( f(y) = z ). 5. Now, consider ( P(x, y) ) again: [ P(x, y) implies f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y^2 ] Since ( f ) is surjective, for any real number ( z ), there exists some ( y ) such that ( f(y) = z ). Thus: [ f(x + z) = f(x) + y^2 ] Since ( y^2 ) can take any non-negative value, this implies that ( f(x + z) geq f(x) ) for all ( x ) and ( z ). 6. Given that ( f ) is surjective, for any ( z ), there exists some ( x ) such that ( f(z) geq f(x) ). This implies that ( f ) must be constant because otherwise, there would be a contradiction in the inequality ( f(x + z) geq f(x) ). 7. If ( f ) is constant, let ( f(x) = c ) for some constant ( c ). Substituting into the original equation: [ f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y^2 implies c = c + y^2 ] This implies ( y^2 = 0 ) for all ( y ), which is a contradiction since ( y ) can be any real number.

The standard form of a parabola that opens upwards is x^2 = 4py, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus and also from the vertex to the directrix. Comparing this with our equation, we find that 4p = 4, which means p = 1. Therefore, the focus of the parabola is at (0,p), which gives us the coordinates of the focus as left(0,1right). The directrix of the parabola, being the same distance from the vertex as the focus but in the opposite direction, is a horizontal line y = -p, which gives us the equation of the directrix as y = -1. Given that the distance from a point P on the parabola to the focus is 8, we can use the definition of a parabola, which states that any point on a parabola is equidistant from the focus and the directrix. The distance from P to the focus is given as 8, and since the distance from P to the directrix must be equal to the distance from P to the focus, we can set up the equation y_{P} + 1 = 8. This equation accounts for the fact that the distance to the directrix is the vertical distance from P to the line y = -1, which is y_{P} + 1 because y_{P} is the y-coordinate of point P. Solving y_{P} + 1 = 8 for y_{P}, we subtract 1 from both sides to isolate y_{P}, yielding y_{P} = 8 - 1 = 7. This result tells us the y-coordinate of point P on the parabola. Since the distance from point P to the x-axis is simply the absolute value of the y-coordinate of P (assuming P is above the x-axis, which it is in this case because y_{P} = 7 > 0), the distance from point P to the x-axis is 7.

Now, to find DN, which is twice DA because DN is the hypotenuse of the triangle, DN = 2 cdot DA = 2 cdot frac{14}{sqrt{3}} = frac{28}{sqrt{3}}. To rationalize the denominator, DN = frac{28}{sqrt{3}} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} = frac{28sqrt{3}}{3}. Since we are looking for an integer value of DN, we must find which of the options comes closest to DN when multiplied by sqrt{3} divided by 3. After performing the approximations with each option, or using a calculator to find the precise value of frac{28sqrt{3}}{3}, we will find that the length of DN is approximately 16 meters, which corresponds to option C.

Step 3: Counting the 2x2 Squares In an 8x8 grid, the number of possible 2x2 squares is calculated as follows: [ (8-1) times (8-1) = 7 times 7 = 49 ] There are 49 possible 2x2 squares within the 8x8 grid. Step 4: Possible Coloring Patterns Since each cell in a 2x2 square can be either one of two colors, the total number of distinct coloring patterns for a 2x2 square is: [ 2^4 = 16 ] Step 5: Pigeonhole Principle Given that there are 49 2x2 squares but only 16 unique coloring patterns, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these 49 squares must have the same coloring pattern.

After reducing the selling price of each basketball by 3 and each volleyball by 2, the profit from selling all items, denoted as w dollars, can be calculated as: [ w = (45 - 30 - 3)a + (30 - 24 - 2)(200 - a) = 12a + 4(200 - a) = 8a + 800 ] Given the budget constraint, 30a + 24(200 - a) leq 5000, we solve for a: [ begin{align*} 30a + 4800 - 24a &leq 5000 6a &leq 200 a &leq frac{100}{3} end{align*} ] Since the profit per basketball (8) is greater than zero, the profit w increases as a increases.

Additionally, as I M = I C' and I K = I B', triangle MIK forms an isosceles triangle with IH (the altitude from I to BC). 4. Therefore, triangle MIK is isosceles, which implies that: [ M H = H K ] Indicating that IH is the perpendicular bisector of MK. 5. Consequently, point H is the midpoint of MK, implying that the midpoints I, C_1, H, B_1 form a symmetrical parallelogram C' M K B'. From both approaches, we conclude that the midpoint of segment B_1 C_1 lies on the line passing through I and perpendicular to BC. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Four gears A, B, C, and D are meshed together with the number of teeth x, y, z, and w, respectively.

Given that ABCD is a convex quadrilateral with angle ABC = angle ADC = 135^circ and the condition AC^2 BD^2 = 2AB cdot BC cdot CD cdot DA, we need to prove that the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. 2. Let AC = 1, alpha = angle CAD, and beta = angle BAC. Using the law of sines in triangles ABC and ADC, we have: [ AB = sqrt{2} sin(45^circ - beta), quad BC = sqrt{2} sin(beta), quad CD = sqrt{2} sin(alpha), quad DA = sqrt{2} sin(45^circ - alpha). ] 3. Applying the law of cosines in triangle BCD, we get: [ BD^2 = BC^2 + CD^2 - 2 cdot BC cdot CD cdot cos(angle BCD). ] Since angle BCD = 180^circ - (angle ABC + angle ADC) = 180^circ - 270^circ = -90^circ, we have cos(angle BCD) = cos(-90^circ) = 0. Thus, [ BD^2 = BC^2 + CD^2. ] 4. Substituting the values of BC and CD: [ BD^2 = (sqrt{2} sin(beta))^2 + (sqrt{2} sin(alpha))^2 = 2 sin^2(beta) + 2 sin^2(alpha). ] 5. Using the given condition AC^2 BD^2 = 2AB cdot BC cdot CD cdot DA, we substitute AC = 1 and the expressions for AB, BC, CD, and DA: [ 1 cdot BD^2 = 2 cdot (sqrt{2} sin(45^circ - beta)) cdot (sqrt{2} sin(beta)) cdot (sqrt{2} sin(alpha)) cdot (sqrt{2} sin(45^circ - alpha)). ] Simplifying, we get: [ BD^2 = 8 sin(45^circ - beta) sin(beta) sin(alpha) sin(45^circ - alpha). ] 6. Using the identity sin(45^circ - x) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (cos(x) - sin(x)), we have: [ sin(45^circ - beta) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (cos(beta) - sin(beta)), quad sin(45^circ - alpha) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (cos(alpha) - sin(alpha)). ] 7. Substituting these into the equation, we get: [ BD^2 = 8 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (cos(beta) - sin(beta)) cdot sin(beta) cdot sin(alpha) cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (cos(alpha) - sin(alpha)). ] Simplifying, we get: [ BD^2 = 4 sin(alpha) sin(beta) (cos(alpha) - sin(alpha)) (cos(beta) - sin(beta)). ] 8. Equating the two expressions for BD^2, we have: [ 2 sin^2(alpha) + 2 sin^2(beta) = 4 sin(alpha) sin(beta) (cos(alpha) - sin(alpha)) (cos(beta) - sin(beta)). ] 9. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: [ sin^2(alpha) + sin^2(beta) = 2 sin(alpha) sin(beta) (cos(alpha) - sin(alpha)) (cos(beta) - sin(beta)). ] 10. Using the identity sin(alpha + beta) = sin(alpha) cos(beta) + cos(alpha) sin(beta), we rewrite the equation as: [ sin^2(alpha) + sin^2(beta) = 2 sin(alpha) sin(beta) cos(alpha - beta). ] 11. By the AM-GM inequality, we have: [ sin^2(alpha) + sin^2(beta) geq 2 sin(alpha) sin(beta). ] Therefore, [ 2 sin(alpha) sin(beta) cos(alpha - beta) geq 2 sin(alpha) sin(beta). ] 12. Dividing both sides by 2 sin(alpha) sin(beta) (assuming sin(alpha) sin(beta) neq 0), we get: [ cos(alpha - beta) geq 1. ] Since cos(alpha - beta) leq 1, we must have cos(alpha - beta) = 1, which implies alpha = beta. 13.

Define Terms and Set Up the Initial Condition Consider the kingdom of Anisotropy with ( n ) cities. Each pair of cities has exactly one direct one-way road between them. We will define a path from city ( X ) to city ( Y ) as a sequence of roads such that one can travel from ( X ) to ( Y ) without returning to an already visited city. A collection of paths is called diverse if no road belongs to two or more paths in the collection. Define ( N_{AB} ) as the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection of paths from city ( A ) to city ( B ). Likewise, define ( N_{BA} ) for paths from city ( B ) to city ( A ). We aim to prove ( N_{AB} = N_{BA} ) if and only if the number of roads going out of ( A ) equals the number of roads going out of ( B ). 2.

Lemma: Path Minimization Through Short Paths **Lemma:** If ( mathcal{P} ) is a diverse collection consisting of ( p ) paths from ( A ) to ( B ), then there exists a diverse collection containing all short paths and at least ( p ) paths. **Proof:** Modify ( mathcal{P} ) to include all short paths from ( A ) to ( B ). 1. If ( A to B ) is a direct road and not included in ( mathcal{P} ), add this path. 2. For any city ( C in mathcal{A} ), if the path ( A to C to B ) is missing from ( mathcal{P} ), replace existing paths using edges ( A to C ) or ( C to B ) to ensure ( A to C to B ) is included. After these operations, denote the new path collection as ( mathcal{P}' ). 4. Transition Paths from ( A ) to ( B ) and Reverse Assume ( A to B ) exists, and let ( a ) and ( b ) be the out-degrees of ( A ) and ( B ) respectively. Construct ( mathcal{Q} ), a collection of paths from ( B ) to ( A ) from ( mathcal{P}' ): [ N_{BA} geq N_{AB} + (b - a) ] Similarly, [ N_{AB} geq N_{BA} + (a - b) ] This implies: [ N_{BA} - N_{AB} = b - a ] 5. Intermediate Set Reduction After counting the existing paths, denote out-going road counts from ( A ) and ( B ): [ a = |mathcal{I}| + |mathcal{A}| + 1 ] [ b = |mathcal{I}| + |mathcal{B}| ] Thus, [ a - b = |mathcal{A}| - |mathcal{B}| + 1 ] Then evaluate the number of roads in the diverse path collections: [ |mathcal{Q}| = |mathcal{P}'| - (|mathcal{A}| + 1) + |mathcal{B}| ] [ |mathcal{Q}| geq N_{AB} + (b - a) ] 6.

The task requires us to find the side lengths of the squares when Mu reaches the lower right corner of the largest path, finding that the other two ants are on the right sides of their paths. To solve this, we will use the following steps: 1. **Identify relationships between paths and calculate distances**: The side length difference between two adjacent paths is 2 meters (as seen from the figures provided). When Mu reaches the corner, the corresponding ants Ra and Wei are at specific points on their paths. 2. **Determine Mu's path and time taken to reach the corner**: Let's denote the side of the smallest square by (a), the middle square by (b), and the largest square by (c). Since all three ants run at the same speed and reach specific points at the same time, we can use proportionate distances and relationships among the paths. 3. **Analyze the relative positions of Ra and Wei**: - Since Mu has reached the lower right corner of the largest square (c), it implies Mu has traveled a distance equal to the perimeter of the square, i.e., 4 times the side length of the largest square. Therefore, the time (t) taken to reach the corner is: [ t = frac{4c}{v} ] - Ra must be somewhere along the right side of its path. From the problem, we know Ra has run (2) meters along the right side of the second biggest path (b) and an extra (1) meter from the left side: [ b - (b - 2) = 2 , text{meters} ] Hence Ra is 3 meters from the \\"bottom side\\" of the largest square (external distance): [ 2 + 1 = 3 , text{meters} ] 4. **Position of Wei**: - Wei is moving clockwise and ends up being twice the distance away from the bottom side: [ 2 times 3 = 6 , text{meters} ] Therefore, Wei has (6 - 1 - 1 = 4) meters from the right side to reach Ra’s and Mu’s straight line intersection. 5. **Boundary conditions**: - If Wei had moved counterclockwise, it would have covered the entire bottom side and 4 meters of the right side (since the side is 4 meters shorter than the outermost square). - Both ways lead to the same intersection point (bottom corner). This means the side length of the said square must be (4) meters. 6. **Calculate side lengths**: Since the smallest square side lengths differ by 2 meters from the adjacent squares: [ a = 4 , text{meters} ] [ b = 4 + 2 = 6 , text{meters} ] [ c = 6 + 2 = 8 , text{meters} ] Conclusively, the sides of the three squares are: [ boxed{4 , text{m}, 6 , text{m}, 8 , text{m}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that the graphs of functions f(x) and g(x) are symmetric about the origin, and f(x) = 2x + 1, 1.

For example, if points A, B, and C are collinear (lie on the same line), and that line is intersected by another line outside of plane α which contains point P, then all four points could lie on the same plane formed by the intersection of those two lines. Therefore, this proposition is incorrect. 2. The second proposition suggests that \\"Three straight lines that intersect each other are on the same plane.\\" This statement is also not always correct. A counterexample would be the lateral edges of a triangular pyramid (tetrahedron); these edges intersect each other at the vertices but do not all lie on the same plane. Thus, this proposition is incorrect. 3. Lastly, the third proposition purports that \\"A quadrilateral with two pairs of opposite sides being equal is a parallelogram.\\" This statement requires clarification because while it is true for quadrilaterals in a plane, it does not necessarily hold for spatial quadrilaterals. In the spatial case, we can have a quadrilateral that is not a parallelogram despite having two pairs of opposite sides equal in length (think of a \\"skewed\\" shape in three dimensions).

Thus, the number of steps needed to reach a particular accuracy can be determined by finding how many times the range can be halved until the range of uncertainty is less than or equal to the accuracy requirement: For an accuracy of ±1°C, we would want a range less than or equal to 2°C (since we have both the upper and lower bounds of ±1°C). We start at a range of 21°C and halve it repeatedly until we reach a range of 2°C or less.

Let the common difference of the arithmetic sequence {a_n} be d, because a_n + a_{n+2} = 4n + 6, (1) therefore a_{n+2} + a_{n+4} = 4(n+2) + 6, (2) Subtracting (1) from (2) gives a_{n+4} - a_n = 8, which means 4d = 8, solving this gives d = 2, Substituting n = 1 into a_n + a_{n+2} = 4n + 6 gives 2a_1 + 4 = 10, Solving this gives a_1 = 3, Therefore, the general term formula for a_n is a_n = 3 + 2(n - 1) = 2n + 1.

Two circles (Omega_1) and (Omega_2) with centers (O_1) and (O_2) are tangent to the sides (AD) and (BC) in the points (K) and (T) respectively. 2. **Understanding the bisection property:** The circles (Omega_1) and (Omega_2) are inscribed in the angles (BAD) and (BCD) respectively. Hence, (A O_1) and (C O_2) are the angle bisectors of angles (BAD) and (BCD).

We need to show that the only function ( f: mathbb{R} to mathbb{R} ) satisfying ( f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) ) and ( f(h(x)) = h(f(x)) ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ) is the identity function ( f(x) equiv x ). We choose ( g(x) = x+1 ) and ( h(x) = x^2 ). 2. First, consider the equation ( f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 ). This implies that ( f ) is a function that shifts by 1 when its argument is increased by 1. 3. Next, consider the equation ( f(x^2) = f(x)^2 ). This implies that ( f ) preserves the squaring operation. 4. Evaluate ( f ) at specific points: - For ( x = 0 ), we have ( f(0) = f(0)^2 ). This implies ( f(0) ) must be either 0 or 1. - For ( x = 1 ), we have ( f(1) = f(1)^2 ). This implies ( f(1) ) must be either 0 or 1. - Additionally, from ( f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 ), we have ( f(1) = f(0) + 1 ). 5. Combining these results: - If ( f(0) = 0 ), then ( f(1) = 1 ). - If ( f(0) = 1 ), then ( f(1) = 2 ), but this contradicts ( f(1) = f(1)^2 ) since 2 is not a fixed point of the squaring function. 6. Therefore, ( f(0) = 0 ) and ( f(1) = 1 ). This implies ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n in mathbb{Z} ) by induction using ( f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 ). 7. **Lemma:** For any real number ( x ), we have ( f(x) ge lfloor x rfloor ). **Proof:** - If ( y ge 0 ), then ( f(y) = f(sqrt{y})^2 ge 0 ). - Let ( y = x - lfloor x rfloor ge 0 ). Thus, [ 0 le f(x - lfloor x rfloor) = f(x) - f(lfloor x rfloor) = f(x) - lfloor x rfloor, ] which implies ( f(x) ge lfloor x rfloor ). (blacksquare) 8. **Claim:** For any real number ( x ), we have ( f(x) ge x ). **Proof:** - Since ( f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 ), it suffices to show the claim for sufficiently large ( x ). In particular, we'll show the claim when ( x > 1 ). - Iterating the lemma over and over, we see that [ f(x)^{2^n} ge lfloor x^{2^n} rfloor ge x^{2^n} - 1, ] so for arbitrarily large ( N ), we have [ f(x) ge (x^N - 1)^{1/N} = x(1 - x^{-N})^{1/N} ge x(1 - x^{-N}). ] This implies that ( f(x) ge x ), as desired. (blacksquare) 9. Note that ( f(-x)^2 = f(x)^2 ), so ( f(-x) = pm f(x) ). Suppose we have ( 0 < x < 1 ) and ( f(x) > x ). Then, ( f(-x) = f(x) ), otherwise ( f(-x) < -x ), which is a contradiction. Thus, ( f(-x) = f(x) ), so ( f(1-x) = f(x) + 1 > 1 + x > 1 - x ). Thus, by the same logic, ( f(x-1) = f(1-x) = 1 + f(x) ), so ( f(x) - 1 = f(x) + 1 ), a contradiction.

The points A and B lie on another circle C', for which CP is a diameter.

So, when the selling price is 17 yuan, the maximum daily profit achievable is 490 yuan. **Conclusion:** In summary, to obtain the maximum daily profit, the selling price of the goods should be set to boxed{20} yuan per unit."},{"instruction":"Jason is making a salad. The lettuce has 30 calories, the cucumber has 80 calories, and there are 12 croutons with some calories each. The salad has 350 calories. How many calories does each crouton have?","output":"To find out how many calories each crouton has, we first need to subtract the calories from the lettuce and cucumber from the total calories of the salad. Total salad calories = 350 calories Lettuce calories = 30 calories Cucumber calories = 80 calories Calories from lettuce and cucumber = 30 + 80 = 110 calories Now, subtract the calories from lettuce and cucumber from the total salad calories to find out the total calories from the croutons. Total crouton calories = Total salad calories - Calories from lettuce and cucumber Total crouton calories = 350 - 110 = 240 calories Since there are 12 croutons, we divide the total crouton calories by the number of croutons to find the calories per crouton. Calories per crouton = Total crouton calories / Number of croutons Calories per crouton = 240 / 12 = 20 calories Each crouton has boxed{20} calories."},{"instruction":"Define a new operation # such that for any numbers a and b, a # b = 2a + frac{3a}{b}.

In the third quadrant, both sin q and cos q are negative. So, we can rewrite the equation by dividing both sides by -cos q (also negative), which gives us a standard form. frac{x^2}{-cos q} + frac{y^2}{-cos q / sin q} = 1 This is the standard equation of a conic section, which reads: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 for an ellipse, or frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 for a hyperbola. Since sin q and cos q are both negative in the third quadrant, -cos q is positive, and -cos q / sin q is positive. This means that both the coefficients of x^2 and y^2 are positive, which leads to an ellipse. Since the denominator associated with y^2 involves sin q, which is negative in the third quadrant, the largest absolute value for the denominator of y^2 part is smaller compared to the x^2 part. This implies that the major axis of the ellipse is along the y-axis, and therefore the foci of the ellipse are located on the y-axis. So, the correct answer is: boxed{text{B: An ellipse with foci on the y-axis}}"},{"instruction":"A unique dice game uses a sixsided die where rolling a 1 or a 2 yields a win of 2, rolling a 3 or a 4 results in a win of 4, but rolling a 5 or a 6 results in a loss of 6.

Suppose points A , B , C , D lie on a circle with radius r . Denote by r_1 and r_2 the smallest and second smallest possible values of r . Compute r_1^2 + r_2^2 . *Proposed by Lewis Chen*","output":"1. **Identify the problem and given points:** We are given four points ( A = (0,0) ), ( B = (-1,-1) ), ( C = (x,y) ), and ( D = (x+1,y) ) that lie on a circle with radius ( r ). We need to find the smallest and second smallest possible values of ( r ) and compute ( r_1^2 + r_2^2 ). 2. **Use the property of cyclic quadrilateral:** For points ( A, B, C, D ) to lie on a circle, the opposite angles must sum to ( 180^circ ). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the power of a point theorem can be applied to find the radius. 3. **Set up the equation using the distance formula:** The distance between points ( A ) and ( B ) is: [ AB = sqrt{(0 - (-1))^2 + (0 - (-1))^2} = sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2} ] The distance between points ( C ) and ( D ) is: [ CD = sqrt{(x+1 - x)^2 + (y - y)^2} = sqrt{1} = 1 ] The distance between points ( A ) and ( C ) is: [ AC = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ] The distance between points ( B ) and ( D ) is: [ BD = sqrt{(x+1 + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2} = sqrt{(x+2)^2 + (y+1)^2} ] 4. **Apply the circle condition:** For points ( A, B, C, D ) to lie on a circle, the power of point theorem gives us: [ AB cdot CD = AC cdot BD ] Substituting the distances: [ sqrt{2} cdot 1 = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} cdot sqrt{(x+2)^2 + (y+1)^2} ] Squaring both sides: [ 2 = (x^2 + y^2) cdot ((x+2)^2 + (y+1)^2) ] 5. **Simplify the equation:** Expanding and simplifying: [ 2 = (x^2 + y^2) cdot (x^2 + 4x + 4 + y^2 + 2y + 1) ] [ 2 = (x^2 + y^2) cdot (x^2 + y^2 + 4x + 2y + 5) ] 6. **Solve the Pell's equation:** The equation simplifies to a form of Pell's equation. Solving this Pell's equation, we find the smallest solutions for ( (x, y) ) are ( (5, 2) ) and ( (34, 14) ). 7. **Calculate the radii:** Using the smallest solutions: [ r_1 = sqrt{(5-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} = sqrt{25 + 4} = sqrt{29} ] [ r_2 = sqrt{(34-0)^2 + (14-0)^2} = sqrt{1156 + 196} = sqrt{1352} ] 8. **Compute ( r_1^2 + r_2^2 ):** [ r_1^2 = 29 ] [ r_2^2 = 1352 ] [ r_1^2 + r_2^2 = 29 + 1352 = 1381 ] The final answer is (boxed{1381})"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},W={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],L={key:0},z={key:1};function R(n,e,h,u,o,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",W,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
