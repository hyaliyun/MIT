Georgette Heyer (; 16 August 1902 - 4 July 1974) was an English historical romance and detective fiction novelist. Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story for her younger brother into the novel The Black Moth. Heyer was born in Wimbledon, London, in 1902. She was named after her father, George Heyer. Her mother, Sylvia Watkins, studied both cello and piano and was one of the top three students in her class at the Royal College of Music. Heyer's paternal grandfather had emigrated from Russia, while her maternal grandparents owned tugboats on the River Thames.  Heyer was the eldest of three children; her brothers George Boris (known as Boris) and Frank were four and nine years younger than her. For part of her childhood, the family lived in Paris but they returned to England shortly after World War I broke out in 1914. Although the family's surname had been pronounced \\"higher\\", the advent of war led her father to switch to the pronunciation \\"hair\\" so they would not be mistaken for Germans. During the war, her father served as a requisitions officer for the British Army in France. After the war ended he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). He left the army in 1920 with the rank of captain, taught at King's College London and sometimes wrote for The Granta.  George Heyer strongly encouraged his children to read and never forbade any book. Georgette read widely and often met with her friends Joanna Cannan and Carola Oman to discuss books. Heyer and Oman later shared their works-in-progress with each other and offered criticism.  When she was 17, Heyer began a serial story to amuse her brother Boris, who suffered from a form of haemophilia and was often weak. Her father enjoyed listening to her story and asked her to prepare it for publication. His agent found a publisher for her book, and The Black Moth, about the adventures of a young man who took responsibility for his brother's card-cheating, was released in 1921. According to her biographer Jane Aiken Hodge, the novel contained many of the elements that would become standard for Heyer's novels, the \\"saturnine male lead, the marriage in danger, the extravagant wife, and the group of idle, entertaining young men\\". The following year one of her contemporary short stories, \\"A Proposal to Cicely\\", was published in Happy Magazine. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: did she achieve success at an early age?","output":"Yes, Georgette Heyer achieved success at an early age. This is evident from the quote: \\"When she was 17, Heyer began a serial story to amuse her brother Boris...

Given the question: Information:  - Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia (German: ), is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations.  - The Kings Park Stadium (also known as Growthpoint Kings Park for sponsorship reasons and also commercially promoted as The Shark Tank), is a stadium in the Kings Park Sporting Precinct in Durban, South Africa. The stadium was originally built with a capacity of 12,000 and opened in 1958, extensively renovated in the 1980s and then again in time for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. It currently has a capacity of 52,000 and is the home ground of the Sharks. The stadium has also been used by Durban-based Premier Soccer League football (soccer) clubs, as well as for large football finals.  - The Rugby World Cup is a men's rugby union tournament contested every four years between the top international teams. The tournament was first held in 1987, when the tournament was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia. New Zealand are the current champions, having defeated Australia in the final of the 2015 tournament in England.  - The Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) (also known by its French name Confédération Africaine d'Athlétisme) is the continental association for the sport of athletics in Africa. It is headquartered in Senegal. It organises the African Championships in Athletics and other continental competitions. The body's president is Hamad Kalkaba Malboum of Cameroon.  - Kings Park Sporting Precinct is a site located in Stamford Hill, Durban, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. It was developed primarily to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, but will also form part of the city's long term plan to host the Summer Olympics. The precinct regularly hosts domestic and international rugby union and association football events, as well as national and international swimming galas.   - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Although it does not border Namibia, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River separates it from that country. The capital and largest city is Harare. A country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used.  - The 1995 Rugby World Cup was the third Rugby World Cup.

Write a title for this article: But behind the competition on the court, there is a new collaboration in the economy. The mayors of the teams’ cities — Jim Gray in Lexington and Greg Fischer in Louisville — are using their positions to persuade their cities, long at odds, to cooperate. The effort came from a conversation the mayors had at a basketball game shortly after they were elected in 2010: How do you compete in an age of adapt-or-die economics, when China and India are far bigger threats than the neighboring county? The answer, they say, is to join forces and become a kind of super-region that will draw talented people from around the world and will be able to hold its own in a competitive global marketplace. It is a particularly urgent task now for local leaders, when the federal government is mired in political deadlock and state governments are broke. “We need to collaborate domestically to compete globally,” said Amy Liu, co-director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, which is helping to guide the effort in Kentucky. “U.S. cities are competing against rapidly rising markets in Asia, South America and parts of Eastern Europe. They cannot afford to compete against each other.” Successful economies are increasingly regional, Ms. Liu said. They grow by clustering around universities, companies and skilled people who invent things. The mayors want to start that sprouting process in the Lexington-Louisville region. They want to create a new brain hub (think Silicon Valley in California and the Research Triangle in North Carolina) whose focus would be inventing and making things in high-tech manufacturing plants. “Lexington and Louisville had always been fighting, but we’ve got to get beyond that,” Mr. Fischer said in an interview. “The way to get more pie is to make more pie, not to fight over the slice that’s in front of us.” Mr. Fischer, 54, and Mr. Gray, 58, come from backgrounds that seem to have prepared them for the challenge. Both are businessmen from families of F.D.R. Democrats. Both grew family businesses beyond the borders of the United States — Mr. Fischer by inventing an ice and beverage dispenser and Mr. Gray by building specialty factories for foreign manufacturers in the United States. President Obama has emphasized high-tech manufacturing as a potential engine for growth in the economy, but some economists argue that the focus is misplaced. Manufacturing has been shrinking as a share of the economy for years, and the economists say that is something best done in cheaper labor markets. “Even if we do manage to do great things in terms of high-tech manufacturing, that’s unlikely to lead to high levels of jobs for Americans in the middle of skill distribution,” said Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard and the author of “Triumph of the City.” “That’s the enormous challenge that we face in this country.” The aim may be ambitious, the mayors say, but it is not such a stretch, considering the large ecosystem of production that is already here — Toyota’s North American headquarters, Raytheon, two Ford plants and a General Electric manufacturing plant. The cities are roughly 80 miles apart, and the region, around 20 northern Kentucky counties, produces nearly half of the total economic output of the state’s 120 counties. Still, the region has lagged in research and development and has a long way to go before becoming a hub of innovation, which is at the heart of the most successful American cities, said Kenneth Troske, a professor of economics at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. The key is education, Professor Troske said, an area in which the state has lagged badly. These northern metro areas, with their big universities, have high levels of education, but they are islands in a state that ranks 47th in terms of share of adults with a college degree. This is important because the work force will come from the rest of the state. “In education, we’re flat and at the bottom,” he said. “That has to be front and center moving forward, whatever industry we want to attract. We have to have a large majority of our kids getting some kind of post-secondary degree.” The mayors acknowledge that and say it will take a concerted effort by local government, business leaders, universities and civic organizations to accomplish it. That is what the project, which they call the Bluegrass Economic Advancement Movement, is designed to do. “Government is a good convener,” Mr. Fischer said. “It can bring people together and let the market solve the problem.” Mr. Gray points to Germany as a model, where college students work on factory floors as well as study at technical colleges in a deliberate state policy to develop a skilled work force. Such collaboration already exists between Toyota and a local community college here, Mr. Gray said, but it needs to expand to smaller companies. “This is so much more meaningful than just recruiting the next Toyota,” Mr. Gray said. “Toyota is the holy grail, and we’ve got it. It’s how you leverage it.” The project is still in early stages. Researchers are analyzing the region’s economy and making a master map of its features. But Mr. Gray said the economy is ripe for change. Argonne, the Energy Department laboratory that contributed technology to the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, is opening a battery research and development center in Lexington this year in a partnership with the two universities. “Anyone who waits for the phone to ring and someone to bring them a bunch of jobs, well that model doesn’t work anymore,” Mr. Gray said.

Is the human mind the brain? Do those questions have the same meaning? Possible answers:  * no;  * yes;","output":"To address these questions, let's break down each one and analyze them step by step. 1. What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain? Step 1: Understand the question - This question is based on the assumption that we only use a certain percentage of our brain capacity and are wondering about the potential consequences of utilizing our brains to the fullest. Step 2: Analyze the assumption - The assumption is a common myth; humans actually use nearly 100% of their brain in a typical day. However, not all areas are active simultaneously. Different tasks and cognitive functions activate different regions. Step 3: Answer the question - Since we already use nearly 100% of our brain, there wouldn't be any significant changes or special abilities acquired if we could use all of it. However, if the question is referring to the simultaneous activation of all brain regions, this could potentially lead to information overload and an inability to function efficiently. 2. Is the human mind the brain? Step 1: Understand the question - This question asks if the human mind is equivalent to the brain. Step 2: Define terms - The brain is the physical organ responsible for our thoughts, emotions, and cognitive functions. The mind refers to the mental processes, consciousness, and personal experiences which result from the brain's activity. Step 3: Answer the question - The human mind is a product of the brain, but they are not the same thing. The brain is the physical structure, while the mind is the result of its complex network of neurons and processes. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Step 1: Compare the questions - The first question is about the potential consequences of using 100% of our brain, while the second question is about whether the human mind is the same as the brain. Step 2: Analyze their meanings - The first question deals with brain capacity and functionality, whereas the second question deals with the relationship between the brain and the mind. Step 3: Answer the question - No, these two questions do not have the same meaning because they address different aspects of human cognition and brain function. In conclusion, the answer is 'no'; these questions do not have the same meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

For instance, we would need additional details about the proximity and interaction between the gentleman in the blue scarf and the blond girl. Are they holding hands, talking, or merely walking near each other? Furthermore, it is crucial to consider the man in the black suit and his relationship to the other two individuals. Is he walking with them or merely coincidentally nearby? Since the premise does not provide adequate information to determine the validity of the hypothesis, the correct answer is that it is not possible to tell. More context and detail about the relationship between the individuals and their actions are required to conclusively support or refute the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Facts:   - appointer: bill clinton    - predecessor: ruth bader ginsburg    - office: judge the district of columbia circuit of the united states court of appeals for      - term start: october 7 , 1994    - birth date: 16 march 1942    - name: david s. tatel    - birth place: washington , d.c. , u.s.    - alma mater: university of michigan , ann arbor university of chicago   Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of david s. tatel .

Working as a successful singer, model, and actress, we still can't believe that she's related to the man who coined \\"Achy Breaky Heart.\\" ||||| There's a newcomer to Maxim's Hot 100 list for 2013, but she's no stranger to headlines: Manti Te'o's fake girlfriend.      Coming in at number 69 — and beating out celebrities such as Jessica Chastain, Emma Roberts and Zooey Deschanel — Maxim has named the football star's imaginary girlfriend to its coveted list of hottest women of the year. Former Disney star Miley Cyrus took the number one spot.      The bio says it all: \\"After Manti Te'o's fake girlfriend hoax of 2012, we think it might be nice to have an invisible girl of our own to love. Why not? She's got a ton of great qualities, including looking awesome in a bikini.\\"      Maxim included a photo of a bikini, worn of course by the invisible lady, against a scenic tropical backdrop to further the point.      The news comes several months after the Notre Dame football star — who has since been drafted by the San Diego Chargers — was caught up in a scandal involving the existence (or rather, nonexistence) of his girlfriend, Lennay Kekua.      Te'o said he met Kekua online and began dating long-distance until she developed leukemia and died in a car accident. The story pulled at the heartstrings of the nation as he gave emotional interviews about their relationship and his loss. When it surfaced in January that a male acquaintance had impersonated Keukua and she was never real, it became the center of headlines.      For the full list of Maxim's Hot 100, click here.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Think about first meeting your spouse, your first date, when you got engaged, your wedding, and when your children were born, if you have any. Try to remember how you felt during these pivotal moments. Remind yourself that you and your partner have shared many wonderful moments, and there's a reason you've invested so much in each other. It's tough to rebuild a connection after years of monotony, stress, arguments, and everything else that comes with a marriage. Reminding yourself of your relationship's high points can help you focus on what you love about your spouse. The little things in life make a bigger impact than grand gestures, so show each other kindness every day. Pay each other compliments, write each other notes or emails, and do other small, random acts that show you care. For example, you could slip a note into their bag before they leave for work that says, “Have a fantastic day! I love you.” You could let them know how nice they look, or do a chore they haven't gotten a chance to do. Try to schedule a date night every week, or as often as you can. To alleviate boredom, do something new and exciting each time. You could try out a new restaurant or cuisine, go to a concert, go hiking, or explore a new part of your city. You could also go on day trips or weekend getaways. If you have kids, ask your parents, in-laws, or a babysitter to watch them so you can spend quality time with your spouse. Tell your spouse you want to be open and honest with each other about your needs, wants, and desires. Let them know that they can trust you, and that they can share anything without fear of judgment.  Say, “I'd like us to be honest about what we need from each other. I want to fulfill your emotional and physical needs, and we both need to let each other know how to be the best partner.” It's scary to make yourself vulnerable and say, “I need you to tell me that you love me and find me attractive,” or “I want to try something new in the bedroom.” Having the courage to make yourselves vulnerable might be exactly what you both need to deepen your bond. It can be tough to rebuild a physical bond, so take it slow. Begin holding hands, hugging, and cuddling more often. As you grow more comfortable being physically intimate, work on touching each other, kissing and, eventually, having sex more often. Check in with your spouse to make sure they're comfortable. You might say, “Do you mind if I hold your hand?” while watching a movie, or ask if they want a back rub after a long day.","output":"When you're married, sometimes things can become dull and you might feel less connected to your spouse. To remember why you love your spouse, think about the special times you've had together, like your first date or wedding. Be kind by doing little things like giving compliments or writing nice notes. Plan fun dates or trips together and ask for help watching your kids so you can spend time with your spouse. Talking openly about what you both need can help you both feel closer and trust each other more. It's important to be honest even if it's scary. To feel closer physically, start with simple things like holding hands or hugging. As you get more comfortable, you can try more touching and kissing. Always make sure your spouse is okay with what you're doing by asking them. This will help you both feel happier and more connected in your marriage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Double jeopardy is a procedural defence that prevents an accused person from being tried again on the same (or similar) charges and on the same facts, following a valid acquittal or conviction. As described by the U.S. Supreme Court in its unanimous decision one of its earliest cases dealing with double jeopardy, \`\`the prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy; and the accused, whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy at the first trial.''","output":"Yes, based on the text provided, it is true that there is such a thing as double jeopardy. Double jeopardy is a legal concept and procedural defense that aims to protect individuals from being tried twice for the same crime, based on the same charges and facts. It is a fundamental principle embedded in the legal systems of many countries, including the United States. The doctrine of double jeopardy ensures the finality of decisions made within the criminal justice system and provides an important safeguard against the potential abuse of state power. It prevents the state from using multiple trials to wear down and exhaust a defendant's resources, or unduly enhancing its chances of securing a conviction. In the United States, the protection against double jeopardy is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which states that no person shall \\"be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\\" This means that once a person is tried and either acquitted or convicted of a specific crime, they cannot be tried again for the same crime, based on the same facts. The U.S. Supreme Court's unanimous decision in one of its earliest cases dealing with the issue of double jeopardy illuminates the essence of this legal protection. The Court emphasizes that the prohibition is not against being punished twice but against being put in jeopardy twice. Therefore, the concept of double jeopardy is applicable even if the accused is acquitted at the first trial. The Court's statement highlights the importance of safeguarding individual rights and ensuring fair treatment within the legal system. However, it is important to note that there are exceptions and nuances to the double jeopardy rule. For instance, double jeopardy protections may not apply when a person faces separate charges in different jurisdictions or when they are accused of committing other crimes arising from the same facts as the original crime. Furthermore, double jeopardy may not apply in cases where the initial trial was declared a mistrial, if there was a successful appeal on points of law, or when new evidence emerges that significantly changes the case against the defendant. In conclusion, the concept of double jeopardy is a valuable legal protection that aims to ensure fair treatment of individuals within the criminal justice system and prevent potential misuse of state power. It is deeply rooted in the legal systems of many countries, with the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment providing a clear example of its enshrinement in law. However, it is essential to be aware of the exceptions and limitations to this rule, as the application of double jeopardy principles may vary depending on the specific circumstances of a case."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Given the following context:  On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter.  Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class. Pru makes an impassioned plea for all the good things that England represents, but when she wakes up the next morning, Clive has gone, leaving her a letter of goodbye.  answer the following question:  What is the alias of the person the butler privately expresses his support for?

The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound, and with Brian as composer, arranger, producer, and de facto leader, often incorporated classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. Recorded in the wake of California Music's demise, a supergroup that would have involved Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and record producer Terry Melcher, 15 Big Ones (1976) marked Brian's return as a major force in the group. The album included new songs by Brian, as well as cover versions of oldies such as \\"Rock and Roll Music\\", \\"Blueberry Hill\\", and \\"In the Still of the Night\\". \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" peaked at No. 5 in the U.S. Brian and Love's \\"It's O.K.\\" was in the vein of their early sixties style, and was a moderate hit. The album was publicized by an August 1976 NBC-TV special, simply titled The Beach Boys. The special, produced by Saturday Night Live (SNL) creator Lorne Michaels, featured appearances by SNL cast members John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd.  The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release. During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound. Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted, \\"[Undoubtedly] the new album is nothing too deep\\", but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's \\"Good Vibrations\\".  For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album The Beach Boys Love You (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian later called Love You one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, saying that \\"That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies.\\" Jardine credited Carl and Dennis with having \\"the most to do with that album ... [they were] paying tribute to their brother.\\" Love You peaked at No. 28 in the UK and No. 53 in the US and developed a cult following; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike, and an early work of synthpop.  Referring to \\"naysayers\\" of the album, the underground fanzine Scram wrote, \\"Fuck [them] ... [the album showcases] a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliche, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.\\" The A.V. Club - considering the album in \\"the same vein\\" as Tonight's the Night (1975), Pussy Cats (1974), The Madcap Laughs (1970), and Barrett (1970) - described Love You as: \\"something almost desperately optimistic ... Wilson sings frayed songs about roller-skating, road-tripping, and Johnny Carson - like a frazzled man sitting in a corner chanting 'calm blue ocean' over and over. It's a beautiful, noisy, funny, heartbreaking work of art - one not for everybody, yet vital for anyone who wants to understand Wilson's overall worldview.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What were the other singles?","output":"The other singles mentioned in the article are \\"Rock and Roll Music,\\" which peaked at No. 5 in the U.S., and \\"It's O.K.,\\" which was a moderate hit and written by Brian and Love."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: On a hot summer's day Jonathan and his classmates were anxiously sitting in their classroom, waiting for the final bell of the day to sound. Jonathan prayed that the bell would ring soon, because he wanted to quickly run home before the three huge, fat, smelly bullies   could see him. Every day the three bullies would wait there for an innocent school kid to tease and bully. The moment the bell sounded, Jonathan rushed out with his bag. He sped off across the school field and out onto the walkway. However, all of his effort was useless because leaning on a fence were the three bullies. Jonathan thought about crossing the street next to him, but it would be too risky. So he hid behind a small bush in hope that the three would leave. But he moved too quickly and was seen by one of the bullies. They approached him then. One bully grabbed Jonathan by the collar of his shirt and grabbed the money out of Jonathan's pocket and put it into his own. \\"G-Give it back\\", Jonathan weakly said. \\"G-G-Give it b-back\\", mocked   the bully. The other two bullies laughed. Beside them was a small dirty stream. \\"Let's throw him in there\\", said one of the bullies. Then they threw Jonathan into the stream and walked off down the walkway. Jonathan shakily picked himself up out of the creek and continued his walk home with his head down and tears in his eyes. He dared not cry because he knew boys didn't cry. Jonathan arrived at his house where his mother was waiting outside the front door with an angry look on her face. \\"Why are you so late and dirty?\\" she asked curiously. \\"I slipped\\", he quietly replied.

Quinn enjoys running a few miles every morning, which demonstrates a dedication to regular exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Running is an effective way to stay in good physical condition and has numerous benefits for the body, such as improving cardiovascular health, building strength, and enhancing endurance. Additionally, running provides mental health benefits as well, such as reducing stress and boosting mood. Furthermore, when the weather is good, Quinn swims laps in the pool, adding another form of physical activity to their routine. Swimming is an excellent full-body workout that engages multiple muscle groups at once. It is low-impact, which makes it a suitable form of exercise for people of all ages and fitness levels. Swimming also offers cardiovascular benefits and improves flexibility, balance, and coordination. By engaging in two different forms of physical activity – running and swimming – Quinn displays a commitment to staying active and healthy. They likely possess a high level of energy and vitality, which allows them to maintain an active lifestyle and enjoy various outdoor and physical activities. In summary, Quinn is best described as an active person always on the move due to their dedication to regular exercise, engagement in multiple forms of physical activities, and commitment to maintaining a healthy lifestyle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A couple who routinely drugged their toddler daughter so they could 'catch up on their sleep' have been given suspended prison sentences. The drug addict mother, 41, and father, 40, regularly gave their two-year-old daughter the liquid paracetamol Medised - intended for children more than twice her age - for a year and a half so she was less likely to wake in the night and disturb their sleep, a court heard. Gloucester Crown Court was told the little girl also sometimes had the sedative Diazepam - used to treat severe anxiety and agitation. The parents admitted cruelty after drugging their toddler with Medised so they could catch up on their sleep. The girl had to be fed through a. nasal tube when she was born due to problems caused by her mother's use. of Diazepam and the heroin substitute methadone while she was pregnant,. the court heard. Instead. of weaning their daughter off the tube, the couple, from Nailsworth in. Gloucestershire, continued to use it routinely because it was easier for. them, prosecutor Kannan Siva said. They. went on to give her Medised on a nightly basis between the ages of two. and a three and a half so they could sleep, he added. The. little girl was taken into the care of an aunt in June 2011 after her. 'plainly selfish' parents, who met in rehab, told a social worker what. they had been doing. Judge. Jamie Tabor QC criticised the couple for their 'remarkably stupid' actions, and told them he would have jailed them were it not for the. fact it would deprive their daughter of weekly supervised visits from. her parents. The parents, whose identities cannot be revealed, walked free from court after being handed suspended sentences. Their offences were not malicious but. they were quite plainly selfish to spare themselves the tribulations of. parenthood, the judge said. 'Every. parent of a young child will have undergone sleepless nights because the. child is unsettled for one reason or another. You chose to adminster. Medised, which was not intended for a child that age, and you chose to. keep very quiet about it,' he said. 'I. see before me a wholly inadequate man who was rather struggling with. this child and a mother who was more concerned with herself than her. child,' the judge added. Both parents admitted being cruel to. their daughter between September 2009 and June 2011 by routinely. administering Medised - a liquid medicine typically prescribed to. children between the ages of six and 12 to relieve cold and flu. symptoms, fevers or headaches. Her mother admitted a similar charge. involving her daughter taking Diazepam, but denied that she had given it. to her daughter deliberately. 'Plainly selfish': The mother, 41, and father, 40, were given suspended sentences at Gloucester Crown Court. The couple's denial of a charge of administering methadone to their daughter was accepted by the prosecution. They had faced another charge of cruelty by using a feeding tube on the child, which was not proceeded with. Judge Jamie Tabor QC. The. woman was sentenced to 18 months suspended for a period of two years,. while the man was given a 12 month sentence suspended for the same. period. Both were placed under a curfew between the hours of 8pm and 6am for a period of six months. The. court heard the couple's daughter was eating normally within a month of. being taken into care and had grown into a 'bright little button'. Her parents have supervised access to their daughter at weekends. It might send the little girl 'off the rails' if she were to be deprived of the visits, the judge said. Her. aunt said in a recent statement: 'She is a much loved, beautiful and. bright little girl, surrounded by the people who love her deeply,. especially her mum and dad.' Giles Nelson, representing the girl's mother, said the couple met when they were both in rehab in 2001. 'I am afraid they went badly wrong as parents,' he said. Martin Steen, representing her father, said: 'He thought that by giving Medised he was relieving her [his daughter] and relieving himself. He now recognises he was wrong and is ashamed. He loves his daughter dearly.' Judge Tabor told the couple that with their own drug addiction histories they should have known better and what they had done was 'most remarkably stupid'. He said the mother had show no real effort to address her own addictions and was still taking the highest prescription of methadone he had ever seen. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Roethlisberger, though, has his work cut out for him.

Options: - grill - go to market - bring home fish - eat hamburger - make bread  Explain why a human would choose \\"bring home fish\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"bring home fish\\" as the answer because living near the coast provides easy access to an abundant source of fresh seafood, particularly fish. Fishing can be a sustainable and cost-effective choice for satisfying hunger when living close to the ocean. Here's a detailed explanation of the other options and why they are less relevant in this case: - Grill: While grilling is a popular cooking method, it doesn't address the nutritional requirement of relieving hunger or obtaining food. It is only a means of cooking food you already possess. - Go to market: Going to the market involves purchasing food items, which could include fish, but it doesn't specifically address the coastal advantage of having direct access to a source of fresh fish. Additionally, going to the market requires time and monetary expenses, while fishing near the coast can be a more economical and sustainable option. - Eat hamburger: Although eating a hamburger can relieve hunger, it does not take advantage of living near the coast. Hamburger meat is typically land-based and does not make use of readily available marine resources. - Make bread: Bread can satisfy hunger and provide energy, but it does not key in on the coastal access to fresh seafood, specifically fish. Bread is a land-based food that doesn't fully utilize the advantages of living near the ocean. In conclusion, by choosing \\"bring home fish,\\" a human can leverage their proximity to the coast to access fresh seafood, which is sustainable and readily available in the area, and subsequently relieve their hunger using the natural resources surrounding them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a 0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump.

Paul LePage said Friday he did not call LePage a racist, as the governor claims.      \\"I've never received a voicemail like that before,\\" Democratic State Rep. Drew Gattine told CNN's Jim Scuitto on \\"OutFront.\\" \\"Every time you think he's crossed a line -- you think he can't go any further -- but then he draws a different line, and he crosses it.\\"      LePage left a message goading Gattine to \\"prove that I'm a racist\\" after a series of controversial comments once again put the governor in the news, according to the Portland Press Herald, which also was the first to obtain audio of the voicemail. The uncensored audio message, also shared with CNN, contains several explicit phrases.      The bombastic Republican governor is known for his loose style, which sometimes draws criticism. He is a strong supporter of Donald Trump, and Trump's campaign recently hired his daughter to work on the race in Maine.      Earlier this week, LePage had doubled down on comments he has made in the past about the racial background of drug dealers in his state, saying that \\"90-plus percent ... are black and Hispanic people.\\"      According to the Press Herald, Gattine was identified by local media as having called LePage racist, though Gattine denies doing so.      \\"I'm not a name-caller. I'm not going to play that game with the governor,\\" Gattine told Sciutto. \\"Calling somebody a racist is one of the worst things you can ever call somebody. And it's not something that I've ever called anybody.\\"      LePage, however, was adamant in the recording.      \\"Mr. Gattine, this is Gov. Paul Richard LePage,\\" the audio recording says. \\"I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you (obscene term). I want to talk to you. I want you to prove that I'm a racist. I've spent my life helping black people and you little (obscene term), socialist (obscene term). You -- I need you to -- just friggin'. I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you.\\"      LePage apologized for the voicemail in a statement on Friday, but justified his reaction saying the label of racist is \\"the absolute worst, most vile thing you can call a person.\\"      \\"I didn't know Drew Gattine from a hole in the wall until yesterday,\\" LePage said. \\"It made me enormously angry when a TV reporter asked me for my reaction about Gattine calling me a racist. ... So I called Gattine and used the worst word I could think of. I apologize for that to the people of Maine, but I make no apology for trying to end the drug epidemic that is ravaging our state.\\"      Gattine told CNN he had not heard from LePage since.      Challenges Gattine to a duel      On Thursday, the governor took credit for leaving the voicemail in a later interview at his home with local media, and said he would like to challenge Gattine to a duel.      \\"When a snot-nosed little guy from Westbrook calls me a racist, now I'd like him to come up here because, tell you right now, I wish it were 1825,\\" LePage said, according to the Press Herald. \\"And we would have a duel, that's how angry I am, and I would not put my gun in the air, I guarantee you, I would not be (Alexander) Hamilton. I would point it right between his eyes, because he is a snot-nosed little runt and he has not done a damn thing since he's been in this Legislature to help move the state forward.\\"      Friday, LePage walked back that rhetoric, saying he was purely making a historical reference.      \\"Obviously, it is illegal today; it was simply a metaphor and I meant no physical harm to Gattine,\\" LePage said.      Maine Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett called LePage's remarks a \\"threat.\\"      \\"Gov. LePage's direct threat against Rep. Gattine is both erratic and disturbing, and he is clearly unfit to lead our state,\\" Bartlett said in a statement. \\"Not only did the governor blatantly say he would take violent action against a sitting lawmaker, he also twice invoked a homophobic slur to drive home his point. Those reckless remarks may incite others to violence. ... Paul LePage is an increasingly menacing figure who does not reflect the values of our state.\\" ||||| Gov. Paul LePage left a state lawmaker from Westbrook an expletive-laden phone message Thursday in which he accused the legislator of calling him a racist, encouraged him to make the message public and said, “I’m after you.”      LePage sent the message Thursday morning after a television reporter appeared to suggest that Democratic Rep. Drew Gattine was among several people who had called the governor a racist, which Gattine later denied. The exchange followed remarks the governor made in North Berwick on Wednesday night about the racial makeup of suspects arrested on drug trafficking charges in Maine.      “Mr. Gattine, this is Gov. Paul Richard LePage,” a recording of the governor’s phone message says. “I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you (expletive). I want to talk to you. I want you to prove that I’m a racist. I’ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist (expletive). You … I need you to, just friggin. I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you.”      Gov. LePage’s message to Rep. Drew Gattine. Warning: This audio contains obscenities.      LePage later invited a Portland Press Herald reporter and a two-person television crew from WMTW to the Blaine House, where during a 30-minute interview the governor described his anger with Gattine and others, told them he had left the phone message and said he wished he and the lawmaker could engage in an armed duel to settle the matter.      “When a snot-nosed little guy from Westbrook calls me a racist, now I’d like him to come up here because, tell you right now, I wish it were 1825,” LePage said. “And we would have a duel, that’s how angry I am, and I would not put my gun in the air, I guarantee you, I would not be (Alexander) Hamilton. I would point it right between his eyes, because he is a snot-nosed little runt and he has not done a damn thing since he’s been in this Legislature to help move the state forward.”      Gattine is the House chair of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, which has opposed some of LePage’s welfare, drug enforcement and other reforms. He said the governor’s phone message was uncalled for.      “Obviously that message is upsetting, inappropriate and uncalled for,” Gattine said Thursday night. “It’s hard to believe it’s from the governor of the state of Maine, but again, we need to stay focused on the drug problem we are facing here in Maine and cannot allow this story to be about the governor’s inappropriate and vulgar behaviors.”      REPORTER’S QUESTION ENRAGES GOVERNOR      LePage left the message after a television reporter asked the governor what he would say to people who are calling him a racist. LePage asked who had called him that and the reporter said he had talked to Gattine, but didn’t say Gattine had called the governor a racist.      LePage then reacted, told the reporters “you make me so sick,” and stormed off.      He later called the same reporters to the Blaine House for an interview, told them he had called Gattine and said he hoped the lawmaker would make the governor’s phone message public. The Press Herald made a Freedom of Access Act request for the phone message, and Gattine provided a copy to the Press Herald around 8:50 p.m.      Gattine has been a longstanding critic of many of LePage’s proposals to reform the state’s welfare system and has blocked efforts by Mary Mayhew, commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services, to change eligibility requirements for a variety of programs that help individuals and families with developmental disabilities. Gattine is running for re-election in House District 34, which includes the city of Westbrook. He is unopposed.      Gattine said Thursday that he never called LePage a racist.      “What I said to the television reporter today is that the kind of racially charged comments the governor made are not at all helpful in solving what the real problem is,” Gattine said. “And that is, we have a crisis in the state of Maine of people overdosing on heroin and prescription drugs and we are not doing enough with respect to treatment and prevention.”      GATTINE: MORE EMPHASIS ON TREATMENT      Gattine said he essentially agrees with LePage that drug traffickers must be stopped from coming into the state.      “The law enforcement piece is incredibly important,” Gattine said. “And I don’t really care what the color is of the people that are importing drugs into this state. I think law enforcement needs to be in a position where it can do its job, but in an area where we are really failing is not funding treatment and prevention as much as we should be.”      Gattine noted that a record number of people, 272, died of drug overdoses in Maine last year and the state is on pace to break that record this year.      “And this administration continues to pursue policies that make treatment less available … and I think that’s a huge part of the problem,” Gattine said.      Over the years, Gattine and LePage have butted heads on several issues.      Gattine was among the Democratic lawmakers who earlier this year sparred with LePage over how to manage patients sent by the courts to the state’s Riverview Psychiatric Center. LePage threatened to stop accepting federal money unless the Legislature could figure out how to manage patients. Gattine replied, saying, “It shouldn’t be this hard. If the department (of Health and Human Services) is serious about this, they should be able to answer these questions.”      A HISTORY OF DISAGREEMENTS      After the federal government accused Maine in 2015 of processing food stamp applications slower than any other state, Gattine said the federal warning – the government said Maine’s “chronically poor performance” doesn’t meet federal standards – ripped the state, claiming it was part of a pattern in which the LePage administration repeatedly failed to adhere to federal guidelines. Gattine said people were not getting the services they need.      In a March 2015 guest column published by the Press Herald, Gattine slammed the LePage administration for proposed cuts to seniors’ health care. Gattine said the cuts would force elderly Mainers to choose between paying medical bills and buying groceries.      “It’s infuriating that people who contributed so much to Maine have to show up in Augusta to beg their government not to cut the health care benefits that they have worked on for their entire lives,” he said in the column.      LePage also has criticized Gattine and other lawmakers for opposing a measure that would have made possession of small amounts of heroin a felony. LePage has said the threat of a felony-level crime is necessary to force people to get into drug treatment programs.      “The primary lever for getting people into treatment shouldn’t be to get them into the criminal justice system,” Gattine said. “To me, if we let the problem get that far it’s just another sign of our failure.”      Share      < Previous      Next >      filed under: ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Maine Governor Paul LePage faces heavy criticism after leaving an expletive-laden voicemail for State Representative Drew Gattine, a Democrat, whom LePage believed had accused him of being a racist.

Gattine denies calling LePage a racist, and LePage has since apologized for his voicemail, defending himself by stating that he's \\"spent his life helping black people.\\" To exacerbate the issue, LePage also challenged Gattine to a duel, but has since clarified that this was simply a metaphor and not a call to violent action."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: \\"Louis was sent a book.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"Louis was sent a book\\" as acceptable linguistically, as it adheres to the general rules and principles of the English language. From a grammatical standpoint, this sentence is an example of a passive construction, which is commonly used in English to draw attention to the recipient of an action rather than the doer of the action. To further analyze the sentence, let us break down its linguistic components: 1. Subject: \\"Louis\\" - The subject of the sentence is the individual, Louis, who is also the recipient in the passive construction. Since subjects are often the focus of a sentence, using this construction emphasizes that Louis is the focus, rather than the book. 2. Predicate: \\"was sent a book\\" - The predicate provides information about the subject. In this context, the predicate consists of the auxiliary verb \\"was,\\" the main verb in passive form \\"sent,\\" and the object \\"a book.\\" The passive construction indicates that an action has been done to or for the subject, without specifying who performed the action. 3. Verb tense: The past passive form of the verb \\"to send\\" suggests that this action took place in the past. The sentence does not specify the exact timing, which would depend on the context in which it is used. 4. Object: \\"a book\\" - The object is the item being sent to Louis. It is an indefinite, countable noun, which is appropriately used with the indefinite article \\"a.\\" 5. Word order: English conventionally follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, and this sentence adheres to that pattern. \\"Louis\\" is mentioned first, followed by the passive verb construction \\"was sent,\\" and finally the object \\"a book,\\" informing readers about how these elements are related. While this sentence is acceptable linguistically, it could be further examined by considering the pragmatics and stylistic aspects of its use. The passive voice may not always be the most effective choice, depending on the intended audience, context, or purpose of the communication. For example, using the active voice construction, \\"Someone sent Louis a book,\\" may be more suitable under some circumstances, allowing for enhanced clarity and a stronger emphasis on action. Yet, overall, the sentence \\"Louis was sent a book\\" conforms to English grammar, syntax, and conventions, which should satisfy most linguists' evaluation of its acceptability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unbeknownst to her, this newfound obsession drives her to uncover dark family secrets and helps her learn the true meaning of self-expression, love, and forgiveness. Plot: Kat, a reserved and introverted English major at a prestigious university, struggles to find her place among her more outgoing peers. Her life changes when she is assigned a project to write and recite an original poem for her poetry class. Reluctantly, Kat throws herself into the world of spoken word poetry. As Kat searches for inspiration, she comes across an old forgotten box of her late mother's journals in her family's attic. Her mother, an English professor, had passed away when Kat was just a child, leaving unanswered questions and a void in her heart. Kat becomes captivated by her mother's eloquent words and finds solace in reading her poetry. Determined to present a powerful poem, Kat decides to use her mother's writings as inspiration, combining their words to create a heartfelt narrative. Kat is initially nervous to share her work with the class, but when she recites her poem, she surprises everyone, including herself, with her raw talent and undeniable presence. Kat's poetry gains recognition and admiration from students and professors. Among her burgeoning admirers is a kind and charismatic slam poetry enthusiast named Alex, who shows genuine interest in Kat's work and encourages her to join a local spoken word group called \\"Ember of Hope.\\" As Kat's confidence grows, she starts to unveil long-hidden family secrets in her mother's poetry. These secrets involve a troubled past, a strained marriage, and the subsequent affairs her mother divulged in her writings. Kat's father, an austere and reticent man, tries to prevent her from unearthing these truths and pleads with her to abandon her pursuit of poetry.  Torn between resentment, anger, and the need for understanding, Kat struggles with the gravity of her mother's past and her newfound love for the art of poetry. As she continues to immerse herself in poetry, she becomes closer to Alex and starts developing romantic feelings for him. This newfound love affair motivates Kat to confront her family's troubled past and find a way to heal their damaged relationships. In the climax, Kat takes the stage at a major spoken word competition and delivers a powerful and personal poem that reflects her journey of self-discovery, forgiveness, and love. This performance touches the heart of everyone in the audience, including her father, who later apologizes to Kat for not being as supportive as he should have been. The film concludes with a heartwarming scene of Kat and her father reading her mother's poems together, finally finding peace and understanding after many years of bottled-up emotions. As Kat continues to flourish in the world of spoken word poetry, she realizes that the assignment that seemingly forced her to read a poem was, in fact, a serendipitous guide to finding her voice, her purpose, and healing her family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With Tomas Rosicky rolling back the years against Brighton on Saturday to help Arsenal to a 3-2 win in the FA Cup fourth round, there has been no shortage of plaudits for the Czech midfielder. Certainly, the 34-year-old has proven himself to be one of Arsene Wenger's most successful signings since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2006. We asked JustArsenal blogger Bob Allock to give us the rundown on how Rosicky has won over so many fans' hearts and etched himself into Gunners' folklore. Tomas Rosicky is proving his worth to the Arsenal cause and deserves a contract extension at the club The way that Rosicky plays the game, with superb technical ability and the drive and attacking intent to go with it, is what we want to see from the","output":"Arsenal midfielders. In an era when the Premier League is known for its physicality and high-tempo play, the Czech international has shown he can stand his ground and more. Throughout his time at the Emirates, Rosicky has faced numerous injury setbacks, but his resilience and determination to come back stronger have endeared him to the fans. He has become a symbol of commitment and passion for the club, something that has been lacking in recent years. His leadership on the field is another attribute that sets him apart from his teammates. Rosicky has donned the captain's armband on multiple occasions and has consistently been a mentor to the younger players at the club. His experience and football intelligence have been instrumental in helping the likes of Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere develop into top talents. Though he may have played fewer games than some of his peers due to injuries, Rosicky's quality was always evident when on the pitch. With a penchant for scoring spectacular goals and crucial match-winners, the playmaker has provided a much-needed creative spark in the Arsenal midfield. As the 2014-15 season comes to an end and Rosicky's contract is set to expire, there is a growing sentiment among fans that the club should reward him with a new deal. Given his recent performances, it's clear that he still has plenty to offer, and his experience and leadership would be invaluable as Arsenal look to build on their success and challenge for major honours in the coming years. In concluding, the calls for a contract extension for Tomas Rosicky are entirely justified, and Arsenal would be wise to secure the services of their veteran midfielder for at least another season. His unwavering commitment to the team, combined with his raw talent and unique style of play, make him the perfect embodiment of the values and ideals that have come to define the club under Arsene Wenger's tenure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Whether or not Usain Bolt did get caught out criticising these Commonwealth Games - the reporter insists, the athlete vehemently denies - the subsequent headlines were another indication that life for the Jamaican sprinter is not like that for any other athlete.\\"","output":"Title: Usain Bolt: More than an Athlete; Uncovering the High-stakes Journey of a Sports Icon Introduction An individual who continues to live in the global sports spotlight, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt revels in fame and success. Yet, with this status comes the relentless scrutiny from media and the public alike. A recent incident where Usain Bolt allegedly criticized the Commonwealth Games has fuelled a new round of headlines, proving that life for the iconic athlete is anything but ordinary. In this article, we explore the exceptional journey of Bolt and the unrelenting pressure that comes with being in the public eye. 1. A Unique Athlete: Origins and Accomplishments In order to understand the extraordinary life of Bolt, one must initially examine his remarkable career. Hailing from Jamaica, Bolt rose through the ranks and established himself as the fastest man on the planet. With numerous world and Olympic records under his belt, he is internationally renowned as a powerhouse in the world of athletics. His phenomenal achievements both on and off the track have certainly set him apart from his contemporaries. 2. The Price of Fame: Media Exposure and Public Scrutiny With great success comes great responsibility – and in Bolt's case, that includes dealing with constant media exposure and public scrutiny. As seen in the Commonwealth Games incident, whether Bolt criticized the event or not, his every move soon becomes international news. This unyielding focus on his actions generates immense pressure on Bolt and illustrates the unique challenges he faces. After all, he is not only upholding his sporting triumphs but also managing the heavy weight of public expectation. 3. A Question of Balance: Bolt's Lifestyle and Personal Choices Like any other person, Bolt must maintain a balance between his professional and personal life. However, as a superstar athlete, this can be extremely difficult to achieve. He must constantly navigate both the temptations and responsibilities that fame brings, all while focusing on his training and performance. As the media dissects every aspect of his life, Bolt's personal choices are under significant scrutiny, making it difficult for him to truly escape the prying eye of the public. 4. The Role of Social Media: Amplifying the Pressure  In today's age of social media, the presence and influence of online platforms further compound the pressure on Usain Bolt. With millions of followers across various platforms, Bolt's every word and action has the potential to spark global debate. As a result, something as simple as a tweet could escalate into a public relations nightmare if not carefully managed. Consequently, what might seem like a minor miscommunication or controversy could quickly spiral out of control. Conclusion In sum, it is apparent that Usain Bolt's life is a far cry from that of an ordinary athlete. As the fastest man in the world, Bolt not only enjoys incredible success but also endures immense pressure from the media, fans, and the public. From scrutinizing his every move to magnifying social media activity, the unique challenges that Bolt faces are a testament to the undeniable impact that fame and success can have on an individual's life. The recent controversy surrounding the Commonwealth Games merely highlights the delicate balance Bolt must maintain in order to excel at being an exceptional athlete, while preserving the essential aspects of his humanity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.

Summarize the following: While this article gives you good general instructions for melting brass, there are many factors to consider when setting up a furnace. Seek advice online or from foundry workers to find a furnace setup suitable for your budget, the volume of metal you plan to melt, and all types of metal you might want to use it for. Popular metalworking forums online include IForgeIron. The hobbyists and professionals there should be able to advise you. Melting brass requires a great deal of preparation, and a special furnace that can heat the brass rapidly before too much of the component metals oxidize. Purchase a metal melting furnace that can reach 2,000ºF (1,100ºC), constructed from a refractory material that can withstand this heat. Most brass will melt at temperatures as low as 1,650ºF (900ºC), but a higher maximum temperature will give you a margin of error, and make the brass easier to pour.  Select a furnace large enough to hold the crucible and brass you intend to melt. Consider the fuel you will be using. Waste oil is a free fuel source, but the furnace may be more expensive. Propane furnaces are cleaner, but require you to keep purchasing more fuel. Solid fuel furnaces may be cheapest to purchase, or make yourself, but require significant fuel expense and cleanup if used frequently. You may already have brass items ready for melting, but if you want more raw material, thrift stores and yard sales are often treasure troves. Failing that, you can try contacting local scrap yards. Remove the brass from other materials, especially non-metallic objects such as glass, plastic, paper, and cloth. . Wash the brass with soapy water to remove surface contaminants such as oils and excess oxidation prior to performing the melt. If the brass is lacquered, remove the lacquer with acetone, lacquer thinner, or paint stripper. Always wear gloves and work in a ventilated area while removing lacquer, especially if using paint stripper. A crucible holds the molten metal while it is in the furnace.  For brass alloys, a graphite crucible may be the best option owing to its durability and ability to be heated quickly. Crucibles made from other materials are available, but make sure they can withstand the high temperature required.  Before using a new graphite crucible, heat it to 200ºF (95ºC) for 20 minutes and let cool. This removes excess moisture that can cause spattering.  Each crucible should only be used for one alloy. If you also plan to melt aluminum, iron, or other metals, they will each need their own crucible. You'll need tongs, a skimming spoon, and a pouring shank to handle the metal. Steel tongs are used to grip the crucible and place it in or out of the furnace. A steel skimming spoon is used to remove dross from the surface of the metal before pouring. Finally, a pouring shank is needed to hold the crucible in place and allow you to tilt it for pouring.  If you are able to weld, you may fabricate these tools yourself from scrap. Optionally, purchase a pyrometer for measuring high temperatures, to make it easier to determine when the brass is ready to pour. An outdoor area is almost a necessity for melting brass, as the creation of toxic fumes is almost impossible to avoid.  An open garage or similar structure may be a good option. Even when melting other metals, make sure your furnace has sufficient ventilation. Furnaces require a great deal of air, and may produce carbon dioxide and other gases, depending on the fuel source. Even apparently dry materials, especially concrete, can contain trapped moisture. If a drop of molten metal comes into contact with moisture, the liquid will transform into steam and rapidly expand, spraying the molten metal with force. To avoid this scenario, place a box of dry sand near the furnace, and always carry and pour molten metal above this sand. The easiest way to handle molten brass is to pour it into metal ingot molds.  Casting the brass into more complex shapes takes considerably more preparation. Look up information on sand casting or foam inclusion casting if you are interested in casting machine parts or artwork. Find expert supervision for these processes if possible, as success rate can be low for beginners. Summary:","output":"This is about melting brass safely and properly. You need a special furnace that can heat up really high, and you need to find the right one for your needs. It's important to clean the brass first and get all the tools you need, like a special container for the melted metal called a crucible. Melting brass should be done outside or in a well-ventilated area to avoid breathing in harmful fumes. You also need to be careful with hot, melted brass and always pour it over sand to avoid accidents. People can make simple or complex shapes with the melted brass, but it's a good idea to get help from experienced people if you want to do that."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A Chilean college security guard has been arrested in the murder of an American graduate and ordered held in jail, an appeals court unanimously ruled on Wednesday. Erica Faith Hagan, 22, from Kentucky, had been in the southern Chilean city of Temuco on an exchange program after graduating from Georgetown College. She was working as a teaching assistant in English and religious education at the Colegio Bautista school, where her lifeless body was found in her dormitory bathtub on September 6. In custody: Domingo Cofre, 44 (left), a former security guard at the Colegio Bautista in Chile, has been arrested in connection to the murder of US graduate Erica Faith Hagan (right) Clues: DNA evidence linked Cofre to the crime scene, where the 22-year-old American psychology graduate was found bludgeoned to death with a metal rod September 6. A week later, investigators in Chile arrested 44-year-old Domingo Cofre, a former night watchman for the Colegio Bautista, in connection to the slaying. On Wednesday, Judge Alejandro Vera ordered Cofre to remain in custody for the duration of the investigation, which is expected to take three months. Local media reported that the 22-year-old teaching assistant had apparently suffered multiple blows to her head with an iron poker. The Chilean news website Soychile.cl reported that DNA evidence found on the metal rod linked Cofre to the crime scene. Prosecutor Cristian Paredes has told El Tiempo that the injuries had ‘slashing-crushing’ elements. According to the site Emol.com, Cofre allegedly hit Hagan at least three times and then tried to start a fire in her apartment in an apparent attempt to cover up the crime. When police searched Cofre's home September 12, they reportedly found a blood-stained shoe. The footwear has been sent to a lab for testing to determine if the blood belonged to Hagan. The parents of the 22-year-old psychology graduate  traveled to the city of Temuco earlier this month to transport their daughter's body back to the United States. Erica Faith Hagan was found with three head wounds in the bathtub of her apartment on the campus of Colegio Bautista of Temuco September 6. Parents' worst nightmare: Bambi and Chris Hagan are pictured in Chile, where they arrived this week to transport their daughter's body back to the US. She was working as an English teacher at a secondary school in Temuco, located 450 miles south of the capital of Santiago. On Tuesday, local authorities announced that they are investigating three potential suspects in connection to Hagan's slaying. They have not been named. Roberto Garrido, a spokesperson for the Public Ministry of Chile, told the press the investigation into the killing has revealed that Ms Hagan likely knew the killer or killers and opened the door for them because officers found no signs of forced entry in her apartment, reported Soy Chile. Hagan's wounds were said to have been caused by a blunt object. AFP reported there were traces of a fire at the unit. Two separate online fundraisers have been set up to help Erica's parents with her final expenses, including the cost of transporting her remains back to the US. Well-educated: Hagan, 22, graduated from Georgetown College in Kentucky earlier this year. Bright future: Hagan obtained a degree in psychology with a minor in Spanish. A friend of Erica Hagan’s has launched a GoFundMe account hoping to collect 100,000, which would go toward a memorial scholarship to 'help carry on her legacy.’ Erica's older sister, Kimberly, also set up a fundraiser Monday, which has since reached - and surpassed - its goal of collecting 5,000 towards the 22-year-old's funeral expenses. ‘Its [sic] very obvious she was loved by many, she will be greatly missed and never forgotten,’ the bereaved Ms Underhill wrote. Kimberly Underhill also revealed that an FBI agent has been sent to Chile to help with the investigation into her sister’s murder. Miss Hagan graduated from Georgetown College in Kentucky earlier this year with a degree in psychology and a minor in Spanish. In July, she traveled to Chile after accepting a six-month job as a teaching assistant in English. She had visited Chile previously and was scheduled to return home in December. 'This was a phenomenal, well-loved young lady that deserved better,' said Hagan's aunt, Charlene Martin. Do-gooder: Hagan went to Chile (pictured) in July to work as a teaching assistant in English for six months. She was found with three head wounds in the bathtub of her apartment on the campus of Colegio Bautista of Temuco (pictured) on Saturday morning. Killed by friends? Officials in Chile revealed that Hagan likely knew her killers because her apartment showed no signs of a forced entry. Erica had been documenting her experiences of living and working abroad in her blog 'Donde en el Mundo?' (Where in the world?) Her last entry went up September 5, just two days before her violent death. In her lengthy post, Hagan discussed some instances of culture shock she had experienced in her encounters with the locals. Along with anecdotes about cultural differences between Chileans and Americans, Hagan gushed about the friendliness of the local people. 'God has blessed me with many people that care how I spend my time and don't want me to be lonely while I'm here,' she wrote. 'Everyday I meet more people that invite me to be social with them and I love it! The hardest part is for me to take them up on it by asking them to keep me company during my free time. 'Ironic I know, but I still have that southern upbringing that taught me that it's rude to invite yourself to places. In due time I guess...' Temuco is one of the country's largest cities and located near the southern boarder. A memorial service will be held this week at Georgetown College. Hagan was set to return home in December and continue her education by entering a graduate school.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: After you have inserted the elastic all the way through the fabric, you will need to sew the fabric and the ends of the elastic together to close the pieces. This will allow the elastic to gather the shoulder and dress pieces at the top of your dress. Sew the fabric and the ends of the elastic piece together leaving a ½” seam allowance. Make sure to sew the fabric on the wrong side so that when you turn the pieces inside out, the seam allowance will be hidden. After you have closed up the back of the shoulder and dress pieces, you will need to hem the bottom of the pieces. Fold and pin along the bottom edges of the shoulder and dress pieces to create a ½” seam. Next, line up the back seams of your shoulder piece and dress piece and pin the pieces together at the elastic in the front and back. When you are happy with the positioning of the pieces, stitch a line down the front and back of the elastic at the very center of the front and back to secure the pieces together. You can simply stitch up and down the width of the elastic pieces two or three times to ensure that they are secured.  Use a thread color that will blend in well with your fabric. This will help to ensure that the stitching is not as noticeable. Make sure that there is an even amount of shoulder piece fabric on either side of the dress piece. Otherwise, your dress may end up looking lopsided. Make sure to sew through both layers of the elastic and fabric. After you have sewn the shoulder piece and the dress piece together, your dress is ready to wear! Try on your new dress and see how it looks.

Instead, a good answer would be: Before the WC-130H aircraft were converted for transport missions, they were primarily used for weather reconnaissance by the United States Air Force (USAF). The WC-130H, a variant of the C-130 Hercules aircraft, was originally developed to conduct weather observation, measurement, and data collection missions. The USAF's 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, also known as the \\"Hurricane Hunters,\\" used the WC-130H aircraft to fly directly into hurricanes, tropical storms, and other severe weather systems to collect essential data, including wind speed, temperature, humidity, and pressure. This information helped meteorologists accurately forecast the development and movement of these storms, ultimately aiding in the protection of life and property.

Some children reach eagerly for the treat they see. Some last a few minutes before they give in. But others are determined to wait until the last moment. By the time the children reach high school, something remarkable has happened. A survey found that those who as four-year-olds had enough self-control to hold out generally grew up to be more popular, adventurous, confident and dependable. The children who gave in to temptation  early were more likely to be lonely, easily frustrated and inflexible . Actually, the ability to delay reward is a sign of emotional intelligence which doesn't show up on an IQ test. The hardware of the brain and the software of the mind have long been scientists' concerns. But brain theory can't explain what we wonder about most, like the question why some people remain _ in the face of troubles that would sink a less resistant soul. Here comes the theory of Daniel Goleman, writer of Emotional Intelligence: when it comes to predicting people's success, brain ability measured by IQ may actually matter less than the qualities of mind once thought of as \\"character\\". EQ is not the opposite of IQ. What researchers have been trying to understand is how they work together; how one's ability to handle stress, for instance, affects the ability to concentrate and put intelligence to use.

The mother of Eric Garner, the Staten island resident who was killed by an officer who put the man in a chokehold after he grew agitated over being stopped for allegedly selling cigarettes on the street, has praised the protesters gathering across the city in her son's honor after a grand jury decided not to indict the officer responsible for his death. 'It is just so awesome to see how the crowds are out there,' said  Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, who added that she herself even ended up stuck in her car after protests shut down traffic. 'I was just so proud of that crowd. It just warmed my heart.' Scroll down for videos. Hope from tragedy: The mother of Eric Garner, Gwen Carr (left), and his widow, Esaw Garner (right), have both revealed how 'proud' they are of those protesting the death of Garner. Celeb support: At a march in Los Angeles on Sunday, Tyrese Gibson (above) came out to lead the protesters. Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, echoed that sentiment, saying she told her son when she saw protesters from their window, 'Look at all the love that your father's getting.' And these protests show no signs of dying down, this as model and actor Tyrese Gibson led a march in Los Angeles on Saturday in memory of both Garner and Michael Brown. Demonstrators around the country have staged die-ins and other protests since the Garner grand jury's decision Wednesday, which closely followed the Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict a white officer in the fatal shooting of Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old. Garner's family members joined the Rev. Al Sharpton later Saturday as Sharpton laid a wreath at the site on Staten Island where Garner died July 17 in a confrontation that started when police tried to arrest him for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. An amateur video seen by millions showed Garner gasping, 'I can't breathe' during the fatal encounter. Difficult decision: These protests began on Wednesday across the country after a grand jury decided not to indict the police officer whose chokehold killed Garner. Keeps going: It has been four days since the grand jury decision, and the protests show no signs of slowing down. 'All we're concerned about is justice from the police,' said Garner's stepfather, Benjamin Carr, who wore a T-shirt with the words, 'Enough is enough.' Protests continued in New York City for a fourth day with several dozen people lying down on the floor of Grand Central Terminal. There were no reports of arrests. On Friday night, 20 protesters were arrested on disorderly conduct charges in New York, police said. Hundreds of demonstrators marched and many briefly laid down in Macy's flagship store, Grand Central and an Apple store. They streamed along Fifth Avenue sidewalks and other parts of Manhattan, with signs and chants of 'Black lives matter' and 'I can't breathe.' Big name support: Al Sharpton and Spike Lee were at a news conference days after a Grand Jury decided not to indict the officer involved in Garner's death. In Oakland, California, hundreds of protesters briefly blocked Interstate 880, a major freeway, on Friday night. There were no immediate reports of any arrests or injuries.

To better understand the comparison, let’s break down the two sentences. 1. \\"A motocross rider gassing his bike\\": - This sentence specifically mentions a \\"motocross rider,\\" which implies the person participating in the sport of motocross or participating in an off-road motorcycle race. - The term \\"gassing\\" in this context refers to the act of putting fuel (usually gasoline) into the vehicle, in this case, \\"his bike.\\" - The \\"bike,\\" in this context, refers to a motocross motorcycle, which is designed for off-road racing and often differs from standard street motorcycles in terms of suspension, power, and overall build. 2. \\"A person is fueling up a vehicle\\": - The subject \\"a person\\" is neutral and does not specify any particular profession or activity. In a broad sense, a motocross rider is indeed a person. - The term \\"fueling up\\" means putting fuel into a vehicle, which is the same action as \\"gassing\\" in the first sentence. - The term \\"vehicle\\" is far more generic than \\"bike\\" from the first sentence. It may include cars, trucks, motorcycles, or any other transport that requires fuel to operate. However, a motocross motorcycle does fall under the category of vehicles. Based on the analysis, the second sentence can be interpreted as a true sentence in relation to the first. Both sentences discuss a person putting fuel into a vehicle, but the first sentence is more specific in defining the type of person and the type of vehicle involved. While the second sentence is more general in its description, it retains the core idea of someone putting fuel into a vehicle, which supports its truthfulness compared to the original sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Does NOT look anything like this color! Review: This color is actually more grey in color & I was dissapointed. I couldn't use it & had to go out & actually test colors before I found one that matched perfectly Answer:","output":"Based on the customer review provided, it is evident that the customer was dissatisfied with the product purchased. The dissatisfaction stems from several factors that we can glean from the review: 1. False advertising/Color discrepancy: The customer's primary dissatisfaction comes from the fact that the color of the product they received does not match the color portrayed in the product's advertising material. The review title explicitly states that the customer feels the color he received \\"does NOT look anything like this color.\\" This suggests that the customer was misled, further contributing to their dissatisfaction. 2. Time and effort wasted: The customer had to go out and \\"actually test colors\\" before finding one that matched perfectly. This process added considerable effort and inconvenience, which might have been avoided had the original product matched the description. Consequently, the customer's dissatisfaction is heightened due to the time and energy they had to expend in search of a suitable alternative. 3. Practical limitations: The customer could not use the product they received as it did not meet their expectations, need, or intended purpose. This adds to their feelings of dissatisfaction as they were not able to utilize the product for which they paid, rendering it a wasted investment. Overall, it can be concluded that the customer was dissatisfied with the product due to the unexpected color discrepancy, the time and effort spent searching for an appropriate alternative, and the inability to use the item they initially purchased."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: People have many different emotions during the day we also call these this? Options:  A. brains  B. feelings  C. brown hair  D. drug problem  E. radio Answer:","output":"Option B. Feelings During the course of a day, people can experience a wide range of emotions. These emotions encompass various states of mind, reactions to events, and internal sensations that can influence our thoughts, decision-making, and interactions with others. In the context of the options provided, the term \\"feelings\\" is the most appropriate to describe these different emotions experienced throughout the day. Feelings, also commonly known as emotions, are responses to certain stimuli that can influence our behavior and perception of the world around us. They play a significant role in our mental well-being, and can range from happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, to more nuanced emotions such as jealousy, compassion, pride, and embarrassment. Option A, brains, refers to the organ that is responsible for cognitive functions and serves as the control center for the body. While the brain does play a role in processing emotions through its limbic system, it is not the most accurate term to describe the emotions themselves. Option C, brown hair, pertains to a physical characteristic and is unrelated to the emotional experiences of people throughout the day. Option D, drug problem, indicates an issue related to substance abuse and is not applicable in this context since it does not encompass the full range of emotions experienced by people on any given day. Option E, radio, refers to a communication device or system that uses electromagnetic waves to send and receive information.

The introduction of ocean tides getting water on the rocks adds an external factor to the weathering process. While water from ocean tides is not directly mentioned in the given process, it still has an effect on weathering by influencing the water's availability to seep into the rocks, which is the first step in the process. When ocean tides bring water to the rocks, they can either increase the water supply, leading to more weathering, or temporarily reduce it, allowing the rocks to dry out and slow down the weathering process. By influencing the amount of water available to seep into the rocks, the ocean tides indirectly impact the rate of weathering. This effect can cause variations in the speed and extent of weathering, ultimately making it less consistent or slower in some cases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.  Question: \\"What kind of ruler was King Jaume 1?\\" Response: \\"King Jaume 1 was a Moor\\" Possible answers:  - no  - yes Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No The response does not correctly answer the question. King Jaume I was not a Moor but an enlightened ruler who ruled Aragón and Catalunya. He conquered the island of Mallorca from the Moors and profited from the talents of various communities, including the Moors, Jews, and Genoese traders."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Several studies suggest those in their teens and 20s will be the first generation since World War II to be worse off than their parents. The inquiry will look at whether this is a result of government policy or broader economic trends. The House of Commons Work and Pensions select committee of MPs said those born in the middle of the baby boom (between 1956 and 1961) had been forecast to receive 118% of the amount they contributed to the welfare state in taxes and national insurance contributions. The Committee's chairman Frank Field MP said voters currently had two priorities for welfare reform: was it fair, and was it affordable. \\"Politicians of successive governments have ducked both of these fundamental questions when it comes to the different levels of income afforded to those above and others below retirement age,\\" he said. \\"Is it fair and affordable to divert a large and growing sum of public expenditure toward pensioners - regardless of their circumstances - while mainly poor families with children face year-on-year restrictions on their income? Can the \\"triple lock\\" pension increase pledge be sustainable? Or are these policies necessary to guard against pensioner poverty? \\"The select committee hopes to learn from voters of all ages what they believe to be both fair and affordable, so we can propose ways of restoring confidence across all generations in the welfare state.\\" The inquiry comes months after a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) concluded that young people are on track to be poorer than their parents at every stage of their lives. The study found that average working-age households actually grew richer during the financial crisis. But it said that the reason for the growth between 2006-12 was the increase in pension values over the period. \\"Despite the financial crisis, household wealth on average increased in real terms over the late 2000s, driven by increases in private pension entitlements,\\" Dave Innes, a research economist at the IFS said. \\"Even with these increases in average wealth, working-age households are at risk of being less wealthy at each age than those born a decade earlier.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"Some smart people called MPs want to find out if people from the older generation, called baby boomers, are better off than their children.

A special group of MPs will look at this more carefully and see if it's fair to use some of the money for retired people and how it affects others. They want to make sure the whole country can agree on a fair and affordable plan for everyone.

However, it doesn't provide detailed information on what pigs eat.  To provide a more comprehensive answer: Pigs are omnivorous animals, which means they can consume both plant and animal-based food. In the wild, pigs primarily rely on a diet of roots, leaves, fruits, nuts, and sometimes small animals or insects. They use their strong snouts to dig for underground food like roots or tubers. In a domestic setting, pigs are typically fed with a wide-range diet that includes pig feed (which could be grain-based or a combination of plant and animal-based ingredients), vegetables, fruits, and other food scraps. Some pig farmers also use a combination of commercial feeds with vitamins, minerals, and other supplements.

Unlike Victoria, who diligently studied and maintained a strong academic performance throughout college, Mary struggled to find the motivation and focus necessary to excel in her courses. This difference in study habits and academic drive placed Victoria in a more favorable position when it came to the competitive nature of medical school admissions. From the beginning of college, Victoria was determined to pursue a career in medicine. In order to achieve this goal, she understood the importance of hard work, commitment, and consistency in her academic endeavors. As a result, Victoria developed essential time-management and study skills that enabled her to excel in her pre-med courses. She took the time to connect with professors, engage in research activities, and participate in relevant extracurriculars, all of which bolstered her credentials and prepared her for the rigors of medical school. On the other hand, Mary did not possess a clear vision for her future, which made it difficult for her to commit to the hard work required for academic success. As a result, she often found herself struggling academically, with her grades reflecting her lack of focus. Mary frequently procrastinated, opposed to Victoria's disciplined approach. Although Mary showed interest in pursuing medicine, her inconsistent academic performance, lack of initiative in research, and minimal extracurricular involvement cast doubts on her readiness for the demanding nature of medical school. Despite having initial interest in medicine, Mary’s lack of studying and limited preparation inhibited her from developing a strong foundation in science and critical thinking skills. Victoria showed an unwavering commitment to academic excellence and possessed a deeper understanding of the subjects she studied. Consequently, Victoria's strong grades, extensive research experiences, and participation in extracurricular activities related to medicine showcased her dedication to the field and made her candidacy more compelling to medical school admission committees. In conclusion, getting into medical school was more likely for Victoria than Mary because Mary did not study hard in college. Victoria's determination and commitment to her academic success proved to be the key factor in separating their chances for medical school admissions. Victoria's robust background and achievements demonstrated her potential for success in medical school and ultimately the medical field itself, while Mary's poor academic performance and lack of preparation left her at a significant disadvantage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The question asks for the age of the twin towers when they were destroyed, not the duration of the cleanup and recovery process. To provide a more accurate response: The Twin Towers, also known as the World Trade Center (WTC), were completed and opened in 1973. The North Tower (WTC 1) was completed in December 1970, and the South Tower (WTC 2) was completed in July 1971. The complex was destroyed on September 11, 2001, during a terrorist attack. To determine the age of the Twin Towers when they were destroyed, we can calculate the time between the completion of the towers and the date of the attack: For the North Tower: - From December 1970 to December 2000: 30 years - From January 2001 to September 2001: 9 months Therefore, the North Tower was about 30 years and 9 months old when it was destroyed. For the South Tower: - From July 1971 to July 2001: 30 years - From August 2001 to September 2001: 2 months Thus, the South Tower was about 30 years and 2 months old when it was destroyed.

The show was created by British music executive Simon Fuller and was produced by FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment. American Idol rapidly gained widespread popularity and, over time, became one of the most successful television shows in U.S. history. The aim of the show was to discover the best undiscovered singing talent in the country. Contestants would audition in front of a panel of judges, including music industry experts like Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, and Randy Jackson who were part of the original judging panel. Those who successfully passed the auditions then competed against each other in a series of live performances, where they would be critiqued by the judges and voted on by the viewing audience. The series was indeed co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman during its first season, with Seacrest continuing as the sole host from the second season onwards. Over the years, American Idol has launched the careers of numerous music artists, including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, and Jennifer Hudson, who have all gone on to achieve considerable commercial success and accolades in the music industry. After 15 seasons, American Idol concluded its run on Fox with the series finale on April 7, 2016. However, the show was later revived on a different network, ABC, with the new version of the series premiering on March 11, 2018. The show has continued to showcase talented singers and inspire viewers across the nation, proving its lasting impact as a television staple."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

UPDATE 1-China issues guidance to bolster new Silk Road, regional development * Guidance would speed up approvals for construction projects * Banks encouraged to securitise assets to boost lending * New Silk Road aims to boost ties with central, south Asia (Adds details of guidance, background on Silk Road initiative) BEIJING, Aug 21 (Reuters) - China's government rolled out fresh guidance on Friday aimed at supporting its new Silk Road infrastructure initiative, along with regional development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area and the Yangtze River economic corridor that includes Shanghai. The government said it will speed up approvals for major construction projects and strengthen bank credit policies for investments in those regions, in policy guidance issued by the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the National Development and Reform Commission, the government's top planning agency. China is seeking to extend its influence and to support domestic industry through its \\"One Belt, One Road\\" initiative, which aims to create a modern Silk Road trade route across central, west and south Asia. The new policy will bolster demand in China's infrastructure sector as concern mounts over flagging economic growth. Activity in the factory sector shrank at its fastest pace in almost 6-1/2 years in August, a private survey showed on Friday. Projects under the plan include a network of railways, highways, oil and gas pipelines, power grids, Internet connections, and maritime and other infrastructure links extending as far as Greece, Russia and Oman, increasing China's connections with Europe and Africa. Banks will be encouraged to securitise assets and clear non-performing loans to increase lending to long-term development projects, Ye Yanfei, an inspector at the banking regulatory commission's policy research bureau, told reporters. Ten new local asset management companies would facilitate the process, he said. Projects targeted for support include environmental protection, forestry and water conservancy, and construction of central and western Chinese railways, the document said. China Development Bank Corp, the country's biggest policy lender for large infrastructure investments, is expected to boost lending to 2 trillion yuan (313 billion) this year, Lu Xin, deputy head of the bank's business development unit, told a news conference hosted by the banking regulator. President Xi Jinping said in March that he hoped China's annual trade with the countries in the new Silk Road initiative would surpass 2.5 trillion in a decade. Friday's guidance also outlined support for Xi's proposal to integrate the areas of Beijing, Hebei and Tianjin to help ease Hebei province's dependence on highly polluting heavy industries, a source of hazardous smog throughout the region. The three local administrations and their transportation networks would be more closely integrated, as the capital shifts industrial enterprises, factories and even government departments into neighbouring cities. The plan will also relocate heavy industries such as steel to China's east coast.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.  Two meteorologists study Earth's climate. Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress.  Which person observed that the climate becomes colder at high elevations? Answer:","output":"Jerry, the meteorologist who studies alpine climate, observed that the climate becomes colder at high elevations. This observation is consistent with his area of study, as alpine climate is characterized by its elevation-dependent temperature patterns and the fact that it is typically found in high mountainous terrain. Through his research, Jerry would have encountered the lapse rate of air, which describes the decrease in temperature experienced as one ascends in altitude. This is a significant factor in understanding and analyzing the alpine climate. On the other hand, James focuses on tropical climates, which are generally characterized by warm temperatures and high humidity levels near the Earth's equator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A woman jumping over a hurdle during a race.\\", does this mean that \\"a child was there\\"?","output":"The phrase \\"A woman jumping over a hurdle during a race\\" does not explicitly provide any information about the presence of a child. The focus of this statement is on the woman participating in a hurdle race, which is a track and field event involving running and jumping over obstacles at a high speed.  It is important to consider the context in which the statement is made, as details not directly mentioned in the statement may still be relevant to the overall situation. For example, if this phrase is described in a broader context of a school or community event, there may be a possibility that children are present, either as participants, spectators or volunteers. In such cases, one could infer that there may be a child at the event. However, the given phrase itself does not state or imply the presence of a child. Cases where a child could be present in relation to the statement include: 1. Spectators: As mentioned earlier, if the hurdle race is a part of a larger event open to the public, there could be children in the audience, watching the race and cheering for the participants. 2. Race Participants: In some cases, an event might include different age categories where children could also participate alongside adults, running in separate races. In that scenario, a child could be present at the event as a participant. 3. Event Staff or Volunteers: A child could also be at the event as part of the organizing team or as a volunteer, handling tasks such as distributing water or refreshments to the participants, setting up the hurdles, or even helping in timing and recording the race results. 4. Family members: It is also possible that a participant in the race, such as the woman jumping over the hurdle, may have brought her own child along to the event, potentially as a way of sharing her experience or allowing the child to learn more about the sport. Although these scenarios suggest possible ways in which a child could be present at the event, it is essential to note that the original phrase - \\"A woman jumping over a hurdle during a race\\" - does not specifically indicate or directly imply the presence of a child. To confirm if a child was indeed present during this particular situation, additional information or context would be required."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Inductive reasoning is the process of drawing general conclusions based on many pieces of evidence. This type of reasoning is the basis of the scientific method.   Q: What is the process of drawing general conclusions based on many pieces of evidence?   A: A:","output":"The process of drawing general conclusions based on many pieces of evidence is known as inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is a cognitive process that plays a crucial role in our ability to understand and interpret the world around us. It is a method of reasoning where specific observations, instances, or experiences are used to formulate broader generalizations that hold true for an entire category or group. Inductive reasoning is often contrasted with deductive reasoning, which is based on applying general principles to specific situations. While deductive reasoning moves from general principles to specific conclusions, inductive reasoning operates in the opposite direction, moving from specific observations to general conclusions. The process of inductive reasoning involves several steps, which can be described as follows: 1. Observation: The first step involves gathering information through observation, examination, or experimentation. This can be done in a structured or unstructured environment, relying on both quantitative and qualitative data. 2. Identification of patterns: After gathering evidence, the next step is to identify patterns or trends in the observed data. This identification can lead to the development of initial hypotheses or theories about the phenomenon being studied. 3. Development of a hypothesis: Once patterns have been identified, a hypothesis is formulated that seeks to explain the observed trends or relationships between variables. A hypothesis is an informed guess or proposition that can be tested empirically. 4. Testing the hypothesis: The hypothesis is then subjected to empirical testing, which involves collecting additional data or evidence to support or refute the proposed hypothesis. This is often done using research methods such as experiments, surveys, or case studies. 5. Revision and refinement: Based on the results of the empirical tests, the initial hypothesis may be revised or refined to better explain the observed patterns. This step may involve an iterative process of retesting and refining the hypothesis until a comprehensive and well-supported generalization is developed. 6. Generalization: The final step of inductive reasoning is to establish a general conclusion or principle that can be applied beyond the specific instances and observations originally considered. This generalization forms the basis for broader theories or principles in the given field of study. Inductive reasoning is the foundation for the scientific method, which is used by researchers and scientists to investigate a wide range of phenomena and develop new knowledge. By leveraging the power of inductive reasoning, researchers can draw meaningful conclusions from limited data sets and build theories that enhance our collective understanding of the world. However, it is important to note that inductive reasoning does not guarantee absolute certainty, as new evidence may challenge previously accepted generalizations. Therefore, it is essential to approach inductive reasoning with an open mind and a willingness to revise and adapt our understanding in light of new evidence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Determine the sentiment: The more I analyze this film, the worse it becomes. First of all, why a motivational speaker? That part was just stupid. I mean, why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker? Is Alexander Stone really that disorganized? First he can't decide what he wants to do to control the world, so he looks to the Bible for ideas. Many of these ideas, I might add, really have no reliability(For example, the part of the \\"The houses of Ishmael and Isaac shall scream out in terror\\" could have already happened. It could have been have been the synagogues burned during Krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in Baghdad or something.) And Gillen Lane's family! They had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water! I might add that since Casper van Dien/Gillen Lane is only in his twenties(or that's the impression that I had)and has a ten year child, he had his child during high school. Yeah, there goes TBN's family values. Also, why did this film have to be so damn propaganda-like? I'll repeat what an earlier reviewer said. The Indiana Jones flicks use Christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated. This film doesn't do that. The beginnig starts off well, with Michael Ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy's Omega Code. Then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of, the two prophets tell him \\"Tell your master that we are here!\\". Dominic(Ironsides) replies \\"He already knows\\" and points to a small surveillance camera. That part sent chills up my spine. Had only it gone on like that one scene I would have loved this film. I'll give Michael York credit: he does a fine job of acting out his character, as does Michael Ironsides. But the good guys are horrible. I've already went on about Lane's family . Now that I'm over the acting, I'll get on to plot. This is obviously a Baptist film, since our beloved Pope of the Vatican is portrayed as an oaf. The world domination plot I liked and found plausible and subtle, as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well-done. Also another diatribe against the Vatican, their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded, since Gillen explains to the Pope that it's not the end of the world, but the beginning of a new one Also, the Vatican (or Israelis)says their going to secede from the World Union aince they used the Omega Code to control the world. Whoever it was, they wouldn't just secede, they'd send over commandoes and kill them. This is the equivalent of America knowing about the KGB going to kill the President and simply saying \\"We're not going to talk to you any more!\\". Come on!

But one thing has stood out recently since I have gone there and that is, 2.95 appetizers in the bar until 6pm.  When you think something is 2.95, you probably think it is either a small portion, not good or both of these things.  Well it is neither of these things.  The appetizers are generous portions and great tasting with several selections to choose from.  I want to just make it easy and say to the waiter, I'll have one of each please.  I love a good cheeseburger and the Brio Bistecca Burger is definitely my favorite right now.  It comes on a tasty bun with mozzarella cheese and is served with well done potato chips...yum!  You don't even get messy eating it because they cut it into quarters for you.  The bruschetta is also easy to eat because you can just pick it up and bite it.  They have two different kinds on the happy hour menu.  Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta with fresh basil and a balsamic drizzle and Sliced Steak Brushetta with Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and Tuscan Italian dressing.  There is also a Margherita Flatbread that is prepared with Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil cooked in an authentic Italian wood-burning oven.  I don't eat calamari but my friends ordered the Calamari Fritto Misto which was fried to a crisp golden brown with peperoncini and they liked it.  This is probably just either half or less than half of what they offer for 2.95.  I still haven't tried either shrimp appetizers or the eggplant appetizer.  The Beef Carpaccio served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and fresh Parmesan cheese looks excellent as well.  Tuscan culinary creations are perfected at Brio.

Rose Bengal was first used in the early 1900s as a dye for food, textiles and cosmetics. But now it is proving to be a useful weapon in the fight against skin cancer. Television advertisements constantly warn of the dangers of overexposure to the fierce sun. Among them is the possibility of the disease melanoma , a type of skin cancer. More than 1,200 Australians die every year from the disease. Initial trials of a solution of Rose Bengal injected into some melanoma cells have had a 75 percent success rate in controlling the disease. Professor John Thompson, the director of the Melanoma Unit at the University of Sydney, says this organic dye could become a powerful cancer-fighting treatment. \\"We believe it works by getting into the tumor  cells and causing them to self-destruct. But the exact mechanism by which it works is not totally clear. It's not useful for people who have a primary melanoma.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write a summary based on this article: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is riding high this week. But politics is a fickle business, Americans have short memories, and every race is different.      On the latter point, as Sen. Marco Rubio (who was on top just a year ago) told CNN's Dana Bash, \\"I think we need to understand that some of these races don't apply to future races. Every race is different — it has a different set of factors — but I congratulate (Christie) on his win.\\"      Some will say this is a less-than-gracious congratulations. Maybe. But it's also true.      There is a danger in winning, inasmuch as it fosters hubris and often reinforces the wrong lessons. Ken Cuccinelli, for example, won a series of down-ballot elections despite being outspent and having a penchant for micro-managing. He always won — until he didn't.      When we win, we have a tendency to think it's because we did everything right. In this regard, winning a landslide election can be especially dangerous. Losers may have to re-evaluate things — but not winners. For this reason, winning can ironically reinforce bad habits and make a candidate less likely to engage in introspection, or even be open to constructive criticism.      It must feel good to believe you've finally cracked the code. But this is a trap. As Cuccinelli just learned, what works in a state Senate race may not work in a governor's race. And as Christie may soon learn, what works in a governor's race may not work on a presidential race (just ask Rick Perry).      For Christie right now, the champagne is still flowing, and laudatory notes and calls and columns are still coming in. So if you're Chris Christie, you probably think a couple things are true. You think that through the shear force of your personality, you can make people like you. And you probably believe that you can get away with being confrontational. You might even think this is a selling point.      You think this because — so far — it's held true. So far, Christie's confrontational style has mostly come across as refreshing. (Perhaps we secretly enjoy getting to yell at people vicariously through him?)      And in a primary contest where conservatives are looking for a fighter, this might actually help him. So many of us already conflate anger and passion with a conservative philosophy. Christie may also benefit from a style that is an obvious contrast to the cerebral and aloof Obama. On the other hand, as Jonathan Chait has noted, while attacking teachers or Obama might help in a primary, \\"It's another thing altogether if he gives this treatment to Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan, Scott Walker, or other fellow partisans.\\"      But let's just assume, for the sake of argument, that Christie makes it to the general election. Imagine a time after the press has turned on him (as they turned on John McCain and other Republican media darlings). What happens when MSNBC plays video of him yelling at someone for the millionth time, and after George Will or Charles Krauthammer writes the column about the danger of an angry man having his finger on the button? What happens when he tells a national political reporter that \\"it's none of your business\\"?      How will that play in Peoria — under the intense glare of a presidential campaign?      Not everyone thinks this is a problem. \\"Christie's confrontational personality can appeal to all sorts of electorates so long as he trains his anger in the right places,\\" writes Josh Barro, who believes the \\"right places\\" include New Jersey teachers, because \\"Christie's ire toward groups that demand ever-higher taxes and spending is popular with the electorate.\\"      But as Scott Galupo points out, other interest groups Christie might encounter on the presidential trail won't make for such easy marks:      Is Chris Christie going to yell at senior citizens about Medicare?      Is he going to yell at beneficiaries of food stamps?      Is he going to yell at families on Medicaid or CHIP?      Is he going to yell at farmers about agribusiness subsidies? [The American Conservative]      The problem isn't just that Christie's style won't always work on the presidential trail. It's that it might backfire ... horribly.      It's understandable why his advisors might not want him to tinker with his natural demeanor. And you can imagine the \\"let Christie be Christie\\" headlines that would surely emerge were he to tone down his style and fall flat. But conservatives who have seen the media turn on Republicans once they become a viable threat to a Democrat like Hillary Clinton worry his behavior will gradually go from being portrayed as \\"colorful\\" or charming to erratic and dangerous.      \\"If Christie yells at a teacher at a town hall in Iowa, that teacher is going to get a lot of time on television afterward — in a way that these people [who] get berated in New Jersey don't,\\" says my liberal sparring partner Bill Scher.      This is a good point. In recent years, we've seen \\"civilians\\" like Joe the Plumber and Sandra Fluke elevated to rock star status. One can easily imagine Christie telling some teacher in Davenport to 'Do your job!' But what happens when she goes on to become a cause célèbre? The media would then parade this \\"victim\\" around as an excuse to talk about Christie's \\"bullying\\" and Christie's \\"war on women.\\"      If I were Hillary, I would set a trap. Just send female supporters in to every Christie coffee, rally, or speech in New Hampshire or Iowa — and have them confront him on camera. What would he do? How long before he snaps at one of them?      You can watch Bill Scher and I discuss this on Bloggingheads below: ||||| All signs point to Gov. Chris Christie cruising to reelection in New Jersey tonight.      This is one of those times when personal bias is well nigh overwhelming: Christie—an authentic, half-Italian, New Jerseyan Bruce Springsteen uberfanatic, and a strong conservative by any reasonable standard—is about to rocket to the top tier of 2016 presidential contenders.      Judging by a spate of recent posts and on-the-ground reports, Business Insider’s Josh Barro is an unabashed fan of Christie as well. He even brushes aside the one serious reservation I have about the governor: his proclivity for in-your-face confrontations—in a word, “bullying”:      Christie’s confrontational personality can appeal to all sorts of electorates so long as he trains his anger in the right places. When Christie yelled at that teacher yesterday about how education spending levels will “never be enough” for New Jersey’s teachers’ unions, he was doing so in a state that spent 19,291 per pupil on K-12 education last year — more than any state except New York and Vermont and 74% more than the national average. … So long as Christie keeps training his anger in the right place, Christie will be O.K. What national liberal reporters don’t get is that “towards teachers” can be the right place, politically and substantively, to train that anger.      This is true as far as it goes.      Which I fear is not actually very far.      Back in 2010, I wrote this at U.S. News:      In the short term, the example of New Jersey’s Gov. Chris Christie is instructive. He has maintained popularity while aggressively pushing an agenda of fiscal austerity. How does he do it? Simple: In teachers unions and state-government employees, Christie has found a juicy, isolatable adversary. This works on the state level, where things like pensions and teacher benefits are significant sources of budget shortfalls—unlike on the national level, where middle-class entitlements are the big driver. The lesson is this: To the extent that “government” is a sectional entity—an interest group consisting of people who have not had to “sacrifice like the rest of us”—Republicans will find that cutting it is politically popular. To that extent that “government” is Grandma and Grandpa in Boca Raton, Republicans will need to tread carefully and—it’s possible to do both—honestly.      Zoom in on “juicy, isolatable adversary.”      At the presidential level, teachers aren’t going to cut it. Neither are employees of the federal government, whose salaries account for about 5 percent of total federal spending.      Is Chris Christie going to yell at senior citizens about Medicare?      Is he going to yell at beneficiaries of food stamps?      Is he going to yell at families on Medicaid or CHIP?      Is he going to yell at farmers about agribusiness subsidies?      If Christie is a wise and disciplined campaigner, I find it hard to believe he’d do any of those things. And given his recent disparagement of the GOP’s “libertarian strain” in the context of the debate over the national security state, I can’t see Christie getting up in the grill of a Pentagon contractor, either.      Teachers and public-sector employees who don’t want to pay as much for their healthcare as most of the rest of us do are the “right targets” when you’re arguing about state budgets. In fact, they are ridiculously easy targets. They are to Chris Christie what southern reactionaries are to Sacha Baron Cohen.      But I ask Josh: who are the analogously easy marks when you’re talking about the federal budget, and do you honestly think it will do Chris Christie any good to get in their faces? ||||| Summary:","output":"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's confrontational style has been perceived as refreshing, but it could be a double-edged sword as he moves towards a potential presidential run. While it may help him in a primary contest where conservatives are looking for a fighter, the media might turn on him once he becomes a viable threat to a Democrat like Hillary Clinton, changing the portrayal of his behavior from charming to erratic and dangerous. Christie's advisors may not want him to change his natural demeanor, but they should be cautious of the potential pitfalls of his approach, especially in engaging with different interest groups on the presidential trail."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who has thirty-seven individual panels attributed to him with confidence?

He found that dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. He labeled it as era A. Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B. John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history.  But I can use this background: Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's obligate anaerobes.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Era A represents the time when dinosaurs were flourishing, before their extinction around 66 million years ago. This implies a long period of evolutionary processes leading to the diversity and dominance of dinosaurs. 2. Era B represents the time period of a mass extinction event. These events, while devastating in their impact on biodiversity, are relatively brief in comparison to processes of evolution and species dominance. 3. The event that marks the transition from era A to era B is classified as a \\"mass extinction event\\". From the background provided, mass extinctions often represent accumulations of smaller extinction-events that occur in a brief period of time in comparison to periods of evolutionary development and diversity, like era A.  4. This comparable briefness is further supported by the fact that even the first known mass extinction event, the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago, is prescribed as an \\"event\\", suggesting a shorter duration relative to the long stretches of time between such events. Therefore, based on the idea that evolutionary processes take much longer than mass extinction events, era B would typically be shorter than era A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Oxford East MP Andrew Smith said the decision was a \\"massive boost\\" for the campaign to save the stadium. \\"I think the developers now really have got to face facts and listen to local people and allow the stadium to be used for recreation, get back greyhound racing, speedway and invest in what should be a first rate facility for our whole community,\\" he said. The track, which was also home to speedway, closed in December 2012 after the GRA said it was no longer viable. In January last year city council planners refused proposals from developer Galliard to demolish the stadium and build 220 homes on the site. The developer withdrew its appeal against the decision in May after the site was listed as a conservation area. Summary:","output":"The High Court has ruled in favor of Oxford City Council, upholding their decision to designate the Oxford Stadium site as a conservation area. The site's owners, Greyhound Racing Association (GRA), had challenged this decision, hoping to develop the site in Blackbird Leys for other purposes. However, the court found that the designation process was carried out correctly, meeting all statutory requirements. Oxford East MP Andrew Smith believes this decision supports the campaign to save the stadium and encourages developers to reallocate the stadium for recreation purposes.

Is \\"Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: 藏; pinyin: Zàng) although the geographical term Xīzàng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region.\\" the correct answer?","output":"No, the quoted statement does not directly answer the question about the origin of the term \\"Xizang.\\" This statement provides an insight into the definition of the term \\"Zang\\" and its application to Tibetan people, language, and culture, but it does not specify during which dynasty the term \\"Xizang\\" first came into use. The term \\"Xizang\\" was first used during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368). To provide a more detailed history and context, the Yuan Dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, who extended his Mongol Empire by successfully conquering the Song Dynasty in China. The Yuan Dynasty represents the first time in history when the whole of China was under foreign rule. During the early part of the Yuan Dynasty, Tibet was officially incorporated as a part of the empire. Prior to this, Tibet was not uniformly defined or had stable political boundaries. Rather, it was a diverse region consisting of several smaller kingdoms and principalities. In the 13th century, Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyeltsen, an important Tibetan religious leader, established a relationship with the Mongol court, which ultimately led to Tibetan submission under the rule of the Yuan Dynasty. With this development, Tibet became an important cultural and religious hub within the Yuan Empire. The term \\"Xizang\\" originated in this historical context, as the ruling Mongols and the Chinese administrative system sought to establish a clear identity for this newly incorporated territory. \\"Xizang\\" is comprised of two Chinese characters, \\"Xi\\" (Chinese: 西), which means \\"west,\\" and \\"Zang\\" (Chinese: 藏), which is associated with the Tibetan people, their language, and their culture. The combined term Xizang was thus a geographic description of the region within the Yuan Empire, referring to the \\"western part of the Tibetan area.\\" In conclusion, the term \\"Xizang\\" was first used during the Yuan Dynasty when Tibet was officially incorporated into its empire. It was a geographical expression referring to the territory inhabited by Tibetan people, language, and culture in the western part of the Yuan realm."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given inputs k, i, and A, where k and i are integers and A is a list.

Summarize: It is the first industrial action of its kind in the offshore oil and gas industry in almost 30 years. But how do you actually conduct a strike on a North Sea oil platform? Those union members involved on the seven Shell platforms will go to designated areas - but will respond should there be an emergency situation. There will not be the traditional high-profile picket lines that people associate with strikes on land. In February, Wood Group announced it was cutting rates paid to about a third of its UK contractor workforce. It blamed the \\"continuing cost and efficiency challenges affecting the UK North Sea oil and gas sector\\". The unions claim workers could suffer a cut to their pay and allowances of up to 30% - but that has been dismissed by Wood Group. Workers are also disgruntled that a two-week working cycle has been changed to a three-week cycle. leaving many away from their families for a longer time. An overtime ban came into effect on Monday ahead of the planned Tuesday strike. It was expected to go ahead as there were no fresh talks on Monday. RMT regional organiser Jake Molloy told the BBC Scotland news website: \\"Striking on an offshore installation is a unique exercise which has no comparison with any other industrial sector. \\"There's no collective grouping in the form of mass meetings, no 'march through the gates' or establishing a picket line, and there's no place and little point to waving flags or displaying placards - as there's nobody there to see them. \\"Instead of turning out to work at 6:30 tomorrow morning workers will turn out to gather in an assigned area on the platform, probably a games room, cinema or meeting room. \\"This room and any other assigned will be their area for the duration of their work period, 12 hours, after which they can return to their cabins. \\"I expect they will have organised activities to get them through the day as they know it is a long day when you're not working.\\" Mr Molloy said the strikers would be passing the time with card games and quizzes, plus reading the messages of support from across the North Sea and beyond. But he recognised that it could be difficult for those not involved in the dispute who are continuing to work. Nevertheless, Mr Molloy hoped there would be \\"good banter and camaraderie\\" amongst the workforce as a whole. He believed it took great courage to get involved in any form of industrial action offshore. Mr Molloy explained: \\"This is an unforgiving industry with a seriously bad record when it comes to any form of workforce challenge, these workers are to be applauded for their strength, spirit and principles.\\" Unite regional officer John Boland echoed the words of the RMT regional organiser, saying strike action was not a decision taken lightly. He added: \\"There have been ongoing discussions between our shop stewards and the management on the actual platforms. \\"It's been arranged [there will be] designated areas where our members will go while they are taking industrial action. \\"Obviously this is a safety issue as well, so they are in areas which are safe for them. \\"But also we have said to Shell and Wood Group that in the case of an unforeseen emergency happening then any of our members who are members of emergency response teams will respond. \\"They are in an area where they can be contacted if necessary.\\" Oil services firm Wood Group said it was \\"extremely disappointed\\" by the decision to take strike action. Dave Stewart, chief executive officer for Wood Group's eastern region business unit, said: \\"Our employees' safety and wellbeing remains our top priority and our commitment is to ensuring it is not compromised during industrial action. \\"Although we are extremely disappointed that industrial action will be taken, we respect the right of those employees who choose to do so. \\"Our firm focus remains on reaching a resolution, which meets our mutual goal of sustaining these jobs for our employees in the North Sea now and in the future, against the backdrop of an extremely challenging climate created by the sustained low oil price. \\"We are continuing to engage frequently, proactively and openly with our employees and the unions.  We met with union representatives on Friday and senior management have visited impacted installations over the weekend to talk with our people, with the clear aim of positively progressing discussions towards reaching a resolution.\\" A Shell spokesman said: \\"This action is highly regrettable. Shell's priority is to ensure the safety of our workforce and assets and we will not compromise on safety during this period of industrial action. \\"While we recognise the right of Wood Group's employees to strike, it is clear that in order for the North Sea oil and gas industry to remain competitive in the lower oil price environment, structural change is needed. \\"We hope that Wood Group's employees and management will continue working towards reaching a solution which will halt this counter-productive industrial action.\\" Wood Group provides maintenance and construction services to the installations, having signed a new three-year contract extension with Shell earlier this year. The seven Shell platforms involved are Shearwater, Gannet, Nelson, Curlew, Brent Alpha, Brent Bravo and Brent Charlie. Summary:","output":"Workers on seven Shell oil platforms in the North Sea are conducting the first strike in their industry for almost 30 years. The industrial action, in response to the announcement by Wood Group in February that it would be cutting rates paid to around a third of its UK contractor workforce, comes in response to fears that workers could see their pay and allowances cut by as much as 30%.

Write a title for this article: When Mariano Rivera is on the mound, as he was in the ninth inning yesterday at Yankee Stadium, he insists he feels fine. His arm feels normal, he said, and he does not think about pain. It is after he pitches that Rivera feels something different. That is why he took a magnetic resonance imaging exam before reporting to the ballpark yesterday. Rivera wanted peace of mind, and he said he had it now. “When your arm hurts, you want to know what’s going on with your arm,” Rivera said. “Now that I know there’s nothing wrong, it’s just a small strain, I can deal with it.” Rivera has a mild muscle strain in his right elbow, and Manager Joe Torre said he would no longer be tempted to use him in the eighth inning. But the ninth is fair game, and Rivera secured the final three outs in a 6-4 victory over the Detroit Tigers. Randy Johnson worked the first eight innings to improve to 15-10, leaving after Marcus Thames’s two-run homer with no outs in the ninth. “I gave up four hits and I gave up four runs,” Johnson said. “I’m still shaking my head about that.” There was no mystery: three of the hits were homers, and Thames’s came after a walk. Johnson had been 1-10 in his career when allowing three home runs, but this time he was so dominant otherwise that he won easily. He struck out eight and walked one. Entering with a two-run lead, Rivera allowed a double off the right-field wall to Magglio Ordóñez. Then he fell behind Carlos Guillén, 3-1, before Guillén chased a sinker and grounded out to third. The next two hitters grounded out weakly to end the game and give Rivera his 33rd save. Even with a fragile elbow, Rivera seemed like himself, throwing 96 miles an hour with the same mechanics as always. “I don’t think there is a difference in the way I’ve been throwing,” Rivera said. ” But there will be differences between now and the postseason, an increasingly likely destination for the Yankees, who led Boston by eight games in the American League East. Torre spoke about the need to give Rivera more time to warm up. He also pledged not to use Rivera in the eighth, which he has done 11 times this season. “Maybe down the road, we’ll find a block of time to shut him down,” Torre said. “But right now, there doesn’t seem to be any danger in letting him pitch.” Torre did not rule out using Rivera for a third straight day if he needs him tonight, depending on how Rivera feels. Rivera called his condition discomfort, not pain, and he admitted to feeling sore. He said that he had never felt anything like this, and that it was completely different from what he felt in 1992, when he needed reconstructive surgery. This problem is not structural, Torre said, and Rivera was getting heat, ice and ultrasound treatment on the elbow and forearm. The reason to be careful now, Rivera said, was to be strong in October. “October, I’ll be fine  yeah, definitely,” he said. “If I have to take time now to make sure that everything’s O.K., I will do that instead of not being O.K. and missing October.” The Tigers, who have the best record in the league, also appear headed to the playoffs. The Yankees finished their regular-season series against Detroit with five victories in seven games, losing only on June 1 and in the second game of Wednesday’s doubleheader. Both times, Rivera was being rested. That points to his obvious importance. “It’s always a concern,” Alex Rodriguez said of Rivera. “You just want to make sure you stay strong through the finish line with no injuries.” Rodriguez broke out of a 2-for-29 slump with hits in his last three at-bats yesterday. He batted fifth, behind Jorge Posada, because Torre said he did not want to juggle Rodriguez’s spot in the lineup. After popping up with the bases loaded in the first inning, Rodriguez blooped a single to left for the Yankees’ first run in the third. He doubled and scored in the fifth inning and led off the seventh with his 27th home run. The fans stood and cheered after the homer, and Rodriguez eagerly bounded up the dugout steps for a curtain call. “Joe sent me out there,” Rodriguez said. “I said, ‘Sweet  I haven’t done that in a while.’ ” After striking out four times last Friday in Anaheim, Rodriguez said he felt fine. But he finished the weekend 1 for 15 with 10 strikeouts, and with time to reflect, he said, the contrast was clear. “I stunk,” he said. “It was painful to watch me. I couldn’t even watch video  it was that bad. But that’s baseball. You stink one day and you’re good the next few days.” Other Yankees contributed offensively, including Derek Jeter, who reached base four times, and Bobby Abreu, who had a double and a two-run single. But mostly, the Yankees won because of Johnson  and Rivera, the sore-armed savior who finished up.","output":"\\"Rivera's Resilience: Pitching Through Pain for Yankee Victory\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sophie's eyes widened as she took in her two options. The radiant diamond ring glinted in the warm sunlight, the brilliance of the jewel caught her breath. In stark contrast, the ruby ring had a more antique charm, containing a history that could fill volumes. It was Greg's mother's ring, a precious family heirloom passed down through generations.  Sophie pondered the decision, her heart touched by the sentimentality and connection to Greg's family that the ruby ring embodied. However, she knew that a ruby didn't align with her tastes as much as the sparkly new diamond. Despite the sentimental value, the ruby ring seemed to lack a certain luster and radiance. It was as if life had somewhat diminished its beauty. The diamond ring, on the other hand, had Sophie spellbound. It was a contemporary design, sleek and elegant, and a symbol of a new beginning. She could envision herself donning the diamond ring at their engagement party, showcasing its gleaming sparkle to their family and friends. In many ways, this ring symbolized the start of their lives together. Sophie was aware that this decision was not only about aesthetics or what suited her personal preferences, but also about the future and how these rings could ultimately contribute to the narrative she and Greg were crafting together. A new life beckoned the couple, full of fresh experiences and significant milestones to embark upon. And so, having this new ring as the cornerstone of their journey was an attractive prospect. Greg patiently awaited Sophie's decision, his eyes filled with love and understanding. He knew that this was a significant moment for them both, and he wanted to ensure that Sophie's choice was an authentic reflection of her feelings. And so, after much contemplation, Sophie gently took Greg's hand and said, with a tone of resoluteness: \\"I choose the diamond.\\" In that instant, Greg's expression transformed into one of sheer joy. He slipped the shimmering diamond ring onto Sophie's finger, which sparkled magnificently against her radiant skin. It was a perfect fit, and it seemed to embody everything their relationship stood for: unwavering love, new beginnings, and continual growth. As they embraced, Greg whispered into Sophie's ear that he'd cherish her decision forever. It seemed only fitting that their love story embarked upon a course adorned with the glittering diamond, which seemed to beckon a lifetime of adventure, devotion, and happiness. And so, the couple began planning the next steps of their joined path, feeling grateful for the decision made, and excited about the journey that lay ahead. The diamond ring illuminated their collective dreams, and they knew that this dazzling symbol of their love would guide them through whatever twists, turns, and trials their lives might bring. As for the ruby ring, although it didn't become Sophie's engagement ring, it still held a special place in their hearts as it continued to symbolize the rich family history of Greg's lineage, weaving its tale through the backdrop of their own story. The diamond and ruby rings, holding distinct significances in their lives, would endure as cherished symbols of the past, present, and future. Sophie's choice reaffirmed the couple's deep love and unbreakable bond, and they proudly embraced the beginning of their new life together, encircled by the brilliance of the chosen diamond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are two ways in which the body cools down?\\" is \\"Sweating and constricting blood vessels\\"?","output":"Not exactly. The correct answer should be \\"Sweating and dilating blood vessels.\\"  Sweating is the first way the body cools down, as mentioned in the paragraph. When the body temperature rises, sweat glands in the skin produce sweat. The sweat evaporates from the skin's surface, which in turn helps to cool down the body. The second way the body cools down is through dilating blood vessels, not constricting them. When the body is overheated, the blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This increases blood flow to the body's surface, allowing more heat to reach the surface, and then radiate off the body into the surrounding environment. On the other hand, constricting blood vessels occurs when the body needs to retain heat, like in colder temperatures. When blood vessels constrict, or narrow, blood flow to the body's surface is reduced, which decreases the amount of heat that can be lost to the air."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

However, some conditions share symptoms with other medical issues, which means it’s possible to misdiagnose yourself. Similarly, some conditions require medical treatment. Before trying to treat yourself, see your doctor to get a proper diagnosis and discuss your treatment options.  Tell your doctor you’re interested in taking turmeric as a natural treatment. You may need to work with your doctor to manage your condition. Don’t stop taking a medication prescribed by your doctor unless they say it’s okay.","output":"The key point in the text is that turmeric can be utilized as a natural remedy for various health issues such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, and diabetes. Nevertheless, self-diagnosis and treatment can be risky due to the possibility of misidentifying your condition since some diseases exhibit similar symptoms as others. Therefore, it is paramount to consult with a healthcare professional to receive a correct diagnosis and to discuss potential treatment methods, before attempting any self-treatment regime.  If you are considering using turmeric as a therapeutic option, it is crucial to communicate this to your healthcare provider in order to ensure it is a suitable and safe choice for your particular condition. In situations where you have already been prescribed medication by a doctor, it is distinctly advised not to withdraw from this treatment unless you are given express permission from your doctor to do so. It becomes evident that whilst turmeric can potentially serve as a natural treatment for certain conditions, the management of one's health condition requires careful consultation and ongoing collaboration with medical professionals. This helps guarantee that any potential benefits from alternative medications such as turmeric are realized safely without hampering any existing medical treatment strategies. It is vital to remember that stopping prescribed medication prematurely without a doctor's advice could jeopardize one's health.

Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards.

Autumn Veatch, 16, was aboard a small plane flying from Montana to Washington with her step-grandparents when the aircraft crashed into a remote area in the northern part of the state.      Veatch was the sole survivor of the crash and fought her way from the burning wreckage and through dense woods for more than two days before she was found by hikers on Monday.

Question: Which action painter was Jack the Dripper? Answer:","output":"Jack the Dripper is a nickname given to the influential American action painter Jackson Pollock (1912–1956). The moniker arose from Pollock's innovative painting technique, where he would literally drip and splash paint onto the canvas in a seemingly chaotic manner. The nickname reflects both the painter's first name, Jack, and his signature painting style. Born in Cody, Wyoming, Pollock grew up across the American Southwest and eventually moved to New York City to study art. He gained prominence in the New York School art movement, which was marked by the rise of abstract expressionism in the mid-20th century. Unlike traditional painters, who used brushes to apply paint onto the canvas, Pollock developed his own unique method, which involved the use of sticks, trowels, knives, and brushes to manipulate the dripping paint. This technique allowed him to create dynamic, rhythmic compositions that captured a sense of raw energy and movement. These seemingly chaotic patterns of dripped and splattered paint would interact with each other, creating complex visual textures and impressive visual effects. Pollock's innovative approach to painting was not just about the final result, though; it was the physical act of painting itself. His method allowed him to directly express his emotions and instincts through the medium of paint, becoming one with the work. Pollock's groundbreaking technique had a profound impact on the art world. His work paved the way for a new generation of artists who sought to break free from the constraints of traditional painting and explore more abstract, expressive ways of creating art. As such, Pollock's legacy extends beyond his own artwork, influencing other notable action painters like Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, and Robert Motherwell. Some of Pollock's most well-known works that showcase his \\"drip\\" painting style are: 1. \\"Number 1, 1949\\": Also known as \\"Lavender Mist,\\" this painting is considered one of Pollock's greatest achievements due to its large size, vibrant colors, and intricate web of drips and splatters. 2. \\"No. 5, 1948\\": A quintessential example of Pollock's action painting, this piece is famous for selling at an auction for 140 million, making it the most expensive painting at its time in 2006. 3. \\"Autumn Rhythm (Number 30, 1950)\\": This large, expressive work is characteristic of Pollock's mature style and embodies the essence of action painting. 4. \\"One: Number 31, 1950\\": Widely regarded as one of Pollock's masterpieces, this painting perfectly captures the dynamic, rhythmic movement of his dripped paint technique. In conclusion, Jackson Pollock, also known as Jack the Dripper, revolutionized the world of painting with his innovative action painting technique. He not only defied traditional methods but also showed how expressive and emotional the physical act of painting can be. This approach inspired a whole new movement in art, cementing Jackson Pollock's influential status in the history of modern art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant","output":"Based on the given movie review sentence, the sentiment expressed is negative. There are several indicators in the phrase that illustrate the reviewer's disapproval or dissatisfaction with the character of Janice Beard, portrayed by Eileen Walsh.  First, the use of the word \\"charmless\\" implies that the character of Janice Beard does not have an attractive or captivating quality. In the context of movie reviews, characters with charm are often well-received and connect with the audience, driving the story forward. The lack of charm, in this case, points to the reviewer's perception that the character fails to engage the audience and may come off as uninteresting or one-dimensional. Second, the term \\"vacant\\" is used to describe Janice Beard's persona. A vacant personality usually suggests a lack of depth or substance, which can be interpreted as dull, shallow, or hollow. In movie reviews, three-dimensional and multi-layered characters are generally preferred as they give the audience a more authentic experience and allow them to connect and empathize with the character. A vacant character typically does not evoke strong emotions from the audience, which is seen as a major drawback in the eyes of the reviewer. Overall, the sentiment expressed in the review sentence is negative because the reviewer is criticizing Janice Beard's character as being charmless and vacant, which indicates their dissatisfaction with the character development and portrayal in the movie. This illustrates their belief that the character fails to create an engaging and enjoyable experience for the viewers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The driveway had lots of traffic.","output":"No, the next sentence does not follow the preceding text. The preceding text explicitly mentions that the apartment building management blocked off the driveway to traffic for the duration of the ice cream party. This measure was likely taken to ensure space for the ice cream truck and safety for the residents, particularly the young children mentioned. This would make it impossible for the driveway to have a lot of traffic during the time period specified.

Information:  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - La Mancha is a natural and historical region located on an arid but fertile, elevated plateau (610 m or 2000 ft.) of central Spain, south of Madrid, from the mountains of Toledo to the western spurs of the hills of Cuenca, and bordered to the South by the Sierra Morena and to the North by the Alcarria region. La Mancha includes portions of the modern provinces of Cuenca, Toledo, and Albacete, and most of the Ciudad Real province. La Mancha historical comarca constitutes the southern portion of CastillaLa Mancha autonomous community and makes up most of the present-day administrative region.  - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\").  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Ciudad Real (English: \\"Royal City\\") is a city in CastileLa Mancha, Spain, with a population of c. 75,000. It is the capital of the province of Ciudad Real. It has a stop on the AVE high-speed rail line and has begun to grow as a long-distance commuter suburb of Madrid, which is located 115 miles (185 km) to the north of Ciudad Real.  - A comarca (, pl. \\"comarcas\\" pl. \\"comarques\\") is a traditional region or local administrative division found in parts of Spain, Portugal, Panama, Nicaragua, and Brazil. The term is derived from the term marca, meaning a \\"march, mark\\", plus the prefix \\"co\\"- meaning \\"together, jointly\\".  - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - A natural region is a basic geographic unit. Usually it is a region which is distinguished by its common natural features of geography, geology, and climate.   - The province of Ciudad Real is a province in the southwestern part of the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It is bordered by the provinces of Cuenca, Albacete, Jaén, Córdoba, Badajoz, and Toledo. It is partly located in the old natural region of La Mancha. Its capital is Ciudad Real. It is the third biggest province of Spain, after Cáceres and Badajoz. The historical comarca Campo de Calatrava is located in the centre of the province.  - Villanueva de los Infantes is a municipality in the province of Ciudad Real , Castile - La Mancha , Spain .

Please write a short summary for the following article: Congress's latest awful tech-policy idea: the Net-censorship bill No idea is too bad not to get a second chance in Congress -- especially when it comes to tech policy. This week's demonstration of that principle is a bill called the \\"Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act,\\" which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday after being set aside in September. COICA would empower the attorney general to get court orders barring Internet providers from routing their users to sites suspected of copyright infringement. The bill's text provides a generous definition of what would qualify a site for such punishment: It could be \\"primarily designed\\" or marketed for copyright infringement or have no other \\"demonstrable commercially significant purpose or use.\\" Copyright infringement, in turn, is broadly defined: It could include not just hosting downloads or streams of photos, music or movies but also providing \\"a link or aggregated links to other sites or Internet resources for obtaining access to such copies.\\" (Disclosure: I've linked to DVD-decrypting and file-sharing programs many times. Then again, it's now legal to decrypt a DVD to collect short clips for review and commentary.) A suspected Web site would not be guaranteed its day in court. COICA requires that the government notify the site and its domain registrar but does not demand a trial and a verdict. A simple injunction by a judge will suffice. It's a rough equivalent of the \\"judicial civil forfeiture\\" proceeding through which the Feds can take a suspected drug dealer's property without first securing a conviction. COICA wouldn't actually remove a site from the Internet, though. Instead, it would compel Internet providers and domain-name registries to remove their own listings of a site's domain name. Users could still get to that site by typing its Internet Protocol address, just as you can get to washingtonpost.com by typing 12.129.147.65 in your browser's address bar. The Motion Picture Association of America thinks the bill is fantastic. Others do not. Ninety-six pioneering Internet engineers have signed an open letter calling COICA a dangerous, unsound measure that would \\"risk fragmenting the Internet's global domain name system.\\" The man who invented the Web itself, Tim Berners-Lee, doesn't like this bill, either. Forty-nine law professors signed their own letter calling COICA \\"an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.\\" So, people who helped build the Internet think this law will have disastrous consequences, and people who know the law think it will get thrown out in court first. And yet COICA sailed through the Judiciary Committee on a 19-0 vote, with some of those yeas coming from senators who should know better, to judge from their records. I know it's fashionable to say that nobody in Congress reads anything before voting on it. But, seriously: Did anybody on the Judiciary Committee read this thing before voting on it? One senator has: Sen. Ron Wyden (D.-Ore.) told IDG News Service's Grant Gross that he'll oppose the bill. That should stop it from going anywhere this year--but I won't be surprised to see COICA re-emerge, zombie-like, in the next session. Because bad tech-policy ideas often get third chances too. (2:58 p.m. Added a line about COICA's September setback and noted the chances of it not proceeding this year.)

If a Russian site is offering illegal content to American citizens via American ISPs and American domain names, it is breaking American law every time it delivers its content to American households. The American justice system has already determined piracy and counterfeiting have no valid place in America. If these sites were hosted in America, they would be shut down in an instant. The logical conclusion is not to let the country with the least online laws decide for the world what is or is not permitted online. That will just lead to a 'race to the bottom', with every cyber-criminal migrating to the Ukraine or Bangladesh. The only reasonable course of action is to block it at the ISP level. Piracy and counterfeiting are not free speech. If an illegal torrent site wants to open a legal free speech website, they will still be able to do so.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.  Question: \\"What as President Obama asking Congress for to implement his plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure?\\" Answer: \\"To work together on his new plan and to support it\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Answer: \\"President Obama was asking Congress to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure, which included rebuilding roads, rails, and runways, as well as modernizing the nation's air traffic control system.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  In late 1854 or early 1855 James Robertson married Beato's sister, Leonilda Maria Matilda Beato. They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862.  Guess a valid title for it!

Please answer the following question: Process:  - You plant vegetable seeds in the ground - You water the seeds - You wait for the seeds to sprout - You keep the area free of pests and weeds while the plants grow - You thin out the plants as they get bigger to give them space to grow - You remove the vegetables from the plants when they are ripe.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less seeds will sprout happens, how will it affect LESS vegetables.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've provided suggests that fewer seeds will sprout than expected. This circumstance could arise due to several reasons, such as inadequate water, soil conditions, or sowing depth, among other factors. If fewer seeds sprout, it will directly affect the final number of vegetable plants growing in the garden, and consequently, the total number of vegetables that can be harvested. This outcome will be due to having a lower initial number of sprouted seedlings to develop, mature, and ultimately produce vegetables. In essence, with fewer plants, fewer vegetables will be produced, thus leading to reduced yields from the garden. The supposed perturbation does have a direct effect on the overall vegetable gardening process. However, it is important to consider that many factors can contribute to seed germination and sprouting, and optimal cultivation practices should be undertaken to mitigate these potential issues. Some of these practices may include using high-quality seeds, ensuring proper watering, maintaining appropriate soil conditions, and providing the necessary nutrients. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of fewer seeds sprouting does have a direct impact on the number of vegetables produced. To minimize this effect, it is essential to incorporate good gardening practices and address any issues that may hinder seed germination and plant growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? when was the last time the gre was revised?","output":"The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is an internationally recognized standardized test used by graduate schools and business programs to assess applicants' preparedness for postgraduate study. Administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), the GRE has undergone several revisions over the years to improve its validity and reliability as an assessment tool, as well as to ensure that the test remains current and relevant to the skills and knowledge required by modern graduate programs.  The last significant revision of the GRE occurred in August 2011. This revision, often referred to as the \\"Revised GRE\\" or \\"GRE Revised General Test,\\" introduced several key changes aimed at better aligning the test with the demands of modern graduate education: 1. Enhanced scoring scale: The Revised GRE updated the scoring scale for the Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning sections. Previously, these sections were scored on a 200-800 scale, with 10-point increments. In the revised test, these two sections have a scoring range of 130-170, with 1-point increments. This change was made to provide a more accurate and detailed assessment of test-takers' abilities. 2. New question types: The revised test introduced several new question types, including text completion and sentence equivalence questions in the Verbal Reasoning section, and numeric entry and multiple-choice questions with more than one correct answer in the Quantitative Reasoning section. These changes were made to better evaluate a range of cognitive skills, including critical reasoning, problem-solving, and data interpretation. 3. Changes to the Analytical Writing section: The Analytical Writing section now consists of two tasks—an \\"Analyze an Issue\\" task and an \\"Analyze an Argument\\" task—that require test-takers to formulate and support their own arguments, as well as evaluate others' arguments. This revision was intended to more accurately assess higher-order reasoning skills and the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively. 4. Adaptivity: In the revised test, the Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning sections are section-level adaptive, meaning that a test-taker's performance on the first section of each of these sections determines the difficulty level of the subsequent section. This change allows the test to better measure a test-taker's abilities across a wider range of skill levels. 5. User-friendly test design: The revised GRE introduced several features designed to improve the overall test-taking experience, such as the ability to skip questions and return to them later within a section, as well as to change answers within a section. These changes were made to allow test-takers to employ various test-taking strategies and better manage their time during the test. Since the 2011 revision, there have been no major updates to the GRE. However, ETS regularly reviews and updates the test content to ensure that it remains relevant and useful for evaluating the skills and knowledge needed for success in graduate programs. Thus, it is essential for test-takers to remain informed about any future changes to the GRE and to prepare accordingly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Popol Vuh (also Popol Wuj) is a cultural narrative that recounts the mythology and history of the K'iche' people who inhabit the Guatemalan Highlands northwest of present-day Guatemala City. The Popol Vuh is a creation narrative written by the K'iche' people before the Spanish conquest of Guatemala, originally preserved through oral tradition until approximately 1550 when it was written down. The survival of the Popol Vuh is credited to the 18th century Dominican friar Francisco Ximenez who made a copy of the original text in Spanish The name \\"Popol Vuh\\" translates as \\"Book of the Community\\", \\"Book of Counsel\\", or more literally as \\"Book of the People\\". The Popol Vuh includes the Mayan creation myth, beginning with the exploits of the Hero Twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque. Context: Since its rediscovery by Europeans in the 19th century, the Popol Vuh has attracted the attention of many authors. For example, the myths and legends included in Louis L'Amour's novel The Haunted Mesa are largely based on the Popol Vuh. The planet of Camazotz in Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time is named for the bat-god of the hero-twins story. The text was also used by German film director Werner Herzog as extensive narration for the first chapter of his movie Fata Morgana (released 1972). Mexican painter Diego Rivera did a series of watercolors in 1931, as illustrations for the book.  In 1934, the Franco-American early avant-garde composer Edgard Varese wrote his Ecuatorial - a setting of words from the Popol Vuh for bass soloist and various instruments. The Argentinian composer Alberto Ginastera began writing his opus 44 symphonic work Popol Vuh in 1975, but left the work incomplete at his death in 1983.  In Munich, Germany in 1969, keyboardist Florian Fricke--at the time ensconced in Mayan myth--formed a band named Popol Vuh with synth player Frank Fiedler and percussionist Holger Trulzsch. Their 1970 debut album, Affenstunde, reflected this spiritual connection. The band is notable especially for its extremely early experimentation with forms that became popularized through the modern electronic, new age/ambient music that was to follow years later. They also worked together with Werner Herzog for 5 of his movies. Another band by the same name, this one of Norwegian descent, formed around the same time, its name also inspired by the K'iche' writings. Question: What did the authors said about him ? Answer:","output":"The various authors, artists, and composers who have been inspired by the Popol Vuh have expressed their fascination and appreciation for the ancient text in different ways, often reflecting their own personal styles and creative approaches. Louis L'Amour, a popular American author, incorporated the myths and legends of the Popol Vuh into his novel The Haunted Mesa. Although L'Amour does not provide direct quotations about the Popol Vuh, his usage of its themes and ideas demonstrates his interest in the K'iche' culture and its mythology. Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, named the planet Camazotz in her book after the bat-god in the hero-twins story of the Popol Vuh. This illustrates her appreciation for the rich mythology depicted in the text and how it can be adapted to new, imaginative contexts. Werner Herzog, the German film director, used the Popol Vuh as a foundation for the narration of the first chapter of his movie Fata Morgana. This shows his respect for the ancient text, its captivating stories, and the unique cultural lens it provides. Diego Rivera, the Mexican muralist and painter, created a series of watercolors in 1931 as illustrations for the book. This artistic expression of the Popol Vuh testifies to Rivera's admiration for the K'iche' culture and his desire to visually represent their stories and history. Edgard Varèse, a Franco-American composer, created a musical piece called Ecuatorial that incorporated words from the Popol Vuh. This demonstrates Varèse's recognition of the cultural significance and the poetic nature of the text, using it to inspire his avant-garde compositions. Alberto Ginastera, an Argentinian composer, began working on his opus 44 symphonic work Popol Vuh in 1975, but it was left incomplete at the time of his death. His dedication to this project reflects his passion for the K'iche' myths and their potential to inspire new musical expressions. Florian Fricke, a German keyboardist, formed a band named Popol Vuh in 1969, as he was deeply interested in Mayan mythology. Their debut album, Affenstunde, showcased this connection and contributed to the popularization of electronic and ambient music. The band's choice of name and ongoing inspiration from the K'iche' text reveal their admiration for the Popol Vuh and its cultural significance. In summary, while most of the authors, artists, and composers have not directly stated their thoughts about the Popol Vuh, their works and creations demonstrate a deep respect and fascination for the K'iche' myths, history, and culture documented in the ancient text. The enduring influence of the Popol Vuh continues to capture the imaginations of individuals from various creative fields, serving as a testament to the power and significance of the K'iche' people's mythology and history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer seems to find the concept of misfits at a military school entertaining and humorous, even if it may be offensive to some. They acknowledge the diverse and quirky cast of characters as a strength of the film, contributing to its comedic effect. The reviewer specifically mentions enjoying the film's message of working together to achieve results, which seems to resonate with them. They also appreciate the performances of Ralph Macchio and Barbara Bach, suggesting that the film is particularly appealing to teens and young adults. Additionally, the mention of a \\"great soundtrack\\" keeping the film moving further reinforces the positive sentiment. While the review contains some potentially negative considerations (such as the possibility of the film being offensive), the overall sentiment is clearly in favor of the film as a funny and engaging piece of entertainment for its target audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 49ers defense intercepted Giants QB Eli Manning 5 times and sacked him twice. In the 4th quarter, with the 49ers holding a 16-10 lead, the Giants marched down the field to the 49ers 4 yard line with 5:25 left to play. The 49ers defense forced 3 incomplete passes and rookie linebacker Chris Borland intercepted Eli Manning's throw on 4th and goal to preserve the win. This was the second time this season the 49ers defense had a goal line stand late in a game (Week 4 vs Eagles). Colin Kaepernick went 15/29 for 193 yards and a touchdown pass.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Robert Owen was born in Wales in 1771. At the age of ten he went to work. His employer had a large private library so Owen was able to educate himself. He read a lot in his spare time and at nineteen he was given the job of superintendent  at a Manchester cotton mill. He was so successful there that he persuaded his employer to buy the New Lanark mill in Scotland. When he arrived at New Lanark it was a dirty little town with a population of 2,000 people. Nobody paid any attention to the workers' houses or their children's education. The conditions in the factories were very bad. There was a lot of crime and the men spent most of their wages on alcoholic drinks. Owen improved the houses. He encouraged people to be clean and save money. He opened a shop and sold the workers cheap, well-made goods to help them. He limited the sale of alcoholic drinks. Above all, he fixed his mind on the children's education. In 1816 he opened the first free primary school in Britain. People came from all over the country to visit Owen's factory. They saw that the workers were healthier and more efficient than in other towns. Their children were better fed and better educated. Owen tried the same experiment in the United States. He bought some land there in 1825, but the community was too far away. He could not keep it under control and lost most of his money. Owen never stopped fighting for his idea. Above all he believed that people are not born good or bad. He was a practical man and his ideas were practical. \\"If you give people good working conditions\\", he thought, \\"they will work well and, the most important thing of all, if you give them the chance to learn, they will be better people.\\" Question: From the passage we may infer that Owen was born   _  . Options: A: into a rich family B: into a noble family C: into a poor family D: into a middle class family The answer is:","output":"C: into a poor family The passage provides information about Robert Owen's background and accomplishments. From the context, it is most likely to infer that Owen was born into a poor family, as he went to work at the age of ten. It also mentions that his employer had a large private library where Owen was able to educate himself, suggesting that he did not have access to formal education, which would have likely been limited to those with financial means. Additionally, his early employment at a young age and focus on improving the lives of workers and their children through education also indicates his empathy for those struggling with poverty, which he may have experienced himself as a child."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Millions of people living all over the world have cancer. Is cancer a pandemic? What is the correct answer to this question?","output":"Step 1: Understand the key terms. My first step is to understand what is meant by \\"pandemic\\" and \\"cancer.\\"  A pandemic generally refers to a widespread infectious disease affecting a large number of people across multiple geographic regions. It typically spreads rapidly and may have high fatality rates.  Cancer, on the other hand, refers to a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. There are various types of cancer, and they can occur due to various factors including genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Step 2: Compare the terms. Now that I have an understanding of both terms, I need to analyze whether cancer fits the criteria of a pandemic. I will consider the following points: - Cancer is indeed a widespread disease, affecting millions of people all over the world. - However, cancer is not an infectious disease. It can't be transmitted between individuals like a virus or bacteria. - Cancer is not a single disease but a group of related diseases, attributable to different causes and risk factors. Step 3: Determine the correct answer. Given the information from Steps 1 and 2, I can now answer the question: Cancer is not considered a pandemic, as it is not an infectious disease that rapidly spreads in the population. While it is a global health issue and affects millions of people, it does not fit the criteria of a pandemic due to its non-infectious nature and diverse range of causes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is credited with very few works? , can you please find it?   The attribution of the panel reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now thought to have been completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.Attempts to date it have undergone similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel was believed to be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan.

It is both a hybrid production and an interplay between art , technology , and humans ... \\" ( Liao , 200 . Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: what may happen if art is removed from the avatar media art ?","output":"If art is removed from avatar media art, such as in the case of \\"Second Life\\" mentioned in the passage, several consequences may arise: 1. Loss of creative expression: Avatars serve as an extension of an individual's creative expression and are a form of visual art. By removing art from avatar media, we risk limiting the potential for users to fully express their creativity and uniqueness in the online environment. 2. Reduction in visual stimulation: The passage emphasizes that avatar media art is an \\"ever-changing visually stimulating entity.\\" If art is removed from avatar media, this dynamic and engaging visual aspect will be lost. This could lead to less interaction among users or less interest in engaging with the platform, eventually diminishing the appeal of the online environment and potentially leading to a reduction in its user base. 3. Inability to fully explore new media art: According to the passage, \\"new media art encompasses the use of digital technologies and the Internet as media,\\" but also highlights that it is more than just these elements. It involves a \\"hybrid production and an interplay between art, technology, and humans.\\" The removal of art from avatar media would compromise this balance, limiting our understanding of new media art and preventing advancements in this field. 4. Compromised connection between art and technology: Art and technology are intertwined in new media art, and avatar media helps bridge the gap between the two. By eliminating art from avatar media art, that connection could be compromised, stifling opportunities for future innovation and collaboration between the fields of art and technology. 5. Impact on artistic communities: Removing art from avatar media art may have profound effects on both the creators and consumers within artistic communities, especially those who work within the context of new media art. This could potentially hinder artists' careers and limit the development of new ideas and practices within the realm of new media art. In conclusion, if art is removed from avatar media art, it could result in a substantial loss of creative expression, reduction in visual stimulation, limitations in exploring new media art, interference in the relationship between art and technology, and negative impacts on artistic communities. Thus, maintaining art as a key component of avatar media art is crucial to sustaining its importance and potential for creative expression and innovation in the digital age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Domestic Violence Legal Assistance Program fills the gap of legal resources for domestic violence survivors who can't afford an attorney. Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ... If a woman knows she is going to get some help that will be a burden off her mind, if the law will help her keep that person away from her.\\" Gwen Bouie-Haynes, project director of the Domestic Violence Services Center for Catholic Charities Inc., said often domestic violence survivors do not have the money to seek legal representation. \\"Legal assistance is a major issue for women fleeing a domestic violence situation,\\" she said. \\"Often times women are in need of immediate legal assistance services for the protection of the mother and the child. To get a protective order you need to be represented by an attorney.\\" Crockett said the pilot program was launched in 1998 at the Haven House Family Shelter Inc., a domestic violence shelter for women and children in Vicksburg. The program has helped victims in 90 court cases, and 150 legal counseling sessions have been held there.

When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger. Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \\"thank\\" him. Shrek signs the contract and appears in a reality where he is feared by villagers. He takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds \\"WANTED\\" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Stiltskin, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down. Upon inquiry, Stiltskin reveals that the day he erased was the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or never met Donkey, and consequently Stiltskin was able to get King Harold and Queen Lillian to sign their kingdom away, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Stiltskin's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \\"true love's kiss\\".

Write an article based on this \\"Residents in Bridgend county borough will only be able to throw away two black bin bags of household rubbish a fortnight under council changes.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Bridgend County Borough Residents Limited to Two Black Bin Bags per Fortnight due to Council Changes Introduction: The Bridgend County Borough Council has announced changes in waste management policies, limiting the disposal of household rubbish to two black bin bags per household every fortnight. These changes have been implemented to encourage better waste management practices among local residents and follow similar measures adopted by councils across the UK. Step 1: Understand the goal of the policy change One of the primary objectives behind this policy change is to foster a sense of responsibility among residents regarding waste disposal and management. This move is aligned with the council's ongoing efforts in pushing for a cleaner and greener environment, focusing on waste reduction, recycling, and sustainable living practices. Step 2: Discuss the problems associated with excessive waste Excessive household waste poses significant problems for both the environment and the local economy. Landfills are reaching capacity, leading to a surge in waste management costs for the borough and increasing the carbon footprint due to transportation of the waste. Additionally, the overflow of waste attracts pests and wildlife, posing risks to public health and safety. Step 3: Explain the benefits of the policy change By limiting waste disposal to two black bin bags per fortnight, the council anticipates that households will be more conscientious about their waste management practices. This could lead to an increase in recycling rates, supporting the local recycling industry and helping the council achieve its environmental targets. This measure would not only reduce the financial burden on the taxpayers but also contribute to an improved quality of life through a cleaner and healthier environment. Step 4: Offer tips and recommendations for residents To help residents adapt to this change, the article could provide suggestions on ways to reduce waste, such as: - Practicing mindful shopping by planning meals, reducing single-use plastic consumption, and opting for reusable bags - Repurposing or upcycling items before discarding them - Composting food scraps and garden waste to reduce the amount of rubbish in black bin bags - Check and adhere to local recycling guidelines to increase the volume of recyclable waste sorted correctly Step 5: Address concerns and potential drawbacks The new waste management policy may receive some criticism from local residents, particularly those who already struggle to manage their waste within the current limits. The article should address these concerns by discussing the support available from the council, which could include: - Information on how to maximise recycling efforts - Access to additional waste disposal facilities for specific situations - Resources and guidance for households that have difficulty adjusting to the new system Conclusion: The decision by Bridgend County Borough Council to limit the disposal of household rubbish to two black bin bags per fortnight reflects the growing global awareness of the need for better waste management practices. As residents adapt to this new policy and embrace the benefits of a cleaner environment, we can expect to see a healthier, greener, and more sustainable future for the community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights.

She notices that all signs indicate that Milshen is experiencing adiabatic cooling. She doesn't see any indications of adiabatic cooling in Limlen, though. This is important information to relay in her broadcast later tonight to the citizens of both countries and she is glad she noticed it.  and a hint : Adiabatic cooling occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes a parcel of air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. As the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, water vapor normally condenses to form cloud drops. This condensation normally occurs on cloud condensation nuclei such as salt or dust particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.Frontal and cyclonic lift occur when stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure by a process called convergence. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds over a wide area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of the warm air mass just ahead of the front.  Please answer this question : Is the air more or less saturated in Limlen?","output":"Based on the given situation and information, it appears that Milshen is experiencing adiabatic cooling, while Limlen is not showing any signs of this process. In adiabatic cooling, air containing water vapor rises, cools to its dew point, and becomes saturated as water vapor condenses to form cloud drops. Since adiabatic cooling is not occurring in Limlen, we can infer that the air in Limlen is less saturated compared to Milshen. Adiabatic cooling is facilitated by one or more of three possible lifting agents - cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic. This process results in the formation of clouds, which can vary in forms depending on the lifting mechanism and the stability of the air mass involved. In Milshen, the presence of clouds and adiabatic cooling suggests that the lifting mechanisms are at work, leading to the saturation of the air. In contrast, Limlen does not exhibit any indications of adiabatic cooling. Therefore, the air in Limlen is less saturated compared to the air in Milshen, where the adiabatic cooling process is happening. Less saturated air means that the water vapor content in the air is lower, leading to fewer clouds and lower chances of precipitation. It is crucial for the meteorologist to convey this difference in saturation levels and weather conditions between the two countries during the broadcast, as this information is valuable for the citizens' daily activities and planning. While Milshen experiences more saturated air and potentially cloudier or wetter weather conditions due to the adiabatic cooling process, Limlen has less saturated air and possibly clearer skies or drier conditions. This distinction in weather patterns between the two countries can be attributed to the absence of lifting agents in Limlen, preventing adiabatic cooling and consequential air saturation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Parasakthi Movie plot: Chandrasekaran, Gnanasekaran and Gunasekaran are three Indian immigrant brothers from Madurai, Tamil Nadu living in Rangoon, Burma with Chandrasekaran's wife Saraswati. Their younger sister Kalyani was raised in their home town by their father Manickampillai. In 1942, during World War II, the three brothers and Saraswati plan to visit Madurai to attend the impending wedding of Kalyani to a writer named Thangappan. Due to war conditions and bombardment of Burmese ports by Japan, the shipping company offers only one ticket and Gunasekaran, the youngest brother, takes it and leaves for Tamil Nadu. The ship fails to reach on time due to the dangers of the war, and Kalyani's marriage takes place without any of her brothers present. Kalyani becomes pregnant. But on the day she delivers her child, Thangappan dies in an accident and Manickampillai dies of shock, leaving Kalyani and her child destitute. Her house gets auctioned off, and she makes her living by selling food on the streets. Gunasekaran, after being stranded at sea for several months, finally arrives in Tamil Nadu at Madras. However, while watching a dance performance, he is robbed of all his belongings after being intoxicated. Impoverished, he becomes enraged at the status of the once glorious Tamil Nadu, and fakes insanity by indulging in numerous tricks to make a living. Gunasekaran finally comes across his destitute sister at Madurai, having learned of their father's death and her poverty. He continues to play insane and does not reveal his true identity to her due to his poverty, but hovers around her. Kalyani is irritated by the stranger's behaviour, unaware that he is her brother. Kalyani is nearly molested by a vagabond named Venu, but is saved by Gunasekaran.

Title: The Devil and Daniel Mouse Movie plot: The story is about two struggling mouse musicians, Daniel and Jan. When they are fired from their latest gig (their music is deemed too old-fashioned and not with the times), Daniel goes to pawn his guitar in order to buy groceries. Jan wanders off on her own and encounters a shifty reptilian character in a white suit who introduces himself as \\"B.L. Zebubb\\", a record producer. He and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company. Little does she suspect that B.L. is none other than the Devil himself, and at the height of her fame he will return to collect her soul. To assist her, Weez conjures three band members from thin air, a rabbit (Rabbit Delight), a beaver (Boom Boom Beaver), and a praying mantis (Pray Mantis). As \\"Funky Jan\\", Jan is soon the most popular rock star on the planet while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help. A trial is held in the woods at night over Jan's soul, with Weez as the judge and Daniel acting as Jan's attorney. As an additional stipend, the Devil states that should Daniel lose the trial, his soul as well as Jan's will be taken as payment. At first, the trial seems hopeless, considering Daniel has no education as a lawyer and cannot present even the beginnings of a reasonable argument to release Jan. Having nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members. The other animals watching the trial begin to sing and clap along to the tune and so do the jury of lost souls. An enraged Devil attempts to summon forth demons to stop the heroes, but the spirits he conjures also fall prey to the sway of Daniel's music.

And why is it that Little Bear's animal friends can all talk and behave like people, but his friend Emily has a dog that can only bark and fetch? Tell me that isn't a mystery! Dog lovers can be reassured (less worried or frightened) by Kipper and his friends. These dogs are very human.

What did the great Mr. Disney have in mind? And this is unfair! The other day we watched a very nice little pig setting up a picnic. One of the foods was a big ham. Could it have been a soybeam ham? Is there such a thing? I hope so! Another thing that really bothers me: what if Elmo(one of my son's favorite cartoon stars) isn't real? He can't be a mere puppet !

Article: Each section will form a loc. Start separating sections of hair on the back of your head first. Use a comb to separate the hair into a 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) thick section. Use your free hand to hold the section of hair together.  If you want fatter locs, you can separate a thicker section of hair. Use sections that are 1 inch by 1 inch (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm) square at the base for medium locs, or double the size for a large loc. Backcombing works best on hair that’s 6 inches (15 cm) or longer, but can work with hair as short as 3 inches (7.6 cm). Backcombing an entire head of hair can take up to 4 hours to complete. Start by combing the section of hair 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the roots, towards the direction of the scalp. Comb over the same section 5-10 times until the hair starts to bunch up towards the scalp, then slowly make your way down, towards the ends of the hair. Continue combing in 3 inches (7.6 cm) sections until the entire portion of separated hair is backcombed. You can purchase a dread comb online or at a beauty supply store. Grip the hair between your index finger and thumb, a couple of inches (about 5 cm) away from the root. Hold the section of hair tightly and run the crochet needle in between your fingers, through the hair several times. Your hair will bunch up even further. Continue doing this down the length of the hair until the entire section is knotted and looped. After you use the comb and needle, the hair should resemble a dread. Use small rubber bands to secure it at the base of the loc and at the end of the section of hair. This will hold it in place and allow it to keep its form. If you plan to go out in public before you have finished dreadlocking your hair, you may wish to use rubber bands that are the same color as your hair to create a more natural appearance. Look for products like locking gel, lock and twist gel, or beeswax. Dread cream will prevent hair and scalp dryness and will promote the forming of dreads. Squeeze a generous portion into the palm of your hand, then apply it from the root to the end of the loc. Put the loc between the palms of your hands and roll it back and forth several times so that it forms into more of a rounded shape. Start from the root and work your way down to the end of the loc. This will help form the locs and make them look uniform. Continue dreading each section of hair in even sections until the entire head has been dreaded. Do not attempt to backcomb the sections again, or you’ll have to restart the knotting process. Remove the rubber bands once you’ve dreaded all the hair. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is that dreadlocking hair involves separating sections of hair on the back of the head, backcombing and using a crochet needle to create knots and loops, securing the locs with rubber bands, applying dread cream, and rolling the locs between palms to create a uniform shape. This process, which can take up to 4 hours to complete, works best on hair that's 6 inches or longer but can also be done with hair as short as 3 inches.

They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss. McKaskel never learns of the kiss, but tells Vallian, who is critical of his apparent pacifism, to back off several times.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move?  Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between.  Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Tree city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move. The reason behind this conclusion is that Red city experienced many earthquakes, while Tree city experienced few and far between earthquakes. As described in the hint, convection within the Earth causes the plates to move, and when the stresses build too much, the rocks break and release energy in the form of earthquakes. Since Tree city had fewer earthquakes, it is reasonable to infer that the convection within the Earth causing the plates to move was less in Tree city compared to Red city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Celtic captain Scott Brown has played down the absence of his club's supporters at Friday's Champions League qualifier against Linfield. Article:","output":"Title: A Captain's Courage: Scott Brown Leads Celtic in Champions League Qualifier Despite Fan Absence There's an old saying in football, “it’s not about the number of supporters you have, it’s about the amount of heart you put into the game.” Celtic captain Scott Brown seems to personify this sentiment. As the Scottish team heads into their important Champions League qualifier against Linfield on Friday, the absence of their loyal fans in the stands might seem like a setback. However, Brown has made it abundantly clear that the lack of the crowd's support will not be a deterrent to the team's performance on the pitch. The occasion's gravity is undeniable. It's the sort of match-up that can propel a team into the next level of competition, drawing attention and admiration from football fans around the world. For a group as storied and well-regarded as the Celtic Football Club, there is arguably no better opportunity to seize. True to Brown's leadership, the team is refusing to dwell on any potential drawbacks or setbacks as they prepare for this monumental game. For those unfamiliar with the past clashes between Linfield and Celtic, there's a rich tapestry of history underlying this rivalry. With supporters known to engage passionately in the competition's spirit, their voices often provide a stirring backdrop behind the athletes' performances. However, Friday's match-up will differ significantly from past encounters due to the absence of Celtic supporters in the stands. While Brown acknowledges the impact of their fanbase, he remains firm in his conviction that not having them present during the game will not hold the team back. The Celtic captain expressed his sentiments in a recent interview, saying, \\"we are professional footballers, and we know how to handle a situation like this. We are here to play football and represent the club.\\" Scott Brown emphasized the criticality of the players focusing on their game, rather than on what they cannot control. \\"Of course, we would love to have our fans there with us, but we can't change the circumstances,\\" he expounded. \\"It's time to show our true character and concentrate on what really matters – giving 100% on that field.\\" Brown's words of resolution echo a determination that is pervasive within the team. They understand that on Friday, they are representing more than just themselves; they are representing a club with an illustrious history and a fanbase worldwide. The team will need to keep their focus clear and their eyes on the prize, as the match against Linfield could be a significant turning point for them in the Champions League. Furthermore, there's no reason to believe that Celtic fans globally won't be cheering on their team in spirit. The new age of connectivity we find ourselves in can prove to be an advantage in this situation. The game will be broadcast on multiple platforms worldwide, and fans are encouraged to follow the match through their preferred medium, offering their support from afar. As the game approaches, fans and critics alike will be closely watching the performance of Celtic in this Champions League qualifier. Scott Brown’s emphasis on the players' resilience and dedication to the club serves as an inspiring call to arms for a team ready to face any potential obstacles on the pitch. In the end, it's not about the stands being full or empty; it's about the heart and soul the players put into the game. As Celtic Football Club heads into Friday's qualifier, their intrepid captain Scott Brown leads the charge, undaunted by the lack of familiar faces in the crowd. As Brown appropriately captures the essence of the situation, \\"football is football, fans or no fans.\\" The determination of this mighty team, backed by the spirit of their fanbase far and wide, is set to show the world what true character and grit look like on the field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this task, you will be shown a sentence, and you should determine whether it is overruling or non-overruling. In law, an overruling sentence is a statement that nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent by a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court which establishes a different rule on the point of law involved. Classify your answers into overruling or non-overruling consequently, the proposed claims against clay would be futile, and we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in denying the plaintiff's motion to amend.","output":"The task is asking you to read a given sentence and then determine whether it is 'overruling' or 'non-overruling' in the context of law.  An 'overruling' sentence is one that cancels out or negates a previous legal decision or a precedent due to a new law or a different interpretation of the existing law from the same or higher authority. It means the sentence must essentially alter the course of a previously held law or ruling. A 'non-overruling' sentence does not change any previously existing law or court decision. It might involve a decision or judgement, but it doesn't challenge or change any established rule. Based on these guidelines: Let's analyze the provided sentence: \\"Consequently, the proposed claims against Clay would be futile, and we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in denying the plaintiff's motion to amend.\\" This sentence does not overrule or negate any existing legal decision or precedent. Instead, it is presenting a conclusion or judgement on a specific claim. It asserts a judgement on the futility of the proposed claims against Clay and mentions that the court decision to deny the plaintiff's motion to amend does not constitute an \\"abuse of discretion\\".

With a focus on preventing such banking crises in the future, numerous measures can be implemented to ensure financial stability and reduce the adverse impact on economies and people's lives. First, it is crucial to improve regulation and supervision in the banking sector. Governments should work together with international organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to establish global standards that enhance the stability of financial institutions. These standards should enhance the transparency of financial activities, including the disclosure of potential risks, and ensure that banks hold adequate capital and maintain sufficient liquidity levels to withstand potential economic shocks. Secondly, central banks must play a proactive role in monitoring and managing financial risks. They can do this by implementing macroprudential policies that prevent the build-up of systemic risks and ensure the stability of the financial system as a whole. This may include setting counter-cyclical capital buffers, which require banks to hold additional capital during economic upturns, or implementing restrictions on credit growth that could lead to asset price bubbles. Thirdly, it is essential to diversify and strengthen the financial system through encouraging the growth of alternative financial institutions such as credit unions and development banks. These institutions can provide additional sources of financing for businesses, reducing the dependency on traditional banks and making the overall financial system more resilient to shocks. Fourthly, implementing reforms to the banking sector's corporate governance is vital. This includes ensuring that banks have effective and independent boards that can hold management accountable for their actions and safeguard shareholders' interests. Additionally, implementing robust risk management practices can help banks better identify and manage potential risks related to their activities, thereby reducing their potential exposure to crises. Fifthly, fostering international cooperation and coordination among regulators and central banks can help develop a unified response to potential banking crises, allowing countries to learn from each other's experiences and share best practices. This cooperation can also help in developing and implementing early warning systems that can monitor potential vulnerabilities and prompt timely policy actions to avoid the emergence of new crises. Finally, it is important to ensure that consumers and investors are protected from financial fraud and predatory practices by establishing effective consumer protection frameworks and promoting financial education to raise awareness of potential risks. In sum, working towards preventing future banking crises requires a multifaceted approach that involves regulatory and supervisory reforms, macroprudential policies, diversification of the financial system, improvements in corporate governance, international cooperation, and consumer protection. By implementing these measures, we can build a more resilient and stable financial system, ensuring that we do not experience another significant banking crisis as the one we're going through right now."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bill O'Reilly: More proof that the left-wing media are blatantly dishonest Before he died, Andrew Breitbart spoke to \\"The Hollywood Reporter.\\" That was the last interview he ever did. Mr. Breitbart was upset because he believed the left-wing media was trying to destroy him. He pointed to Media Matters as the primary offender. Breitbart went on to accuse the far-left web site of receiving orders from the Democratic National Committee and directly passing those orders on to MSNBC. The blogger called it a rigged operation and was furious that a news agency as powerful as NBC would engage in dishonest practices. Now, for years \\"Talking Points\\" has been telling you that Media Matters, heavily funded by people like George Soros, has been corrupting the editorial process in America. And tonight we will give you one more vivid example. As you may know, I have been very critical of the oil companies jacking up gas prices when there's plenty of supply available in the U.S.A. Also, I've criticized President Obama for doing nothing about it when he could call the oil chieftains into the White House and get behind legislation to limit oil speculation. Enter Media Matters who calls me a hypocrite because they say I didn't hammer President Bush when gas prices rose during his tenure. Here is what Media Matters ran on its web site: O'REILLY: So the next time you hear a politician say he or she will bring down oil prices, understand its complete BS. If Americans want lower gas prices? Cut back. O'REILLY: Now Media Matters posted that clip nine days ago but they dishonestly edited it. Here is the full clip. O'REILLY: The Republican Party pretty much lets big oil do whatever it wants and refuses to rein in corrupt speculators who drive up the price of oil. So the next time you hear a politician say he or she will bring down oil prices? Understand its complete BS. If Americans want lower gas prices? Cut back. O'REILLY: I believe President Bush is a Republican, is he not? So, Media Matters lied as it always does. It takes video clips out of context every single day. And guess who went wild calling me hypocritical? NBC News in the form of MSNBC. I know, you’re shocked. Here is the bigger picture. We know that most of the media is actively rooting for President Obama to be re-elected. But it used to be that the liberal press just tilted coverage ignoring stories that reflected positively on conservatives and Republicans and hyping stories that help Democrats and liberals. But now… now national news agencies are actually lying to you, using out of context quotes that they get from web sites and fabricating things all in an effort to advance the liberal agenda. Later in this broadcast, you'll hear conservative Rick Santorum criticize Fox News for not helping him out… interesting. So the next time you hear Fox News is a right-wing operation, just mention Rick Santorum's contention. The danger here is that the presidential election will not be reported honestly. And that Americans who do not pay close attention will be deceived and therefore, their vote unfairly influenced. That's on them, of course, you can't force people to be fair and wise. But if Andrew Breitbart's contention is true, that the Democratic Party is now coordinating with Media Matters, who is coordinating with MSNBC, that is troubling and a blatant corruption of the First Amendment. Not easy being a celebrity in America. Everybody's got a camera; everybody's looking at you. Sometimes bad things can happen. Conservative author Jason Mattera walked up to comedian Chris Rock and -- well -- roll the tape. JASON MATTERA, AUTHOR: Big fan. Grew up in Brooklyn. How's it going. Can I take a picture with you? MATTERA: When you... when you said the Tea Party was insane and racist... O'REILLY: All right. Now, Mr. Mattera is a \\"Pinhead\\" because he misrepresented himself. I mean, Rock was kind enough to give him the picture. And then he turns around, and he ambushes him. You don't want to do that, all right? And even though he reacted poorly, I can't call Mr. Rock a \\"Pinhead\\", because that stuff has happened to me, and I don't always react in the best way.

Wi-Fi or WiFi () is a technology for wireless local area networking with devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. \\"Wi-Fi\\" is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, which restricts the use of the term \\"Wi-Fi Certified\\" to products that successfully complete interoperability certification testing.  Devices that can use Wi-Fi technology include personal computers, video-game consoles, phones and tablets, digital cameras, smart TVs, digital audio players and modern printers. Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the Internet via a WLAN and a wireless access point. Such an access point (or hotspot) has a range of about indoors and a greater range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points.  Wi-Fi most commonly uses the UHF and SHF ISM radio bands. Having no physical connections, it is more vulnerable to attack than wired connections, such as twisted pair.  In 1971, ALOHAnet connected the Hawaiian Islands with a UHF wireless packet network. ALOHAnet and the ALOHA protocol were early forerunners to Ethernet, and later the IEEE 802.11 protocols, respectively.  A 1985 ruling by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission released the ISM band for unlicensed use.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: I recall my mother's voice which called me to order, and often ended with some strong proverb to express the gravity of the wrong done. It was common practice for my mother to send me off soul-searching with a proverb. Of the many interactions I had with my mother those many years ago, one stands out with clarity. I remember the occasion when Mother sent me to the main road, about twenty yards away from the farmhouse, to invite a passing group of seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container along and collect dry cow dung   for making a fire. I was then to prepare the meal for the group of work-seekers. The thought of making an open fire outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that high heat, was enough to upset even an angel. I did not manage to hide my feelings from my mother, and after serving the group, she called me to the balcony, where she usually sat to attend to her sewing  . Looking straight into my eyes, she said, \\"Tsholofelo, why were you so unhappy when I requested you to prepare a meal for those poor people?\\" Despite my attempt to deny her allegation  , and using the heat of the fire and the sun as an excuse for my alleged behavior, Mother, giving me a firm look, said, \\"A foot has no nose.\\" It means, \\"You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you.\\" Had I denied the group of people a meal, it may have happened that, in my travels some time in the future, I found myself at the mercy of those very individuals. As if that was not enough to shame me, Mother continued, \\"A person is a person because of another person.\\" The answer is:","output":"Question: According to the article, what was the proverb told by the mother to teach her child a lesson and what was its implication? A) \\"A foot has no nose.\\" - You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you. B) \\"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\\" - Better to have a lesser but certain advantage than the possibility of a greater one that may come to nothing. C) \\"Every cloud has a silver lining.\\" - Every difficult or sad situation has a comforting or more hopeful aspect, even though this may not be immediately apparent. D) \\"You cannot have your cake and eat it too.\\" - You can't use or have something up and then still possess or keep it. Answer: A) \\"A foot has no nose.\\" - You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you.  Step-by-step reason: - First I analyzed the entire given text to understand the context and to find the key points that can be used to create a multi-choice question. - I noted that the main interaction of the story was between the protagonist and their mother, where the mother was teaching a lesson using a proverb. - The proverb she uses is \\"A foot has no nose\\". The article then explains the meaning of this proverb which is \\"You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you.\\" - Considering this, I formulated the question to ask what proverb the mother used and what its implication was. - For the false options in the multi-choice question, I selected commonly known proverbs and their meanings that did not match the context of the story to create a clear contrast with the correct answer. - The correct answer focuses on the essence of the proverb used in the original text."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What will happen to Casey?\\", is \\"unimportant\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","output":"No, \\"unimportant\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will happen to Casey?\\" because it doesn't provide any information or context about the situation or possible outcomes. Rather, it contradicts the purpose of the question, which is to seek clarification or predict the consequences of a particular action (in this case, Sasha putting Casey on hold). A valid answer to this question should consider various factors such as the reason for Sasha putting Casey on hold, the length of time Casey may be put on hold, and the relationship between Sasha and Casey. It should also take into consideration the context in which the call was initiated, the subject of the conversation, and Casey's likely reaction to being put on hold. For example, a more informative answer to the question could be: If Sasha puts Casey on hold for a short period of time to attend to another urgent call, Casey may stay on the line and patiently wait for Sasha to return. In this case, there may not be any major consequences, especially if the conversation was informal or about a matter that is not time-sensitive. On the other hand, if Sasha puts Casey on hold for a long period of time, leaves the call without any explanation, or if the conversation was about a critical or sensitive issue, Casey may become frustrated or irritated. Casey could hang up the call and potentially feel upset, leading to misunderstandings or conflicts in their relationship. Alternatively, Casey might also use this waiting time to multitask, like checking their emails or attending to other tasks, and may or may not be bothered by being put on hold. The impact of being put on hold would depend on the individual's personality, patience level, and perception of the situation. In some cases, the consequences of Sasha putting Casey on hold may be determined by external factors as well. For instance, if this call was a part of a professional setting and Casey was urgently required to make a decision or provide information, then being put on hold could lead to delays in decision-making, missed opportunities, or miscommunication among team members. In conclusion, providing a valid answer to the question \\"What will happen to Casey?\\" requires context and elaboration on various factors to give a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes. Using a term like \\"unimportant\\" does not contribute valuable information and is therefore not a valid answer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done.  Question: suppose good climate conditions happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER nests.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"The occurrence of good climate conditions can have a direct impact on bird nesting behavior, particularly on the size and number of nests. In favorable climates, we could observe both more and smaller nests as birds enjoy an abundance of food and suitable habitats. The given process of nest building may be influenced by these beneficial conditions as well. Firstly, let's discuss how good climate conditions can lead to an increased number of nests. Favorable climate conditions can promote a greater abundance of food resources such as insects, seeds, and fruits, which are critical to bird survival and reproduction. Birds that have access to abundant food resources are more likely to breed successfully and produce more offspring. As a result, the need for nests will increase as birds need safe and comfortable spaces for laying eggs and raising their young. Secondly, it is also essential to consider how these favorable conditions might affect the size of the nests. Under good climate conditions, birds will have access to more nesting materials, such as twigs, leaves, and other natural debris. Additionally, there will likely be less competition for nesting spots among birds, reducing the need for large nests as a way to ward off potential rivals or intruders. This availability of nesting materials and space can lead to a trend towards smaller nests, as birds will be more capable of building and maintaining smaller nests without compromising their offspring's safety or comfort. Now, let's delve into the second part of the question - the influence of this supposed perturbation on the second effect mentioned, which is the trend towards smaller nests. Given that the good climate conditions encourage birds to build both a greater number of nests and smaller nests, it can be concluded that there would be a direct correlation between the two effects. This means that the perturbation - the favorable climate conditions - will have a greater effect on the second effect mentioned, smaller nests. The abundance of nesting materials in good climate conditions will make it easier for birds to construct a smaller nest while still retaining the necessary structural integrity and safety for their offspring. In conclusion, the occurrence of good climate conditions will likely have both more and smaller nests as a result of increased food resources, availability of nesting materials, and diminished competition for nesting sites. The impact of the favorable climate conditions has a more significant effect on the second effect mentioned, leading to smaller nests for birds to raise their offspring. The birds will be more capable of building and maintaining these smaller nests, making it a more viable option for their reproductive needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Still looking for their first win of the season, the Bengals went home, donned their alternate uniforms, and played a Week 9 duel with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati clawed first as QB Ryan Fitzpatrick completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Chad Ocho Cinco.  In the second quarter, the Bengals increased their lead as Fitzpatrick hooked up with Ocho Cinco again on a 10-yard TD pass.  The Jaguars would end the half on kicker Josh Scobee's 52-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued its hot streak as RB Cedric Benson got a 7-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Jacksonville began to rally as Scobee nailed a 26-yard field goal, FB Montell Owens returned the fumbled kickoff 18 yards for a touchdown, and RB Maurice Jones-Drew got a 1-yard TD pass.  Fortunately, the Bengals' defense prevented the Jaguars from getting the 2-point conversion, allowing Cincinnati to finally get its first win of the season.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

It is the oldest of the five \\"académies\\" of the institute.  - The Nouveau Roman (\\"new novel\\") is a type of 1950s French novel that diverged from classical literary genres. Émile Henriot coined the term in an article in the popular French newspaper \\"Le Monde\\" on May 22, 1957 to describe certain writers who experimented with style in each novel, creating an essentially new style each time.

The huge crowds mean lots of money for the economies of Mediterranean countries.Italy's 30,000 hotels are booked every summer.And 13 million people camp out on French Beaches,parks,and roadsides.Spain's long sandy coastline attracts more people than anywhere else.37 million tourists visit yearly,or one tourist for every person living in Spain.

Q:How much can environment affect intelligence? In one study, striking increases in IQ occurred in 25 children who were moved from an orphanage  to more stimulating(,) environments.The children, who were all considered mentally retarded and unadoptable, were moved to an institution where they received personal attention from adults.Later, these supposedly retarded children were adopted by parents who gave them love, a family ,and a stimulating home environment.The children gained an average of 29 IQ points.For one child, the increase was an amazing 58 points.A second group of initially less \\"retarded\\" children, who stayed in the orphanage, lost an average of 26 IQ points. Other encouraging results can be found in early childhood education programs, which provide stimulating intellectual experiences for disadvantaged children.In one study, children from low-income families were given enriched environments from early infancy  through preschool.By age 2 their IQ scores were already higher than those in a control group.More important, they were still 5 points higher seven years later.High-quality enrichment programs such as Head Start can prevent children from falling behind in school. A particularly striking environmental effect is the fact that 14 nations have shown average IQ gains of from 5 to 25 points during the last 30 years.These IQ boosts, averaging 15 points, occurred in far too short a time for genetics to explain them.It is more likely that the gains reflect environmental forces, such as improved education, nutrition, and living in a technologically complex society. Which of the following is NOT mentioned as an environmental factor that affects IQ  _  . A) Good nutrition. B) Improved technology. C) Better education. D) Food pollution. A:","output":"D) Food pollution is NOT mentioned as an environmental factor that affects IQ. The environmental factors that are mentioned include good nutrition, improved technology, and better education. These factors contribute to an individual's intelligence and may have a significant impact on their cognitive development. In some cases, such as the study mentioned, children who were moved from orphanages to more stimulating environments experienced significant increases in their IQ scores. Early childhood education programs that provide intellectually stimulating experiences for disadvantaged children can also lead to an increase in IQ scores over time. These enrichment programs, such as Head Start, can prevent children from falling behind in school and help to bridge the gap in cognitive development between children from low-income families and their more privileged peers. Additionally, IQ gains in 14 nations over the last 30 years, ranging from 5 to 25 points, suggest that environmental forces, such as improved education, nutrition, and living in a technologically complex society, play a significant role in affecting intelligence. These environmental factors may contribute to cognitive growth and development, far beyond what genetic factors alone can achieve. In conclusion, while genetics play an important role in determining an individual's intelligence, environmental factors such as good nutrition, improved technology, and better education can have a significant impact on a person's IQ as well. Therefore, efforts should be made to create conducive environments that foster cognitive growth and development, particularly for disadvantaged children who may not have access to the same resources as their more privileged peers. In doing so, we can help to create a more equitable and intellectually rich society for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: The city was gray but the buildings contrasted with dirt red. The morning settled my nerves a bit more and before long the train pulled into the station. Boston had a slower feel, much slower than New York. The air was cool and peppered with moisture. I knew I was close to the ocean. Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city. My eyes darted from color to color, sign to sign, connection to connection. I floated like a ghost and thought about crying. There were few people out so I found a relative ease in that but my mind still jumped around reckless. I needed to find Kim. I saw a silent pay phone with a dangling phonebook and headed towards it until I remembered that phone books don't normally list cell phones. Kim wasn't the type of girl to list herself in the phonebook either.

The Lions then got their only points of the first half with a 33-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Cowboys responded with a 35-yard field goal just before halftime. After the break, Dallas added more points with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten, putting them up 27-3. The Lions responded with two consecutive defensive touchdowns: first a 34-yard interception return by Bobby Carpenter, then a 56-yard pick-6 by Chris Houston. The Cowboys scored their final points of the game with a 23-yard field goal late in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Lions continued their comeback with a 23-yard touchdown catch by Calvin Johnson. They made it a three-point game with a 51-yard field goal by Jason Hanson, then Romo threw an interception to Stephen Tulloch, and took their first lead of the game late in the final quarter when Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 2 yards out to become only the second player in NFL history to record at least two touchdown catches in 4 straight games (the other to do so is former Vikings receiver Cris Carter).

Hold the netball with your dominant hand.. +Aim toward the basket while the other team shoots. Defend the court at the five-foot mark.. +Your right arm should point up through the air. There are 200 methods to shoot in netball, so you can search online or come up with one that suits you..","output":"Proper balance is key to an accurate netball shot, so be sure that your weight is distributed evenly between both feet. Hold the netball with your dominant hand. After positioning yourself properly inside the shooting semicircle and aligning your body with the netball post, it's time to focus on your balance and grip. Distributing your weight evenly between your feet prevents you from losing balance in the middle of the shot and affecting your shooting accuracy. This stability will also give you confidence when taking the shot. Use your dominant hand to hold the netball. Your fingers should be spread wide, creating a comfortable grip on the ball. The ball should not be touching your palm; instead, it should rest on your fingertips for better control. Your non-dominant hand should be on the side of the ball, helping you stabilize it and guide it during the shot. Next, focus on your shooting technique. Extend your shooting arm upwards with your elbow slightly bent, forming an \\"L\\" shape. Your shooting hand should be facing the net, with your wrist flicking forward as you release the ball. This flicking motion will generate backspin on the ball, making it travel straighter and giving it a softer touch when it reaches the hoop. While doing this, your non-dominant hand should remain steady and away from the ball, allowing your dominant hand to smoothly guide the shot. Maintain a consistent shooting routine to refine and perfect your technique. The more you practice, the more you'll develop muscle memory, which will contribute to your overall accuracy in netball. Concentrate on your stance, balance, grip, and shooting mechanics, and always be mindful of your body position. Finally, remember that every player has their own unique shooting style. While the above tips apply to most players, it's essential to pay attention to your own strengths and weaknesses and make adjustments as needed.

McCain responds angrily to report on drones Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) sharply criticized congressional appropriators Thursday for secretly slipping language into the omnibus spending bill that preserves the CIA’s role in lethal counterterrorism operations. McCain was responding to a report in Thursday's Washington Post that revealed that Congress is on the verge of blocking President Obama’s plan to shift control of the U.S. drone campaign from the CIA to the Defense Department. The measure, buried within the 1,500-page, 1.1 trillion federal budget plan, would restrict the use of any funding to transfer unmanned aircraft or the authority to carry out drone strikes from the CIA to the Pentagon, officials said. Waving around a copy of The Post while speaking on the Senate floor, McCain blasted his colleagues on the Senate and House Appropriations committee for making such a key decision without formally and publicly consulting the authorizing committees for the CIA and Defense Department. “The Appropriations Committee has no business making these decisions,\\" he said. \\"The job of the Armed Services Committee and the job of the Intelligence Committee is to authorize these things.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the city that was bombed in the Bristol Blitz?  Bristol, the largest city in South West England, has an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church.

To secure commercial publication in 1896, Crane agreed to remove profanity, but he also made stylistic revisions. Bowers's approach was to preserve the stylistic and literary changes of 1896, but to revert to the 1893 readings where he believed that Crane was fulfilling the publisher's intention rather than his own. There were, however, intermediate cases that could reasonably have been attributed to either intention, and some of Bowers's choices came under fire – both as to his judgment, and as to the wisdom of conflating readings from the two different versions of Maggie. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): When was Maggie first published?","output":"Maggie was first published in 1893.

Rome, Italy (CNN) -- A Nigerian man who sang in a Vatican choir arranged gay liaisons for an Italian government official who served in the unpaid role of papal usher, according to transcripts of wiretaps collected by Italian authorities.  The wiretaps were gathered as part of an investigation into how public-works contracts were awarded.  The purported conversations were between Angelo Balducci, who oversaw the Italian government's awarding of construction contracts -- including work on the airport at Perugia -- and Thomas Chinedu Ehiem, a 39-year-old Nigerian singer. They were recorded between April 14, 2008, and January 20, 2010.  In addition to working for the government, Balducci served as a \\"gentleman of his holiness,\\" also known as a papal usher or \\"Vatican gentleman.\\" The main responsibility of the ceremonial position is to welcome heads of state to the Vatican and escort them to see the Pope.  Balducci is one of three public officials who, along with a businessman, have been jailed on charges related to corruption in the public works department. The public officials are alleged to have awarded contracts to businessmen who offered them favors, money, sex, and/or house remodeling in exchange. The suspects, who deny the charges, are in \\"cautionary custody\\" though they have not been charged or indicted.  The Italian news media have nicknamed the scandal \\"grande opere,\\" which translates as \\"big works.\\" The transcripts of the wiretaps were made public on Wednesday and widely disseminated in the media.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - anger - nodding - listening - take notes - writing down Answer:","output":"The clicking away of a shorthand typewriter was taking notes while hearing testimony.  When a testimony is given during a legal proceeding or any formal event, it is important to document the statements and information shared by the witnesses and participants. A shorthand typewriter, which was commonly used before the advent of modern technology, served as an effective tool for transcribing spoken words into written form rapidly and accurately. Shorthand typewriting is a specialized skill that involves the use of a particular typewriter and a unique shorthand writing system. This system is designed to capture words and phrases as they are spoken, using a set of abbreviations and symbols for common words and letter combinations. A skilled shorthand typist can type at speeds similar to the pace of normal speech, ensuring that important details are not missed during the recording process.  The transcription created by the shorthand typewriter during the testimony serves multiple purposes, such as: 1. Documentation: A formal record of the testimony helps attorneys, judges, and other legal professionals refer back to the statements and evidence presented during the proceedings. 2. Analysis: Legal professionals may need to review the transcribed testimony to build their case, identify inconsistencies in statements or evidence, and decide on the best course of action in the future. 3. Appeals and Legal Precedent: Testimonies transcribed by shorthand typewriters can be referenced in potential appeals, as well as in future cases that may involve similar legal issues or arguments, thereby shaping the legal landscape. In conclusion, the clicking away of a shorthand typewriter during a testimony serves the critical function of taking notes and preserving an accurate record of the spoken words. This detailed and valuable document can then be used by legal professionals and others involved in the proceedings for various purposes, such as analyzing the case, preparing for future hearings or appeals, and establishing legal precedents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have no idea how a Texan (the director, Douglas McGrath) and the American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about Ms. Paltrow was in the first place! I had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her Oscar-winning \\"Shakespeare In Love\\" performance but she gets all the beats right here--she is nigh on perfect as Emma Woodhouse. She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare but she should be remembered for this.Of course, she's surrounded by a great supporting cast including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson et al...Jeremy Northam is very appealing as the love interest, even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to Paltrow (in the process, allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship); several years on, Ewan's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96 and, personally, I find puckish Alan Cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays. But the standout is, without a doubt, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; what this version needs is a scene where Emma reconciles with Miss Bates, as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn. The film is worth watching (again even) for her performance alone.All in all, this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the British class system.

He slugged .812, which was fourth-highest of all time, and broke his on-base percentage record with a .609 average. Bonds passed Mays on the career home run list by hitting his 661st off of Ben Ford (baseball) on April 13, He then hit his 700th off of Jake Peavy on September 17. Bonds hit 45 home runs in 373 at-bats, and struck out just 41 times, putting himself in elite company, as few major leaguers have ever had more home runs than strikeouts in a season. Bonds would win his fourth consecutive MVP award and his seventh overall. His seven MVP awards are four more than any other player in history. In addition, no other player from either league has been awarded the MVP four times in a row. (The MVP award was first given in 1931). The 40-year-old Bonds also broke Willie Stargells 25-year record as the oldest player to win a Most Valuable Player Award (Stargell, at 39 years, 8 months, was National League co-MVP with Keith Hernandez in 1979).

Instead, implement the following tips to amp up your retirement savings, cut spending and find extra sources of income. Check out these 30 tips on how to retire early. While these retirement tips can help support your early retirement goals, you need a strategy to get you there. Figure out what it will cost for you to get into an early retirement and how much cash you will need to comfortably live on. A solid plan can help direct all your actions toward reaching the goal of an earlier retirement, and hopefully with less stress.

If you imagine a comfy retirement as a vacation home and monthly cruise ship trips, revisit that vision so you don’t have to bleed cash but can still retire in style. Instead of two homes, for example, why not live in your favorite vacation destination and pocket the principal from selling your primary residence? If you’re not sure where to start but know you have more to learn, take classes on fiscal responsibility, investing and saving. There are numerous financial advisors and consumer education sources that offer classes and literature — online and offline — that can help you learn more so you can make better decisions. No matter what age you are, don’t wait to get started on saving for an early retirement. It’s easy to get caught up today and forget about what tomorrow brings. The longer you wait, the longer it will be until you can comfortably retire. Sorry, folks: Simply skipping that 4 latte in the morning ain’t gonna cut it. It takes a much more committed approach where “sacrifices” are viewed in a new light. “It’s amazing when I work through the numbers that some people think manicures, landscapers and maids are a need,” said Michael Chadwick, a certified financial planner and CEO of Chadwick Financial Advisors in Unionville, Conn. That’s right, all of it. First: Is it time to pay off your home? You might not have the resources now to plunk down one huge check, but consider savvy alternatives such as switching from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage. Second: Do the same with loans and credit cards, as high interest eats up income fast. Once you get rid of your debt, do everything in your power to avoid falling back into it. Don’t rely on credit to get by or use your credit card to splurge on an item you know you can’t really afford. If you overspend and carry a balance, you will be tied to paying off the debts plus interest when you could be saving that money for retirement instead. While it’s risky to count on unknowns such as an inheritance, you might have cash streams available outside the traditional retirement realm, said Jennifer E. Acuff, principal wealth advisor with TrueWealth Management in Atlanta. For example, “Understand your options with respect to any pensions you might be entitled to from current or previous employers,” she said. If you’re in your 20s and start investing now, you’re in luck, said Joseph Jennings Jr., investment director for PNC Wealth Management in Maryland. “Due to the power of compounding, the first dollar saved is the most important, as it has the most growth potential over time,” he said. As an example, Jennings compared 10,000 saved at age 25 versus 60. “The 25-year-old has 40 years of growth potential at the average retirement age of 65, whereas 10,000 saved at age 60 only has five years of growth potential.” Calculator: How much will I need to save for retirement? The wisdom of taking advantage of a company match on the 401k is well established — but think about how that power is accelerated if a working couple does it with two such company matches. “If your employer has a matching contribution inside of your company’s plan, make sure you always contribute at least enough to receive it,” said Kevin J. Meehan, regional president-Chicago with Wealth Enhancement Group. “You are essentially leaving money on the table if you don’t.” The methodology is simple, yet the results can be profound: Put money into monthly, systematic investments during your working years. “There’s no other element of investment planning or portfolio management that’s more essential over the long term,” said Jesse Mackey, chief investment officer of 4Thought Financial Group in Syosset, N.Y. How about some free money? The ESPP typically works by payroll deduction, with the company converting the money into shares every six months at a 15 percent discount. “If you immediately liquidate those shares every time they’re delivered, it’s like you get a guaranteed 15 percent rate of return,” said Dave Yeske, managing director at the wealth management firm Yeske Buie and director of the financial planning program at Golden Gate University. “Add the after-tax proceeds to your supplemental retirement savings.” Whether you choose to open an IRA, Roth IRA, 401k or Roth 401k, it’s important to choose a retirement vehicle that not only grows your savings, but also provides tax benefits. Don’t just rely on a savings account. There’s no sense in depriving yourself of every single thing, especially well-deserved time off. But Yeske points out that you can save a ton in 150 countries through a service called HomeExchange.com, which helps you “exchange” homes or apartments all over the world. “My wife and I have stayed for free in London, Amsterdam, New York and Costa Rica,” he said. “And when you’re staying in someone’s home or apartment, you don’t have to eat out at a restaurant for every meal, so your food costs nothing more than if you were at home.” To get to an early retirement, you have to periodically revisit your IRA, 401k or other retirement account to make sure your money doesn’t grow cobwebs. For example, the way your retirement account is diversified shouldn’t put too much emphasis on low-yield investments — such as money market funds and low-yielding bonds. “Dividends can pile up in the money market account, typically earning one one-hundredth of a percent,” Yeske said. “Make sure your cash is invested properly.” In this curse of consumerism, you buy something expensive, feel excited and then scout for something else to purchase when the “new car smell” wears off. And it’s a huge trap if you want an early retirement, said Pete, a finance blogger who retired in his 30s. Another advantage: “Here in the rich world,” he wrote for MrMoneyMustache.com, “the only widespread form of slavery is the economic type.” Early retirement doesn’t necessarily mean retiring all of your income, especially if you find ways to bring in money without hard work. Investing in rental properties is one way you can create a cash flow stream — and you can minimize the labor by hiring a property manager. Or, set up an internet sales business, and hire a part-timer to fulfill orders and track stock based on volume. By serving in the military, you can also serve yourself. Members commonly retire after 20 years, living off generous pensions and health insurance. Although members of the military should expect 401k-style retirement plans in the future, an earlier-than-normal retirement should still remain an option for many men and women. Not only does eating out cost considerably more than cooking for yourself at home, it also tends to involve more calories, sodium and fat that do not contribute to your well-being. Instead, planning and creating batch-style meals can cut your costs. Even creating a garden for some vegetables can help reduce your food bill, which means you should have more money to put in your retirement savings to help you retire early. Although you might be busy, it can make more fiscal sense to do certain things around the home yourself. This means no maid service, gardener or pool technician. While paying for these services are convenient, they might be draining you of potential retirement savings. Look at what household expenses you could reasonably cut, and channel that money into your retirement fund. An added bonus: You could even get in better shape as you take on more of these responsibilities. Also, you get the satisfaction from doing the work yourself. If you want to retire early, you need to cut back on some of your overpriced luxuries and services. Of course, it’s important to allow yourself a balanced life — making time for entertainment, exercise, friends, family and so on. However, there are things you can do to cut back on expensive monthly services, such as cable TV, internet and phone. Instead, look for alternatives like new on-demand streaming services and affordable mobile phone plans.

Some popular outdoor activities that you can enjoy on the cheap include taking a walk, hiking or riding a bike. Or, go tent camping rather than taking an expensive vacation. While you love your car, it’s probably costing you a significant amount of money in terms of the gas and maintenance, as well as the initial investment and ongoing car payments. If you live in an area that allows you to depend less on a car, take advantage of it. Find opportunities to walk or ride a bike. Or, take public transportation whenever possible, and reap the benefits of healthier and more cost-effective living. Get off the couch, and do things that remind you of your mission to retire early. Although you don’t want to waste money on activities you can do for free, it’s OK to splurge a little on certain excursions and lessons — especially if they keep you motivated to retire early. So plan a cruise this summer, take up some golf lessons or treat yourself to a spa day. Many early retirees and successful people in general will tell you that staying positive helped keep them on the right track to accomplishing their goals. People who stay positive are also less likely to become ill and are better able to cope with hardship and stress, according to the Mayo Clinic. As corny as it might sound, this positivity could keep you from overspending and help you stick to your early retirement goal. With each choice you make, ask yourself if your decision will make you happy. Impulses can lead to poor choices and bad spending habits. So, always think about how your everyday decisions can impact your life goals.

However, when you stop spoiling your kids, you’ll have more money to use for an early retirement. You might also find some good opportunities to teach your children better spending habits. Never put saving for your child’s college tuition over saving for your retirement — this is especially true if you’re determined to retire early. With tuition costing tens of thousands of dollars over four years, it can take a big chunk out of your early retirement savings fund. Instead, focus on saving for retirement first and help your kid apply for scholarships, grants, work-study and part-time jobs to help offset college costs. Some middle agers are selling the bulk of their possessions — including their homes — and moving into tricked-out tiny houses, mobile homes and houseboats. These options open the door to a life of leisure travel and can eliminate major expenses, such as property taxes and mortgage payments. You might think that because you’ve hit a certain age, it’s too late to retire early. It doesn’t have to be. You can implement these tips at any point and start seeing the results.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"His colleagues and contemporaries in France\\" correctly answer the question \\"What brought about the final split with Sartre?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"His colleagues and contemporaries in France\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"What brought about the final split with Sartre?\\" Based on the paragraph, the correct answer would be \\"the publication of The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

UPDATED:. 22:39 EST, 8 January 2014. Lara Bingle's best friend Vicki Lee has sparked rumours that the Australian model and her boyfriend Sam Worthington have tied the knot by posting a cryptic Instagram snap on Wednesday. In the image, Lara is seen standing at a wedding altar on a Western Australian beach, wearing a black bikini. Lee also captioned the picture: 'Here comes the bride, all dressed in bikini'. Wedding fever: Lara Bingle's best friend Vicki Lee has sparked rumours that the model has married boyfriend Sam Worthington by posting this snap of the star standing at a wedding altar. The setting couldn't be anymore stunning, with the 26-year-old posing in front of a backdrop of crystal blue water. Several white chairs are set up on the sand as well as flowers and a makeshift altar made out of bamboo and swathed in white fabric. After Vicki posted the image, Lara joked in a comment underneath:: 'It's vicki and my wedding :)' Romantic outing: Lara and Sam were last seen together over the weekend when they went shopping and enjoyed lunch in Perth. Romantic meal: The couple enjoyed a meal at burger joint Grill'd in Scarborough Beach. On Thursday afternoon, Lara re tweeted a post from Who magazine's Twitter page. '@MsLaraBingle is not or has not married Sam Worthington in a beach ceremony, her rep confirms to @WHOmagazine,' it read. Lara and Sam have been inseparable over the past few months after meeting at the Cotton On Foundation's Global Citizen Concert headlined by Bono, Kings of Leon, Stevie Wonder and Alicia Keys at Central Park back in September. As an ambassador to the brand, Lara was guest of honour, and was joined by Sam, Natalie Imbruglia and Scott Eastwood for the charity music event. According to onlookers, 'sparks flew' between the pair during the concert, and they soon were seeing the sights of NYC and later Paris and other cities around Europe together. Inseparable: The happy couple also spent Christmas together and were snapped on the 23rd of December again in Sam's home state. Sam clearly likes to date women from his home country as he briefly dated Aussie singer and actress Sophie Monk this year, and before that was in a relationship with Australian bartender Crystal Humphries. Meanwhile, Lara was formerly engaged to Australian Cricket Captain Michael Clarke, but she most recently dated fashion designer Gareth Moody, 35, and then New York DJ Nick Cohen. Lara is currently in Western Australia spending time with Sam while he films his new movie, Paper Planes. Friends at sea: Lara enjoyed a cruise around Rottnest Island in WA with gal pals Emmi Moore and Nadia Rosa on Monday. The Avatar star grew up in Perth before making it big in the film industry and he spends a lot of his time these days Stateside. It was recently announced that the 37-year-old actor will reprise his role as Jake Sully in James Cameron's long-awaited Avatar sequel. The movie will start shooting in New Zealand next year, with a tentative release date set for 2016. So in love: Lara and Sam have been posting several romantic snaps of one another on their Instagram pages of late. Cute: The pair have only been dating for a few months, but are clearly smitten. Avatar was the highest-grossing film in history and made 2.7 billion worldwide, along with winning three Academy Awards. Cameron has already revealed he has 'an idea for a fourth' movie in the franchise and said the forthcoming motion picture will tell the story of the 'early expeditions' on the moon Pandora. He told MTV News: 'Basically it goes back to the early expeditions of Pandora, and kind of what went wrong with the humans and the Na'vi and what that was like to be an explorer and living in that world. Earlier this week, Lara was seen spending time on a 30m super yacht, cruising around Rottnest Island with good gal pals Emmi Moore and Nadia Rosa. Best pals: Lara's other love of her life is her best friend Vicki Lee, who posted the cryptic snap. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Given the question: Article: Early one morning, more than a hundred years ago, an American inventor called Elias Howe finally fell asleep. He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem. It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Despite his exhaustion, Howe slept badly. He tossed  and turned. Then he had a nightmare He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine. When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine.

Remember that fee comparisons aren't created equal.The two most debated aspects of 401(k) plans are breadth of investment offerings and the fees associated with those offerings. Blanchett said complaints about investment options are on the wane, rightly so. \\"Most plans are OK there, and to be honest, the things that are missing are the ones people won't realize they are missing.\\" Fees, though, continue to be a bone of contention in the retirement plan market. There's just one very important thing to remember if an employee does want to discuss fees with their employer: You have to compare the fees on your plan to fees on similarly-sized plans. Sure, in a perfect world it wouldn't matter if you worked for Exxon Mobil or a local grocery store in terms of the competitiveness of plan fees, but the truth is, it makes all the difference in the world: The larger the plan is, the better it can negotiate with vendors for lower-fee investment offerings. \\"When someone tells me they think their 401(k) fees are too high, I always ask, 'Compared to what?'\\" Adams said. When an online financial tool is suggesting that you're paying too high a fee, know what the basis of comparison is. It's not just size. Are there fees or services you have access to in your plan but aren't using? Remember the wider demographic of the plan: Sometimes you might pay for a certain service that is part of the package and one that is of value to the plan as a whole, Adams said. \\"There are legitimate complaints,\\" Johnson said, but he again stressed being an educated complainer. \\"When I meet with individual clients, my advice to them if they want to have this conversation with the boss is to go in and offer solutions. If you go on BrightScope and it says your plan fees are high compared to the average, then go in and say, 'Hey, here is what Fidelity will come in and offer, and here is what Vanguard will do.\\" 6. Understanding the chess match of the company match.A company match pegged to an employee contribution is one of the best benefits of a 401(k)—Blanchett said research shows it improves participant behavior—but it is at the discretion of the employer. For many small-business employers, the company match was a feature that became a casualty of the recession. Now that business in America is booming again, have all those rescinded matches come back? The experts say no, and that's one delicate conversation that employees of small firms have every right to seek out with their bosses. \\"We're quite a few years removed from the crisis, and if a plan has not added [the match] back, if I'm that person, I would ask: 'It was in here before. Why isn't it back?'\\" Blanchett said. \\"The biggest complaint we get is that there is no match or the company cut down on match. That's No. 1,\\" Johnson said. Even big public companies cut back on the match, and at companies of 50 or less employees, the issue is widespread, he said. \\"Five years ago, people didn't know if they would survive and now are a little out of survival mode and asking where does the business invest,\\" Johnson said. \\"They could invest more in the 401(k), and it's an easy thing to do.\\" Of course, easier said than done. \\"The reality is it's a form of confrontation,\\" Blanchett said. But it's also a negotiation: Even if the employer does not agree to restart the company match, it's possible they could offer an employee a pay raise to make up for it. Johnson said another potential negotiation is with employers who feel bad about cutting a match, and even if they won't bring it back yet, they might be more willing to listen to employee suggestions for lower-fee 401(k) plans to switch over to. \\"That's where you have to have a mature conversation and put yourself in the shoes of the other person, sniff out whether the boss is being greedy or really having a hard time keeping the doors open,\\" Johnson said. He said it is also important to remember that in many cases, employers may have simply lost sight of the match relative to all of the other issues they deal with as business recovers. Sometimes it's not that they are thinking of the cost, it's just that they don't have the time to think about it at all. \\"I have the conversation with a lot of bosses who own a dental or medical practice or small manufacturing or sales company—the core of our economy, with 15 to 50 employees—and they are just busy folks and often haven't thought about any of these issues long enough to implement solutions,\\" Johnson said. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text discuss how to talk to an employer about your 401(k) with a focus on comparing fees and understanding the company match. 1. Comparing fees: It is important to compare the fees on your 401(k) plan to fees on similarly-sized plans. Knowing the basis of comparison when discussing fees with your employer is crucial. Be an educated complainer and offer solutions by suggesting alternatives like Fidelity or Vanguard. 2. Understanding the company match: The company match is a major benefit of a 401(k) plan but is at the discretion of the employer. Many small businesses removed the match feature during the recession, and not all have reinstated it. Employees of these companies can approach their bosses and ask why the match hasn't been reinstated. Keep in mind that employers may have lost sight of the match amid other business recovery priorities, so having a mature conversation about it can lead to potential negotiations for lower-fee 401(k) plans or salary raises for employees."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What of many of them have been destroyed? Movie plot title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her...

In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Drugs such as low-dose aspirin (pictured) would be more effective if timed with the body’s natural rhythms, new research says. Many popular pills – including some cholesterol-busting statins – would be better taken at night than in the morning, scientists believe. They say widely-used tablets such as low-dose aspirin would be more effective if timed with the body’s natural rhythms. Scientists showed that individual genes are governed by the body clock and become more or less active at certain times of the day. They found that nearly half of all mouse genes work harder at some points in the 24-hour cycle than others, with ‘rush hours’ of activity just before dawn and dusk. Although the study was on mice, most mouse genes have ‘twins’ in humans. Many common drugs home in on these genes and so should be most effective when the genes are most active. This is particularly important in the case of medicines such as aspirin, which are broken down quickly by the body. The University of Pennsylvania study found 56 of the 100 best-selling drugs in the US act on genes that ebb and flow over the day. Similarly, 119 of the 250 pills on the World Health Organisation’s list of essential medicines may work better at a certain time of the day, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. Pennsylvania University’s pharmacology professor John Hogenesch said more work is needed to say when is the best time to take each pill. However, research already shows that low-dose aspirin, taken daily by millions of Britons who have survived a heart attack or stroke to keep their blood thin, is best taken at night. This ensures the drug has time to work before morning – the peak time for heart attacks. Likewise, simvastatin, one of the most widely-used cholesterol-lowering statin pills, should also be taken at bedtime. This is because the drug works by blocking a key step in the production of cholesterol, and the gene behind this step is most active at night. Patients are already told to take simvastatin in the evening, however many still take it at the wrong time. Some will take the drug in the morning to prevent them forgetting. Individual genes are governed by the body clock and become more or less active at certain times of the day. Many common drugs home in on these genes – and so should be most effective if given when the genes are most active, say U.S. researchers. Professor Hogenesch said: ‘There’s a huge opportunity for improving the action of existing drugs through better timing.’ Heidi Wright, of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ‘Simvastatin…is best taken at bedtime as your liver makes most of your cholesterol at night. ‘Low-dose aspirin works by making your blood less sticky. There is research that says more heart attacks occur in the morning, so…reducing this stickiness by the morning could help prevent heart attacks.’ Women are putting their lives at risk by ignoring the symptoms of heart disease, researchers warn. Many brush pain off as indigestion or a pulled muscle and wait days or weeks before seeing a doctor. But in fact it could be a symptom of angina, where one of the arteries to the heart gets blocked, or a mild heart attack. Harvard researchers urge women not to assume heart attacks are a ‘man’s disease’ and to seek help. Statistically, women are less likely to have a heart attack than men before the menopause, but afterwards they overtake them and are more at risk. Furthermore, heart attacks in women tend to be more severe than in men – possibly because they have ignored the warning signs. Lead author Dr Catherine Kreatsoulas, of the Harvard School of Public Health, said: ‘Both men and women go into a phase of denial – but women seem to stay in this stage longer.’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article tells us that some medicines, like low-dose aspirin and cholesterol-lowering statins, work better if we take them at the right time of day.

Requiring all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years is too onerous for travelers Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The U.S. State Department has asked American embassies and consulates around the world to identify certain groups that should get extra scrutiny when they apply for visas. A series of directives also instructs U.S. diplomatic posts overseas to review the social media accounts of visa applicants who are suspected of terrorist ties or of having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas. The diplomatic cables sent by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directed embassies to convene security and intelligence working groups to determine criteria for \\"population sets\\" that would warrant increased scrutiny before traveling to the U.S. Even if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a visa, those identified as meeting the criteria would require additional scrutiny, leading to a possible visa denial. It is the first evidence of a plan for the \\"extreme vetting\\" of foreigners entering the United States that President Donald Trump promised during his campaign. The four cables sent between March 10 and March 17 do not define which groups would be considered among the \\"population sets\\" requiring more scrutiny. But in the first glimpse into what \\"extreme vetting\\" may look like under the Trump administration, one of Tillerson's memos would have added to the interview process questions about an applicant's workplaces, employers, addresses and travel history going back 15 years, as well as all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years. The questions were withdrawn in a following memo, pending approval of the list by another federal agency. The directives, first reported by Reuters, quickly drew criticism from rights groups and others who've accused Trump of discriminating against Muslims through his now-suspended ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \\"These measures could provide license for discrimination based on national origin and religion,'' human rights group Amnesty International wrote in a letter to Tillerson on Thursday. \\"They...

There were also calls to extend the boycott to include French luxury goods and cosmetic products. Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. Some burned French flags, some added Swastika (due to its conotaions with Nazism) to the French flag, and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of French consulates and embassy. Some shoppers who insisted on entering one of the Carrefour stores in Kunming were blocked by boycotters wielding large Chinese flags and hit by water bottles. Hundreds of people joined Anti-French rallies in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao, which quickly spread to other cities like Xi'an, Harbin and Jinan. Carrefour denied any support or involvement in the Tibetan issue, and had its staff in its Chinese stores wear uniforms emblazoned with the Chinese national flag and caps with Olympic insignia and as well as the words \\"Beijing 2008\\" to show its support for the games.

Use the following casting schedule on your kiln to fuse the glass:  Turn the temperature to 250 °F (121 °C) for 10 minutes. Raise the temperature to around 1,465 °F (796 °C) and leave it on that temperature for 10 minutes. Turn the heat down to 950 °F (510 °C) and leave the kiln at that temperature for 1 hour. Decrease the temperature to 850 °F (454 °C) and wait for 15 minutes. Turn the heat to 100 °F (38 °C). Leave the kiln closed and wait a day before you open it. Don't touch the mold or reach into the kiln until the outside is cool to the touch. The time it takes the kiln to cool will vary. Measure the temperature of the kiln an hour after it fired. This difference between the temperature it fired at and the temperature an hour later is the cooling rate per hour for the kiln. For example, if your kiln fired at 1,500 °F (820 °C) and an hour later the temperature is 1,250 °F (677 °C), the cooling rate is 250 °F (121 °C) per hour. Put gloves on when removing the glass from the kiln as it still might be quite warm. Place the glass on a steady work surface. Use a diamond pad or a grinding stone to make it smooth and get rid of any blemishes. Rub uneven or imperfect areas of the glass with the diamond pad or grinding stone to smooth out the imperfections. Hold the mold gently as you rub it with the diamond pad or grinding stone. Kilns are programmed to turn off after they're finished firing. If you want to, you can force the kiln to turn off by using the on/off switch on the kiln. When you're finished with the kiln, plug it out to cut off the electrical supply reaching it. Summary:","output":"During kiln firing, avoid direct contact due to high heat.

Test sentence: \\"This girl will not buy bread, will she buy bread?\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"The test sentence, \\"This girl will not buy bread, will she buy bread?\\", is not the most grammatically correct sentence in formal English. However, it can be understood in spoken informal English. To analyze this, let's break down the sentence structure and suggest an improved version of the sentence. The sentence contains two clauses: 1. \\"This girl will not buy bread.\\" 2. \\"Will she buy bread?\\" The first clause is a negative statement, indicating that the girl in question will not purchase bread. The second clause seems to contradict the first clause by questioning whether she will buy bread or not. In proper English, we can rephrase this sentence as a tag question to create a grammatically correct sentence. A tag question is a question added at the end of a statement to confirm or check information. Here's an improved version using tag questions: \\"This girl will not buy bread, will she?\\" This sentence follows the basic structure of a negative statement followed by a tag question. The tag question \\"will she?\\" is used to confirm or check the information provided in the statement, making the sentence more concise and clear. Alternatively, if the intention is to ask the question first and then provide the answer, you can rephrase the sentence as follows: \\"Will this girl buy bread? No, she will not.\\" In summary, the given test sentence, while it can be understood in informal spoken English, is not an appropriately structured grammatical English sentence. Rephrasing it using tag questions or separating the question and answer improves the sentence structure and clarity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question King John in June 1215 was forced to put his seal to \\"The Articles of the Barons\\" by a group of powerful barons who could no longer stand John's failed leadership and despotic rule. The king's Great Seal was attached to it on 15 June 1215. In return, the barons renewed their oaths of fealty to King John on 19 July 1215. A formal document to record the agreement was created by the royal chancery on 15 July: this was the original Magna Carta. \\"The law of the land\\" is one of the great watchwords of Magna Carta, standing in opposition to the king's mere will. The Magna Carta of 1215 contained clauses which in theory noticeably reduced the power of the king, such as clause 61, the \\"security clause\\". This clause allowed a group of 25 barons to override the king at any time by way of force, a medieval legal process called distraint that was normal in feudal relationships but had never been applied to a king. After a few months of half-hearted attempts to negotiate in the summer of 1215, open warfare broke out between the rebel barons and the king and his supporters. What was the process by which the king's power could be overridden?","output":"The process by which the king's power could be overridden in the 1215 Magna Carta was through a medieval legal process called \\"distraint.\\" This process was outlined in Clause 61, known as the \\"security clause.\\" According to this clause, a group of 25 barons had the authority to override the king's decisions at any time by using force if necessary. Distraint was a common practice in feudal relationships, which allowed a lord to seize the property of a vassal in order to secure the performance of their feudal obligations or as a form of punishment for failing to fulfill these obligations. However, this practice had never before been applied to a monarch. In the case of King John and the Magna Carta, the barons sought to introduce this mechanism to limit the king's despotic rule and address concerns about his leadership. By including the security clause in the Magna Carta, the barons aimed to create a system of checks and balances on royal authority to protect their rights and ensure that the king adhered to the law of the land, rather than governing based on his mere will. Despite the barons renewing their oaths of fealty to King John after the Magna Carta was sealed, open warfare soon erupted between the rebel barons and the king's supporters. This highlights the fragility of the agreement and the broader, ongoing struggle for power between the monarchy and the barons during this era. Nonetheless, the concept of limiting a monarch's power through a form of legal restraint was a significant development that shaped the evolution of constitutional law in England and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years did it take for the conquest of Tenerife?","output":"Title: The Historical Conquest of Tenerife: A Testimony of Persistence and Resilience Introduction Tenerife is the largest and most populous of the seven Canary Islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa. Known for its picturesque landscapes, lush vegetation, and unique wildlife, Tenerife has often been marked as a strategic point for political, commercial, and military ventures. Its historical significance, however, goes beyond its natural beauty and geographical advantage. The island played a central role during the period of European exploration and conquest in the 15th century. This article seeks to explore the journey of the conquest of Tenerife – a goal that took several years to accomplish. The Guanches: The Aboriginal Inhabitants of Tenerife Before exploring the conquest of Tenerife, it is essential to understand the culture and society of the native population. The island was inhabited by the Guanches, aboriginal people of Berber origin, who existed in relative isolation until European sailors began to venture into the Canary Islands in the 14th century. The Guanches lived in small communities, held unique religious beliefs, and maintained their distinctive art, language, and customs. Upon the arrival of the first Europeans, the native inhabitants initially resisted their attempts at conquest, establishing a lasting conflict between the two groups. The Beginning: Political Turmoil and Failed Expeditions The conquest of Tenerife did not commence as a single, well-coordinated effort. The initial steps towards claiming the island were marked by a series of failed expeditions and political disputes. In 1402, French explorer Jean de Béthencourt set out to conquer the Canary Islands under the backing of French and Castilian nobles, initiating the colonization process of Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, and El Hierro. However, Tenerife evaded Béthencourt's grasp due to the fierce resistance of the native Guanches and the political dysfunction among the European powers. In the 15th century, amid constant tension between the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal, both nations set their sights on Tenerife and its strategic importance. However, this competition led to indecision, delays, and disorganization – factors that only prolonged the process of conquest. An infamous example was a failed 1464 expedition led by Castilian nobleman Diego García de Herrera, who was ultimately defeated by the Guanche forces. The Final Push: Conquering Tenerife The conquest of Tenerife, in its ultimate form, was driven by Spain's Crown of Castile, as it sought to consolidate its claim on the entire Canary Archipelago. In the late 15th century, Alonso Fernández de Lugo – a Spanish conquistador – was entrusted with the task. A seasoned military leader with prior experience in capturing the islands of La Palma and Gran Canaria, de Lugo was the perfect candidate for this arduous mission. In 1494, Alonso Fernández de Lugo embarked on a large-scale military expedition to conquer Tenerife. He assembled an army composed of Spanish soldiers, mercenaries, and allies from the previously conquered Canary Islands. The conquistador swiftly established a foothold on Tenerife, building the fortress of La Madera near present-day Santa Cruz. However, the conquest of Tenerife was not an easy task. The native Guanches, led by chiefs such as Tinerfe, Bencomo, and Acaimo, put up a fierce resistance that lasted for several months. The struggle culminated in the Battle of Aguere and the Battle of La Victoria in November 1494, where the Spanish forces finally managed to overcome the Guanche resistance. It was not until a few months later, on 25 July 1496, that the surrender of the remaining Guanche warriors was secured, effectively bringing about the end of the conquest of Tenerife. In Conclusion: The Lengthy Conquest of Tenerife The Spanish conquest of Tenerife spanned years of intermittent contact, failed expeditions, and political confrontation. The final push led by Alonso Fernández de Lugo lasted approximately two years, from the commencement of his expedition in 1494 to the surrender of the Guanche warriors in 1496. The conquest marked a turning point in the history of the Canary Islands as European colonization took root, and the indigenous Guanche culture slowly faded under the yoke of their conquerors. Despite the lasting impacts of these historical events, it is essential to remember the resilience and spirit of the native population, who fiercely resisted intrusion into their ancient and richly textured civilization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Taking the time to go through the emotions will help you come to terms with the reality of the situation and gradually grow stronger. Remember that it's okay to be vulnerable, as this is how we grow emotionally and build mental resilience after undergoing heartaches. Another crucial step in getting over a long relationship is self-care. Pay attention to your physical, emotional, and mental well-being by indulging in activities that nurture your soul and help you regain your balance. This can include regular exercise, healthy eating habits, and engaging in creative outlets, such as writing, painting, or dancing. Additionally, consider seeking professional help if you're struggling to cope with the aftermath of the breakup or need guidance on rebuilding your life and regaining your self-esteem. Reconnecting with close friends and family is also vital during this time, as they can provide support, comfort, and a listening ear. Surround yourself with positive individuals who care about your well-being and can provide objective advice or a different perspective if needed. Take this time to strengthen bonds with your loved ones, plan outings, and develop a new support network. Evaluate and reflect on the relationship and the lessons learned to gain a better understanding of what you want in a partner moving forward. This introspection is vital in identifying patterns that may have contributed to the breakup or understanding what changes in your life might be necessary to ensure success in future relationships. Be honest with yourself, and remember that it takes two to make or break a relationship. It is also important to establish boundaries and give yourself space from your ex-partner. Cut all ties if possible, including social media connections, shared friends, or frequent haunts. Keeping a distance will make it easier to detach oneself emotionally and enable progress towards moving on. Lastly, don't rush into another relationship to fill the void left by your previous one. Give yourself ample time to heal, grow, and rediscover who you are as an individual before committing to someone new. When you feel ready and emotionally stable, allow yourself to explore new social settings, expand your network, and gradually open your heart to new potential partners. Patience is key during this time; remember that getting over a long relationship takes time and often requires a great deal of effort, but the result is a stronger, healthier, and more resilient version of yourself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;","output":"c). No The hypothesis \\"SCR retrofits can be accomplished without the need for resources\\" is false based on the premise \\"Estimated Resources Needed for Single and Multiple SCR Retrofits.\\" An SCR retrofit, or selective catalytic reduction retrofit, refers to the modification or upgrading of an industrial facility, specifically its emission control system, to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) in its emissions using selective catalytic reduction technology. Implementing an SCR retrofit typically involves several steps, such as designing and engineering the system, procuring necessary equipment and materials, coordinating with contractors, performing necessary construction work, and testing and commissioning the system. These processes inevitably require various resources, including financial, material, and human resources, to ensure successful implementation. 1. Financial resources: The cost of implementing an SCR retrofit can vary significantly depending on factors such as the size and complexity of the system being retrofitted, the specific NOx reduction requirements, and the chosen SCR technology. Generally, expenses will be incurred for purchasing and installing the catalyst, system design and engineering, project management, and ongoing operation and maintenance. 2. Material resources: Various materials and equipment are needed for SCR retrofits, including catalyst materials (typically a combination of titanium dioxide, vanadium, and tungsten), ammonia storage and distribution systems, NOx analyzers, and flue modifications. Additional components, such as valves, piping, instrumentation, and control systems, may also be required depending on the specifics of the project. 3. Human resources: Competent and experienced professionals are necessary to ensure the successful implementation, operation, and maintenance of an SCR retrofit. These may include engineers, chemists, technicians, project managers, and construction personnel, depending on the scope and complexity of the project. 4. Time: SCR retrofits typically require a significant time investment for planning, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning. The time it takes to complete an SCR retrofit may be influenced by factors such as the size and complexity of the project, regulatory requirements, and site-specific constraints. In conclusion, it is not possible to accomplish SCR retrofits without the need for resources. These retrofit projects invariably require financial, material, and human resources, as well as time to be successfully implemented.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton in 1920? from the following article ?  I was stationed on the Isle of Grain – a ghastly place but the first line of defence against invasion – and in our battalion of the Suffolks we had a number of professional musicians. So we formed an orchestra and played in the equivalent of the NAAFI during our spare time. I was the principal cello and we were conducted by the bandmaster, one Lieutenant Bonham. The other boys knew that I was longing to conduct and one day when Bonham fell ill with 'flu, they thought \\"old Barby\\" – as I was known – should have a go. It was really rather romantic – I was scrubbing the floor in the Officers' Mess when they came and invited me to take over. We did the Light Cavalry overture and Coleridge-Taylor's Petite Suite de Concert but I can't say I recall the rest of the programme. While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: \\"The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John.\\" After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. The Musical Times commented, \\"Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.\\" At the Three Choirs Festival of 1920 he took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton, in the LSO cellos. He joined two newly founded string quartets as cellist: the Kutcher Quartet, led by his former fellow student at Trinity, Samuel Kutcher, and the Music Society Quartet (later called the International Quartet) led by André Mangeot. He also made several early broadcasts with Mangeot's quartet.

The fact that an animal, which typically does not have a significant role in films, is mentioned as the most likable actor underscores the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the rest of the cast and the film overall. 3. Criticism of the creator: The customer accuses the film's director, Altman, of self-massaging and hubris. This indicates that the customer does not appreciate the creative direction the filmmaker took, which supports the notion of dissatisfaction with the end product. 4. Call for reconsideration: When the customer states that the director should \\"think twice before sending one of his 'ideas' to the screen,\\" it strongly implies that they believe this particular film shouldn't have been made or released. This clearly demonstrates their dissatisfaction with the product. 5. Reference to lacking clarity: The customer mentions that even subtitles would not have helped them understand the film, pointing to a lack of clarity and coherence in the plot and overall content.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: There are loads of different varieties, intensities, and styles of roller coasters, and deciding what kind of experience you want out of riding a roller coaster is an important first step. Some riders prefer old-school wooden coasters for a vintage feel, while others will prefer newer, super-fast, upside-down behemoths to test their mettle. The choice is completely up to you, but it's good to get some sense of what to expect from different kinds of coasters.   Wooden roller coasters are the oldest and most classic types of coasters, and usually the kind you'll want to start on. They're operated with a traditional chain-lift mechanism, in which the cars are lifted to a peak and dropped to allow gravity to force the cars through the rest of the turns and valleys at high speed. It's also a fun and bumpy ride. These usually won't go upside down. The Texas Giant, the American Eagle at Six Flags America, and the Beast at King's Island are all examples of classic wooden coasters. Also, Thunderbolt is a common name for wooden coasters.  Steel roller coasters feature complex steel tracks, offering somewhat smoother rides and more maneuverability, as well as the ability to invert the riders, incorporating loops, corkscrews, and all kinds of other exciting motions. Most modern roller coasters, including the classic Kingda Ka, the Millennium Force, Steel Dragon 2000 and the Storm Coaster are steel coasters. Not all roller coasters are designed the same way, and some are a bit more comfortable for first-time riders than others. Knowing a bit about the different types will help you pick the right one. For the beginner, traditional seated car roller coasters are typically the best way to get an introduction to the ride. They're comfortable, safe, and relatively simple.  Floorless coasters, for example, allow the riders' legs to hang free, simulating an intense falling experience, while standing coasters lock the riders in place in an upright position. Wing coasters feature two cars that extend on either side of the track, giving your individual car the impression of floating, while suspended coasters are able to swing back and forth freely as the coaster goes around bends. If you're inexperienced at riding roller coasters, the best way to get your sea legs is to ride a smaller version of a coaster. Most parks have a variety of different types of roller coasters, and they're all fun. Smaller coasters will usually have less-intense drops, no loops, and will still give you a good thrill, going at high speeds. Often, they'll have shorter lines, too, which gives you less time to get nervous while you wait. Alternatively, depending on your temperament, it might be better to jump in the deep end and ride an intense roller coaster to get it over with. That way, you'll know you've been through the wildest of the wild and you don't need to be scared anymore. At the beginning of most roller coasters should be a measuring stick with a minimum height requirement for all riders. This isn't to punish enthusiastic kids who want to ride the big rides, but to ensure the safety of all the riders. The seats and safety harnesses need to be big enough to fit everyone, so kids and especially short people run the risk of slipping through the harness.  Don't sneak past the height requirement and then wait in line. Typically, before you jump in the car, the park employees will measure you with a height stick and send off anyone who doesn't meet the mark. It would be too bad to have waited around for two hours just to get rejected at the last second. Most roller coasters feature warnings that pregnant rides, riders with heart conditions, and other physical ailments should not ride certain roller coasters. Most of these warnings will be featured at the beginning of the line, next to the height requirement. Don't ride if you have any concerns about your physical health. One great way to pick a roller coaster is to pick one that doesn't have an insanely long line. Very popular roller coasters will often have waits for up to two or three hours, depending on the ride and the park, so it's important to manage your time if you want to ride some roller coasters. It might be worth it to wait several hours for one big one, or you might rather spend your time riding other rides.  Bring something to do in line, or some friends to talk with. Waiting that long can be awfully boring, and might be a lot more fun with a book or some buddies to goof off with. Be respectful and polite to everyone else in line who's waiting with you. Some theme parks also have fast passes, which allow you to show up to a ride at a designated time, skip the line, and hop right on the ride. This allows you to more efficiently use your time at the park, though these passes are more expensive than a regular ticket. On lots of roller coasters, the line will split once you get toward the end of it, to line up for different seats along the car. Once in the loading zone, pick the row you wish to ride in, and get in that line. Any of the cars are great choices for your first rides.  Some people love the front for the view, while others love the back for what is called the \\"goat effect,\\" a phenomenon named after the Thunder Mountain roller coaster at Disneyland. Toward the back of the cars, the g-forces exerted on the riders are stronger, making the experience more intense, making up for the lack of view. If you don't have much of an opinion or preference, head to the shortest line to get on the ride the quickest. Less waiting, less nerves, more fun.","output":"The passage discusses the various aspects of roller coasters. It first delineates the differences between wooden roller coasters, which offer a vintage, bumpy ride that rarely includes upside-down sections, and steel roller coasters that can have complex tracks with loops and other disorienting features, enabling much more intense experiences. Popular examples of each type are provided.  The text further elaborates on the different seating experiences available, from traditional seated cars for beginners, to floorless coasters, standing coasters, and wing coasters that change the riders' orientation relative to the track for increased thrill. It is suggested that novice riders start with smaller, less intense roller coasters to familiarize themselves before moving onto larger ones. The passage also highlights the importance of the minimum height requirement for safety reasons and cautions against ignoring it. Additionally, rides may not be suitable for people with certain health conditions, and long queues are common for popular roller coasters. Strategies for choosing a ride based on waiting times, position in the car, and possible use of fast passes to minimize wait times are also discussed."},{"instruction":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Polish.

This intellectual Indian family has contributed significantly to various scientific developments and discoveries. In particular, Sir C. V. Raman and his nephew, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, have gained widespread recognition as Nobel laureates in physics.  Sir C. V. Raman was born in 1888 in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, and became famous for his groundbreaking research in the field of light scattering. His discovery, referred to as the Raman Effect, earned him the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics. Raman's scientific contributions include findings in the fields of acoustics, optics, molecular physics, and crystallography. On the other hand, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, born in 1910 in Lahore (now in Pakistan), gained distinction for his work on the theoretical underpinnings of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes –- celestial bodies that can form when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and undergo gravitational collapse. This led to the formulation of the Chandrasekhar Limit, which defines the maximum mass a white dwarf can attain before collapsing into a denser state or exploding. For his contributions to the understanding of stellar evolution, Chandrasekhar was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics. In summary, although both Sir C. V. Raman and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar are distinguished physicists and Nobel laureates from the Chandrasekhar family, the relationship between them is that of uncle and nephew.

I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value.

I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help.

Question: Who does Ian fall in love with? Movie title: Sex Drive Movie plot: Ian Lafferty (Josh Zuckerman) is an 18-year-old recent high school graduate. He searches for a girl online making it seem as if he is attractive and strong, although he's sweet and unassuming. He soon meets \\"Ms. Tasty\\" (Katrina Bowden) and agrees to meet her in person. She lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, while he lives in Chicago, Illinois. With his best friends Lance Nesbitt (Clark Duke) and Felicia Alpine (Amanda Crew), he goes to Knoxville in a 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge borrowed without permission from Ian's arrogant homophobic older brother Rex (James Marsden). On the way to Knoxville, they come across a hitchhiker (David Koechner), as the radiator in the Judge overheats. They attempt urinating in the radiator, which only works briefly as they try to leave the hitchhiker in the dust. The hitchhiker, frustrated at Ian's lack of concern for his well being, leaves, but not before urinating on the car window. As Ian and Felicia wander to find help, Lance is waiting with the car as Ezekiel (Seth Green) happens to pass by in his horse-drawn buggy. Ezekiel and his Amish buddies repair the car while they join a Rumspringa party where Fall Out Boy are playing a concert, and at which Lance meets an attractive Amish girl, Mary (Alice Greczyn). The three promise to come again on the way back to do some work in return for fixing the car. They go to jail due to Ian throwing a tire iron into a state trooper car, due to his increasing frustration after trying to put a possum he hit out of its misery, and are released after Mary pays the bail. Upon arriving at Knoxville, they find a hotel that sports a wide variety of role playing rooms. Rex, who has discovered the Judge gone missing, arrives angrily and insists that they go back and that Ian cannot visit Ms. Tasty. After Ian pretends to be gay, Rex allows him to see Ms. Tasty, hoping this encounter will change Ian's mind. Ian finally meets Ms. Tasty.

Question: Q: In adaptive radiation, what is the name of the initial species that then subsequently becomes multiple other ones?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  In some cases, a population of one species disperses throughout an area, and each finds a distinct niche or isolated habitat. Over time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species, which is called adaptive radiation. From one point of origin, many adaptations evolve causing the species to radiate into several new ones. Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island, which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms (Figure 11.16). The Hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates one example of adaptive radiation. From a single species, called the founder species, numerous species have evolved, including the eight shown in Figure 11.16.

' \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived -- Choices: [a]. negative; [b]. positive; Answer:","output":"Answer: [b]. positive The sentiment of the sentence \\"can easily worm its way into your heart.\\" is largely perceived as positive. This phrase typically indicates that something or someone has a charming and endearing quality that makes it easy for people to develop affection, appreciation, love, or attachment towards it or them, despite any potential initial resistance or preconceived notions. The use of the word \\"worm\\" in the phrase might initially suggest negative connotations, as worms are often associated with invasiveness and discomfort. However, within the context of the sentence, it is used metaphorically to emphasize the idea of effortlessly penetrating a person's emotions, winning over their affections in a genuinely heartwarming and endearing manner. Furthermore, the idea of something or someone reaching one's heart suggests a profound emotional impact. The heart is often regarded as the center of emotional experiences, so when something has the ability to reach a person's heart with ease, it implies an overwhelmingly positive feeling. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence is undoubtedly positive, as it conveys the notion of a subject's ability to evoke emotional attachment and an affectionate response, making it easier for people to become fond of or enamored with it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is endangered when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death-threatening postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill lurks around Kahane's home and is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi), whom he watches while talking to her on the phone, that Kahane is at a showing of 'The Bicycle Thief'. Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards. Kahane continues goading Mill about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot the two men fight. Mill loses his balance and falls, and feeling threatened, kills Kahane, then makes the death look like a robbery gone wrong.The next day, Mill receives another postcard. Mill attends Kahanes funeral and gets along with June; she knows none of the other mourners.

This is a significant development in the ongoing narrative of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The decision to voice their request publicly shows an increased readiness by the North Korean government to engage in dialogue to address various issues affecting the two nations. Direct dialogues have been sporadic over the years, due to growing tensions and differences in policy, particularly surrounding nuclear programs and human rights. However, these talks signify a potential opportunity for both nations to express their concerns openly, reaching a common ground on key matters. The United States government has not yet provided a clear response to North Korea's demand, although the subject is currently under active consideration. Analysts believe that agreeing to direct talks could result in expanding communication channels and substantially ease tensions between the two countries. Despite the cautious optimism surrounding this latest development, it is crucial to remember the historical context of relations between the US and North Korea. Previous attempts at establishing direct discussions have faltered or ended without producing lasting results. Any future talks will need to be approached with patience and a sincere commitment to diplomacy, weighing both the possible benefits and potential risks. Nonetheless, North Korea's request for direct talks marks a possible turning point in their relationship with the United States. If executed thoughtfully, these dialogues could create a foundation for a more stable future, building trust and fostering cooperation on shared interests.

Sentence 1: Drill a hole into the wall. Sentence 2: Don't drill here, there's a gas pipe. Does drill mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"Yes, the word \\"drill\\" means the same thing in these two sentences. In both contexts, \\"drill\\" refers to the action of making a hole in a surface using a drill, which is a power tool with a rotating cutting end designed specifically for creating holes. However, the two sentences convey different messages related to the act of drilling. In Sentence 1 – \\"Drill a hole into the wall\\" – the speaker is instructing someone to go ahead and use a drill in order to create a hole in the wall. This could be for various purposes, such as hanging a picture frame, mounting a TV, or installing a shelf. This sentence is essentially an affirmation and permission for the drilling action to take place on the wall. On the other hand, Sentence 2 – \\"Don't drill here, there's a gas pipe\\" – serves as a warning about a potential hazard associated with drilling at a particular location. The speaker cautions the listener not to drill in the identified area because there is a gas pipe behind the wall, and drilling into it could possibly cause a gas leak, which is dangerous and could lead to catastrophic consequences. In this context, the speaker is advising against drilling in order to avoid any accidents or damage. Thus, while the word \\"drill\\" denotes the same action in both sentences, the context and purpose of drilling differ. The first sentence is an instruction to perform the act of drilling, and the second is a warning to abstain from drilling at a specific location due to safety concerns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Context: Recent studies have indicated a protective role of physiological autophagy in ischemic heart disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of autophagy regulation after ischemia are poorly understood. Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles released from cells that play critical roles in mediating cell-to-cell communication through the transfer of microRNAs. In this study, we observed that miR-30a was highly enriched in exosomes from the serum of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients in vivo and culture medium of cardiomyocytes after hypoxic stimulation in vitro. We also found that hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α regulates miR-30a, which efficiently transferred via exosomes between cardiomyocytes after hypoxia. Inhibition of miR-30a or release of exosomes increased the expression of the core autophagy regulators beclin-1, Atg12, and LC3II/LC3I, which contributed to maintaining the autophagic response in cardiomyocytes after hypoxia. Taken together, the present study showed that exosomes from hypoxic cardiomyocytes regulate autophagy by transferring miR-30a in a paracrine manner, which revealed a new pathway of autophagy regulation that might comprise a promising strategy to treat ischemic heart disease. Answer: miR-30a is highly enriched in exosomes from the serum of AMI patients. Hypoxia induces miR-30a upregulation and enrichment into exosomes. MiR-30a is efficiently transferred via exosomes between hypoxic cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of exosome release contributes to maintaining of autophagy after hypoxia. Inhibition of miR-30a augments autophagy after hypoxia.","output":"Question: How do exosomes from hypoxic cardiomyocytes regulate autophagy in relation to ischemic heart disease according to the study?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(Associated Press)      Most rallies in Tahrir have been led by liberal- or left-leaning groups. But Friday's rally was dominated by the country's most organized political group, the Muslim Brotherhood, which has rarely come out in full force since the protests that forced President Hosni Mubarak to step down in February.      The Brotherhood had until recently avoided confrontation with the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, but now warns of escalating its protest campaign if plans to give permanent political powers to the military are not scrapped.      \\"The army has no role in ruling people. Its only job is to protect the country. We want civilian rule chosen through democracy,\\" said Hani Hegazi, a 28-year old Brotherhood member who traveled by bus to Tahrir from the Delta province of el-Beheira.      Banners read: \\"Down with military rule. Egypt our country is not a military camp.\\" Some demonstrators flew the Egyptian flag, while others including ultraconservative Salafis waved a banner declaring Islam's holy book, the Quran, to be \\"our constitution.\\"      The rally was called to protest a document floated by the government which declares the military the guardian of \\"constitutional legitimacy,\\" suggesting the armed forces could have the final word on major policies even after a new president is elected. The document, which includes guiding principles for Egypt's new constitution, also introduces clauses that would shield it from civilian oversight.      Most of Egypt's pro-democracy groups object to the document, calling it an attempt to perpetuate military rule past the post-Mubarak transitional period which is supposed to end with the election of a new parliament and a new president.      In addition to the Brotherhood, Salafis, left- and liberal-leaning groups such as the April 6 movement and other youth revolutionary alliances joined the rally, demanding a timetable for the end of military rule, which began in February.      They have called for marches from mosques around Egypt to major squares, dubbing it the \\"Friday of the Single Demand\\" _ that demand being a clear date for the transfer of power to civilian rule. Many groups have planned to hold an open ended sit-in until a date has been set.      The Brotherhood says the document reinforces \\"dictatorship.\\"      \\"It contains articles that rob the people of their sovereignty and reinforces dictatorship. It constitutes a coup against the principles and goals of the January 25 revolution,\\" the group said in a statement issued Wednesday. Last-minute negotiations between the government and the Brotherhood failed to stave off their participation in the rally, or scrap the document.      The show of force comes 10 days before the country's first parliamentary elections since Mubarak stepped down, when a Brotherhood-affiliated political party is expected to fare well.      Anger against the Supreme Council has been building up over their management of the transition period. Many complain that the generals are recreating the Mubarak regime by cracking down on opponents, by refusing to order a thorough reform of the security services, and by monopolizing decision making. Islamists and liberals alike now express fear that the military council wants to hold on to power, a claim denied by the generals.      The military council had promised to transfer power to an elected civilian government within six months of Mubarak's ouster. But according to a vague timetable in place, it may not be until early 2013 that a president is elected. Only the dates for the parliamentary elections, which are due to begin in ten days and which will drag into March, are yet known.      Walid Farouk, 32, who wore the heavy beard and traditional robe of the ultraconservative Salafi trend, said that Egypt had seen nothing good from military rule since the army first took power in 1952.      \\"All of us are scared that the army could try to hold on to power,\\" he said. \\"It is time for a civilian government.\\"      The writing of Egypt's constitution has been a divisive issue, and details of who will write it and what it contains are at the heart of recent rallies.      Some liberals have supported the idea of writing guiding principles for the constitution, fearing that a parliament controlled by Islamists would insert religious principles into the document.      Even now, some liberals remain opposed to the Friday rally, saying a document is necessary to detail how members of the assembly are to be chosen, and controversial clauses can be negotiated.      But many others have come to distrust the military's Supreme Council at least as much they distrust the Islamists.      At Friday's rally, protesters are also expected to celebrate the birthday of one of the most prominent revolutionary to be jailed by the military prosecutor. Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a famous blogger and activist, was detained late last months for refusing to answer to the military prosecution on his alleged role in sectarian violence that left 27, mostly Christians, dead. He turned 30 on Friday.      Many hold the military responsible for the violence, and see Abdel-Fattah's detention as an attempt to find a scapegoat and discredit activists. ||||| CAIRO — Tens of thousands of Islamists jammed Tahrir Square on Friday, demanding the swift exit of Egypt ’s interim military rulers in the most significant challenge to their authority since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak nine months ago.      The huge turnout was the first time that Egypt’s Islamists had so openly and aggressively challenged military rule, ending an uneasy truce that had prevailed as long as the military appeared willing to allow the Islamists as much of a say in Egypt’s future as they could win at the ballot box.      That truce fell apart, on the eve of parliamentary elections, after the military council spelled out for the first time its intention to preserve a decisive role for itself in Egyptian politics far into the future, elevating itself above civilian control and imposing rules to protect individual and minority rights. And after sitting out many of the protests organized by liberals since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster, Islamists took to the streets on Friday in a fierce backlash.      “The people didn’t sacrifice hundreds of lives in the revolution so that the military would jump over their will,” said Mohamed Ibrahim, a teacher at a religious school who traveled from Mansoura, about 75 miles away, to attend. “If they can do that, what is the point of parliamentary elections?”      The rally represented the beginning of a new battle between Egypt’s two most powerful political forces, the military and the once-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, that leaves Egyptian liberals and leftists anxious and divided on the sidelines.      “Each side is drawing a line in the sand over its future role in the political process,” said Prof. Emad Shahin, an Egyptian scholar at Notre Dame who was in Tahrir Square on Friday. “The military forces would like to secure an exit from the transitional period with some kind of assurances of their future role in the political scene, and the Islamists think that this could put a check on their power even if they win in clean and fair elections.”      After sunset, as thousands of protesters prepared to camp overnight in the square, the military-led government declared in a statement that it refused to withdraw its guidelines but that it would continue to debate them with political leaders through the beginning of the coming elections. The move ensured that the deeply polarizing debate would continue to grip the country as voters go to the polls, beginning Nov. 28.      Many liberals were torn between their fears of military rule and a religious takeover. Most liberals stayed home despite the stated democratic demands of the protest: giving power to elected civilians. In fact, some liberals appeared to be looking to the military council to act as a hedge against a religious takeover and to impose a “bill of rights” before elections that the Islamists might win.      “The liberals would rather prolong the transitional phase than accept the results of clean and fair elections, which shows they are not very sure about their weight in society and politics,” Professor Shahin said, suggesting they preferred “to cooperate with those in power.”      The April 6 Movement, a pivotal force in the uprising, was one of the few liberal groups to make a conspicuous presence on Friday. Its banners called the day “the Friday of One Demand” — meaning a transfer of power to the lower house of Parliament as soon as it is seated in April. The military initially pledged to cede power to a civilian authority by September, but is now expected to delay that transition until 2013 or later.      An April 6 activist said its members had been told not to talk about the military’s controversial guidelines. “Of course there are fears of Islamists’ taking power,” said Dina Allithy, 23, a recent college graduate and a member of the group. “But today we are trying to ignore all of that.”      The Brotherhood, an organization that honed its discipline under decades of police scrutiny, sent hundreds of members on Thursday night to camp out and start setting up in Tahrir Square, the staging ground of a two-week sit-in that ousted Mr. Mubarak in February. By Friday morning, buses arrived carrying thousands of supporters from outside Cairo. ||||| Tens of thousands of Islamist and secular protesters gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square and Alexandria on Friday for a mass rally to pressure the ruling military council to hand over power to a civilian government.      The demonstration, dubbed the \\"Friday of One Demand,\\" was called in response to a document of \\"supraconstitutional\\" principles floated by the government that declares the military the guardian of \\"constitutional legitimacy\\", suggesting the armed forces could have the final word on major policies even after a civilian parliament and president are elected.      A wide spectrum of political groups including liberals and ultraconservative Islamists have decried the document even as they reportedly negotiate with the government to get it changed.      Though opposition to the military's perceived power grab comes from all sides, Muslim religious movements are the most vocal. They fear that the document will push Egypt toward a more civil, secular state.      Yasir Hamida, a 40-year-old member of the Muslim Brotherhood, told Al Jazeera's Malka Bilal that he had lived through the former regime and now wanted to \\"do something for our kids\\".      \\"My demand is that the ... document be cancelled. Enough. We are tired now. We thank the army, but it's time to transfer power and let the parliament start organising a constitution and get ready for a civilian state,\\" he said. \\"I'm happy that all the coalitions are here today.\\"      Elections for the lower house of parliament, the People's Assembly, begin on November 28 and will last until January, occurring in three stages. The upper house, or Shura Council, will be elected after that.      The ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), which assumed ultimate executive power after President Hosni Mubarak stepped down in February, initially promised a presidential election in early 2012 but has recently suggested it could occur as late as 2013. In the meantime, the SCAF will be able to propose and veto legislation, convene and adjourn parliament, and appoint the prime minister and cabinet.      Liberals join with Islamists      Friday's protest drew political parties and religious movements of different stripes, though the loudest voices in the square came from Islamists, including hardline Salafis and the comparatively moderate Muslim Brotherhood.      Liberal, leftist and Islamist parties and groups such as the April 6 Movement, founded in solidarity with labour protests, participated in the rally. Islamists joined with their call to put an end to military trials of civilians, which have led to the incarceration of thousands in proceedings described by human rights activists as opaque and unfair.      Anan Zuhairi, a 26-year-old doctor, told Bilal she was not with any party or political movement but that she joined the protest because \\"nothing has been resolved since the revolution\\".      \\"Nothing we revolted for has happened. Emergency law is still not canceled. People are being taken out of their homes. Our demands have remained the same except they've become more,\\" she said. \\"We just want democracy and freedom. The people with opinions are all in prisons.\\"      The two main demands of the protesters were to prevent the imposition of the government's document and to set a date for the presidential elections, Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros said.      \\"People are saying there has been no referendum on this document, and are asking why it is being imposed before the upcoming elections,\\" she said. \\"They see this as the military trying to impose their rule.\\"      \\"They are telling the military to stop trying to unilaterally control this transition period,\\" she said.      Document shields SCAF budget      Though some parties had called for an extended sit-in, most of the crowd started to leave after the sun set and the weather began to turn cold, Tadros said, and the Muslim Brotherhood instructed its supporters to go home by 8pm.      Al Jazeera's Jamal Elshayyal, in the northern coastal city of Alexandria, reported that thousands of people had also gathered there, \\"mainly heeding the call from the Salafists and the Muslim Brotherhood.\\"      After prayers, the crowd marched from mosques to a major military headquarters to protest the SCAF's rule.      Protesters chanted \\"we do not want military rule\\" and \\"we must protect our revolution\\".      The contested government document, written by Deputy Prime Minister Ali Selmi, includes clauses that remove the military's budget from parliamentary oversight and allow the SCAF a final say on military-related matters. Selmi and the rest of the cabinet have been approved by the SCAF and ultimately answer to the military.      The government has revised the draft, but Islamists, who organised a mass protest in July against such a charter, have rejected the very idea of a document that would limit parliament's authority to draft the constitution, branding the articles as undemocratic.      The Muslim Brotherhood, through its Freedom and Justice Party, may emerge as the largest bloc in the election. ||||| Summary:","output":"A big group of people in Egypt got together in a place called Tahrir Square to protest against the military rulers. They are worried that these military rulers are trying to keep too much power for themselves in Egypt. This gathering was one of the largest ones in Egypt in the recent months. Many people, including a group called the Muslim Brotherhood, came to protest and demand that the military rulers give power to regular people instead. They want a new government that is chosen by the people, not by the military. This protest is important because the people of Egypt are fighting for their rights and a better future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article:","output":"Title: The Detailed Guide to Fine-tuning Your Tobacco Cultivation Whether you are a first-time grower or an experienced horticulturist, refining your technique can always deliver better results. In this article, we dive into the intricacies of tobacco cultivation, focusing on critical steps such as seedling transplanting, appropriate fertilization, sun exposure, watering, and flower management. The journey of cultivating tobacco begins small, starting from a cell tray populated with tiny sprouts. Your first task entails plucking out half of these sprouts from the tray. The reason to perform this selective weeding is multifold. Primarily, it allows the remaining sprouts to have more room to grow without competition for nutrients. For this purpose, tweezers are the perfect tool. They provide the precision required to remove sprouts without damaging the surrounding ones.  Once your seedlings have happily matured and stand tall at 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm), you need to upscale their living conditions. The seedlings then need to be transplanted into pots. Doing so allows for more adequate space for mature root development, further enabling the plants to draw nutrients more effectively and ensuring their healthy growth. An overriding factor for prosperous growth involves the right nutrition strategy. For tobacco, applying a fertilizer that contains nitrate but absolutely no chlorine is a prerequisite. Nitrate is paramount as it enhances the leaf quality and improves the overall yield. In contrast, tobacco plants are sensitive to chlorine, which can adversely influence the plant's growth and productivity.  As for sunlight exposure, tobacco craves a reasonable amount of it. Keep your tobacco plants in an area that provides around 6 hours of sunlight each day. Such an exposure amount would ensure enough photosynthesis for the plants' growth, yet not too much to cause plant stress or water loss through transpiration. The watering process is a delicate balance for tobacco. You want the soil to be wet enough to provide ample moisture to the tobacco roots, but never so drenched that it leaves your plants wallowing in a water-logged state. Overwatering can cause roots to suffocate and encourage the proliferation of harmful fungi and pests. One final but significant piece of advice pertains to flower management. As the tobacco plant begins to bloom, avoid the temptation of leaving these flowers to form completely. Make a conscious effort to cut off these flowers as they begin sprouting. This step redirects the plant's energy from reproduction back into leaf development, thus ensuring bigger and healthier leaves - the prized components of the tobacco plant. In conclusion, cultivating tobacco is an art as much as it is a science: demanding strategic selectiveness in sprout choice, precise transplantation, quality fertilization, a careful balance of sunlight and water, and dutiful flower control. Tending to these factors with care can lead to a bountiful, healthy yield of tobacco leaves, and an ultimately rewarding gardening experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The narrator mentioned that they were in a Horse Show, which implies their active participation in the equestrian event. Riding around on a horse and showing off in front of a crowd is a direct indication of their involvement as an equestrian (or equestrienne, depending on gender). These equestrian events typically involve demonstrating different riding styles, control, and partnership between the rider and the horse. Being awarded a blue ribbon confirms their success in the equestrian event as it usually represents first place or a high level of achievement in a contest.

Born on November 30, 1929, in Mount Vernon, New York, Richard Wagstaff Clark was an American television and radio personality, who became a household name in the entertainment industry. He was often referred to as \\"America's oldest teenager\\" because of his youthful appearance, which is one of the reasons he could be considered as an \\"ageless\\" star. Dick Clark started his career in the radio and television industry in the late 1940s and early 1950s. However, it was his role as the host of the popular TV show \\"American Bandstand\\" (1956–1989) that catapulted him into stardom. \\"American Bandstand\\" was a music-performance and dance television program that showcased many famous musicians and bands over the years. Clark's charismatic personality and appealing looks made him an ideal host for the show and provided youth with guidance in popular music and dance trends. In 1972, the first edition of \\"New Year's Rockin' Eve\\" was launched and hosted by Dick Clark. The show was created as an alternative to Guy Lombardo's \\"New Year's Eve\\" broadcasts, which mainly featured a traditional big band music style. Dick Clark's \\"New Year's Rockin' Eve\\" brought forth a fresher format by showcasing contemporary popular music acts and celebrating the New Year with live performances and music. The program became a staple of American New Year's Eve celebrations and turned into an annual tradition that millions of viewers tuned into every year. Dick Clark continued to host the event for decades, with \\"New Year's Rockin' Eve\\" becoming a cultural phenomenon and a significant part of Clark's legacy. The show's structure generally involved a live broadcast from Times Square in New York City, witnessing the famous ball drop, interspersed with pre-recorded musical performances and interviews. Dick Clark was synonymous with the event and was admired for his incredible ability to relate to the audience and his remarkable energy for his age. However, in 2004, Clark suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed and affecting his speech. While he made efforts to continue hosting the show, it became evident that he needed support to carry on the tradition. In the subsequent years, Clark was joined by co-hosts such as Ryan Seacrest and various guest hosts. Dick Clark made his final appearance on \\"New Year's Rockin' Eve\\" on December 31, 2011. Sadly, he passed away on April 18, 2012, at the age of 82. Dick Clark's impact on the entertainment industry and his long-standing position as the host of \\"New Year's Rockin' Eve\\" make him an unforgettable figure in American culture.

Based on interaction ritual theory, we experience different levels or intensities of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions. Emotional energy is considered to be a feeling of confidence to take action and a boldness that one experiences when they are charged up from the collective effervescence generated during group gatherings that reach high levels of intensity.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Face-to-face group meetings, as described in the context provided, can be referred to as \\"interaction rituals\\" or \\"focused encounters.\\" These terms stem from the interaction ritual theory developed by Randall Collins, which builds upon the work of Durkheim and Goffman.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. look around right twice after look left A:","output":"Part #1: Understand different actions and their corresponding commands. Usage:  - 'I_LOOK': look (The agent looks around) - 'I_WALK': walk (The agent walks) - 'I_RUN': run (The agent runs) - 'I_JUMP': jump (The agent jumps) - 'I_TURN_LEFT': turn left (The agent turns left) - 'I_TURN_RIGHT': turn right (The agent turns right) Part #2: Identify the word 'after' and understand that it signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. Usage: look left after look right (In this example, the agent will first look right, then look left because the word 'after' is used) Part #3: Recognize the word 'around' and understand that it makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. Usage: look around right (Here, the agent will look while turning around to the right) Part #4: Understand the words 'twice' and 'thrice' and how they trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Usage: look around right twice (In this case, the agent will look around to the right two times) Combining these parts, we can understand that the original command \\"look around right twice after look left\\" means the agent should perform the actions in the following sequence: A: I_LOOK_LEFT, I_LOOK_AROUND_RIGHT, I_LOOK_AROUND_RIGHT Here, the agent first looks left, then looks around right twice (since the word 'twice' is used), following the 'after' instruction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As the movie is set in the year 1375, tensions and uncertainties between different nations and cultures were common.

He's my uncle, actually,\\" she replied with a warm smile, trying to put the young man at ease. \\"Please, lead the way.\\" The young man, who introduced himself as Marco, nodded vigorously and began leading Lieutenant Verona through the church's intricate hallways. The combination of the high vaulted ceilings and the delicate glow of the sunlight filtering through the stained glass windows gave the church an ethereal ambiance that was difficult to describe. As they proceeded further, the lieutenant couldn't help but notice the countless pieces of religious art adorning the walls and ceilings, each telling a different story from the Bible. Despite his initial shock, Marco's demeanor never changed. He incessantly chatted about the church's history, architectural design, and the various works of art that they passed by. It was clear that he was passionate about his job, often pausing to explain the significance of a particular sculpture or painting in great detail. Eventually, they arrived at the door of a modest office that stood at the end of a long corridor. Without knocking, Marco pushed the door open and gestured for the lieutenant to enter. \\"Monsignor Verona is waiting for you inside,\\" he whispered, almost reverently. As she stepped inside the office, Lieutenant Verona was greeted by her uncle, who was sitting behind his desk, engrossed in reading a thick book. He looked up as she entered, and a warm smile spread across his face as he recognized her. \\"Ah, Lieutenant! It has been too long,\\" Monsignor Verona exclaimed, rising from his desk to embrace his niece. They exchanged pleasantries and began to catch up, with the lieutenant recounting her latest adventures in her career, while Monsignor Verona shared the various challenges he faced overseeing the church and attending to the needs of his congregation. During their conversation, the lieutenant couldn't help but feel a sense of tranquility and contentment wash over her. Her uncle's office was a stark contrast to the opulence of the church – simple, yet comfortable. The scent of old books and the faint aroma of incense created a welcoming atmosphere that encouraged deep and thoughtful conversations. As the hours passed, the discussion between the lieutenant and her uncle shifted towards more personal matters. They spoke of family members, shared anecdotes about their childhood, and reflected on their shared hopes and dreams for the future. Throughout their conversation, it became clear that the bond between Lieutenant Verona and Monsignor Verona was not only familial but also spiritual. Their mutual love and respect transcended blood ties, and it was evident that the lieutenant found solace and wisdom in her uncle's guidance. As the daylight began to fade, it was time for Lieutenant Verona to take her leave. As they exchanged heartfelt goodbyes, she promised to visit her uncle more often and to continue their meaningful conversations. With the warmth of familial love in their hearts, they parted ways – Lieutenant Verona resuming her duties, and Monsignor Verona returning to his sacred duties at the church. --- This encounter between Lieutenant Verona and her uncle, Monsignor Verona showcases the beauty of familial bonds and the depth of connections that can be established when there is mutual love, respect, and understanding. The journey through the church, guided by the charming and knowledgeable Marco, serves as a metaphor for the continuity and guidance that family can provide to one another. And ultimately, it serves as a reminder that no matter how complex and demanding one's life may become, it is in the sanctuary of family and spirituality that we can often find solace, wisdom, and purpose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I always wish the animals could be free. I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around. She was so young but seemed to enjoy jumping on some bouncy trampoline type thing at the Sea World. My husband might remember the funny things better than I do.

Translate this to English?","output":"Can the European Council present the initiatives it pursues to enable the development of closer political and economic relations between the European Union and the United States of America? The European Council, as the institution responsible for defining the European Union's political direction and priorities, plays a crucial role in fostering stronger political and economic ties between the EU and the US. The EU is the largest trade and investment partner of the US, and their cooperation covers multiple areas, including economy, trade, energy, security, and the environment.  Some of the key initiatives pursued by the European Council to enhance EU-US relations are: 1. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP): This proposed trade agreement aimed to strengthen economic ties between the EU and the US, creating more growth and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Although negotiations took place between 2013 and 2016, they have been on hold due to differences on crucial issues like market access, regulatory cooperation, and public procurement. 2. EU-US Energy Council: Founded in 2009, this council seeks to promote transparent and competitive energy markets, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. They also collaborate on research and technology for secure and sustainable energy and discuss global energy security challenges. 3. The New Transatlantic Agenda: Launched in 1995, this agreement creates a framework for EU-US cooperation on promoting peace and stability, democracy, and development around the world. Initiatives in this agenda have included joint efforts against terrorism, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and facilitating conflict resolution. 4. The EU-US Privacy Shield Framework: This initiative, which has been recently invalidated by the European Court of Justice, aimed to provide companies on both sides with a mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States. 5. Dialogue on security and defense: To strengthen cooperation in addressing global security challenges, the EU and the US engage in a structured dialogue on security and defense. Areas of collaboration include tackling cyber threats, hybrid threats, and countering terrorism. 6. The EU-US Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) cooperation: This cooperation focuses on border management, migration, law enforcement, and civil protection. The dialogue between the EU and the US addresses common challenges such as cross-border crime, terrorism, and irregular migration. 7. Dialogue on climate change and the environment: EU and US representatives meet regularly to discuss policies and actions related to climate change, resource efficiency, and circular economy. They also coordinate on multilateral environmental agreements and initiatives. The European Council will continue to seek and develop initiatives that benefit both the EU and the US. This will require close and effective cooperation to address common challenges, seize opportunities, and work towards shared values and goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What work by a Roman emperor shows the influence of Stoicism on the Roman upper classes?\\" is in \\"The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic.

It has several common names, including: aplodontia, mountain boomer, ground bear, and giant mole. The name sewellel beaver comes from \\"sewellel\\" or \\"suwellel\\", the Chinookan term for a cloak made from its pelts. This species is the only living member of its genus, Aplodontia, and family, Aplodontiidae. It should not be confused with true North American and Eurasian beavers, to which it is not closely related.  - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - The term Sciuromorpha has referred to numerous groups of rodents , but the only family common to all variations is the Sciuridae , the squirrels . Most definitions also include the mountain beaver . Traditionally , the term has been defined on the basis of the shape of the infraorbital canal . A sciuromorphous zygomasseteric system is characterized by attachment of the lateral masseter muscle along the side of the rostrum . Unlike hystricomorphous and myomorphous rodents , the medial masseter muscle does not pass through the infraorbital canal . Among extant rodents , only the families Sciuridae , Castoridae , Heteromyidae , and Geomyidae are truly sciuromorphous . Some authorities would exclude the Geomyidae and Heteromyidae from that list due to the attachment of the medial masseter directly behind the zygomatic arch. Carleton and Musser ( 2005 ) redefined rodent suborders on the basis of a host of both morphological and molecular reasons . They defined the Sciuromorpha as including three families , Sciuridae , Aplodontiidae , and Gliridae . Of these , only the Sciuridae are truly sciuromorphous . The Aplodontiidae are protrogomorphous and the Gliridae are myomorphous . The connection between Aplodontiidae and Sciuridae has been proposed numerous times in the past . The two families have been united into a common infraorder ( Sciurida ) or superfamily ( Sciuroidea ) . It has long been suggested that dormice ( Gliridae ) are not particularly related to the Myomorpha , and their zygomasseteric structure has been termed \`\` pseudomyomorphy '' . The connection between squirrels and dormice has been almost exclusively suggested through genetic studies , and to a lesser degree via the fossil rodent Reithroparamys .  - The Eurasian beaver or European beaver (\\"Castor fiber\\") is a species of beaver which was once widespread in Eurasia. It was hunted to near-extinction for both its fur and castoreum; and by 1900, only 1200 beavers survived in eight relict populations in Europe and Asia. Reintroduced through much of its former range, it now occurs from Great Britain to China and Mongolia, although it is absent from Italy, Portugal, the southern Balkans, and the Middle East.  - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'parent taxon' with the subject 'sciuromorpha'.

Write the answer: Which Midlands city was formed when several towns joined together as a county borough in 1910, achieving city status in 1928?","output":"The Midlands city that was formed when several towns joined together as a county borough in 1910, and later achieved city status in 1928, is Stoke-on-Trent. Stoke-on-Trent is located in Staffordshire, England, and is a unique city known for its rich industrial heritage, specifically in pottery and ceramics. The city was created through the amalgamation of six towns, namely Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Stoke-upon-Trent, and Tunstall. The decision to unify these towns was driven by the need to resolve a range of local government, public health, and economic issues present in the area at the time. The Federation of Stoke-on-Trent, as it was initially known, marked a significant change in the way local government operated within the region. Before the federation, the six towns were independent urban districts, each with its powers and functions. However, as these towns grew, their proximity led to an overlap of resources and services, making it necessary to centralize authority to better manage the area, provide efficient services to inhabitants, and foster economic development. Through the process of unification, the six original towns retained much of their unique identities, while at the same time, creating a shared identity through becoming part of the larger Stoke-on-Trent area. One of the major reasons that Stoke-on-Trent received its city status in 1928 was due to the importance of pottery manufacturing in the area. Known as the Potteries, Stoke-on-Trent had become the world center of ceramic production, with famous factories such as Wedgwood, Spode, and Royal Doulton operating within the city. Stoke-on-Trent's city status was granted during the celebration of the 679th anniversary of the signing of King John's Charter, which initially established the borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme. This significant achievement in Stoke-on-Trent's history was recognized by the King and led to it being given city status, a testament to the burgeoning success of the pottery industry. Today, Stoke-on-Trent continues to be known for its pottery and ceramics industry, although over time, the city has diversified its economy, incorporating fields such as information technology, healthcare, and higher education. This transformation has led to new opportunities for growth and development, while still retaining a strong connection to its industrial past. The city's history and culture continue to be celebrated through museums, galleries, and events, ensuring that Stoke-on-Trent's unique identity as a united county borough continues to thrive in the modern era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Baby Gammy and his mother have moved into a new house paid for using part of the 250,000 raised for his family through public donations. About half of the money raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, leaving 120,000 to cover 10-month-old Gammy's future medical and living expenses, said charity Hands Across The Water. Charity founder Peter Baines said the family needed a new home because their previous one-bedroom unit was too run-down for Gammy, who still suffers from a lung condition. Scroll down for video. Baby Gammy and his mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua moved into a new house, 100km south of Bangkok. Almost half of the 250,00 raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, where the pair will live with Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children. 'He was recently back in hospital for six days prior to them moving into house,' Mr Baines told Daily Mail Australia. 'We took advice from Down Syndrome Australia who said the environmental conditions of where the kids live are important. 'They're more susceptible to illness, colds, and virus than children who do not have Down syndrome so they need to live in a cleaner, healthier environment that's why we were keen to see them moved.' Earlier this year Goy and Gammy found themselves at the centre of an international row over the ethics and legality of surrogacy when it emerged Gammy's Australian parents David and Wendy Farnell abandoned him in Thailand but took home his healthy twin sister Pipah. Before moving into the new home Gammy was in hospital for six days due to a lung infection. Goy and Gammy pose with Nom Manochantr, general manager of Hands Across The Water in Thailand. Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of  Pipah, the West Australian reported. Pipah recently returned to Australia after a trip to China with Mrs Farnell for her mother's funeral. WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said officers have yet to make a decision about whether she can stay in the care of her father David Farnell, a convicted child sex offender. 'The department was fully aware of her travel and was supportive of her taking time to grieve and spend time with her family,' Ms Morton told the West Australian. 'While this specific case is still subject to an ongoing thorough assessment, I can assure you that much has happened behind the scenes.' The family needed a new home because their previous one-bedroom unit (pictured) was too run-down for Gammy, who still suffers from a lung condition. The family plans to do some alterations at the front of their new house to set up a noodle shop, similar to the one they used to run at Goy's grandparents nearby house (pictured) Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of Gammy's twin sister Pipah, pictured with David and Wendy Farnell. The house for Gammy's family was purchased and is being held under a trust in the name of Hands Across The Water, which is managing the family's money on behalf of his Thai surrogate mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua. 'This way we guarantee the safety of the house so the family can't sell it or use it for any means that are inappropriate,' Mr Baines said. Gammy, Goy, and Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children moved into the home earlier this month. Mr Baines said Gammy was now much healthier and has gained a lot of weight. He added that the family plans to do some alterations at the front of the house to set up a noodle shop, similar to the one at the front of Goy's grandparents' house where Gammy sometimes stayed. Hands Across The Water founder Peter Baines visited the family earlier this month to assess their situation and needs. Pictured: Goy and her three children. Mr Baines described Gammy as: 'a strong little boy who certainly appears healthy and full of life' 'That's not out of necessity, because we're paying them more than enough in a monthly allowance,' he said. 'It's just a way for Goy to be productive and earn an income.' The house is in the same neighbourhood as the family's previous residence, in an industrial area about 100km south of Bangkok, where they also ran a small shop selling salads and noodles. Mr Baines said 250,000 was raised for Gammy through the Go Fund Me website, but the company took 10,000 in fees. 'We made approaches and asked if they could discount that and they said no,' he said. Three people, who wish to remain anonymous, originally set up the Go Fund Me page to raise 25,000 for Gammy. Media outlets picked up the details of that fund when the story started gaining worldwide media attention, and when the amount of money donated became too much for them to handle they asked Hands Across The Water took step in and manage it. Mr Baines said: 'we anticipate the original donated funds being sufficient to see Gammy into early adulthood' Earlier in the year, Hands Across The Water administered 20,000 towards Gammy's medical costs, including moving him from a public to a private hospital, when he was suffering from a lung infection.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question deals with the difference between various fan sockets (CPU FAN, CPU OPT, and SYS FAN) on a motherboard, while the second question is about the compatibility of an LGA 1150 CPU cooler on an LGA 1151 CPU socket. Let's address both questions separately. 1. Difference between CPU FAN, CPU OPT, and SYS FAN sockets on a motherboard: CPU FAN socket: This is the primary socket on the motherboard that is dedicated to the fan of the CPU cooler. It provides necessary power and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control to manage the speed of the CPU cooler's fan optimally. Connecting the CPU cooler's fan to this socket enables the system to monitor and adjust the fan speed according to the CPU temperature for efficient cooling. CPU OPT socket: CPU Optional (OPT) socket, also sometimes referred to as CPU FAN2, is an additional socket usually provided for a second or supplementary fan of high-end CPU coolers or for a water cooling pump in water-cooled systems. The CPU OPT socket allows the system to control the secondary fan or pump in sync with the primary CPU fan to ensure efficient cooling. Although it's not necessary to use this socket if the cooling system does not require an additional fan or pump. SYS FAN socket(s): System Fan (SYS FAN) sockets, which are usually available in multiple numbers on a motherboard, are designed to connect case fans that help in maintaining airflow throughout the PC enclosure. These sockets enable the motherboard to monitor and control the speed of the case fans according to the system temperature. The case fans are crucial to keeping other components, like GPU or storage drives, at optimal temperatures. 2. Can an LGA 1150 CPU cooler fit on an LGA 1151 CPU socket? LGA 1150 (also known as Socket H3) and LGA 1151 (also known as Socket H4) are two different CPU sockets designed by Intel for their processors. Although they differ in terms of supported processors and chipsets, they share the same cooler mounting holes. As a result, an LGA 1150 CPU cooler should fit on an LGA 1151 CPU socket without any issues. However, it's always recommended to check the CPU cooler manufacturer's compatibility list to ensure the cooler would efficiently cool the particular processor used in the system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What was that article about?","output":"The article is about a disturbing incident involving a famous actress in India who reported being raped inside her vehicle by three people while on her way to a dubbing session for a film. The perpetrators had apparently waylaid her car on the given night, the assault lasting nearly two hours. Besides the physical violation, she was also threatened with the release of lewd pictures on social media platforms.  The local police responded to these allegations by arresting her driver and detaining two more suspects. The main accused, who used to serve as her former driver, remains at large at the time of the article. The police are conducting their search for three additional suspects. The case they have opened includes charges of rape, kidnap, criminal conspiracy, and wrongful restraint. This event has sparked a significant level of outrage across India, especially in the southern film industry where several celebrities and industry personnel have publicly expressed their shock and concern. The sentiment is particularly echoed by a director named Lal, and actor Mohanlal, both expressing disbelief and a strong need for punitive and preventive measures to discourage such criminal acts. The incident has also brought to surface the broader issue of violent sexual crimes in India that have gained visibility since the horrific gang rape and murder of a student in Delhi in 2012, leading to the introduction of stricter anti-rape laws. However, in spite of these legislative amendments, sexual assaults against women and children continue to be a problem across the country, making people question if India has reached a turning point in tackling rape or if more robust actions are still needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(CNN) -- As this election season unfolds, we are watching an age-old dream in politics go horribly smash. It isn't good for politics, and it sure isn't good for the country. President Franklin Roosevelt helped to fire up the dream during his second term in office. Coming off a massive landslide in 1936, he believed that it would be far better for governing if the Democrats became the liberal party and Republicans the conservative one. In the 1938 congressional elections, he barnstormed across the South trying to purge the Democratic Party of several incumbent conservatives. His efforts backfired -- the incumbents won and were sore at FDR -- but the dream became a staple of politics. Meanwhile, Barack Obama has moved left, pushing taxes on the rich, piling up trillion-dollar deficits and bashing the same","output":"business interests that once supported him. On the other side of the aisle, Republicans have moved further right, embracing tax cuts for the wealthy, advocating for deregulation, and opposing nearly every policy proposed by the Democrats. This increasing polarization has led to a political environment where compromise seems almost impossible, and both parties are focused on appealing to their respective bases rather than collaborating for the common good. This growing divide has made governing more challenging, leading to gridlock and public frustration. Key issues such as healthcare, climate change, and income inequality remain unaddressed. As a result, the nationwide problems that demand bipartisan solutions continue to worsen, affecting the lives of millions of Americans. It's essential for politicians to step back and reassess the consequences of their entrenched positions. They must actively work towards bridging the partisan gap and collaborating on policies that serve the public's best interests. In order to achieve this, elected officials must be willing to prioritize compromise over party loyalty, focusing on the collective good rather than political division. In conclusion, as the political divide in America deepens, lawmakers should break free from the constraints of their partisan positions and facilitate collaboration and compromise. By doing so, they can effectively address the pressing challenges facing the country and restore faith in the political system. Failure to do so will only deepen the divide, hinder progress, and continue to undermine the health of the nation."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The Obama administration pulled its ambassador out of Syria over security concerns, blaming President Bashar Assad's regime for the threats that made it no longer safe for him to remain.      FILE - In this June 20, 2011 photo taken during a government-organized tour for foreign diplomats and the media, US ambassador in Syria Robert Ford, covers his nose during his visit with other foreign... (Associated Press)      Ambassador Robert Ford returned to Washington this weekend after the U.S. received \\"credible threats against his personal safety in Syria,\\" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday.      Ford has been the subject of several incidents of intimidation by pro-government thugs, and enraged Syrian authorities with his forceful defense of peaceful protests and harsh critique of a government crackdown that has now claimed more than 3,000 lives.      \\"We hope that the Syrian regime will end its incitement campaign against Ambassador Ford,\\" Toner said. \\"At this point, we can't say when he will return to Syria.\\"      Toner said the U.S. embassy will remain open in Damascus and that the threats were specifically directed toward Ford. His return is conditional on a U.S. \\"assessment of Syrian regime-led incitement and the security situation on the ground,\\" Toner said.      Ford was the first American ambassador to Syria since 2005. President George W. Bush's administration withdrew a full-time ambassador from Syria over charges the country was involved in terrorism and the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Syria has denied any involvement.      The Obama administration decided to return an ambassador to Syria earlier this year in an effort to persuade Syria to change its policies regarding Israel, Lebanon, Iraq and support for extremist groups. Syria is designated a \\"state sponsor of terrorism\\" by the State Department.      Although Ford's appointment in January, while the Senate was out of session, was originally criticized by some Republicans in Congress, he has won praise within the administration and beyond for his determination to meet Syrian opposition leaders in a hostile environment, and tough criticism of the Assad regime's brutal military response to mass demonstrations.      The Senate unanimously approved Ford's nomination earlier this month, with Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, praising Ford for continuing to visit cities under siege and \\"speak truth to power.\\"      Ford was greeted by demonstrators with roses and cheers when he traveled to the restive city of Hama in July, prompting immediate recriminations from the Syrian government, which tried to then limit where Ford could travel. Only days later hundreds of regime supporters attacked the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, smashing windows and spray-painting obscenities on the walls.      Ford also has been the subject of several incidents of intimidation by pro-government thugs, often in coordination with pro-Assad media capturing the humiliation. Media reports said Ford was hit with eggs and tomatoes while going to a mosque in Damascus. Other such incidents have occurred after meetings with dissident groups or individuals, and his postings on Facebook have provoked thousands of Syrian and other responses, and even some death threats from pro-Assad hardliners.      Haynes Mahoney, the embassy's deputy chief of mission, confirmed that Ford has left Syria but said Washington hadn't not formally recalled him _ a symbolically significant diplomatic step.      Toner lamented that the threats deprived the United States of a valuable emissary to the Syrian people at a time they face daily violence from Assad's security forces. Clashes on Sunday saw forces flood into villages where residents have been on strike and shoot two people dead, according to activists.      President Barack Obama has called on the U.N. Security Council to sanction Syria for using deadly violence against citizens who are rising up against the authoritarian government there.      A seasoned diplomat with extensive Middle East experience, Ford \\"has worked diligently to deliver our message and be our eyes on the ground\\" in Syria, Toner said. \\"This decision was based solely on the need to ensure his safety, a matter we take extremely seriously.\\"      ___      AP writers Bassem Mroue in Beirut and Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria, contributed to this report. ||||| In this file picture, new U.S. ambassador Robert Ford (R) talks with Syria's President Bashar al-Assad after presenting his credentials to Assad, in Damascus January 27, 2011.      AMMAN The United States said on Monday it had pulled its ambassador out of Syria because of threats to his safety, prompting Syria to follow suit in a worsening of ties already tattered by U.S. opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's efforts to crush anti-government protests.      The U.S. envoy, Robert Ford, had antagonized Syria's government with his high-profile support for the demonstrators trying to end 41 years of Assad family rule. Assad supporters attacked the U.S. Embassy and Ford's convoy in recent months.      Ford left Syria as a government crackdown on protests and a nascent armed insurgency intensified and as more businesses and shops closed in southern Syria in the most sustained strike of the seven-month uprising.      In the latest violence, two people were killed in the central city of Homs, 85 miles north of Damascus, when troops and loyalist militiamen fired at majority Sunni Muslim districts that have been a bastion for protests.      The United States has called for Assad to step down and, along with its European allies, has intensified sanctions on Syria, including against its small but significant oil sector, a central source of foreign currency for the government.      The State Department issued a statement saying Ford \\"was brought back to Washington as a result of credible threats against his personal safety in Syria.\\"      State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Ford was expected to return to Syria and demanded the Syrian government provide for his protection and end what she called a \\"smear campaign of malicious and deceitful propaganda\\" against him.      \\"The concern here is that the kinds of falsehoods that are being spread about Ambassador Ford could lead to violence against him, whether it's by citizens, whether it's by ... thugs of one kind or another,\\" she said.      Nuland stressed that Ford had not been \\"withdrawn\\" -- a diplomatically loaded term that could have implied that the envoy would not return and that suggests a diminution in relations between the two countries.      \\"INCITEMENT\\" AGAINST ENVOY      U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ford left Damascus on Saturday.      A spokeswoman for the Syrian Embassy in Washington, Roua Sharbaji, said after news of Ford's return became public Syrian Ambassador Imad Moustapha had been recalled to Damascus for consultations on Monday.      Unlike in Libya, there appears to be no appetite among Western or Arab governments to consider armed intervention to stop the violence in Syria, one of a host of Arab states to see uprisings against long-time authoritarian rulers this year.      The killings in Homs on Monday bring to at least 10 the number of civilians killed in tank-backed assaults on districts in the central city in the last two days, activists said.      The official Syrian news agency said \\"terrorist groups\\" had fired at a taxi carrying university students in Homs on Sunday night, killing a young woman. Security forces arrested several members of other groups and seized automatic weapons, automatic rifles and Molotov cocktails.      A Youtube video shot by activists purportedly showed a young protester dying from a gunshot that hit him while he was dragging a body off a street in al-Khalidiya district. Their comrades are heard shouting \\"God is greater\\" as the two bodies lay next to each other on the asphalt.      Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the footage. Most foreign media have been banned from Syria, making it difficult to verify events on the ground.      Syrian authorities say they are fighting \\"armed terrorist groups\\" in Homs who have killed civilians, security forces and prominent figures.      They blame the unrest across the country on such groups, which they say have killed 1,100 army and police. The United Nations says the crackdown has killed 3,000 people, including 187 children.      ATTACKS ON U.S. EMBASSY, CONVOY      Ford left Syria following a series of violent incidents that damaged the U.S. Embassy compound and his motorcade but did not cause any casualties.      At the end of September, Assad loyalists threw concrete blocks at his convoy and hit the cars with iron bars as Ford was visiting centrist politician Hassan Abdulazim, according to an account published by the ambassador the next day.      In July, several Assad loyalists broke into the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, tore down signs and tried to break security glass. They also tried to break into Ford's nearby residence but failed to gain entry.      The Syrian government's mounting security crackdown has triggered a strike by private businesses in towns across the Hauran Plain, which was the first region where masses publicly turned against Assad.      Anger has grown over the killings of several protesters last week in the towns of Dael and in Ibtaa. The region has seen nightly protests in solidarity with Homs.      \\"Troops have entered into several towns to end the strike but protesters want to expand it into wider civil disobedience,\\" said one activist who said army reinforcements had been sent to several towns in the Deraa countryside.      In Deraa city, capital of the agricultural province, businesses across the city were closed for the fourth day. In the town of al-Hirak to the east, the strike picked up steam in the last two days, activists said.      \\"This strike is intensifying every day as more businesses shut and people become more defiant than ever, angered by the increasing brutality and daily roundups and arrests,\\" said one Deraa resident who gave his name as Abu Abdullah.      With troops concentrating on urban centers, protests have expanded in rural regions, including some once bedrocks of Sunni support for Assad but now seeing defections from the military and armed resistance.      In an interview with Reuters last month, Ford said Assad was losing support among key constituents and risked plunging Syria into sectarian strife between Sunnis and Alawites by intensifying the military crackdown.      Ford also infuriated Syria's rulers with his high profile gestures of support for the seven-month-old grassroots protest movement seeking to oust Assad.      He was cheered when he went in July to the anti-Assad hotbed city of Hama, which was later stormed by tanks, ignoring a ban on diplomats traveling outside the Damascus area.

THE HUNDRED YEARS' WAR.  1. Wars of Edward III.--By the Salic law, as the lawyers called it, the crown was given, on the death of Charles IV., to _Philip, Count of Valois_, son to a brother of Philip IV., but it was claimed by Edward III. of England as son of the daughter of Philip IV. Edward contented himself, however, with the mere assertion of his pretensions, until Philip exasperated him by attacks on the borders of Guienne, which the French kings had long been coveting to complete their possession of the south, and by demanding the surrender of Robert of Artois, who, being disappointed in his claim to the county of Artois by the judgment of the Parliament of Paris, was practising by sorcery on the life of the King of France. Edward then declared war, and his supposed right caused a century of warfare between France and England, in which the broken, down-trodden state of the French peasantry gave England an immense advantage. The knights and squires were fairly matched; but while the English yeomen were strong, staunch, and trustworthy, the French were useless, and only made a defeat worse by plundering the fallen on each side alike. The war began in Flanders, where Philip took the part of the count, whose tyrannies had caused his expulsion. Edward was called in to the aid of the citizens of Ghent by their leader Jacob van Arteveldt; and gained a great victory over the French fleet at Sluys, but with no important result. At the same time the two kings took opposite sides in the war of the succession in Brittany, each defending the claim most inconsistent with his own pretensions to the French crown--Edward upholding the male heir, John de Montfort, and Philip the direct female representative, the wife of Charles de Blois.  What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. Who declared the war? 2. Who did the kings demand to be surrendered? 3. How man kings took opposite sides? 4. What is Edward III's relation to Philip IV? 5. What did the French kings wish to complete? 6. Was the French peasantry in good shape? 7. What kind of shape was it in? 8. Where did the war start? 9.

Answer:","output":"In the movie Gattaca, Vincent saves his brother Anton from drowning. The scene takes place during their childhood when Vincent and Anton, who are competitive siblings, engage in a game they call \\"chicken\\", where they swim out into the ocean to see who would give up and swim back to shore first. Despite Vincent's inferior genetic makeup and health issues, he demonstrates great determination and strong willpower which helps him beat his brother Anton in the swimming race. As a result, Vincent ends up saving Anton from drowning when Anton becomes exhausted and can no longer swim back on his own. This particular scene is significant because it challenges the notion of genetic determinism prevalent in the society presented in the film. Although Vincent is deemed as an \\"in-valid\\" due to his genetic makeup, his ability to save Anton, who possesses superior genes, from drowning proves that determination and the human spirit can transcend the limitations imposed by genetics. The act of saving Anton also provides Vincent with an increased sense of self-worth, which further motivates him to pursue his dreams of becoming an astronaut despite the societal barriers in place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rick Perry and his family have made presidential campaign trips aboard a jet owned by a wealthy contributor who is under investigation for possible securities fraud by Texas regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Perry, who has emerged in just weeks as the new frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, flew last weekend aboard Brian D. Pardo's Cessna Citation X jet from a remote Texas airport to various campaign events in Iowa, according to a Perry campaign aide and flight records obtained via Flightwise.com. Records showed that Pardo's plane also flew from Texas to Charleston, S.C., on Aug. 13, the day Perry announced his bid for the presidency there. Perry's campaign said the plane carried the governor's relatives to the campaign kickoff. Pardo, chief executive of Life Partners Holdings Inc. of Waco, Texas, last year donated 50,000 to Perry's Texas campaign fund. Life Partners is a major player in the controversial \\"life settlement\\" business, selling retail investors the right to collect on strangers' life-insurance policies. Texas regulators filed suit against Pardo and his company at the end of July in state court in Travis County, seeking to force them to comply with subpoenas issued amid an investigation of Life Partners. According to a statement from the securities regulators, the probe centers in part on suspected \\"fraudulent practices\\" in connection with the company's sale of its life-insurance investments. Mark Miner, a spokesman for Perry, declined to say how Pardo's plane came to be used by Perry but said \\"it was a plane we chose to use\\" and the owner was \\"paid in full in accordance with federal election laws.\\" Miner said he believed the governor knows Pardo but would not say what relationship, if any, the two have.

Resigned: Scott Sassa, a senior executive at media firm Hearst, has left his job after explicit texts he allegedly sent to a stripper were seen by his bosses. A high-flying executive has resigned from a top job with one of America's biggest media firms after sexually explicit text messages - allegedly sent between him and a stripper - were forwarded to his bosses. Scott Sassa, 53, left his role as president of Hearst Entertainment and Syndication group after the woman apparently forwarded the explicit messages to senior figures at the company. Mr Sassa, who was responsible for the firm's interests in cable television networks, including ESPN and Lifetime, is alleged to have sent the texts to the LA-based stripper and arranged to meet up with her. The woman, who has not been named, is believed to have sent Mr Sassa - who is a single father-of-two - revealing pictures of herself during the exchanges. She is accused of trying to blackmail him by threatening to forward the messages to his bosses at Hearst unless he paid her money. She was helped by her boyfriend in trying to extort money out of Mr Sassa - who has also held senior positions at Fox, NBC, Friendster and Marvel Entertainment, the New York Post reports. He is thought to have met the stripper in LA in December. The stripper is believed to have made a list of demands, but Mr Sassa refused to pay the money.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

Acting like a permanent employee means coming to work as if you already are one. The more normal and “at home” you feel, the more you will be seen as such by others. You can get started by doing the following:  Show up on time Follow the rules Dress according to the dress code Make connections Share ideas Complete assigned tasks to the best of your ability You may not be expected to go above and beyond or even to do a good job. If you value a career opportunity, treat the position as if it is already permanent. Exceed expectations by doing  the following:  Show attention to detail, and keep mistakes to a minimum. Your supervisor will be relieved to know s/he won't have to go over your work or ask you to re-do it. Work overtime to complete projects that have strict deadlines. If your supervisor allows it, you will show dedication to the company by offering to work overtime. Participate in team meetings. Actively participate in team conversations by giving your opinions and sharing your ideas. This will show you truly want to contribute to team success. Volunteer and take initiative on special projects. Sometimes situations arise where certain team members are required to head up special projects. Do not let your temporary status get in your way. If you feel you can truly contribute to the project, volunteer! Your supervisor will appreciate your initiative. It is important to notify your supervisor that you are interested in permanent placement with the company. However, it is not good to keep talking about it, because you will seem annoying and pushy. When bringing this up to your supervisor you can choose to do the following:  Express interest at the beginning of your employment. You can simply say, “I am excited to start working with you and hope my accomplishments will prove my ability to do this job on a permanent basis.” Remind your supervisor toward the middle of your specified time with the company,  preferably after making a good contribution or completing a major project successfully. You can remind them by saying, “I really feel like I can succeed here. If I am offered this position permanently, I know I can contribute to more team successes.\\" Have a discussion with your supervisor a few weeks before your temp status ends. Use this time to be honest about your interest in a permanent position, and remind them of your successes. You can also ask about time-frames and notices, since you would need to seek other employment if they choose not to offer you the job permanently. There is no need to keep asking about a permanent job. Your desire has been made clear, and it is up to the company now. Most likely the decision will be made collectively with input from your co-workers, supervisor, HR and possibly upper-level management.  Be patient. If you seem to fit in well and are the right person for the job, you will be offered the position.","output":"Adopting a \\"just a temp\\" mindset can hinder your success and growth within a company. To increase your chances of being offered a permanent position, behave like a permanent employee from the start by showing commitment and dedication. This includes arriving on time, adhering to the company’s dress code, following rules, building connections, sharing ideas, and completing tasks to the best of your ability. To stand out and exceed expectations, focus on the quality of your work by being detail-oriented, reducing mistakes, and seeking opportunities to work overtime, especially on projects with strict deadlines. Participate actively in team meetings by sharing your thoughts and opinions, demonstrating your genuine desire to contribute towards the team's success. Show initiative by volunteering for special projects, even if your temporary status might make you hesitant. It's crucial to communicate your interest in a permanent position with your supervisor without being overbearing. Initially, express your enthusiasm and intention to prove your abilities. Remind your supervisor of your interest midway through the contract, highlighting your accomplishments. Lastly, discuss your interest in a permanent position a few weeks before your temp assignment ends, asking about time-frames and any required notices. Be patient with the decision-making process, as it may involve input from various sources, like co-workers, HR, and upper management. If you've proven to be a valuable asset to the company and the right fit for the position, you're likely to be offered a permanent job.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the summer is very wet happens, how will it affect There are fewer areas for animals to hide in.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would likely have an indirect effect on the process. Steps to justify: 1. Acknowledge the Perturbation Hypothesis: The scenario given is that there is a very wet summer. Generally, this implies increased rainfall and moisture in the environment. 2. The Effect on Forest Fires: Increased rainfall during a very wet summer could help to reduce the risk of forest fires as the moisture would make the vegetation less susceptible to burning. This is because moist or wet vegetation does not catch fire as readily as dry vegetation. 3. Considering the Process in Question: With a reduced risk of forest fires, the process as described would likely be disrupted. This is due to the fact that the initial step (forest fires burn forests) may not occur, or occur less often/severely, in this altered scenario. 4. Relating to the Concept of Fewer Places for Animals to Hide: Since the forest is less likely to burn in a very wet summer, the animals living in the forests would essentially retain their habitat. As such, there would not necessarily be fewer places for animals to hide, because their environment remains more or less intact. By extension, if there are no or fewer forest fires due to the very wet summer, then predators would not find their prey as easily because the normal hiding places of the animals stay intact and the forest remains dense. Birds might not fly away since their habitat is not threatened. Similarly, if there are no fires, water bodies wouldn't warm up due to the absence of heat from the fires, reducing potential harm to the aquatic life. Therefore, the perturbation proposed does have an effect on the process, even if it's indirect, as it changes the initial conditions leading to the consequences mentioned in the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering What does Quinn need to do before this? A:","output":"Before Quinn ate the steak in one sitting due to his hunger from practice, he needed to go through several steps. Here's a detailed breakdown of what Quinn must have done: 1. Engage in a physically demanding activity: Quinn attended a practice session, which could be a sports practice or any other physical training that required intense effort, resulting in increased hunger. 2. Prepare or purchase the steak: Quinn either bought a steak from a store, restaurant, or already had one at home. If Quinn had purchased an uncooked steak, he needed to cook it as well. In that case, he would have done the following steps:     a) Marinade the steak (optional): Quinn could choose to apply a marinade to the steak to enhance its flavor. This would typically be left on the steak for a certain period before cooking.     b) Preheat the cooking equipment: Quinn needed to heat his cooking equipment, such as a grill, stovetop, or oven, to the suitable temperature to cook the steak.     c) Cook the steak: Quinn would have cooked the steak according to his taste preferences and food safety guidelines. This could include various techniques such as grilling, pan-searing, or broiling.     d) Let the steak rest: After cooking, Quinn would need to let the steak rest for a few minutes to allow its juices to redistribute, ensuring a more flavorful and tender result. 3. Serve the steak: Quinn would have had to plate the steak and prepare any desired side dishes or condiments, such as vegetables, potatoes, or a sauce. 4. Enjoy the meal: As Quinn was very hungry from practice, he gathered his utensils and sat down to eat the steak in one sitting, fully satisfying his hunger.

World powers would go in with fighter jets and the world's most sophisticated precision-guided weapons to render Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi powerless. But that's not the way things happened. As NATO's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark, analysts blamed a host of faulty assumptions, including success based solely on surgical airstrikes, for a protracted war that some fear could drag on for more months. \\"It's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this,\\" said Andrew McGregor of the Jamestown Foundation and director of Aberfoyle International Security, a Toronto-based agency specializing in security issues related to the Islamic world. The rebels, he said, have made noticeable gains with the support of OPTIONS: - Aberfoyle International Security air power. - Andrew McGregor air power. - CNN air power. - Islamic air power. - Jamestown Foundation air power. - Libyan air power. - Moammar Gadhafi air power. - NATO air power. - Toronto air power.","output":"NATO air power. While the initial intention of the NATO-led intervention was to bring a swift end to the Gadhafi's regime through precision-guided airstrikes, the reality differed significantly. The protracted conflict did not strictly adhere to these plans and the instantaneous halting of Gadhafi's rule was not achieved as initially envisaged. This overstretched conflict exceeded the predicted short duration, stretching well past the 100-day mark and ignites fears of an ongoing war that could last for several months, if not years.  Analysts have pointed to a series of flawed assumptions that contributed to this prolonged conflict. Perhaps the most criticized was the belief that a war could be won solely on the strength of surgical airstrikes. This particular approach was deemed to be fundamental in undermining Gadhafi's power, however, this wasn't the case. The Libyan leader proved resistant to such tactics, prolonging the standoff between his forces and the international efforts to displace him. Andrew McGregor, a noteworthy figure from the Jamestown Foundation and also director of Aberfoyle International Security, a security agency based in Toronto that specializes in security issues related to the Islamic world, is quite vocal on the issue. He categorically insists that it's a sheer misunderstanding to presume that victory could be obtained merely through an air campaign. Such a simplistic view overlooks the complex realities of warfare, particularly in a context such as Libya's. In response to the stalemate, rebels in Libya have made appreciable gains, which according to McGregor, are largely attributable to the support of NATO air power. The assistance from NATO has underscored the international commitment to dismantling the Gadhafi regime. While the air support has provided a significant boost, it's becoming increasingly clear that the solution to the Libyan crisis may not solely rest on air power but, instead, a holistic mix of diplomacy, ground operations and international pressure.  However, the protracted conflict raises pertinent questions about the efficacy of relying heavily on air power in modern warfare. Most importantly, it cautions against the danger of simplifying complex scenarios into single-strategy solutions. It indicates a need for a more comprehensive approach to conflict resolution, integrating air power with other approaches such as diplomacy and ground operations. With this kind of diversity, there is a higher probability of achieving the desired outcome in a reasonable timeframe. This is a lesson not just for Libya, but for all future international conflict resolutions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Yankovic was born in Downey, California and raised in Lynwood, California. He is the only child of Mary Elizabeth (Vivalda) and Nick Yankovic. His father was born in Kansas City, Kansas, of Yugoslavian descent, and began living in California after serving during World War II; he believed \\"the key to success\\" was \\"doing for a living whatever makes you happy\\" and often reminded his son of this philosophy. Nick married Mary in 1949. Yankovic is well known for creating parodies of contemporary radio hits, typically which make up about half of his studio releases. Unlike other parody artists such as Allan Sherman, Yankovic and his band strive to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original, transcribing the original song by ear and re-recording the song for the parody. In some cases, in requesting the original band to allow for his parody, the band will offer to help out with the recreation: Dire Straits members Mark Knopfler and Guy Fletcher perform on \\"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\\", Yankovic's parody of Dire Straits' \\"Money for Nothing\\", while Imagine Dragons provided Yankovic with advice on how to recreate some of the electronic sounds they used for \\"Radioactive\\" in Yankovic's parody \\"Inactive\\". Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his \\"mainstream\\" parody targets, such as Toni Basil, MC Hammer, and Men Without Hats. Yankovic's continued success (including the top 10 single \\"White & Nerdy\\" and album Straight Outta Lynwood in 2006) has enabled him to escape the one-hit wonder stigma often associated with novelty music.  Although many of Yankovic's songs are parodies of contemporary radio hits, it is rare that the song's primary topic lampoons the original artist as a person, or the song itself. Most Yankovic songs consist of the original song's music, with a separate, unrelated set of amusing lyrics. Yankovic's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and the topic of the song, contrasting the style of the song with its content (such as the songs \\"Amish Paradise\\", \\"White & Nerdy\\", and \\"You're Pitiful\\"), or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture cliches (such as \\"eBay\\" and \\"Don't Download This Song\\"). Yankovic's parodies are often satirical of popular culture, including television (see The TV Album), movies (\\"The Saga Begins\\"), and food (see The Food Album). Yankovic claims he has no intention of writing \\"serious\\" music. In his reasoning, \\"There's enough people that do unfunny music. I'll leave the serious stuff to Paris Hilton and Kevin Federline.\\"  Yankovic considered that his first true satirical song was \\"Smells Like Nirvana\\", which references unintelligible lyrics in Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". Other satirical songs include \\"Achy Breaky Song\\", which refers to the song \\"Achy Breaky Heart\\", \\"(This Song's Just) Six Words Long\\", which refers to the repetitious lyrics in \\"Got My Mind Set on You\\", and \\"Perform This Way\\", set to Lady Gaga's \\"Born This Way\\" that drew inspiration from Lady Gaga's outlandish but confident attitude.  Yankovic is the sole writer for all his songs and, for \\"legal and personal reasons\\", does not accept parody submissions or ideas from fans. There exists, however, one exception to this rule: Madonna was reportedly talking with a friend and happened to wonder aloud when Yankovic was going to turn her \\"Like a Virgin\\" into \\"Like a Surgeon\\". Madonna's friend was a mutual friend of Yankovic's manager, Jay Levey, and eventually Yankovic himself heard the story from Levey.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What stood out in this article","output":"This article talks about Yankovic, a talented artist known for creating parodies of popular songs.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The two sentences presented contain different pieces of information, so it is important to analyze them separately before addressing the question related to their truth values. Let's break down each sentence. Sentence 1: \\"And what are you doing?\\" This sentence is a general question asking the person what they are doing. It does not provide specific context regarding the situation, location, or person. It can be used in various scenarios to express curiosity or to seek clarification about someone's activity. The truth value of this sentence becomes clearer when the person to whom the question is directed provides an explanation or description of their current actions. Sentence 2: \\"What are you doing at her house?\\" In contrast, this sentence is a more specific question, implicating a particular location - \\"her house\\". This means someone is at a female's house, and the person asking wants to know the reason or activity taking place at that location. It seems to imply a curiosity or concern for the person being there, likely due to the specificity of mentioning \\"her house\\". Now, let's address the question: If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? While both sentences are questions and seek information about what someone is doing, their context and level of specificity vary. It is important to mention that questions themselves do not inherently contain truth values – they aim to gather information or obtain a response with a truth value. Thus, the original question about the truth values of the sentences might not be the most appropriate way to frame the analysis. However, we can discuss the nature of the relationship between the two sentences. If someone answers Sentence 1, it will not necessarily reveal any information about whether Sentence 2 is relevant or applicable to the situation. It is in the responses to these questions that truth values become relevant. So, the overall answer is that the truth value of Sentence 1 does not determine or influence the truth value of Sentence 2, simply because both sentences are questions that pertain to different situations and levels of specificity. Instead, it is the answers or responses to these questions that can be evaluated for truth rather than the questions themselves."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Book Review - The History of White People - By Nell Irvin Painter - Review - NYTimes.com Nell Irvin Painter’s title, “The History of White People,” is a provocation in several ways: it’s monumental in sweep, and its absurd grandiosity should call to mind the fact that writing a “History of Black People” might seem perfectly reasonable to white people. But the title is literally accurate, because the book traces characterizations of the lighter-skinned people we call white today, starting with the ancient Scythians. For those who have not yet registered how much these characterizations have changed, let me assure you that sensory observation was not the basis of racial nomenclature. In order to view this feature, you must download the latest version of flash player Some ancient descriptions did note color, as when the ancient Greeks recognized that their “barbaric” northern neighbors, Scythians and Celts, had lighter skin than Greeks considered normal. Most ancient peoples defined population differences culturally, not physically, and often regarded lighter people as less civilized. Centuries later, European travel writers regarded the light-skinned Circassians, a k a Caucasians, as people best fit only for slavery, yet at the same time labeled Circassian slave women the epitome of beauty. Exoticizing and sexualizing women of allegedly inferior “races” has a long and continuous history in racial thought; it’s just that today they are usually darker-skinned women. “Whiteness studies” have so proliferated in the last two decades that historians might be forgiven a yawn in response to being told that racial divisions are fundamentally arbitrary, and that deciding who is white has been not only fluid but also heavily influenced by class and culture. In some Latin American countries, for example, the term blanquearse, to bleach oneself, is used to mean moving upward in class status. But this concept — the social and cultural construction of race over time — remains harder for many people to understand than, say, the notion that gender is a social and cultural construction, unlike sex. As recently as 10 years ago, some of my undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin heard my explanations of critical race theory as a denial of observable physical differences. I wish I had had this book to offer them. Painter, a renowned historian recently retired from Princeton, has written an unusual study: an intellectual history, with occasional excursions to examine vernacular usage, for popular audiences. It has much to teach everyone, including whiteness experts, but it is accessible and breezy, its coverage broad and therefore necessarily superficial. The modern intellectual history of whiteness began among the 18th-century German scholars who invented racial “science.” Johann Joachim Winckelmann made the ancient Greeks his models of beauty by imagining them white-skinned; he may even have suppressed his own (correct) suspicion that their statues, though copied by the Romans in white marble, had originally been painted. The Dutchman Petrus Camper calculated the proportions and angles of the ideal face and skull, and produced a scale that awarded a perfect rating to the head of a Greek god and ranked Europeans as the runners-up, earning 80 out of 100. The Englishman Charles White collected skulls that he arranged from lowest to highest degree of perfection. He did not think he was seeing the gradual improvement of the human species, but assumed rather the polygenesis theory: the different races arose from separate divine ­creations and were designed with a range of quality. The modern concept of a Caucasian race, which students my age were taught in school, came from Johann Friedrich Blumenbach of Göttingen, the most influential of this generation of race scholars. Switching from skulls to skin, he divided humans into five races by color — white, yellow, copper, tawny, and tawny-black to jet-black — but he ascribed these differences to climate. Still convinced that people of the Caucasus were the paragons of beauty, he placed residents of North Africa and India in the Caucasian category, sliding into a linguistic analysis based on the common derivation of Indo-European languages. That category, Painter notes, soon slipped free of any geographic or linguistic moorings and became a quasi-­scientific term for a race known as “white.” Some great American heroes, notably Thomas Jefferson and Ralph Waldo Emerson, absorbed Blumenbach’s influence but relabeled the categories of white superiority. They adopted the Saxons as their ideal, imagining Americans as direct and unalloyed descendants of the English, later including the Germans. In general, Western labels for racial superiority moved thus: Caucasian → Saxon → Teutonic → Nordic → Aryan → white/Anglo. Linda Gordon is a professor of history at New York University and the author, most recently, of Dorothea Lange: A Life Beyond Limits. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"\\"The History of White People\\" by Nell Irvin Painter presents a provocative examination of the evolution of the concept of \\"white\\" race. The book begins by tracing characterizations of lighter-skinned people, such as the ancient Scythians, and impresses upon readers that these understandings have significantly evolved and were not initially based on essentials like physical or sensory observation. Painter delineates how different civilizations defined racial groups more in terms of culture than physical attributes. For instance, in ancient Greece, Scythians and Celts were recognized as having lighter skin than what Greeks considered normal, but the Greeks still saw them as less civilized. Painter discusses how racial categories are permeable and are influenced heavily by class and culture, as seen in Latin American countries where the term 'blanquearse,' meaning 'to bleach oneself,' is a symbol of upgrading one's class status.  The concept of race as a fluid social and cultural construct appears to be harder for people to grasp compared to the idea that gender is also socially and culturally constructed. The author has attempted to demystify this through her book. The book moves to the exploration of 18th-century German scholars who championed racial “science.” This includes the likes of Johann Joachim Winckelmann who idealized the ancient Greeks as models of beauty and imagined them with white skin. Other scholars such as Petrus Camper, Charles White, and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach each contributed to establishing hierarchies and categories of races based on their observations or beliefs, leading to the creation of a modern concept of a Caucasian race. Painter also points out that prominent figures such as Thomas Jefferson and Ralph Waldo Emerson, reshaped the categories of white superiority, fueling the transition from \\"Caucasian\\" to \\"Saxon,\\" and eventually to \\"Teutonic,\\" \\"Nordic,\\" \\"Aryan,\\" and \\"white/Anglo.\\"  The review ends with the acknowledgement that the book presents a broad overview of a complex issue and manages to make the content comprehensible and engaging for the reader, marking a significant contribution within the realm of \\"whiteness studies.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Movie title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Context: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

The fossils were discovered in 1974 in the Afar region of Ethiopia by a team of paleoanthropologists led by Donald Johanson, which included Timothy White.

Holden proudly posed wearing the 2014/15 Everton shirt, proudly exemplifying her allegiance to the Merseyside club. The blue and white jersey, a representation of fan affinity and loyalty, defines Holden as more than just a Britain's Got Talent judge or an accomplished actress – but as a true Everton supporter.

The Lancashire-born star takes pride not only in the team's on-field accomplishments, but in their history and overall branding. Last season, Holden had the opportunity to vote for the club's current crest, participating in an important decision for the team. This level of engagement is symbolic of her deep-rooted dedication. Everton Football Club, founded in 1878, is one of the most storied and successful football clubs in England. With a rich history spanning over a century, the Toffees have amassed numerous accolades, including nine league titles and five FA Cups. Despite their illustrious past, the club's crest needed a fresh look leading into the 2013/14 season. The team asked their fans, the true lifeblood of the club, to participate in shaping their own future. As the excitement surrounding the crest selection grew, it was only fitting that Amanda Holden, a devoted fan possessing a platform by which she could generate even more interest, would join in on the fun. Holden, along with thousands of other Evertonians, played a pivotal role in determining the identity of the Everton crest that unifies and represents the team, the fans, and the community. The synergy between Amanda Holden and the Merseyside club continues to flourish, as the actress is frequently spotted visiting Goodison Park, the historic home of Everton.

By wearing the 2014/15 Everton shirt and voting for the club's crest, Holden has demonstrated her unwavering devotion to not only the team but their celebrated history.

What is the name of the Tropic which lies approximately 23.5 degrees south of the Equator and runs through Australia, Chile, Brazil and South Africa?","output":"The Tropic which lies approximately 23.5 degrees south of the Equator is called the Tropic of Capricorn. This imaginary line of latitude got its name because, at the time it was named, the sun was in the direction of the constellation Capricorn when it reached its southernmost point (this is no longer the case due to the precession of the equinoxes). The Tropic of Capricorn is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of Earth, the others being the Equator, the Tropic of Cancer, the Arctic Circle, and the Antarctic Circle.  The Tropic of Capricorn marks the southernmost point where the sun can be directly overhead. This astronomical phenomenon occurs during the December solstice when the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. Conversely, during the June solstice, the sun is directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere. The Tropic of Capricorn runs through several countries, including Australia, Chile, Brazil, South Africa, and others. In Australia, the line of latitude passes through the states of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, crossing iconic regions such as the Great Barrier Reef and the famous Australian Outback.  In South America, the Tropic of Capricorn traverses Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. As it crosses Chile, it goes through a portion of the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places in the world. In Brazil, it cuts through the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais, passing close to the city of São Paulo, one of the largest and most populous cities in the world. In Africa, the antumbra line runs through the island nation of Madagascar before crossing the southeastern portion of the African continent, passing through countries such as Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia. In South Africa, it crosses Kruger National Park, a renowned wildlife reserve and safari destination that is home to an impressive variety of African animal species. Throughout its journey across the planet, the Tropic of Capricorn experiences a wide range of climates, including deserts, savannas, rainforests, and coastal regions. In Australia, it brings together diverse ecosystems, while in South America, it spans dry deserts and fertile farmlands. In Africa, the line encounters both lush rainforests and arid savannas. The Tropic of Capricorn, along with the Tropic of Cancer, is essential in understanding the Earth's climatic and seasonal patterns. These imaginary lines help us comprehend the tilt of the Earth's axis, the differences in sunlight distribution throughout the year, and the patterns of weather and climate experienced around the globe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Much to the relief of the art world and Hiorns' fans, the immersive installation has been saved from an unfortunate fate. Originally constructed in a council flat in London, the monumental work has not only received accolades for its creator, but has also become a compelling testimony to the power of art. The Artwork: Seizure Hiorns' Seizure is a unique and ambitious artwork, wherein an entire council flat was filled with 75,000 liters of liquid copper sulphate to create an otherworldly blue crystal environment. The astounding transformation took place when the liquid was allowed to form intricate crystalline structures along the walls, floors, and ceilings, fostering an alien landscape that captivated both critics and audiences alike. He often uses copper sulphate in his works as a subversive material, extending his overarching themes of scientific manipulation and the powerful influence of chemistry on our lives. The Turner Prize Nomination: Seizure's immediate impact on the art community led to Roger Hiorns being nominated for the Turner Prize in 2009. The Turner Prize, established in 1984, is an annual award presented to British visual artists that serves to recognize and promote innovative contemporary works. Inclusion in the shortlist of nominees is a notable honor, and earning such distinction for Hiorns highlighted the immense scale of Seizure's success. While ultimately, he did not emerge as the winner, it solidified his reputation as an avant-garde, experimental artist, and validated his ambitious and imaginative artwork. The Threat of Demolition: However, in the years that followed, Seizure's future faced uncertainty as the London council flat that housed the installation was slated for demolition. This recalcitrant artwork, grounded in its immense originality, was regarded as a symbol of resilience; yet, it risked having its lifespan tragically cut short by the forces of urban redevelopment. To lose such a celebrated piece would be to lose a critical piece of contemporary art history - an irreplaceable opportunity for future generations to experience Hiorns' groundbreaking vision. Saving Seizure: In an extraordinary effort by the Arts Council Collection and Artangel, Seizure was carefully relocated to Yorkshire Sculpture Park in Wakefield, where it was unveiled in 2013. A painstaking process, the delicate task of transferring the crystal-filled room to its new home demonstrated the dedication of all involved in preserving this one-of-a-kind artwork. The relocation successfully saved Seizure from the impending demolition while allowing it to continue to inspire and provoke thought among those who experience it. Conclusion: Roger Hiorns' Seizure not only showcases an artist's approach to combining chemistry and creativity, but also serves as a potent example of the enduring impact of contemporary art. It is a testament to the collective commitment of art enthusiasts, institutions, and Hiorns' own vision that Seizure was saved from the maws of demolition. Its survival signifies a triumph for contemporary art, emphasizing the significance of preserving and nurturing originality and creativity for generations to come."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Canada uses alternative methods to produce electricity while the US use more coal and oil. Both countries recently participated in a Global Warming Council.  But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  What is an answer for this question: Which country uses fewer non-renewable resources? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, it appears that Canada uses fewer non-renewable resources compared to the United States. The background provided suggests that the United States primarily relies on fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, for electricity production. This method contributes to environmental issues such as air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Both fossil fuels and nuclear fission processes involve the use of limited, non-renewable resources. In contrast, Canada is described as utilizing alternative methods to produce electricity. Although the specific methods are not mentioned, it is reasonable to infer that these alternative methods likely involve renewable resources, such as hydroelectric, solar, or wind power. Renewable energy sources are more sustainable and environmentally friendly, as they do not contribute to the pollution and depletion of natural resources associated with fossil fuels and nuclear fission. Therefore, considering the information provided, Canada uses fewer non-renewable resources for its electricity production compared to the United States, which relies heavily on fossil fuels. This distinction showcases Canada's commitment to sustainable energy practices that maintain the integrity of the environment and natural resources for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There was a binding provision for a new delimitation of the federal territory: the Federal Territory must be revised ... (paragraph 1). Moreover, in territories or parts of territories whose affiliation with a Land had changed after 8 May 1945 without a referendum, people were allowed to petition for a revision of the current status within a year after the promulgation of the Basic Law (paragraph 2).

Q: Why is there difficulty in defining process theology ?","output":"There is difficulty in defining process theology because: 1. Diversity of views: Process theologians hold diverse views and interpretations, which leads to various directions and understandings of the theology itself. 2. Transdisciplinary approach: Process theologians often come from different academic backgrounds and integrate their expertise with process theology. This results in a wide range of perspectives and cross-disciplinary practices that make it difficult to pin down a single, concise definition. For example: - John B. Cobb, Jr. has written books on biology and economics and incorporates those fields into his understanding of process theology. - Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead's ideas with poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and feminist theory. - Charles Birch was both a theologian and a geneticist, which influenced his understanding of process theology. - Franklin I. Gamwell writes on theology and political theory, incorporating those disciplines in his approach to process theology. 3. Evolving nature: As new ideas and theories continue to develop, process theology adapts and incorporates these new insights, making it a constantly evolving and dynamic field. 4. Broadness of the concept: Process theology is based on a broad concept of understanding reality, which allows for varied interpretations and ideas to coexist within the framework.

Summarize the following: Bright colors pop and get people’s attention. Add vibrant pinks, greens, or blues to the flyer so it stands out. For example, you could make the background of the flyer magenta or turquoise and add a vibrant-colored border around it. Contrasting colors are colors that are opposite on the color wheel. Colors that contrast make each other stand out, so incorporating them into your design can help people notice the flyer more easily. Some contrasting colors you could use are blue and orange, yellow and purple, and green and red. Try using only shades of blue or all reds. You don't have to use a lot of colors for the flyer to catch people's attention; people just want to look at something aesthetically pleasing. You can achieve that with one eye-catching color. A high-quality photo will get people's attention, just make sure it's relevant to the event. Avoid using photos that are blurry or low-quality. For example, if you're advertising an event at the beach, you could use a photo of a palm-tree-lined beach that has vibrant greens and blues.

Movie title: Inside Man Movie plot: Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), seated in what appears to be a jail cell, opens the film with a prologue about having carried out the \\"perfect robbery\\". A team of masked robbers, dressed as painters who call each other by variants of the name \\"Steve\\", seize control of a Manhattan bank and take the employees and patrons hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms. Additionally, they take all of the hostages' clothes and dress everyone in jumpsuits and masks identical to those of the robbers. This way, the robbers and hostages will be indistinguishable to the police. Police surround the bank and detectives Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) take charge of the negotiations. Russell, the leader of the robbers, demands food. The police supply pizzas whose boxes include listening devices; these pick up a language which the police finally identify as Albanian. However, they discover that the conversations are just old propaganda recordings of the deceased Albanian communist dictator Enver Hoxha; it becomes clear that the robbers anticipated surveillance. After being informed of the robbery, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), the chairman of the board of directors and founder of the bank, hires \\"fixer\\" Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to try to protect the contents of his safe deposit box within the bank. White, with assistance from the Mayor of New York City, arranges a conversation with Russell, who allows her to enter the bank and inspect the contents of the box, which include documents from Nazi Germany. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money that he received from the Nazis for unspecified services, resulting in the deaths of many Jewish people during World War II. White tells Russell that Case will pay him a substantial sum to destroy the contents of the box. She claims she can arrange a minimal jail sentence as Russell and his team have not yet stolen anything or hurt or killed anyone; Russell declines her offers. Frazier demands... The answer is:","output":"A week after the robbery, Russell (Clive Owen) emerges from hiding within the bank's storage room among large stacks of safety deposit boxes. He had been hiding inside a false wall built by his team during the standoff, allowing him to evade the police. He then retrieves a diamond ring and other valuable items from the safety deposit box he had been after, which originally contained incriminating evidence against Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). The evidence linked Case to illegal dealings with the Nazis during World War II. Russell anonymously returns the incriminating documents to the authorities, ensuring that Case is prosecuted for his past crimes. Russell then walks away from the bank disguised as a hostage he had released earlier and successfully escapes with the stolen valuables."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"James Wilson was a prominent Scottish businessman, economist, and politician who played a vital role in the United Kingdom's political and financial landscape during the 19th century. Born on 3 June 1805 in Hawick, Roxburghshire, Scotland, Wilson's passion for economics and politics would guide him to a successful career spanning several important positions in government. Despite the lack of a formal education from an alma mater, Wilson demonstrated his prowess in the realm of economics. He gained widespread recognition after founding The Economist in 1843, a publication which remains highly influential to this day. This accomplishment would serve as a springboard for his political career, and he became a respected Whig Liberal Party member during the reign of Queen Victoria. In January 1853, Wilson was appointed Financial Secretary to the Treasury, working under Prime Minister Earl of Aberdeen. He would later hold the position of Vice-President of the Board of Trade under Prime Minister Viscount Palmerston. Concurrently, he served as the Paymaster-General from 18 June 1859 until 12 August 1859. Wilson's tenure in these roles was marked by his expertise and commitment to the economic stability of the country. During his career, Wilson had the opportunity to work with and succeed notable contemporaries, such as George Alexander Hamilton, Lord Lovaine, and Hon. William Cowper. This allowed him to further shape economic policies in the UK and strengthen his reputation as a skilled economist and politician. On a personal front, Wilson was married to Elizabeth Preston, with whom he shared his life. His legacy as an influential figure was immortalized in a portrait by Sir John Watson-Gordon, titled \\"A Gordon,\\" which was published in \\"The Pursuit of Reason: Portrait of The Economist 1843-1993.\\" The portrait was presented to Mrs. Wilson in 1859 by the Royal Scottish Academy. Tragically, Wilson's life took a sudden turn when he passed away on 11 August 1860 in Calcutta, India. Despite his untimely death, Wilson's contributions to the fields of economics and politics remain celebrated and are often seen as the groundwork for major advancements in the United Kingdom. Today, his memory is preserved through his portrait and the continued success of The Economist, serving as a testament to his undeniable impact on the financial and political spheres in not only the United Kingdom but also the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford. The lecture that evening was on \\"fairy life\\", and at the end of the meeting Polly Wright showed the two fairy photographs taken by her daughter and niece to the...  Guess a valid title for it!

Context: A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters.

Q: what is the sum of the protons and neutrons in an atom? A:","output":"To find the sum of protons and neutrons in an atom, we need to know the atomic number (number of protons) and the atomic mass of the element (the sum of protons and neutrons). Without this information, it is impossible to directly provide an answer. However, here is a step-by-step explanation to find the sum of protons and neutrons in an atom: Step 1: Determine the element. - Ask for the name or symbol of the element in question. Step 2: Identify the atomic number. - The atomic number (Z) is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It also determines the element's position in the periodic table. Step 3: Find the atomic mass. - The atomic mass (A) is the summed total of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. This can be found below the symbol of the element on the periodic table. Step 4: Calculate the number of neutrons. - Subtract the atomic number (number of protons) from the atomic mass, i.e., Neutrons = Atomic Mass (rounded to the nearest whole number) - Atomic Number (Z). Step 5: Add the protons and neutrons. - Add the atomic number (protons) and the neutron number to get the sum of protons and neutrons in the atom, i.e., Protons + Neutrons = Atomic Number (Z) + Neutron Number.

What are the stages of evolution of public administration? Step 1: Research the historical development of public administration. Public administration has evolved through various stages since its early days. These stages are: a) Classical Era (1887-1926): This period is marked by the founding of the discipline, with Woodrow Wilson's essay, \\"The Study of Administration,\\" advocating separating politics from administration. Main contributors to the field during this era include Max Weber, Frederick Taylor, and Henri Fayol. b) Human Relations Movement (1927-1950): This period focused on the study of human behavior in organizations, emphasizing the importance of interpersonal relationships and social factors. The Hawthorne Experiments led by Elton Mayo were significant in this era. c) Behavioral Approach (1951-1970): During this phase, the focus shifted towards a more comprehensive understanding of individual and group behavior in organizations. Researchers like Simon, March, and Selznick were instrumental during this period. d) Public Administration as a Science (1971-1990): The discipline achieved a concrete status as an academic field during this phase, as researchers aimed to establish a more scientific approach to the study of public administration. e) New Public Management (1990-2000): This era saw a widespread adoption of market-based techniques and the introduction of public-private partnerships, emphasizing efficiency and customer orientation in public administration. f) Public Governance (2000-Present): In this phase, public administration emphasizes a more democratic approach, collaboration, and co-production involving citizens and stakeholders for better public decisions, processes, and outcomes. 2. What is Public Administration? What is the main principle? Step 1: Research and define Public Administration. Public Administration is the organization, management, and implementation of public policies, programs, and services carried out by government agencies and public servants at various levels to meet the needs of society. Step 2: Identify the main principle of Public Administration. The main principle of Public Administration is to serve the public interest by directing resources, managing organizations, and implementing policies in an efficient, effective, and transparent manner, aiming to achieve the collective goals set by society. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Step 1: Compare the questions to check for similarity. The first question asks about the stages of evolution of public administration, the second question asks for the definition and main principle of public administration. These inquiries are different, as the first question focuses on the historical development, while the second question addresses the definition and core principle. Step 2: Determine whether the questions have the same meaning. Based on the comparison, these questions do not have the same meaning. They pertain to distinct aspects of public administration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Ottavio's marriage troubled Alessandro; he struggled with the burden of chastity and entertained fantasies of marrying a princess. He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given as a means to strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost.
