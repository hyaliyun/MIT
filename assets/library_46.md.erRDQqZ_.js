If the resulting polynomial has at least two integer roots, the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins. Prove that, by choosing the right strategy, the first player can always win.","output":"Let's analyze the given polynomial: [P(X) = X^4 + square X^3 + square X^2 + square X + square ] where each square represents a placeholder for a non-zero integer, selected by two players alternately. The second player wins if the resulting polynomial has at least two integer roots; otherwise, the first player wins.  Assumptions: We must distinguish between two cases: 1. **Distinct Integer Roots**: The polynomial must have two different integer roots. 2. **Repeated Integer Roots**: The polynomial must have a double (repeated) integer root. We will show the first player can always win in both scenarios by choosing an appropriate strategy.  Player 1 Strategy: 1. **First Move**:    The first player places (-1) in the constant term of the polynomial, leaving the polynomial as:     [ P(X) = X^4 + a_3 X^3 + a_2 X^2 + a_1 X - 1 ] This choice ensures that the potential integer roots are only (pm 1) (positive or negative factors of (-1)). 2. **Second Player's Move**:    The second player places a non-zero integer ((a_i neq 0)) in one of the remaining empty positions.     3. **First Player's Move**:    The first player places another non-zero integer ((a_j neq 0)) in one of the remaining empty positions.     4. **Second Player's Move**:    The second player places a non-zero integer ((a_k neq 0)) in the only remaining position. After all moves, we need to verify that there cannot be two integer roots for the polynomial:  Verifying Potential Roots: Observe that after all placements, the polynomial takes the form: [ P(X) = X^4 + a_3 X^3 + a_2 X^2 + a_1 X - 1 ] We examine the polynomial to ensure it does not have (pm 1) as roots. Suppose (X=1) and (X=-1) are roots: 1. For (X = 1): [ 1^4 + a_3 cdot 1^3 + a_2 cdot 1^2 + a_1 cdot 1 - 1 = 0 implies 1 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 - 1 = 0 implies a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 0 ] 2. For (X = -1): [ (-1)^4 + a_3 cdot (-1)^3 + a_2 cdot (-1)^2 + a_1 cdot (-1) - 1 = 0 implies 1 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 - 1 = 0 implies -a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = 0 ] We now have two simultaneous equations: [ 1. quad a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 0 ] [ 2. quad -a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = 0 ] Adding these equations, we get: [ a_3 + a_2 + a_1 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = 0 implies 2a_2 = 0 implies a_2 = 0 ] However, if (a_2 = 0), this would violate the rule that coefficients must be non-zero. Hence, having (X = 1) and (X = -1) as roots is impossible.  Scenario of Root Multiplicity: Now consider the possibility of double roots: 1. **Double Root (X=1):** If (X=1) is a double root, the conditions are: [ a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 0 ] [ 4 + 3a_3 + 2a_2 + a_1 = 0 ] This can be written as: [ a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 0 ] [ 4 + 3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 = 0 ] Subtracting these equations gives: [ (4 + 3a_3 + 2a_2 + a_1) - (a_3 + a_2 + a_1) = 0 implies 4 + 2a_3 + a_2 = 0 implies a_2 = -4 - 2a_3 ] Similarly: 2. **Double Root (X=-1):** If (X=-1) is a double root: [ -a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = 0 ] [ 4 - 3a_3 + 2a_2 - a_1 = 0 ] This gives: [ 2a_2 = -4 - a_1 ] If (a_2 = 0), this would again contradict the non-zero requirement for the coefficients. In each case, regardless of the coefficients ((a_1, a_3)) chosen by the second player, they must place values such that the polynomial results in configurations violating the rules, hence leaving only the scenario with no two integer roots possible. Thus, the first player can always strategize to avoid polynomials with two integer roots, securing a win. boxed{The first player always wins.}"},{"instruction":"Given that cos (α+ dfrac {π}{4})= dfrac {7 sqrt {2}}{10} and cos 2α= dfrac {7}{25}, find the value of sin α+cos α (   ) A: dfrac {3}{5} B:  dfrac {3}{5} C:  dfrac {1}{5} D: dfrac {1}{5}","output":"Since cos (α+ dfrac {π}{4})= dfrac {7 sqrt {2}}{10}, We can derive that cos α-sin α= dfrac {7}{5}, Given that cos 2α= dfrac {7}{25}=cos ^{2}α-sin ^{2}α=(cos α-sin α)(cos α+sin α)= dfrac {7}{5}×(cos α+sin α), We can solve for cos α+sin α= dfrac {1}{5}.

Since (x) is an integer, we round up, giving (x = 34).     2. For the upper boundary, we find (x) where (5x) is below (1000). So, (5x < 1000) leads to (x < frac{1000}{5} = 200). 3. The next step is ensuring (6x) is (1000) or more, otherwise there would be (6) three-digit multiples. We find (6x = 1000) gives (x = frac{1000}{6} approx 166.67).

Therefore, there are 5 times 5 times 5 = 125 points in total in this three-dimensional grid. 2. **Concept of Line Formation in 3D**:    A line is uniquely determined if we know two distinct points through it. To satisfy the requirement of passing through exactly five points, these points must be collinear and equally spaced. 3. **Direction Vectors**:    The direction vector (a, b, c) describes the movement from one point to another on the line. For the points to remain in bounds and form five collinear points, a, b, c must ensure that the fifth point (i+4a, j+4b, k+4c) is still within the bounds of 1 to 5. 4. **Calculation of Valid Directions**:    Given the constraints, a, b, c should be in the set {-1, 0, 1}. Each component’s maximum step must be such that even after four increments, we do not exceed the boundaries of the grid. 5. **Counting Lines**:    For each vector (a, b, c) (not all zero) and each starting point (i, j, k), we check if moving in the direction defined by (a, b, c) produces four more points within the grid bounds, all distinct. We also adjust for any overcounting due to symmetry and redundant lines. 6. **Symmetry and Redundancy Adjustment**:    Due to symmetry, lines can be overcounted; hence we must ensure each line is counted once.

The slope m is given by    [    m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{0 - 8}{8 - 0} = -1.    ]    Since the slope is -1, line AC makes a 45^circ angle with the x-axis, and consequently, the angle between overline{RC} and overline{SC} is 45^circ. 3. **Identify the Triangle as Isosceles**: Given that triangle RSC has a right angle at S and a 45^circ angle at C, the third angle must also be 45^circ to sum up to 180^circ. This makes triangle RSC an isosceles right-angled triangle, where RS = SC = x. 4. **Calculate the Length of RS and SC**: The area of triangle RSC is given as 12.5.

Similarly, R is 5 units above S, resulting in coordinates (3,0+5) = (3,5). 6. **Calculate the Positive Difference of the x and y Coordinates of R**: The difference between the x and y coordinates of R is 5 - 3 = 2.

This would mean that this trainee is connected with every other trainee. Hence, every other trainee must know this trainee (degree 79).     - However, if a trainee has a degree of 79, no trainee can have a degree of 0 because that would mean the trainee knows nobody, which contradicts the condition of the 79-degrees scenario. 4. **Examine the Implication**:     - The possible degrees of each trainee range between 0 and 79, but if any trainee has a degree of 79, no trainees can have a degree of 0.     - Therefore, the valid degrees that a trainee can have are from 1 to 79 (eliminating 0 if 79 is present due to the mutual knowledge contradiction). 5. **Counting Degrees within the Range 1 to 79**:     - This range has 79 possible values (since it includes both endpoints).     - Given there are 80 trainees, and the range of possible degrees is limited to 79, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two trainees must have the same number of connections or degrees. # Conclusion: By the Pigeonhole Principle, in a group of 80 trainees where the potential degrees of connectivity range from 1 to 79, at least two trainees must necessarily have the same number of connections.

This implies that ( angle BCA) is bisected by line (CR), and the intersections (P) and (Q) on (BC) and (AC) respectively are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of (CR). Consequently, the areas of triangle RPK and triangle RQL are equal by symmetry. 2. **General Case when ( AC neq BC )**:        Without loss of generality, let ( AC < BC ). We denote (O) as the circumcenter of (triangle ABC), and note the following properties:    - The angles in (triangle CLK) and (triangle CKP) are similar.    - Considering perpendicular bisectors: (CL) and (CK) meet the respective sides at (Q) and (P) such that (K) and (L) are the midpoints of ( BC ) and ( AC ), respectively. 3. **Angle Relationships**:    Notice that triangles (triangle CPQ) and (triangle CQK) are right triangles since (P) and (Q) lie on the perpendicular bisectors of (BC) and (AC).

The line (l) passes through the circumcenter (O).    Since (triangle OPQ) is isosceles with (O) being the circumcenter, points (P) and (Q) are equidistant from point (R) regarding (CR). Therefore, they are equidistant from each other and symmetric with respect to (l):    [    RP = CQ quad text{and} quad RQ = CP    ] 5. **Equate the Areas**:    Using these relationships, we can express the areas of (triangle RQL) and (triangle RPK):    [    frac{S(triangle RQL)}{S(triangle RPK)} = frac{frac{1}{2} RQ cdot QL cdot sin angle RQL}{frac{1}{2} RP cdot PK cdot sin angle RPK}    ]    Substituting the known equalities, we get:    [    frac{S(triangle RQL)}{S(triangle RPK)} = frac{RQ}{RP} cdot frac{QL}{PK} = frac{CP}{CQ} cdot frac{CQ}{CP} = 1    ] Since the ratio of the areas is 1, we conclude that the areas of (triangle RQL) and (triangle RPK) are equal.

Intersect the tetrahedron with a plane (alpha), which is parallel to the edges (AC) and (BD). 3. The resulting quadrilateral (PQRS) in the section will be a parallelogram.  4. In fact, since the plane (ABC) passes through the line (AC) and intersects the plane (alpha) along the line ( PQ ), it follows that (PQ parallel AC). 5. Similarly, (RS parallel AC), thus (PQ parallel RS). 6. In the same way, (QR parallel PS parallel BD).

Triangle similarity (e.g., triangle (triangle DAC sim triangle D_{S0}R_0)) shows that route intersections of edges by the plane section divide the edges proportionally.

This gives the equality   sqrt{frac{xy}{ab}} = frac{1}{2} only when   frac{x}{a} = frac{y}{b} = frac{1}{2} 8. Thus,  xy attains its maximum value when   frac{x}{a} = frac{y}{b} = frac{1}{2} 9.

Step 1: Understand the properties of the inverse proportion function y=frac{k}{x} when k<0. - Since k<0, the graph of the function is located in the second and fourth quadrants. This is because for y to be positive (second quadrant), x must be negative (since k is negative), and for y to be negative (fourth quadrant), x must be positive. Step 2: Determine the quadrant in which each point lies based on the value of y. - Point A(x_{1}, 1) has a positive y-value, so it lies in the second quadrant. - Point B(x_{2}, -5) has a negative y-value, so it lies in the fourth quadrant. - Point C(x_{3}, 3) also has a positive y-value, so it lies in the second quadrant as well. Step 3: Analyze the behavior of y as x increases in each quadrant for an inverse proportion function with k<0. - In the second quadrant, as x increases (moves left to right), y decreases because x is negative and y is positive. The more negative x is, the larger the positive value of y. - In the fourth quadrant, as x increases (moves left to right), y increases because both x and y are positive. The larger the value of x, the smaller the negative value of y (closer to zero). Step 4: Apply this understanding to the given points. - Since A and C are in the second quadrant and B is in the fourth quadrant, and considering how y changes with x in these quadrants:     - Between A and C, since C has a larger y-value (3 compared to 1), C must have a more negative x-value than A. Therefore, x_{1} < x_{3}.     - B is in the fourth quadrant, where x is positive, so x_{2} must be greater than both x_{1} and x_{3}, which are negative.

( O ) is the midpoint of ( BC ). The bisectors of ( angle BAC ) and ( angle MON ) intersect at point ( R ). We need to show that the circumcircles of ( triangle BMR ) and ( triangle CNR ) intersect at a point lying on the line segment ( BC ). 2. **Step 2: Highlight geometric properties**      Since ( BC ) is the diameter of the circle, by the Thales' theorem, ( angle BMC = angle BNC = 90^circ ). This also infers that ( triangle BMC ) and ( triangle BNC ) are right angles at ( M ) and ( N ) respectively. 3. **Step 3: Relate triangles ( triangle ANM ) and ( triangle ABC )**      By properties of circles with diameter, ( angle BMC = 90^circ ) and ( angle BNC = 90^circ ), implying that points ( M ) and ( N ) are the feet of the perpendiculars from ( A ) to ( BC ).

Similarly, ( angle NRA = angle NMA = angle ACK ), implies ( RNCK ) is cyclic. 8. **Conclusion**      Thus, ( K ) lies on both circumcircles of ( triangle BMR ) and ( triangle CNR ), confirming that they have a common point that lies on the line segment ( BC ):    [    boxed{K}    ]"},{"instruction":"For how many real numbers x is sqrt{(x3)^2} a real number? textbf{(A) }text{none}qquad textbf{(B) }text{one}qquad textbf{(C) }text{two}qquad textbf{(D) }text{a finite number greater than two}qquad textbf{(E) }infty","output":"To determine for how many real numbers x the expression sqrt{-(x-3)^2} is a real number, we first consider the expression inside the square root, -(x-3)^2: [ -(x-3)^2 = -1 cdot (x-3)^2 ] Since (x-3)^2 is always nonnegative, -(x-3)^2 is nonpositive.

Select a point O on l_1 and construct a perpendicular line l_2 to l_1 passing through O, serving as the y-axis.    - Consequently, we have a Cartesian coordinate system with l_1 as the x-axis and l_2 as the y-axis.

For every integer ( n geq 2 ) and real number ( r > 1 ), we define a shape ( mathcal{R}(n, r) ) as follows:        - Start with a rectangle of width ( 1 ) and height ( r ). Glue a rectangle of height ( r ) and width ( r^2 ) to its left.    - Then, glue a rectangle of width ( 1 + r^2 ) and height ( r^3 ) below our figure, followed by a rectangle of height ( r + r^3 ) and width ( r^4 ) to the left of our figure.    - Next, glue a rectangle of width ( 1 + r^2 + r^4 ) and height ( r^5 ) below our figure, followed by a rectangle of height ( r + r^3 + r^5 ) and width ( r^6 ) to the left of our figure.    - Continue this process until we have assembled ( 2n ) rectangles together.     Observe that by construction, the entire shape ( mathcal{R}(n, r) ) is a rectangle composed of two similar \\"staircase\\" polygons which are not congruent since ( r > 1 ). 2. **Aspect Ratio Calculation:**    The shape ( mathcal{R}(n, r) ) is similar to a ( 1 times f_n(r) ) rectangle where ( f_n(r) ) is given by:        [    f_n(r) = frac{1 + r^2 + cdots + r^{2n}}{r + r^3 + cdots + r^{2n-1}} = r + frac{1}{r + r^3 + cdots + r^{2n-1}}.    ] 3. **Continuity and Range Analysis:**    We claim that this form ( f_n(r) ) can achieve any ( k > 1 ). By examining the limits:        [    lim_{r to 1^+} f_n(r) = 1 + frac{1}{n},    ]    [    lim_{r to infty} f_n(r) = infty.    ]        Since ( f_n ) is continuous, it achieves all values greater than ( 1 + frac{1}{n} ). Therefore, by taking sufficiently large ( n ) such that ( k > 1 + frac{1}{n} ), we can construct a valid ( mathcal{R}(n, r) ) for any ( k > 1 ). 4. **Special Case ( k = 1 ):**    Now, consider the case when ( k = 1 ). Suppose a square is dissected into two similar polygons ( mathcal{P} sim mathcal{Q} ). Let ( Gamma ) denote their common boundary.    - Counting the number of sides suggests ( Gamma ) must run from one side of the square to the opposite side (possibly ending at a corner).     - Orient ( Gamma ) from north to south with ( mathcal{P} ) on the west and ( mathcal{Q} ) on the east.    Let ( s ) be the length of the longest segment in ( Gamma ). Then, the longest side length of ( mathcal{P} ) and ( mathcal{Q} ) is ( max(s, 1) ). 5. **Proof for the longest side:**    - For ( mathcal{P} ):      The longest edges of ( mathcal{P} ), not in ( Gamma ), are either the west edge of the original square (length 1) or its north/south edges (length at most 1). The same argument applies to ( mathcal{Q} ).    Since ( mathcal{P} ) and ( mathcal{Q} ) have the same longest side, they must be congruent, contradicting the problem's condition of non-congruent similar polygons. # Conclusion: The dissection is impossible for ( k = 1 ) and possible for every ( k > 0 ) except for ( k = 1 ).

If a segment ( s ) is not part of the broken line ( L ), then ( L ) must pass through its top vertex ( x ). Since each vertex has exactly three neighboring vertices, ( L ) must include the edges directly to the left and right of ( x ), enclosing the two squares on either side of ( s ) in red.    Consequently, every white square on the top row must have segments of ( L ) to its left and right, ensuring that no two adjacent squares are white. The number of adjacent red square pairs on the top row is given by:    [    2n - text{(number of red-white adjacent pairs)}    ]    where the number of red-white adjacent pairs is twice the number of white squares. Hence, the number of red-red adjacent pairs on the top row is even. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:**    Assume for some row ( l ) (not the bottom row), the number of pairs of adjacent red squares is even. 3. **Induction Step: Moving to Row ( l' ) Below ( l ):**    We denote the vertical segments in row ( l ) as ( a_{1}, a_{3}, a_{5}, ldots, a_{2k-1} ) for segments with a white square to the left and a red square to the right, and ( a_{2}, a_{4}, ldots, a_{2k} ) for segments with a red square to the left and a white to the right. Clearly, ( a_{1} < a_{2} < a_{3} < a_{4} < ldots < a_{2k} ). 4. **Calculating Red Pairs in Row ( l ):**    Between segments ( a_{2i-1} ) and ( a_{2i} ), there are ( a_{2i} - a_{2i-1} ) consecutive red squares, leading to ( a_{2i} - a_{2i-1} - 1 ) pairs of adjacent red squares. The total number of adjacent red pairs in row ( l ) is:        [    sum_{i=1}^{k} (a_{2i} - a_{2i-1} - 1) = left(sum_{i=1}^{k} a_{2i}right) - left(sum_{i=1}^{k} a_{2i-1}right) - k    ]    By the induction hypothesis, this value is even, implying ( sum_{i=1}^{2k} a_{i} + k ) is even. 5. **New Row ( l' ) Analysis:**    Define the positions of the vertical segments in ( l' ) as ( a_{1}', ldots, a_{2k'}' ). Let's merge the positions ( a_i ) and ( a_j' ) into a unified sequence ( c_1 leq c_2 leq ldots leq c_{2k + 2k'} ). Given ( c_0 = 0 ) and ( c_{2k + 2k'} = 2n + 1 ), we analyze changes around positions ( c_i ). 6. **Conclusion from Combined Analysis:**    By ensuring each vertex on row boundary pairs correctly, all transitions involve ( c_{2i+1} = c_{2i} + 1 ). Summing transitions over the entire row ( l' ), we find:    [    2n + 1 = left(sum_{j=1}^{k+k'} (c_{2j} - c_{2j-1})right) + (k + k' - 1)    ] 7. **Final Sum:**    Concluding, the sum    [    sum_{i=1}^{k + k'} (c_{2i} - c_{2i-1}) + k + k'    ]    is even, which means    [    sum_{i=1}^{2k + 2k'} c_i + k + k'    ]    Given our initial analysis and assumption, this sum is even by inductive hypothesis. Hence, the number of pairs of adjacent red squares remains even in row ( l' ). Finally, by mathematical induction, the number of pairs of adjacent red squares in every row is always even.

Observe that ( p^2 - 1 ) can be factored as:    [    p^2 - 1 = (p - 1)(p + 1)    ] 4. Since ( p ) is a prime number greater than 3, ( p ) cannot be divisible by 2 or 3. 5. ( p ) being not divisible by 2 implies that ( p ) must be odd, so ( p - 1 ) and ( p + 1 ) are consecutive even numbers.         - Since ( p ) is odd:       [       p - 1 equiv 0 pmod{2} text{ and } p + 1 equiv 0 pmod{2}       ]       Each of ( p - 1 ) and ( p + 1 ) is divisible by 2, and their product is divisible by 4.   6. One of these numbers, ( p - 1 ) or ( p + 1 ), must be divisible by 4.       - For example: If ( p equiv 1 pmod{4} ), then ( p - 1 ) is divisible by 4.       - Or if ( p equiv 3 pmod{4} ), then ( p + 1 ) is divisible by 4. 6. Since ( p ) is not divisible by 3:       - ( p equiv 1 pmod{3} ) or ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ). If ( p equiv 1 pmod{3} ), then ( p - 1 equiv 0 pmod{3} ). If ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ), then ( p + 1 equiv 0 pmod{3} ). 7. Therefore, one of ( p - 1 ) or ( p + 1 ) is also divisible by 3. 8. Given that ( (p - 1)(p + 1) ) is divisible by both 4 and 3, it must be divisible by 12:    [    (p - 1)(p + 1) equiv 0 pmod{12}    ] 9. Thus:    [    p^2 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{12} implies p^2 equiv 1 pmod{12}    ]  Second Solution: 1. All prime numbers ( p ) greater than 3 can be expressed in the form ( 6k + 1 ) or ( 6k - 1 ). This is based upon the structure of prime numbers which aren't divisible by either 2 or 3. 2. Consider the two possible forms for ( p ):     - If ( p = 6k + 1 ):       [       p^2 = (6k + 1)^2 = 36k^2 + 12k + 1 = 12(3k^2 + k) + 1       ]       Thus:       [       p^2 equiv 1 pmod{12}       ]     - If ( p = 6k - 1 ):       [       p^2 = (6k - 1)^2 = 36k^2 - 12k + 1 = 12(3k^2 - k) + 1       ]       Thus:       [       p^2 equiv 1 pmod{12}       ] 3.

By induction, the initial inequality yields (a_1 leq a_n leq a_1 + k(n-1)) for all positive integers (n). Thus, we have (0 < a_M leq a_1 + k(M-1) < (k+1)M).    - By the second criterion, (a_M = cM) for some positive integer (c leq k).    - Assume (a_n = cn) for some integer (n geq k + 1). Then, we have:      [      (c-1)(n+1) < cn leq a_{n+1} leq cn + k < (c+1)(n+1)      ]      so we must have (a_{n+1} = c(n+1)).    - Similarly, if (n > k + 1), we have:      [      (c-1)(n-1) < cn - k leq a_{n-1} leq cn < (c+1)(n-1)      ]      so (a_{n-1} = c(n-1)).    - The induction step is complete in both directions. 2. **Lemma 2**: If a positive integer (t) satisfies ((f_{k+1} circ f_k circ ldots circ f_2)(t) leq k(k+1)), then (t) is excellent.    **Proof**:    - Consider the sequence ({a_n, n ge 1}) with (a_1 = t), (a_{n+1} = f_{n+1}(a_n)) for (n leq k), and (a_n = n frac{a_{k+1}}{k+1}) for (n geq k + 1).    - By definition of (f), we have (a_1 leq a_2 leq ldots leq a_{k+1}), and clearly (a_{k+1} leq a_{k+2} leq ldots), so the whole sequence is non-decreasing.    - Furthermore, (n | a_n) for (n leq k + 1), and thus (n | a_n) for all (n geq 1).    - For (n leq k), we have:      [      a_{n+1} - a_n = f_{n+1}(a_n) - a_n leq n leq k      ]      while for (n geq k+1), we have:      [      a_{n+1} - a_n = frac{a_{k+1}}{k+1}      ]      But (a_{k+1} = (f_{k+1} circ f_k circ ldots circ f_2)(t) leq k(k+1)), so (a_{n+1} - a_n leq k) for all (n geq 1). This shows that we have constructed a good sequence ({a_n, n ge 1}) with (a_1 = t). Thus, (t) is excellent. 3. **Lemma 3**: A positive integer (t) is excellent if and only if (t leq (g_1 circ g_2 circ ldots circ g_k)(k(k+1))).    **Proof**:    - Let ({a_n, n ge 1}) be an arbitrary good sequence. Since a good sequence is non-decreasing and (n | a_n) for all positive integers (n), we have (a_n leq g_n(a_{n+1})) for each (n geq 1). In particular,      [      a_1 leq g_1(a_2) leq g_1(g_2(a_3)) leq ldots leq (g_1 circ g_2 circ ldots circ g_k)(a_{k+1})      ]      But by Lemma 1, (a_{k+1} leq k(k+1)).    - On the other hand, notice that (g_1) is an identity and ((f_m circ g_m)(n) = g_m(n) leq n) for each positive integer (m) and (n). So,      [      (f_{k+1} circ f_k circ ldots circ f_2)(t) leq (f_{k+1} circ f_k circ ldots circ f_2 circ g_1 circ g_2 circ ldots circ g_k)(k(k+1)) leq (f_{k+1} circ f_k circ ldots circ f_2 circ g_2 circ ldots circ g_k)(k(k+1)) leq ldots leq f_{k+1}(k(k+1)) = k(k+1)      ]    - By Lemma 2, (t) is indeed excellent. We are done. Using Lemma 3, we can determine all excellent positive integers. For (k = 5), we need to compute ((g_1 circ g_2 circ ldots circ g_5)(5 cdot 6)).

Let's analyze the number of integers in the sequence that can be divided by ( 2n-1 ).        - Since ( 2n-1 ) is among ( 1, 3, 5, ldots, 2n-1 ) itself appears exactly once in this sequence.    - Dividing the interval from ( 1 ) to ( 2n-1 ) by ( 2n-1 ) could yield one or zero full intervals (since ( 2n-1 > k ) for ( k < n )).      Consequently, the only number in this interval that ( k cdot (2n-1) ) for some integer ( k ) is ( 2n-1 ).

Let's analyze the sequence of numbers ( 2k-1 ) to ( 2(n+k)-1 ) divisible by ( d ).    - For any ( d ), consider the inclusivity of ( d ): ( 2s-1 ) and ( 2t-1 ), such as      [      begin{aligned}      (2s-1)d &leq 2n-1 < (2s+1)d,       (2t-1)d &< 2(a+1)-1 leq (2t+1)d.      end{aligned}      ]            Divide the sequence by inclusion of ( d ):            [      (2(t+s)-1)d leq 2(a+2n-1)-1.      ]    Plugging in values, we get:      [      begin{aligned}      (2(t+s)-1)d &= (2t-1)d + (2s-1)d + d                     &leq 2(a+1)-1 + 2n-1 + 2n-1                     &= 2(a+2n-1)-1.      end{aligned}      ]    As a result, ( u_n ) lessens to ( 2n-1 ) as also needing ( u_n geq 2n-1 ).

Can all the piles on the table eventually contain exactly 3 stones each after a certain number of steps?","output":"To determine if it is possible to have each pile on the table containing exactly 3 stones after several steps, we analyze the given operations and resulting conditions. Let's break down the solution step-by-step: 1. **Initial Configuration and Operations:**     - Initially, there is a single pile with 1001 stones.     - In each step, we remove one stone from a pile and split the remaining stones into two new piles.      2. **Counting Steps and Stones Removed:**     - If there are ( n ) piles at the end, it means we performed ( n - 1 ) operations. This is because each operation increases the number of piles by one:       [       text{Total operations} = n - 1       ]     - Since each operation removes one stone, the total number of stones removed is also ( n - 1 ). 3. **Total Stones Remaining:**     - Initially, there are 1001 stones. After ( n - 1 ) operations, we have removed ( n - 1 ) stones, leaving:       [       text{Remaining stones} = 1001 - (n - 1) = 1002 - n       ] 4. **Each Pile Should Contain 3 Stones:**     - At the end, each of the ( n ) piles should have exactly 3 stones. Therefore, the total number of stones in all piles is:       [       3n       ]      5. **Equating Remaining Stones to Pile Conditions:**     - The remaining stones must equal the total stones in all piles:       [       3n = 1002 - n       ] 6. **Solving the Equation:**     - Combine like terms to solve for ( n ):       [       3n + n = 1002        4n = 1002        n = frac{1002}{4} = 250.5       ]      7. **Interpreting the Result:**     - The solution ( n = 250.5 ) is not an integer. Given that the number of piles ( n ) must be a whole number, this results in a contradiction. Therefore, it is impossible to have each pile contain exactly 3 stones after performing the stated operations on the initial 1001 stones. # Conclusion: It is not possible to perform the given operations on the initial 1001 stones such that at some point each pile contains exactly 3 stones.

For each point P on a given polygon M, its symmetric point with respect to the line l is also considered. This produces a new polygon M'. **Step 5:** Examine the intersections. Let the line segments passing through points A and B perpendicular to line l be denoted by segments XY and UV, respectively. **Step 6:** Recognize the segments in M. These lines intersect M in two segments (possibly degenerate to points) of equal length because M is convex and M' arises from symmetrical reflection onto l. **Step 7:** Study the trapezoid structure. The convex combination of the two segments forms a trapezoid (or a degenerate trapezoid which could be a parallelogram or rectangle) that lies entirely within M. **Step 8:** Apply translation to the trapzoid. Symmetrizing this trapezoid with respect to line l results in another trapezoid within M' aligned perpendicular to l. **Step 9:** Prove the conclusion. Since A and B are points in M': - Each trapezoid formed connects points that lie in M by reflection related by l. - Therefore, the line segment joining any two points A and B within M' must also lie within M' after symmetrization. # Conclusion: M' is proven to be a convex polygon because any segment AB lies within M', demonstrating all line segments between any two points are also contained within the polygon. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The function f(x) is an even function defined on R. f(x1) is an odd function, and when 0 lt xleqslant 1, f(x)=log_{2024}frac{1}{x}.

This property of even functions allows us to make several deductions about the function f(x) and its related function f(x-1). 1. **Even Function Property**: For an even function, f(-x) = f(x). Applying this to our function, we get: [f(-x) = f(x)] [f(-x-1) = f(x+1)] 2. **Odd Function Property of f(x-1)**: Given that f(x-1) is an odd function, we have f(-x-1) = -f(x-1). This property allows us to establish a relationship between f(x+1) and f(x-1): [f(-x-1) = -f(x-1)] [f(x+1) = -f(x-1)] 3. **Periodicity Deduction**: From the relationship f(x+1) = -f(x-1), we can infer that f(x+2) = -f(x) and subsequently that f(x+4) = f(x). This shows that f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 4: [f(x+2) = -f(x)] [f(x+4) = f(x)] 4. **Calculating f(2025) + f(-frac{1}{2024})**: Given the periodicity of f(x), we can simplify the expression by using the period of 4 to find equivalent values within the given domain 0 < x leqslant 1: [f(2025) + f(-frac{1}{2024}) = f(1) + f(frac{1}{2024})] 5. **Using the Definition of f(x) for 0 < x leqslant 1**: Within this domain, f(x) = log_{2024}frac{1}{x}.

When two trains are moving in the same direction, the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds. Since the faster train is overtaking the slower train, the relative speed is ( V_f - V_s ). The faster train crosses a man in the slower train in 37 seconds. The length of the faster train is 370 meters. To find the relative speed in meters per second, we use the formula: [ text{Relative Speed} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Time}} ] The distance is the length of the faster train, which is 370 meters, and the time is 37 seconds.

This is because in an equilateral triangle, all internal angles are 60^circ. 3. **Tangency and congruence**: Since A, B, and C are points of tangency, the segments overline{EF}, overline{FD}, and overline{DE} are congruent. This further supports that triangle DEF is equilateral. 4. **Circle inscribed in the triangle**: The circle with points of tangency A, B, and C is inscribed in triangle DEF. The radius of the inscribed circle (incircle) can be related to the properties of the equilateral triangle. 5. **Height of the equilateral triangle**: The formula for the height h of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by:    [    h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} s    ]    However, the problem states that the height of an equilateral triangle is exactly 3 times the radius of its inscribed circle.

The figure (F) is the union of all rectangles that intersect the diagonal (AC). We need to prove that the diagonal (AC) divides the area of (F) equally. 2. **Break Down the Square:**    Divide the square into unit squares by constructing lines parallel to the sides of (ABCD). Label the unit squares with rows and columns starting from the bottom-left corner (B).  3. **Label the Rectangles:**    Identify rectangles of the same kind based on how many unit squares they contain and their position relative to the diagonal (AC). Specifically, we consider rectangles that are aligned such that their bottom-left corner belongs to a specific diagonal. 4. **Lemma and its Proof:**    - **Lemma:** The number of each kind of rectangle (bricks of each sort) does not depend on the specific division of the square.    - **Proof:** Note that a rectangle of sort (n) (where (n) is the distance from the main diagonal (AC)) will occupy a certain number of unit squares across (n)th diagonals. This number depends only on (n) and is consistent for each rectangle's position. 5. **Base Case:**    - For 1st sort rectangles (closest to the diagonal (AC)), there is only one configuration where the bottom-left corner is adjacent to (AC).     6. **Inductive Step:**    - Assume that for the first (k-1) sorts of rectangles, the number of such rectangles remains invariant with respect to the division. Now consider the (k)th sort of rectangles, which occupy unit squares in a manner independent of their specific positioning. Hence, the number of unit squares they use on the (k)th diagonal is also fixed. 7. **Return to the Main Problem:**    - Rectangles below (AC) include ones from various sorts, up to the sort that intersects (AC). By the inductive argument above, the total number of these rectangles does not change with different ways the square is divided. 8. **Conclude by Symmetry:**    - Rotating the square (180^{circ}) results in the same configuration but mirrored. This means the number of rectangles below the diagonal in the original orientation is equal to the number above the diagonal in the rotated setup. 9. **Final Argument:**    - The number of rectangles or bricks below the diagonal equals the number above.

Explain for which n this is possible.","output":"We are given the integers from 1 to 1598 written in a sequence and subsequently divided into several parts. We are told that the arithmetic mean of the numbers in the first part equals some natural number ( n ), the second part equals ( 2n ), the third part equals ( 3n ), and so on. Our task is to determine for which values of ( n ) this is possible. 1. **Consideration of Contiguous Natural Numbers**:    Suppose we have a contiguous subset of natural numbers. If the number of elements, ( k ), in this subset is even, then the subset can be divided into pairs, each with an odd sum. Since the sum is odd, their average is not an integer. Therefore, ( k ) must be odd for the average to be an integer. 2. **Odd Number of Elements**:    If ( k ) is odd, the arithmetic mean of the numbers from 1 to ( k ) corresponds to the middle number in the set. Thus, every part of the sequence must consist of an odd number of elements. 3. **Finding the Required Values**:     The arithmetic mean of numbers from 1 to ( k ) is given by the formula:     [     text{Arithmetic Mean} = frac{1 + k}{2}     ]     For this to be an integer, ( k ) must be of the form ( 2n - 1 ), where ( n ) is a natural number.

Given the last number of our entire sequence is 1598, it must match the form ( 2kn ) where ( k ) is a positive integer.

However, we must verify which of these values satisfy the original combinatorial equation. Looking back at the combinatorial equations, we can discard n = 1 and n = 2 since they don't make sense for the combinations (C_{n}^{3} and C_{n}^{5}), as n must be greater than 3 and 5 respectively. So, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's reconsider the step where we compare:  frac{1}{2 times (n - 3)!} = frac{1}{5 times 4 times (n - 5)!}  Instead of simplifying the factorials prematurely, let's write them out explicitly:  frac{1}{2 times (n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)!} = frac{1}{5 times 4 times (n - 5)!}  Now we can cancel out the (n - 5)! on each side:  frac{1}{2 times (n - 3)(n - 4)} = frac{1}{5 times 4}  Multiplying both sides by 2 times (n - 3)(n - 4) gives:  1 = frac{1}{10} times (n - 3)(n - 4)  Multiplying both sides by 10:  10 = (n - 3)(n - 4)  Expanding this out, we get:  n^2 - 7n + 12 = 10  Subtracting 10 from both sides, we have:  n^2 - 7n + 2 = 0  This is not a correctly factored form; we made an error in our calculations in the previous step. There should be one more expansion: Expanding the original brackets gives:  n^2 - 7n + 12 - 10 = 0  So we have:  n^2 - 7n + 2 = 0  To find the correct factors of the quadratic equation, we need two numbers that multiply to give 2 and add up to give -7. Since such integers do not exist, we made another mistake in factoring. We need to solve this quadratic equation to find the correct values of n:  n^2 - 7n + 2 = 0  This can be solved using the quadratic formula:  n = frac{-(-7) pm sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 2}}{2 cdot 1}  n = frac{7 pm sqrt{49 - 8}}{2}  n = frac{7 pm sqrt{41}}{2}  Since n must be an integer (because it's the number of elements in a set, and thus cannot be a fraction), this solution does not make sense in the context of combinations. We must have made an algebraic error. Let's go back and correct the algebraic manipulation. When we expand the expression (n - 3)(n - 4) correctly, we should get:  n^2 - 4n - 3n + 12 = 10  This simplifies to:  n^2 - 7n + 12 = 10  Subtracting 10 from both sides:  n^2 - 7n + 2 = 0  Instead of assuming this doesn't factor, let's apply the quadratic formula:  n = frac{7 pm sqrt{49 - 4 cdot 2}}{2}  n = frac{7 pm sqrt{41}}{2}  Again, this does not result in an integer solution for n. This is because there have been several algebraic errors throughout the process. The correct procedure is to equate the given combinatorial equation and simplify without introducing errors: Given the combination formula: C_{n}^{m} = frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}  We have: frac{n!}{3!(n - 3)!} = frac{n!}{5!(n - 5)!}  Simplifying both sides: frac{1}{3 times 2 times 1 times (n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)!} = frac{1}{5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 times (n - 5)!}  Canceling the factorial and common terms:  frac{1}{6(n - 3)(n - 4)} = frac{1}{120}  Multiplying by 120 and 6 to clear the denominators: 120 = 6(n - 3)(n - 4)  20 = (n - 3)(n - 4)  Expanding: n^2 - 4n - 3n + 12 = 20  n^2 - 7n - 8 = 0  Now we can factor properly: (n - 8)(n + 1) = 0  Given that n must be positive, the solution is: n - 8 = 0  Therefore: n = boxed{8}"},{"instruction":"de a triangle, there is a parallelogram.

Prove that ( n ) is divisible by 3.","output":"We need to prove that if the camel returns to its starting square after making ( n ) moves, then ( n ) is divisible by 3. Let's consider the pattern of the squares the camel traverses. Assume the camel starts on a black square. The sequence of squares traversed by the camel will be as follows: - If we denote black squares by ( B ) and white squares by ( W ), the sequence can be represented as: [ BWBWBWB ldots ] This sequence has a repeating pattern of 3 squares: one black, one white, one black. 1. **Initial Assumption**:    Suppose the camel starts on a black square and the sequence of colors on the squares it steps on subsequently follows the pattern ( BWBW ldots ). 2. **Periodic Nature of the Sequence**:    Notice that this sequence repeats every 3 steps:    [    text{1st step: ( B )}     text{2nd step: ( W )}     text{3rd step: ( B )}    ]    So, the pattern ( BWB ldots ) recurs every 3 steps. 3. **Returning to Starting Square**:    To return to the starting square, which is black (( B )), the number of steps ( n ) must be such that the sequence terminates at a position consistent with the starting color. This implies that after ( n ) steps, the position must again be black. 4. **Condition for ( n ) to Align with Starting Color**:    For the camel to end up on the starting square, which is black, ( n ) must be a multiple of the period of the pattern. Since the pattern has a period of 3, ( n ) must satisfy the condition:    [    n equiv 0 pmod{3}    ] 5. **Conclusion**:    Hence, if the camel returns to its initial position after ( n ) moves, ( n ) must be a multiple of 3, i.e.,    [    n = 3k text{ for some integer } k.    ] Therefore, ( n ) is divisible by 3.

The sum of these expenditures should equal the total amount of money John had: (1/2) * X + (1/3) * X + (1/10) * X + 10 = X To solve for X, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 30 (the least common multiple of 2, 3, and 10).

The volume of the wall can be calculated as: Volume of the wall = length × width × height Volume of the wall = L × 4 m × 20.5 m Since the total volume of bricks is equal to the volume of the wall, we can set the two equal to each other and solve for L: 4.92 m³ = L × 4 m × 20.5 m 4.92 m³ = 82L m³ (since 4 m × 20.5 m = 82 m²) Now, we solve for L: L = 4.92 m³ / 82 m² L = 0.06 m Therefore, the length of the wall is boxed{0.06}  meters.

Are there any other polyhedra with this property?","output":"To solve the problem, we need to demonstrate the existence of a polyhedron where each pair of vertices has an equilateral triangle formed with at least one common third vertex. Here's a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Fixing Two Points**:      Let us fix two arbitrary points ( A ) and ( B ). 2. **Finding Equilateral Triangles**:     The set of points ( X ) that form an equilateral triangle ( ABX ) with the fixed points ( A ) and ( B ) is a circle. This is derived from the fact that any point ( X ) equidistant from ( A ) and ( B ) will lie on this circle. 3. **Selecting Additional Points on the Circle**:    On this circle, select three additional points ( C ), ( D ), and ( E ) such that the triangle ( CDE ) is also equilateral. This ensures that we can construct more equilateral triangles involving these points.     - Since all points ( C ), ( D ), and ( E ) lie on the same circle and are part of an equilateral triangle ( CDE ),       it guarantees that ( AC ), ( BC ), ( AD ), ( BD ), ( AE ), and ( BE ) are the radii of the circle and therefore equal,       ensuring that ( A ), ( B ), and any one of ( C ), ( D ), or ( E ) form an equilateral triangle. 4. **Constructing the Polyhedron**:    The polyhedron formed by vertices ( A, B, C, D, E ) will have the desired property. We can describe this polyhedron more intuitively: it’s made up of two regular triangular pyramids (tetrahedrons) joined at their bases.     - In this construction:         - Triangle ( ABC ) is equilateral and flat on the circle.         - Similarly, triangles ( ABD ) and ( ABE ) are equilateral like ( ABE ).         - Finally, triangle ( CDE ) is also equilateral. 5. **Verification**:     By our construction method, any pair of these vertices forms an equilateral triangle with one other point:     - Triangles: ( ABC, ABD, ABE, CDE ) are all equilateral.     Thus, the polyhedron composed of vertices ( A, B, C, D, E ) satisfies the required property of having an equilateral triangle for every pair of vertices connected through a third vertex. # Conclusion: Therefore, the polyhedron formed by vertices ( A, B, C, D, E ) possesses the stated properties.

Let's calculate the LCM: LCM = 11 * 17 * 19 * 23 * 29 * 37 * 41 Now, let's calculate the product: LCM = 11 * 17 * 19 * 23 * 29 * 37 * 41 LCM = 2028119 * 37 * 41 LCM = 75020403 * 41 LCM = 3075837233 So the LCM of the given numbers is 3075837233. Now, we need to find the smallest number that is 27 less than a multiple of 3075837233. Since 3075837233 is already the smallest number divisible by all the given primes, we just need to subtract 27 from it to find the answer. Smallest number = LCM - 27 Smallest number = 3075837233 - 27 Smallest number = 3075837206 Therefore, the smallest number which, when diminished by 27, is divisible by 11, 17, 19, 23, 29, 37, and 41 is boxed{3075837206} ."},{"instruction":"The scales (1) and (2) in the given image are in balance.

To check for parity, we evaluate f(-x): [ f(-x) = (-x) - frac{1}{(-x)} = -x + frac{1}{x} = -(x - frac{1}{x}) = -f(x) ] Since f(-x) = -f(x), the function f(x) is an odd function.

Thus, the product (x_1 - x_2)(1 + frac{1}{x_1 x_2}) < 0, indicating f(x_1) - f(x_2) < 0, which means f(x_1) < f(x_2).

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation:    [    2(a - sqrt{2})^2 - 1 = 2(a^2 - 2asqrt{2} + 2) - 1    ]    [    = 2a^2 - 4asqrt{2} + 4 - 1     ]    [    = 2a^2 - 4asqrt{2} + 3    ] 5. So, the equation becomes:    [    b - sqrt{2} = 2a^2 - 4asqrt{2} + 3    ] 6. Rearrange terms to get:    [    b - 2a^2 - 3 = - sqrt{2} + (4asqrt{2})     ]    [    b - 2a^2 - 3 = (4a - 1)sqrt{2}    ] 7. For both (a) and (b) to be rational numbers, the right-hand side must also be rational. However, the term ((4a - 1)sqrt{2}) can only be rational if it equals zero (since (sqrt{2}) is irrational), that is:    [    4a - 1 = 0    ]    [    4a = 1    ]    [    a = frac{1}{4}    ] 8. Substitute (a = frac{1}{4}) back into (cos x = a - sqrt{2}):    [    cos x = frac{1}{4} - sqrt{2}    ]    However, we notice that:    [    frac{1}{4} - sqrt{2} < -1    ]    This is impossible since the range of cosine is ([-1, 1]). 9. Therefore, there does not exist a value of (x) for which both (cos x + sqrt{2}) and (cos 2x + sqrt{2}) are rational. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{No}} ]"},{"instruction":"What is the distance between the points (3, 5) and (7, 10)?","output":"To solve this problem, we calculate the distance between these two points using the distance formula: 1.

This implies (f(x) = x^2 + C). 2. **If (g(x)) is not constant.**     There must exist (a neq b) such that (g(a) neq g(b)). Define the period (T) of (g):     [     g(x + T) = g(x)     ]     Take (a = b + T), then:     [     g(u + y + T) = g(u - y + T) = g(u - y) = g(u + y)     ]     Since ((y)) is arbitrary and can span all reals, this implies (g) is constantly repeating for any period related to any real number, essentially making (g) a constant function, returning to our first case.

Consider the problem: We have a playing die with:    - One dot on two opposite faces,    - Two dots on another pair of opposite faces,    - Three dots on the remaining pair of opposite faces. 2. We are constructing a 2 times 2 times 2 cube from eight such dice.     3. Each die has six faces, and in constructing the larger cube, each face will contribute to the external surface of this larger cube. 4. The goal is to determine if the sums of the dots on the faces of the larger cube can be consecutive numbers (i.e., sums forming a sequence such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). 5. First, let's compute the total number of dots on each face of the larger cube:    - Each small cube has 14 dots in total (since 1+1+2+2+3+3 = 14).    - Since we have 8 such cubes, the total number of dots in the 2 times 2 times 2 cube is 8 times 14 = 112. 6. Now we consider how these dots can be visible on the six external faces of the larger cube:    - Each face of the larger cube will have 4 small faces from the small cubes.     7. Let's find the sum of the dots on the faces:    - Each of the 6 faces of the larger cube will collectively show the dots from 4 small cube faces.  8. Observing the distribution:    - The configuration of dots on the small cubes (1, 2, 3 dots per face) means each face on the larger cube needs to accommodate different arrangements of these small faces. 9. Now, let's find the possible sums:    - To find potential sums, we notice that there are a total of 48 visible faces (6 faces of the larger cube, each with 4 faces from small cubes).    - The number of dots on these faces should sum to 48 (since 112 minus the dots which are internal do not count).     10. Finally, evaluate if they can be consecutive numbers:     - If we sum six consecutive numbers, say from (n) to (n+5), the sum is:       [       text{Sum} = n + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) + (n+4) + (n+5) = 6n + 15.       ]            - We need this sum to be 48, but solving:       [       6n + 15 = 48 Rightarrow 6n = 33 Rightarrow n = frac{33}{6},       ]       which is not an integer.        11.

The equation representing their sum is:    [    x + (x + 20^circ) = 126^circ    ]    Simplifying this equation:    [    2x + 20^circ = 126^circ implies 2x = 126^circ - 20^circ = 106^circ implies x = frac{106^circ}{2} = 53^circ    ]    Therefore, the smaller angle is 53^circ. 3. **Calculate the measure of the second angle**: Since the second angle is 20^circ larger than the first:    [    x + 20^circ = 53^circ + 20^circ = 73^circ    ]    So, the second angle is 73^circ. 4. **Use the Triangle Sum Theorem to find the third angle**: The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180^circ. Thus, the third angle is:    [    180^circ - (53^circ + 73^circ) = 180^circ - 126^circ = 54^circ    ]    Therefore, the third angle is 54^circ. 5. **Determine the largest angle**: Comparing the angles 53^circ, 73^circ, and 54^circ, the largest angle is 73^circ. 6. **Conclusion**: The degree measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 73^circ. The final answer is C. boxed{73^circ}"},{"instruction":"Calculate the sum of the areas of all triangles whose vertices are vertices of a 2 by 2 by 2 cube.

The total possible triangles from these vertices are {27 choose 3} = 2925 triangles. We analyze similar classes of triangles: 1. **Face-contained triangles**: Each face is a 2 times 2 grid with 9 vertices, giving {9 choose 3} = 84 triangles per face. With 6 faces, this totals 504 triangles. Each triangle is a right triangle with legs of length 2, so each has area 2. 2. **Edge-spanning triangles**: Each 2-unit edge is a side for 6 triangles (more than the 1 by 1 by 1 case due to the increased number of vertices along the edge), with 12 edges giving 72 triangles. The dimensions of these triangles are a leg of 2, a face diagonal of sqrt{8}, and a space diagonal of sqrt{12}, so the area of each is frac{1}{2} times 2 times sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}. 3. **Vertex-associated triangles**: Each vertex connects uniquely to a set of three other vertices forming an equilateral triangle with sides sqrt{8}. The area of each is frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times (sqrt{8})^2 = 8sqrt{3}. With 27 vertices, we have 27 such triangles. Adding these areas, we have: - 504 times 2 = 1008 from face-contained triangles. - 72 times 2sqrt{2} = 144sqrt{2} from edge-spanning triangles. - 27 times 8sqrt{3} = 216sqrt{3} from vertex-associated triangles. Thus, the total area is 1008 + 144sqrt{2} + 216sqrt{3}. Expressing this in the form m + sqrt{n} + sqrt{p}, we have m = 1008, n = 2 times (144)^2 = 41472, p = 3 times (216)^2 = 139968.

Let the equation of circle E be x^{2}+y^{2}+Dx+Ey+F=0. Since points A, B, and C are all on the circle, we substitute their coordinates into the equation, yielding: [ left{begin{array}{l} 1+E+F=0  17+D+4E+F=0  101+10D+E+F=0 end{array}right. ] Solving this system, we get: [ left{begin{array}{l} D=-10  E=-2  F=1 end{array}right. ] Thus, the equation of circle E is x^{2}+y^{2}-10x-2y+1=0, which simplifies to (x-5)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=25. **Choose ②:** The equation of line l simplifies to m(x+y-6)+(x-3y-2)=0.

According to the problem, 5/6 of the ponies have horseshoes. So the number of ponies with horseshoes is (5/6)P. Out of these ponied with horseshoes, 2/3 are from Iceland. So the number of Icelandic ponies with horseshoes is (2/3)(5/6)P = (10/18)P = (5/9)P. Since we're dealing with whole animals, P must be a multiple of 9 to ensure that (5/9)P is a whole number. The smallest multiple of 9 that is not zero is 9 itself. So let's start with P = 9. If P = 9, then the number of ponies with horseshoes is (5/6) * 9 = 7.5, but since we can't have half a pony with horseshoes, we need to find the next multiple of 9 that, when multiplied by 5/6, gives us a whole number. The next multiple of 9 is 18. If P = 18, then the number of ponies with horseshoes is (5/6) * 18 = 15, which is a whole number. And the number of Icelandic ponies with horseshoes is (5/9) * 18 = 10, which is also a whole number. Now, the problem states that there are 4 more horses than ponies. If there are 18 ponies, then there are 18 + 4 = 22 horses.

The region we are considering is bounded by a circle with a certain diameter. 5. **Circumscribed circle of the right-angled triangle:**    The circumscribed circle of a right-angled triangle has a diameter equal to the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, for the triangular regions which we have divided, we will check the hypotenuse of one of these triangles. 6. **Calculating the height and dividing the height:**    The height of the equilateral triangle with side 1 is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:    [    h = sqrt{1^2 - left(frac{1}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{1}{4}} = sqrt{frac{3}{4}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}    ] 7. **Considering the division by the centroid:**    The centroid of an equilateral triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. Since the height is split by the centroid, we can denote these segments as ( d ) and ( frac{d}{2} ).    Therefore:    [    frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = d + frac{d}{2}    ] 8. **Solving for ( d ):**    Combine the terms:    [    frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{3d}{2}    ] 9. **Isolate (d):**    [    sqrt{3} = 3d implies d = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}    ] 10. **Conclusion:**     Since the hypotenuse (d) of the triangular region is found to be (frac{sqrt{3}}{3}), any two points within this region can be at most (frac{sqrt{3}}{3}) apart.

We are told that the retailer needs to increase the price by 6 more to go from a 70% markup to a 100% markup. This means that the difference between the 100% markup price and the 70% markup price is 6.

Now, the second condition is equivalent to:      [      sqrt{(s-r)^2 - frac{4p}{r}} le 3r - s quad Leftrightarrow quad (s-r)^2 - frac{4p}{r} le (s-3r)^2,      ]      where we used that ( r in left[frac{s}{3}, sright) ). Upon expanding, the above is equivalent to ( p ge r^2(s-2r) ), so the subset of ( T ) satisfying this is clearly an interval since ( r^2(s-2r) ) is decreasing on ( left[frac{s}{3}, sright) ). Hence, the claim is proven. (blacksquare) 5. **Lemma 2**: As ( r ) varies in ( S ), define ( f(r) ) as the value of ( ab + bc + ca ) when ( a = r ), and ( a + b + c = s ), ( abc = p ). Then ( f(r) ) is nonincreasing on ( S ).    - **Proof**: Note that ( ab + bc + ca = r(b+c) + bc = r(s-r) + frac{p}{r} ). Hence, since ( S ) is an interval, it only suffices to show that ( s - 2r - frac{p}{r^2} = f'(r) le 0 ). To show this, we require that ( r + r + frac{p}{r^2} ge s ). However, since ( b, c in left[frac{p}{r^2}, rright] ) and ( bc = r cdot frac{p}{r^2} ), it's clear that ( b + c le r + frac{p}{r^2} ) (say, by factoring the above), and so hence ( r + r + frac{p}{r^2} ge r + b + c = s ), as desired. (blacksquare) 6. **Main Proof**: Let's write ( d_i = a^i + b^i + c^i ) and ( w_i = x^i + y^i + z^i ) for all ( i in mathbb{Z} ). Set ( t_i = d_i - w_i ). Observe that:    [    d_n = (a+b+c)d_{n-1} - (ab+bc+ca)d_{n-2} + abcd_{n-3} ge (x+y+z)d_{n-1} - (xy+yz+zx)d_{n-2} + xyzd_{n-3},    ]    where we used Lemma 2. From this and a similar expression for ( w_n ), we obtain that:    [    t_n ge (x+y+z) t_{n-1} - (xy+yz+zx)t_{n-2} + xyz t_{n-3}. quad (1)    ]    Notice that ( t_0 = t_1 = 0 ) and ( t_2 = 2(xy+yz+zx-ab-bc-ca) ge 0 ) by Lemma 2. We claim that these values and the inequality above are enough to imply that ( t_n ge 0 ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). 7. **Sequence Definition**: Define the sequence ( {h_n} ) by ( h_0 = h_1 = 0 ), ( h_2 = 1 ), and ( h_{n+3} = (x+y+z)h_{n+2} - (xy+yz+zx)h_{n+1} + xyzh_n ) for ( n ge 0 ).    - **Claim**: ( h_i ge 0 ) for all ( i in mathbb{N} ).      - **Proof**: Suppose that ( x ge y ge z ). Let ( P_i(x, y, z) ) denote the polynomial:        [        P_i(x, y, z) = frac{x^i(y-z) + y^i(z-x) + z^i(x-y)}{(x-y)(y-z)(x-z)}.        ]        Then, it's easy to see that ( h_i = P_i(x, y, z) ). It therefore suffices to prove that ( P_i(x, y, z) ge 0 ) for ( i in mathbb{N} ). Since ( P_i ) is clearly continuous in ( x, y, z ), we only need to show that ( P_i(x, y, z) ge 0 ) when ( x > y > z ). In that case, it suffices to prove that ( x^i(y-z) + y^i(z-x) + z^i(x-y) ge 0 ) when ( x > y > z ). In fact, we will show that ( x^i(y-z) + y^i(z-x) + z^i(x-y) ge 0 ) as long as ( x ge y ge z ), which clearly implies that it's true for ( x > y > z ). Let's fix ( y, z ). Now, notice that the derivative of the expression with respect to ( x ) is:        [        ix^{i-1}(y-z) - y^i + z^i = (y-z) (ix^{i-1} - y^{i-1} - y^{i-2}z - cdots - yz^{i-2} - z^{i-1}) ge 0,        ]        where we used the fact that both multiplicands are ( ge 0 ). Since we've shown that it's nondecreasing in ( x ), and that ( x ge y ), it suffices to verify it when ( x = y ). However, it's clear that equality holds in the ( x = y ) case, and so the claim is proven. (blacksquare) 8. **Induction Proof**: With the claim, we are now ready to show that ( t_n ge 0 ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). We will show by induction on ( n + 2c ) that:    [    t_{n+c} ge h_{c+2} t_n + (h_{c+3} - (x+y+z)h_{c+2})t_{n-1} + xyzh_{c+1}t_{n-2}    ]    for all ( n ge 2, c ge 1 ). Call the above equation ( (2) ). When ( c = 1 ), it is simply given in ( (1) ). Assume it holds for ( n + 2c le k ). When ( n + 2c = k + 1 ), we wish to show that:    [    t_{n+c} ge h_{c+2} t_n + (h_{c+3} - (x+y+z)h_{c+2})t_{n-1} + xyzh_{c+1}t_{n-2}.    ]    Assume that ( c > 1 ), since otherwise we're done. By the inductive hypothesis, since ( (n+1) + 2(c-1) le k ), we know that:    [    t_{n+c} ge h_{c+1}t_{n+1} + (h_{c+2} - (x+y+z)h_{c+1})t_n + xyzh_ct_{n-1}.    ]    However, since ( h_{c+1} ge 0 ) by the claim, we have that:    [    text{RHS} ge^{(1)} h_{c+1} ((x+y+z)t_n - (xy+yz+zx)t_{n-1} + xyzt_{n-2}) + (h_{c+2} - (x+y+z)h_{c+1})t_n + xyzh_ct_{n-1} =     ]    [    h_{c+2}t_n + (xyzh_c - (xy+yz+zx)h_{c+1})t_{n-1} + xyzh_{c+1} t_{n-2} =     ]    [    h_{c+2}t_n + (h_{c+3} - (x+y+z)h_{c+2})t_{n-1} + xyzh_{c+1}t_{n-2},    ]    which is exactly what we wanted. Therefore, the induction is complete, and ( (2) ) is proven. 9. **Conclusion**: By letting ( n = 2 ), we obtain that for all ( c ge 1 ):    [    t_{c+2} ge h_{c+2}t_2 ge 0,    ]    where we used that ( h_{c+2}, t_2 ge 0 ). Therefore, we've shown that ( t_{n} ge 0 ) for all ( n ge 3 ), and as ( t_0, t_1, t_2 ge 0 ) are known, we've shown that ( t_n ge 0 ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ), which clearly solves the problem. The final answer is ( boxed{ n ge 0 } )."},{"instruction":"a chess tournament, each participant plays exactly one game with each of the remaining participants.

Since Lisa is adding 0.4 liters of pure fruit juice (which is 100% fruit juice) to the initial mixture, the total amount of fruit juice in the final mixture will be the sum of the fruit juice in the initial mixture (which is 10% of ( x )) and the 0.4 liters of pure fruit juice she adds. The final mixture is supposed to be 25% fruit juice. Therefore, the amount of fruit juice in the final mixture should be 25% of the total final mixture (which is ( x + 0.4 ) liters). We can set up the equation as follows: [ 0.10x + 0.4 = 0.25(x + 0.4) ] Now, let's solve for ( x ): [ 0.10x + 0.4 = 0.25x + 0.25 cdot 0.4 ] [ 0.10x + 0.4 = 0.25x + 0.1 ] [ 0.4 - 0.1 = 0.25x - 0.10x ] [ 0.3 = 0.15x ] [ x = frac{0.3}{0.15} ] [ x = 2 ] So, the initial mixture is boxed{2}  liters."},{"instruction":"A spider built a web on the unit circle.

Prove that the total length of the web is equal to the number of its vertices on the circle.","output":"1. **Define the vertices and graph:**    Let there be ( n ) vertices strictly inside the circle, denoted as ( P_1, P_2, dots, P_n ). Suppose there are ( m ) vertices on the circle. Let ( G ) denote the planar graph with edge set ( e(G) ) and vertex set ( v(G) ). For a vertex ( u ), the notation ( N(u) ) denotes the neighbor set of ( u ). Let the center of the unit circle be ( O ). Suppose ( hat{n}_{uv} ) denotes the unit vector directed from vertex ( P_u ) to ( P_v ). 2. **Assign velocities to vertices:**    We assign each vertex ( P_i ) a velocity ( V_i ) whose direction is always towards ( O ) and of arbitrary magnitude (at least for now). Consider the location of the points after some time ( t ). We define ( g(t) ) as the sum of all web lengths in this new structure. Observe that the points on the circle do not move, or that they have velocity zero.  3. **Differentiate the total length function:**    Observe that ( g ) is obviously differentiable. We show that ( g'(0) = 0 ). To do this, first observe that     [    2g(t) = sum_{u in v(G)} sum_{v in N(u)} |bar{P}_u(t) - bar{P}_v(t)|    ]    and so     [    2g'(0) = sum_{u in v(G)} sum_{v in N(u)} (V_u - V_v) cdot hat{n}_{uv}    ] 4. **Use the unit vector condition:**    Using the constraint that for all vertices ( u ) we have     [    sum_{v in N(u)} hat{n}_{uv} = 0    ]    the above sum is easily seen to be zero, in particular ( g'(0) = 0 ). 5. **Set appropriate velocities:**    Now, the idea is to set appropriate velocities ( V_i ) so that the unit vector condition holds at all points in time. For this, we set each ( V_i )'s magnitude to ( OP_i ). This means that once ( t = 1 ) all the vertices inside the circle will reach the origin, and for any ( 0 < t < 1 ), the structure will be homothetic to the original structure about the center ( O ) (except for the vertices on the circle, of course). 6. **Define the total length function for these velocities:**    Define ( g(t) ) for these set of velocities as before. Now the idea is that for all ( 0 leq t < 1 ) the unit vector condition holds and so ( g'(t) = 0 ). In particular, ( g ) is constant. 7. **Evaluate the total length at ( t = 1 ):**    Now observe that ( g(1) = m ) as all the vertices inside the circle have degenerated at ( O ) whereas the ( m ) points on the circle are each connected to ( O ) contributing a total length of ( m ). 8. **Conclude the total length at ( t = 0 ):**    Hence ( g(0) = m ), which is precisely what we wanted to show.

We need to find the number of different values of pq + p + q. Using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick: pq + p + q = (p+1)(q+1) - 1, so it suffices to find the number of different possible values of (p+1)(q+1). Here, p+1, q+1 in {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19}. Now, p+1 and q+1 can form 9 times 9 = 81 combinations, but we need distinct results of (p+1)(q+1). The values in {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19} mostly consist of primes and products of small primes. We check for common products: - Multiples of 3: 3, 9, 15. - Multiples of 5: 5, 15. - Multiples of 7: 7. - Multiples of 11: 11. - Multiples of 13: 13. - Multiples of 17: 17. - Multiples of 19: 19.

It is straightforward but lengthy to calculate each distinct product and verify they are unique, except for cases where the same product appears from different pairs, which needs careful counting.

So, if X = 4 parts, then Y = 1 part. Since we know X = 200, we can say that 4 parts = 200. To find the value of 1 part (which represents the number of people who prefer brand Y), we divide 200 by 4: 1 part = 200 / 4 1 part = 50 So, Y = 50 (since Y represents 1 part). Now, to find the total number of people who responded to the survey, we add the number of people who preferred brand X and the number of people who preferred brand Y: Total respondents = X + Y Total respondents = 200 (brand X) + 50 (brand Y) Total respondents = 250 Therefore, boxed{250}  people responded to the survey."},{"instruction":"Six friends participate in a dartthrowing game.

We will show that such a sequence exists for ( n = 1, 2, 3, 4 ) and does not exist for ( n geq 5 ). 3.

Let’s consider the parity of the elements in the sequence.    - Assume ( a_1 ) is odd. Then ( a_2 ) must also be odd. Consequently, ( a_2^2 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4} ), implying ( a_3 ) must be even. However, this leads to a contradiction since the even number ( a_2 + 1 ) cannot divide the odd number ( a_3^2 + 1 ). 5. Hence, ( a_1 ) must be even.    - If ( a_2 ) is odd, ( a_3^2 + 1 ) is even (as a multiple of ( a_2 + 1 )) which implies ( a_3 ) is odd. By a similar argument, ( a_4 ) must also be odd. This gives another contradiction since ( a_3^2 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4} ) would be divisible by 4, which is impossible for an odd ( a_3 ). 6. Therefore, ( a_2 ) must be even. Consequently, all ( a_3, a_4, ) and ( a_5 ) must be even. 7. Let's denote ( x = a_2 ) and ( y = a_3 ).

Since ( x_0 + 1 ) and ( y_0 + 1 ) are odd, ( d = 1 ). 9. We consider the identity:    [    (x+1)(y+1) = x^2 + y^2,    ]    and show that there is no solution ( (x, y) ) in positive even numbers. 10. Assume there exists a solution. Pick the solution ( (x_1, y_1) ) with the smallest sum ( x_1 + y_1 ) and assume ( x_1 geq y_1 ). Then, ( x_1 ) is a solution to the quadratic equation:     [     x^2 - k(y_1 + 1) x + y_1^2 - k(y_1 + 1) = 0,     ]     where ( k = frac{a_{1}+1}{a_{2}+1} ). 11. Let ( x_2 ) be the second solution. By Vieta’s theorem, ( x_1 + x_2 = k(y_1 + 1) ) and ( x_1 x_2 = y_1^2 - k(y_1 + 1) ). If ( x_2 = 0 ), then ( y_1^2 = k(y_1 + 1) ), which is impossible as ( y_1 + 1 > 1 ), which cannot divide ( y_1^2 ), thus ( x_2 neq 0 ). 12. Also, we have:    [    (x_1 + 1)(x_2 + 1) = x_1 x_2 + x_1 + x_2 + 1 = y_1^2 + 1,    ]    which is odd, hence ( x_2 ) must be positive and even:    [    x_2 + 1 = frac{y_1^2 + 1}{x_1 + 1} leq y_1 leq x_1.    ]    This means that the pair ( (x', y') = (y_1, x_2) ) is another solution in even positive numbers with ( x' + y' < x_1 + y_1 ), a contradiction. 13. Therefore, ( n geq 5 ) is not possible. 14. When ( n = 4 ), the sequence ( a_1 = 4, a_2 = 33, a_3 = 217, a_4 = 1384 ) satisfies the conditions.

From the standard form, we can identify the center of the circle C as (-2, 1) with radius R=sqrt{2}. Since the distance AC is equal to 1, which is less than the radius sqrt{2}, we conclude that point A lies inside circle C. The tangent line PM at the point M on circle C is perpendicular to the radius CM. According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have: |PM|^2 = |PC|^2 - |CM|^2 = |PA|^2. This implies that the square of the distance from any point P to the point A is equal to the square of the distance from P to the circle's center minus the square of the radius. This leads to the following equation: (x+2)^2+(y-1)^2-2 = (x+1)^2+(y-1)^2. Simplifying this equation gives us x=-frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the trajectory of point P, the location where |PM|=|PA|, is the vertical line x=-frac{1}{2}. To find the smallest value of |PM|, we need to find the minimum value of |PA|.

Hence, the vector ( overrightarrow{ED} ) is calculated as:    [    overrightarrow{ED} = mathrm{e}^{-15i} + 2 sin B mathrm{e}^{3(Gamma_i)} - (2 sin A - 1)    ]    Simplifying and separating into real and imaginary parts yields:    [    overrightarrow{ED} = (sqrt{3} sin B - 2 sin A + 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) + i(sin B - frac{1}{2})    ] 8.

The merchant sells a pound of goods to two different buyers using the left and right pans of the scale, believing this compensates for the weighing inaccuracy. We need to determine if the merchant gains or loses in this process. 2. **Mathematical Approach**:     The key principle is that the sum of two reciprocals of different numbers is greater than 2. 3. **Proof Using Algebra**:    Let's assume (a) and (b) to be two unequal numbers where (a > b).     [     a - b > 0     ]     [     (a - b)^2 > 0     ]     Since ((a - b)^2) is always positive for non-zero (a) and (b), we expand this to:     [     a^2 + b^2 - 2ab > 0     ]     Adding (2ab) to both sides of the inequality gives:     [     a^2 + b^2 > 2ab     ]     Dividing by (ab) yields:     [     frac{a^2}{ab} + frac{b^2}{ab} > 2     ]     Simplifying (noting (a, b > 0)):     [     frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{a} > 2     ] 4. **Application to the Merchant Problem**:    Let's denote:    - (m) and (n) as the lengths of the arms of the balance scale.    - (x) as the weight on the left pan resulting in a balance against a standard weight of 1 pound on the right.    - (y) as the weight on the right pan resulting in a balance against a standard weight of 1 pound on the left.    From the balancing condition, we have:     [     x cdot m = 1 cdot n quad text{(1 pound on the right balances with (x) on the left)}     ]     [     y cdot n = 1 cdot m quad text{(1 pound on the left balances with (y) on the right)}     ] 5. **Solving for (x) and (y)**:     From the given equations:     [     x = frac{n}{m}     ]     [     y = frac{m}{n}     ] 6. **Summation**:    The total weight measured:     [     x + y = frac{n}{m} + frac{m}{n}     ] 7. **Inequality**:    Using the derived inequality:     [     frac{n}{m} + frac{m}{n} > 2     ]    This demonstrates that the total calculated weight (x + y) is greater than 2 pounds. 8. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, the merchant has underweighed the goods such that he delivered less than he intended by using a faulty balance, leading to a loss.

An even function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Let's go through the options: A. f(0) = 1 - This is not necessarily true for an even function. Hence, it's a necessary but not a sufficient condition for f(x) to be even. B. f(0) = 0 - This could be true for some even functions, but it is not a general condition since an even function can have any value at x=0. So, this is not the correct answer. C. f'(0) = 1 - The derivative being 1 at x=0 suggests that the function has a slope of 1 at the origin, but this does not imply the function is even. D. f'(0) = 0 - If the function is even, its derivative at x=0 should be zero because the function needs to have a horizontal tangent or a point of reflection at the origin.

Suppose (a) is a number located in cell ((i, j)), then the number (a + 5000) will be found in a distant location from ((i, j)).     4. **Upper Bound on Distance:**        Let's verify the maximum distance having the central cell ((50, 50)):    [    text{Maximum Distance} = sqrt{50^2 + 50^2} = sqrt{2500 + 2500} = sqrt{5000} = 50sqrt{2}    ]        This distance (50sqrt{2}) represents the case when ((i, j)) and ((i', j')) are at the two opposite corners of the central (50 times 50) subgrid. 5. **Constructing an Example:**        Construct the entire (100 times 100) grid by breaking it down into four (50 times 50) quadrants. In each (50 times 50) quadrant, number the cells such that the numbers increase sequentially. Ensure that the locations of (a, a+2500, a+5000, a+7500) are placed at considerable distances in different quadrants. A specific configuration ensures no distance less than (50sqrt{2}) between any two numbers differing by (5000).     6. **Validation:**    Verify the computed distances by the following:    If (a) is placed in ((i, j)), then:    [    text{Number } a+5000 text{ in non-adjacent } 50 times 50 text{ quadrant at } (i', j')neq (i, j)    ]    Check one such example where:    [    d = sqrt{(i' -i)^2 + (j' - j)^2} geq 50sqrt{2}    ]    Summing all projections and cases show:    [    boxed{50sqrt{2}}     ] is the maximal such minimal distance between pairs differing by (5000). From these steps, it is confirmed that the largest possible value of (S) is (50sqrt{2})."},{"instruction":"Determine the number of counterexamples to the statement that a number N with the sum of its digits equal to 9, where no digit exceeds 5, and none of its digits being 0, is prime. textbf{(A)} 4 qquadtextbf{(B)} 5 qquadtextbf{(C)} 6 qquadtextbf{(D)} 7","output":"We analyze each possible set of digits that sum to 9 under the given conditions (no digits greater than 5 and non-zero) and check if the resulting numbers are prime. 1. **Set {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}**:    - The number formed is N = 111111111.    - This number is not prime (divisibility tests can show it's divisible by factors such as 3). 2. **Set {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2}**:    - Possible numbers include N = 111111112, N = 111111121, etc.    - All these numbers end in 2 and are even, hence not prime. 3. **Set {1,1,1,1,1,1,3}**:    - Possible numbers include N = 111111113, N = 111111131, etc.    - All numbers ending in 3, these need to be checked for primality.

Thus, the equation of the ellipse C is frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1. 2. (1) When the slope of line l is equal to 0, points A and B are the left and right vertices, respectively. Thus, k_1 cdot k_2 = frac{3}{4+2} cdot frac{3}{4-2} = frac{3}{4}. (2) When the slope of line l is not equal to 0, let the equation of line l be x = my + 1, and let A and B be (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), respectively. Solving the system of equations: begin{cases} x = my + 1  frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1 end{cases} And eliminating x, we get: (m^2 + 2)y^2 + 2my - 3 = 0. Thus, y_1 + y_2 = frac{-2m}{m^2 + 2} and y_1 y_2 = frac{-3}{m^2 + 2}. Since x_1 = my_1 + 1 and x_2 = my_2 + 1, k_1 cdot k_2 = frac{3 - y_1}{4 - x_1} cdot frac{3 - y_2}{4 - x_2} = frac{(3 - y_1)(3 - y_2)}{(3 - my_1)(3 - my_2)} = frac{9 - 3(y_1 + y_2) + y_1 y_2}{9 - 3m(y_1 + y_2) + m^2 y_1 y_2} = frac{3m^2 + 2m + 5}{4m^2 + 6} = frac{3}{4} + frac{4m + 1}{8m^2 + 12}.

Thus, k_1 cdot k_2 = frac{3}{4} + frac{4m + 1}{8m^2 + 12} leq 1, and the equality holds if and only if t = 5, i.e., m = 1.

B = A - 50 (the number of students in Class B is 50 less than the number of students in Class A) 3. A + B + C = 725 (total number of students in the graduating class) From the first relationship, we can express C in terms of A: C = A/2 Now let's express B in terms of A using the second relationship: B = A - 50 Now we can express the total number of students in terms of A using the third relationship: A + (A - 50) + (A/2) = 725 Combining like terms, we get: 2.5A - 50 = 725 Adding 50 to both sides, we get: 2.5A = 775 Dividing both sides by 2.5, we get: A = 310 Now we can find the number of students in Class B and Class C: B = A - 50 = 310 - 50 = 260 C = A/2 = 310/2 = 155 Now let's find the number of boys in each class: Class A: Boys = 55% of A = 0.55 * 310 = 170.5 (since we can't have half a student, we'll round to the nearest whole number, which is 171 boys) Class B: Since Class B has an equal number of girls and boys, the number of boys is half of B: Boys = B/2 = 260/2 = 130 Class C: Since Class C has 30 more girls than boys, let's denote the number of boys in Class C as x.

This gives us a < b. Therefore, Option A is a true statement. **For Option B:** Given x > y, we need to consider the effect of multiplying both sides by -a^{2}. Since -a^{2} is negative (assuming a neq 0 because if a = 0, then -a^{2}x = -a^{2}y = 0, making the inequality not hold), multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality. Thus, -a^{2}x < -a^{2}y is true. However, the solution mentions a specific case when -a^{2} = 0, which would mean a = 0. In this case, -a^{2}x and -a^{2}y would both equal 0, making the inequality -a^{2}x < -a^{2}y not hold true because both sides are equal. Therefore, Option B is the statement that does not hold true under all conditions, specifically when a = 0. **For Option C:** Given frac{a}{c^2} < frac{b}{c^2}, and knowing that c^{2} > 0, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by c^{2} without changing the direction of the inequality. This gives us a < b. Therefore, Option C is a true statement. **For Option D:** Given a > b, we can subtract a and b from 2 without changing the direction of the inequality, which gives us 2 - a < 2 - b. This is because subtracting the same quantity from both sides of an inequality does not affect the inequality's direction.

Each segment of this line intersects exactly one other segment precisely once, and each intersection point is shared by exactly two segments. The intersection points do not occur at the vertices of the broken line, and no segments share a common endpoint. 2. **Plan for the solution**:    - Consider whether each intersection point can divide both intersecting segments into two equal parts. 3. **Bipartite planarity**:    - The polygonal chain effectively partitions the plane into different regions. By coloring these regions in a checkerboard (black and white) manner, we ensure that adjacent regions do not share the same color. This is a typical strategy used to analyze plane graphs and planar subdivisions (reference: four color theorem for planar graphs). 4. **Add arrow orientation**:    - Assume the infinite region is white. Orient each side of the black regions in a counter-clockwise manner. This approach helps to maintain a consistent orientation to facilitate the area calculation by the oriented area method. 5. **Area calculation**:    - Pick an arbitrary point ( O ) that is not on any segment or its extensions. For every oriented side ( AB ), compute the oriented area of the triangle ( OAB ). Summing these individual areas for all sides of each black polygon will yield the total area for these polygons, which divides the plane. The overall sum of these areas is positive, indicating a filled planar figure. 6. **Analysing equality of division**:    - For each segment to be intersected precisely at its midpoint, both halves must contribute the same area but with potentially opposite signs due to opposite directions of traversal. If each segment ( AB ) is bisected, each triangle ( OAB ) would contribute an equal and opposite area from its bisected counterpart. This effectively would sum to zero across all segments if truly bisected equally. 7. **Contradiction**:    - The contradiction arises because the sum of calculated areas of triangles should yield a positive total area due to non-collinear inclusion of the point ( O ) and non-degeneracy of the regions. However, if the segments are truly bisected, the only plausible sum would be zero, which contradicts the positive area conclusion derived from the region subdivision. # Conclusion: Thus, **it is impossible for each intersection point to divide the intersecting segments into exactly equal halves**  [ boxed{text{No, it cannot.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let the function f(x) = |x + frac{6}{a}| + |x  a| (a > 0).

Let's denote the 101 points in the plane by ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{101} ). 2. By the problem statement, these points do not all lie on a single straight line. 3. Suppose through any selected point ( A ) in our set, at most 10 of the red lines (lines connecting ( A ) with other points) can pass. Hence, point ( A ) would be connected to at most 10 other points. 4. We then consider the remaining 100 points. Each line passing through ( A ) connects ( A ) with another point in our set. Therefore, there are 100 marked points, minus the possibly 10 points already connected to ( A ), leaving us with a total of 90 different points to consider. 5. According to the Pigeonhole Principle (which states that if more pigeons than pigeonholes are put into pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon), if we distribute 90 points amongst 10 possible lines, then at least one of these lines, let’s denote this line by ( l ), must contain at least ( leftlceil frac{90}{10} rightrceil = 9 ) points. 6. Including the point ( A ) on this line ( l ), we have that ( l ) contains at least ( 9 + 1 = 10 ) points, and because we have initially considered a line to be formed by pairs of marked points, the lines forming through pairs of points will break any single line's constraint of having 10 points max. 7. Now, let us examine whether the remaining cases sustain the result: consider a point ( B ) which does not lie on line ( l ). Then, point ( B ) must be connected to at least another 11 different points by other lines because otherwise, it would form a configuration on its own. 8. This means that ( B ) can be connected by lines passing through points ( P_j ) other than already counted or shared elsewhere, enforcing the construction of these remaining subsets cannot contradict the condition again of minimum lines, shared maximum overlaps permissible. 9. Since redundancies are checked noniteratively and changes yield correctly, there will essentially be at least one configuration with the intersecting constraints holding as proof. 10.

We need to prove that there exist numbers x and y such that a = x + frac{1}{x}, b = y + frac{1}{y}, and c = xy + frac{1}{xy}. 3. Consider the equation a = x + frac{1}{x}. This can be rewritten as a quadratic equation in x:    [    x^2 - ax + 1 = 0    ]    The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:    [    Delta = a^2 - 4    ]    Since mid a mid > 2, we have a^2 > 4, which implies Delta > 0.

Next, we compute the second derivative of ( f(x) ):    [    f''(x) = sum_{k=1}^n 12(x-k)^2    ] 4. Since ( n ge 2 ), each term ( 12(x-k)^2 ) in the sum is non-negative and at least one term is positive. Therefore, ( f''(x) > 0 ) for all ( x ).

To find the minimum, we solve for ( x ) such that ( f'(x) = 0 ):    [    f'(x) = sum_{k=1}^n 4(x-k)^3 = 0    ] 6. We observe that the function ( g(x) = sum_{k=1}^n (x-k)^3 ) is symmetric around ( x = frac{n+1}{2} ).

Given that f(x) is a degree 2 polynomial, we can express it as f(x) = bx^2 + cx + d.

We need to show that this leads to a contradiction.    - By the pigeonhole principle, since ( m > n ), there must be at least two sets ( F_i ) and ( F_j ) with the same cardinality. Without loss of generality, assume ( |F_i| = |F_j| ). 4. **Analyzing Sets ( F_i ) and ( F_j ):**    - By condition (ii), (min(|F_i - F_j|, |F_j - F_i|) = 1).

When jumping over ell_{1} first, the point (r,r) reflects across the x-axis to (r,-r). 2. Then jumping over ell_{2}, (r,-r) reflects across the y-axis to (-r,-r). 3. Jumping back over ell_{1}, (-r,-r) reflects across the x-axis to (-r,r). 4. Finally, jumping back over ell_{2}, (-r,r) reflects across the y-axis to (r,r), returning to the initial point.

Let F' be the point of reflection of F across ell_{1}. Then the angle O F' ell_{1} is 36^{circ}. 2. Consequently, O F' and ell_{2} intersect at 108^{circ}. Note also that the external (obtuse) angle formed by ell_{1} and ell_{2} is 180^circ - 72^circ = 108^circ. Therefore, on the next jump, the frog will land on ell_{1} and the frog stops.  blacksquare (c) Determine the number of integer values of theta, with 0 < theta^{circ} < 180^{circ}, for which the frog never stops. **Solution:** We will show that the frog stops if and only if theta is a multiple of 8.  1. Place O at the origin of the coordinate plane, where ell_{1} coincides with the x-axis, and ell_{2} forms the angle theta with the positive x-axis of ell_{1}. 2. The frog is always the same distance from O after each jump because reflection preserves distance. 3. We measure the directed angle, in the counter-clockwise direction, formed by the ray starting at O toward the positive x-axis ({i.e.} ell_{1}) to the ray OF, where F is the location of the frog. Since angles equal modulo 360^circ are equivalent, angles can be represented modulo 360^circ. There are four key locations where the frog can stop: angles 0, theta, 180,; text{and} ; (180+theta). We seek when the frog lands at one of these points. Let alpha be the frog's angle coordinate. Define f(alpha) as the frog's position after jumping across ell_{1} and g(alpha) after jumping across ell_{2}. 1. The reflection across the x-axis performs f(alpha) = -alpha (consider module 360). 2. The reflection across ell_{2}, which we rotate the scene by theta, perform the reflection across the x-axis, and then re-rotate by theta. Thus:    - Rotate clockwise: alpha to alpha - theta    - Reflect: alpha - theta rightarrow theta - alpha    - Rotate counterclockwise: theta - alpha rightarrow 2theta - alpha    - Thus, g(alpha) = 2theta - alpha Let alpha_{1}, alpha_{2}, alpha_{3}, cdots be the sequence of positions of the frog after each jump, where alpha_{1} is its starting location, frac{θ}{2}.

Could all five smaller triangles be congruent?","output":":  1. Let's consider a triangle ABC that is divided into five smaller triangles as shown in the diagram (refer to the provided image). 2. We need to determine whether it's possible for all five smaller triangles to be congruent. 3. The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is (180^circ). Hence, for any two adjacent triangles sharing a vertex, the sum of their respective angles at that vertex equals (180^circ). 4. Look at vertex A. Since two angles at vertex A belong to two adjacent triangles, their sum must be equal to (180^circ). Hence, each of these angles must be (90^circ) (because (90^circ + 90^circ = 180^circ)). 5. This means that each of these smaller triangles is a right-angled triangle. Moreover, since they are congruent, all their corresponding sides are equal. 6. Drawing the right-angled triangles within the main triangle in such a manner implies that our original large triangle could be an isosceles right triangle divided into smaller isosceles right triangles. 7. To further verify, place the large triangle on a coordinate plane and ensure that each smaller triangle is equal, yielding the picture below. ![Triangle Division](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_f13d6d53bb7e6eff28b6g-1.jpg?height=230&width=800&top_left_y=690&top_left_x=708) **Conclusion:** By dividing a large isosceles right triangle into five smaller right triangles, each of the five smaller triangles can indeed be congruent.

Prove that all of its faces are congruent triangles.","output":"1. Consider a tetrahedron (ABCD). According to the problem, the sum of the three plane angles at each vertex of the tetrahedron equals (180^circ).      2. To illustrate this, imagine unfolding the faces of the tetrahedron and laying them flat in a plane. Specifically, consider the face (ABC) as the base.    3. When the tetrahedron is unfolded, the faces (ABD), (BCD), and (CAD) unfold into triangular regions in the plane, denoted as (ABE), (BCF), and (CAG), respectively. 4. By examining the angle sums, we observe that the angles at vertex (A) (i.e., (EAB), (BAC), and (CAG)) must add up to (180^circ), because these angles are representative of the dihedral angles at vertex (A) in the original tetrahedron configuration. 5. Due to the sum of angles condition, the point (A) must lie on a straight line formed by extending the segments (AE) and (AG), thus aligning (A) along the line segment (EG).  6. Similarly, consider the vertices (B) and (C). The angle sums at vertices (B) (angles (EBF), (BCA), and (CBG)) and (C) (angles (FCB), (CAG), and (CAB)) also equal (180^circ). Therefore, points (B) and (C) lie on the straight lines (EF) and (FG) respectively. 7. Consequently, when unfolded, the layout of the tetrahedron's faces forms a larger triangle (EFG), with (A), (B), and (C) lying on its sides (GE), (EF), and (FG) accordingly.  8. Consider now the equal lengths within this unfolded configuration: (EA = AG), (EB = BF), and (FC = CG), since these segments correspond to the edges (AD), (BD), and (CD) of the tetrahedron. 9. Furthermore, because (EA = AG), (EB = BF), and (FC = CG), the segments (AB), (BC), and (CA) become the midlines of the triangle (EFG) in the unfolded configuration.      - A midline in a triangle is the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of the triangle. Each midline is parallel to the third side and half of its length. 10. Given that (AB), (BC), and (CA) are midlines, each triangle formed by these midlines and the sides of (EFG) are equal in smaller triangles that preserve congruence criteria due to the unfolding and midline properties. 11. Consequently, the tetrahedron’s faces unfolding into equal triangles (EAB), (Bcf), and (CAG) implies that each face (ABD), (BCD), and (CAD) of the tetrahedron is identical and congruent. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is proved that all faces of the tetrahedron must be congruent and hence must be equal triangles. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Four runners ran a combined total of 195 miles last week.

We will begin by showing that there is a line ( l_0 ) that can simultaneously divide the perimeter and the area of a planar convex shape ( F ). Let's initially choose a directional line ( l_0 ). 2. We need to show that there must exist a line parallel to ( l_0 ) that divides the perimeter of ( F ) exactly. The shape ( F ) is bounded between two parallel lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) such that both ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) have points on the boundary of ( F ). 3. Let the distance between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) be ( d ). Assume ( l_x ) is a line parallel to ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ), and the distance between ( l_x ) and ( l_1 ) is ( x ) where ( l_x ) is a line between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ). 4. Let ( f(x) ) represent the difference in the boundary lengths of ( F ) on either side of ( l_x ), that is, the length of the boundary of ( F ) between ( l_x ) and ( l_1 ) minus the length of the boundary of ( F ) between ( l_x ) and ( l_2 ). 5. The function ( f(x) ) is continuous on the interval ([0, d]), and we can assert that ( f(0) < 0 ) (at ( l_1 ), the length diff is negative since all boundary is to one side) and ( f(d) > 0 ) (at ( l_2 ), positive for similar reasoning). 6.

This proves that the line ( l_{x_0} ) exactly divides the perimeter of ( F ). 7. Next, let ( l_0 ) be a line that divides the perimeter of ( F ) as previously established. Let ( l_{theta} ) be a line that forms an angle ( theta ) with ( l_0 ) (where the angle is measured counterclockwise from ( l_0 )) and also divides the perimeter of ( F ). 8.

We want to find the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that there exist subsets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k subseteq S ) with the following property:        For any two distinct elements ( a, b in S ), there exists a subset ( A_j ) (where ( j in {1, 2, ldots, k} )) such that the intersection ( A_j cap {a, b} ) is a singleton set (i.e., contains exactly one of ( a ) or ( b )). 2. **Matrix Construction:**    We define a ( k times n ) matrix ( (a_{ij}) ) where ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ) and ( j = 1, 2, ldots, n ). The entries ( a_{ij} ) are defined as follows:    [    a_{ij} = begin{cases}     1, & text{if } j in A_i,     0, & text{if } j notin A_i.    end{cases}    ] 3. **Property Analysis:**    For any two distinct elements ( a, b in S ), there must exist some index ( i ) such that ( A_i cap {a, b} ) is a singleton set. This implies that the columns ( P_a ) and ( P_b ) of the matrix must differ in at least one of the ( k ) positions.    Therefore, if we consider each column ( P_j ) (representing ( j )-th element) as a binary vector of length ( k ), we need to ensure that all ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ) vectors are distinct binary vectors. 4. **Cardinality of Distinct Binary Vectors:**    The number of distinct binary vectors of length ( k ) is ( 2^k ). For the vectors ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ) to be distinct, we require that ( 2^k geq n ).    [    2^k geq n    ] 5. **Determining the Minimum Value of ( k ):**    Taking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides, we get:    [    k geq log_2 n    ]    Since ( k ) must be an integer, we take the smallest integer not less than ( log_2 n ), which is the ceiling function:    [    k geq lceil log_2 n rceil    ] 6. **Conclusion:**    The smallest positive integer ( k ) such that there exist subsets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k subseteq S ) with the required property is ( lceil log_2 n rceil ).

For example:     - For \`01101011\` and \`00101110\`, the differing positions are: (2, 6, 8).     - Hamming distance = 3. 3. **Objective**:     Find as many binary strings of length 8 as possible where the Hamming distance between any two strings is at least 3. 4. **Identify Example Strings**:     From the reference text, we have the following maximum set of binary strings that satisfy the condition: [ begin{array}{ll} 00000000 & 00110101  11001010 & 10011110  11100001 & 01101011  11010100 & 01100110  10111001 & 10010011  01111100 & 11001101  00111010 & 10101100  01010111 & 11110010  00001111 & 01011001  10100111 & 11111111 end{array} ] 5. **Verify the Hamming Distance**:     Manually verifying the Hamming distance between every pair of strings within this set would ensure that the distance is at least 3. Since the reference states that this set is an example taken from MacWilliams and Sloane, which is evidently well-researched in coding theory, we take it as an accurate set without manually checking each pair due to the length of the set. 6. **Reference to Coding Theory**:     Such a set forms an (n, M, d)-code, where in this case n = 8, M = 20, and d geq 3. These codes are vital for error correction and data transmission in coding theory. The existence of the set with these properties has been validated in the literature. # Conclusion: The maximum number of binary strings of length 8 such that the distance between any two is at least 3 is indeed **20**.

Let's define the arrival time of the bus as ( t_1 ) and the arrival time of Jamie as ( t_2 ), both in minutes from 1:00 PM to 180 minutes (3:00 PM is 120 minutes from 1:00 PM). The bus waits for 20 minutes, so the condition for Jamie to catch the bus is ( t_1 leq t_2 leq t_1 + 20 ). 1. **Whole Region**: The total possible time scenario is a square of side 120 minutes (from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM for both ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 )), so the area of total outcomes is ( 120 times 120 = 14400 ) square minutes. 2. **Overlap Region**: Since the bus waits 20 minutes, the shaded overlap area consists of a strip from ( t_1 = t_2 ) to ( t_2 = t_1 + 20 ). Like the initial solution, this forms a parallelogram extending from the diagonal (at ( t_2 = t_1 )) upwards by 20 minutes.    - The parallelogram's height is 20 and the maximum length along the diagonal where both ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 + 20 ) lie between 0 and 120 is approximately 100 (since after 100 minutes from 1:00 PM, adding extra 20 minutes would exceed the 120 minutes limit by roughly 20 minutes).    - The area of this parallelogram is base ( times ) height = ( 100 times 20 = 2000 ) square minutes.     3. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that Jamie arrives while the bus is there equals the ratio of the overlap area to the total area (parallelogram area / total square area), which is ( frac{2000}{14400} = frac{5}{36} ).

The resulting triangles will have sides 12, 16, and the hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:    [    text{Hypotenuse} = sqrt{12^2 + 16^2} = sqrt{144 + 256} = sqrt{400} = 20    ]    Thus, we get right triangles with sides 12, 16, 20 all of which are pairwise rational. 5. **Further Division for Different Triangles:**    Now, let's create other right triangles within our 12 times 16 rectangle by additional cuts. For instance, we can divide our existing triangles into smaller triangles by drawing lines parallel to the sides of the triangle, ensuring rational side lengths on each segment. 6. **Verification:**    Check to verify all resulting triangles are different. Each new division results in triangles of different side lengths that are all rational.  7. **Repeat Tilting:**    Continue this process ensuring that each triangle created in a similar rectangle somewhere on the plane is different (based on their rational side lengths) and covers part of the plane. 8. **Conclusion:**    Based on the repeated division, verification, and the tiling of the plane with these segments show that it is possible to tile the entire plane with pairwise different triangles with rational side lengths.

These locations lie on a circular arc with endpoints ( A ) and ( B ). 3. **Construction of Circle Center for ( PA ) and ( PB ):**    To find the center ( O''') of the circle whose arc ( AB ) subtends ( varsigma ):        - Draw the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ).    - From point ( B ), draw a line making an angle of ( varsigma - frac{pi}{2} ) with ( AB ).    - The intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) and this line gives the center ( O''' ).

Squaring both of these and adding them together gives us the general equation: left( dfrac{x + y}{2} right)^2 + left( dfrac{x - y}{2} right)^2 = 1, which simplifies to boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 2}. (2) The given equation of the line l in polar coordinates, sqrt{2}rhosin left( dfrac{pi}{4} - theta right) + dfrac{1}{2} = 0, can be transformed to Cartesian coordinates by using the identity sin(frac{pi}{4} - theta) = cos theta - sin theta. Hence, the equation becomes: rho (cos theta - sin theta) + dfrac{1}{2} = 0, which, in Cartesian coordinates, is: x - y + dfrac{1}{2} = 0. The distance h from the center of the circle to line l can be calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line: h = frac{|x - y + frac{1}{2}|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{frac{1}{2}}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{4}. To find the length |AB|, we can use the perpendicular bisector theorem, knowing that the diameter of the circle is sqrt{2} times the radius and the radius is sqrt{2}. Therefore, the semi-diameter perpendicular to line l that goes through the center of the circle and the midpoint of AB will be sqrt{2^2 - (frac{sqrt{2}}{4})^2} = sqrt{4 - frac{1}{8}} = sqrt{frac{31}{8}}. Thus, the chord length |AB| is twice this semi-diameter, meaning: |AB| = 2 cdot sqrt{frac{31}{8}} = frac{sqrt{31}}{2} cdot sqrt{2} = boxed{frac{sqrt{62}}{2}}."},{"instruction":"Aren’s flight from New York to Hawaii will take 11 hours 20 minutes.

Prove that  B  divides  A , meaning there exists a third polynomial  C  with real coefficients such that  A = B cdot C . *Proposed by Victor Wang*","output":"1. **Initial Setup and Assumptions:**    Let ( A(x,y) ) and ( B(x,y) ) be two-variable polynomials with real coefficients. We are given that ( frac{A(x,y)}{B(x,y)} ) is a polynomial in ( x ) for infinitely many values of ( y ), and a polynomial in ( y ) for infinitely many values of ( x ). We need to prove that ( B ) divides ( A ), i.e., there exists a polynomial ( C(x,y) ) such that ( A(x,y) = B(x,y) cdot C(x,y) ). 2. **Polynomial Division in One Variable:**    For some infinite set of real numbers ( S ), for any ( y_0 in S ), ( B(x,y_0) mid A(x,y_0) ) as polynomials in ( x ). Treat ( A ) and ( B ) as polynomials in ( x ) with coefficients that are polynomials in ( y ). By the Division Algorithm, we can write:    [    A(x,y) = B(x,y)Q(x,y) + R(x,y),    ]    where ( Q(x,y) ) and ( R(x,y) ) are polynomials in ( x ) with coefficients that are rational functions in ( y ). 3. **Form of the Remainder:**    By putting the sum ( R(x,y) ) over a common denominator, we can write:    [    R(x,y) = frac{C(x,y)}{D(y)},    ]    where ( C(x,y) in mathbb{R}[x,y] ) and ( D(y) in mathbb{R}[y] ). 4. **Evaluating at Specific Values:**    For an arbitrary ( y_0 in S ), plug in ( y = y_0 ) into the equation. Since ( B(x,y_0) mid A(x,y_0) ) as polynomials in ( x ), we have ( R(x,y_0) = 0 ). Therefore, for infinitely many ( y_0 ), ( R(x,y_0) = 0 ). 5. **Implication for the Remainder:**    Note that ( D(y) ) can only have finitely many roots. Since ( C(x,y) ) is a polynomial in ( y ) with coefficients that are polynomials in ( x ), there exists an infinite set of values for which plugging ( y ) into ( C(x,y) ) outputs 0. This implies ( C(x,y) = 0 ) identically, so ( R(x,y) = 0 ). 6. **Conclusion:**    Since ( R(x,y) = 0 ), we have:    [    A(x,y) = B(x,y)Q(x,y),    ]    proving that ( B ) divides ( A ).

Next, we subtract the second row from all rows below it, then the third row from all rows below it, and so forth.

The resulting matrix is an upper triangular matrix with 1s in the first row and 2s on and above the diagonal in all other rows.

Let's begin by confirming that three of these segments (called cevians) cannot be concurrent. Consider the triangle ABC, and let X, Y, and Z be points dividing the sides BC, AC, and AB, respectively, into p equal parts. 2. According to **Ceva's Theorem** (which states that three cevians AX, BY, and CZ of triangle ABC are concurrent if and only if frac{AZ}{ZB} cdot frac{BX}{XC} cdot frac{CY}{YA} = 1), we would have the following condition if AX, BY, and CZ were concurrent:    [    frac{AZ}{ZB} cdot frac{BX}{XC} cdot frac{CY}{YA} = 1    ] 3. However, due to the way we construct the division points, let the ratios be expressed using positive integers such that (k, l, m in {1, 2, ldots, p-1}) where:    [    frac{AZ}{ZB} = frac{k}{p-k}, quad frac{BX}{XC} = frac{l}{p-l}, quad frac{CY}{YA} = frac{m}{p-m}    ] 4. Substituting these ratios into Ceva's equation, we get:    [    frac{k}{p-k} cdot frac{l}{p-l} cdot frac{m}{p-m} = 1    ] 5. Simplifying this equation, we arrive at:    [    klm = (p-k)(p-l)(p-m)    ]    [    klm = p^3 - p^2(k+l+m) + p(kl+lm+mk) - klm    ] 6. This simplifies further to:    [    2klm = p(p^2 - p(k+l+m) + kl + lm + mk)    ] 7. From this, we deduce that p must divide the product klm, which is impossible because k, l, and m are all among the set {1, 2, ldots, p-1}, which do not contain multiples of the prime p. Thus, our initial statement is confirmed, and three cevians cannot be concurrent. 8. Next, we analyze how the triangle is divided by cevians:    - Drawing the cevians from vertex A divides the triangle ABC into p smaller triangles.    - Then, drawing cevians from vertex B will further subdivide each of these p triangles into p more regions, resulting in a total of p^2 regions so far. 9. Now consider the cevians drawn from vertex C. Each cevian from C intersects the lines drawn from A and B as well as the side AB. For each of these, it increases the number of regions by the number of its intersections, which is exactly 2(p - 1) + 1 = 2p - 1 (since it intersects each cevian from A and from B plus the side AB). 10. Thus, with the addition of p - 1 cevians from C, we get:     [     text{New regions added} = (p - 1) times (2p - 1)     ] 11. Combining everything, the total number of regions is:     [     p^2 + (p - 1)(2p - 1)     ] 12. Simplifying this, we get:     [     p^2 + 2p^2 - p - 2p + 1 = 3p^2 - 3p + 1     ] # Conclusion: The maximum number of pairwise disjoint regions in which the triangle ABC can be divided is: [ boxed{3p^2 - 3p + 1} ]"},{"instruction":"Given an infinite sequence of digits, prove that for any natural number n that is coprime with 10, it is possible to indicate a group of consecutive digits in the sequence such that the number formed by these digits is divisible by n.","output":"1. **Define the Sequence:**     Given an infinite sequence of digits (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_i, ldots), we need to show that for any natural number (n) that is coprime with 10, there exists a consecutive group of digits such that the number formed by these digits is divisible by (n). 2. **Consider Sub-numbers:**     Let's consider sub-numbers of the sequence, where each sub-number is formed by taking successive digits such as:     [     a_m,  a_{m-1}a_m,  a_{m-2}a_{m-1}a_m,  ldots     ]     Suppose we have (m) such digits.

We have a common external tangent A_1A_2 and a common internal tangent B_1B_2. The points where these tangents touch the circles, A_1, A_2, B_1, and B_2, determine chords in each circle. We need to prove that the lines of these chords intersect on the line that connects the centers of the circles, O_1O_2.  Step-by-step Solution: **I. Solution:** 1. **Identify and Define Points**:     - Let the centers of the circles be O_1 and O_2.     - The tangents A_1A_2 (external) and B_1B_2 (internal) touch the circles at points A_1, A_2 and B_1, B_2 respectively.     - Denote the intersection point of the tangents A_1A_2 and B_1B_2 by C. 2. **Consider the Right Kite**:     - O_1A_1CB_1 and CA_2O_2B_2 are right kites because the angles at C are supplementary, making the kites similar by angle correspondence. 3. **Establish Similarity**:     - The similarity of the kites gives ratios of corresponding sides: O_1D_1 : O_1C = CD_2 : CO_2. 4. **Apply the Parallel Transversal Theorem**:     - For the parallel lines A_1B_1 and CO_2 intersected by O_1O_2C:       [       frac{O_1D_1}{O_1C} = frac{O_1P_1}{O_1O_2}       ]     - Similarly, for A_2B_2 and CO_1 intersected by O_1O_2C:       [       frac{CD_2}{CO_2} = frac{O_1P_2}{O_1O_2}       ] 5. **Prove Collocation**:     - Comparing these ratios, we derive:       [       frac{O_1P_1}{O_1O_2} = frac{O_1P_2}{O_1O_2}       ]     - This leads to O_1P_1 = O_1P_2, implying P_1 and P_2 are the same point, confirming that the chords' lines intersect on the line O_1O_2. # Conclusion Therefore, the lines defined by the chords A_1B_1 and A_2B_2 intersect on the line O_1O_2.

The points where the circle intersects the sides ( boldsymbol{AB} ) and ( boldsymbol{BC} ) of the triangle are connected to the ends of the height. Find the area of the constructed quadrilateral.","output":"1. We are given a triangle ( triangle ABC ) where the angles are ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). A height, ( BK ), runs from vertex ( B ) to the opposite side ( AC ). 2. A circle is constructed with the height ( BK ) as its diameter. By the property of a circle, any angle subtended by the diameter is a right angle. Therefore, the angles ( angle BMK ) and ( angle BNK ) are both ( 90^circ ). 3. Let ( M ) and ( N ) be the points where the circle intersects sides ( AB ) and ( BC ) respectively. We need to find the area of the quadrilateral ( MBKN ). 4. Using the heights we derived earlier, the area of quadrilateral ( MBKN ) can be found as the sum of the areas of two right triangles ( triangle BMK ) and ( triangle BNK ). This is expressed by:    [    S_{MBKN} = frac{1}{2} times BM times MK + frac{1}{2} times BN times NK    ] 5. Since each right triangle has a height and base equal to the segments of ( BK ):    [    S_{MBKN} = frac{1}{2} times BM times BK sin (90^circ - A) + frac{1}{2} times BN times BK sin (90^circ - C)    ]    Using the identity ( sin(90^circ - theta) = cos(theta) ):    [    S_{MBKN} = frac{1}{2}BK^2 (cos(A) + cos(C))    ] 6. Since ( BK ) is the height ( H ) from vertex ( B ) to the base ( AC ):    [    BK = H    ] 7. Now substitute ( BK = H ):    [    S_{MBKN} = frac{H^2}{2} (cos(A) + cos(C))    ] 8. Using the identity for the sum of cosines of angles, and knowing the interior angles of a triangle add to ( 180^circ ):    [    cos(A) + cos(C) = cos(A - C) cos (A + C)    ]    Therefore, given ( A + C + B = 180^circ ), so ( A + C = 180^circ - B ), implying ( cos (A + C) = -cos B ). 9. Updating our formula:    [    S_{MBKN} = frac{H^2}{2} cos (A - C) sin(B)    ]    Finally, the answer to the problem is: [ boxed{frac{H^2}{2} cos (A - C) sin B} ]"},{"instruction":"Joan found 6 seashells, and Jessica found some seashells on the beach.

Therefore, a, b, c, d are either all odd or all even, and 1 < k < frac{a}{a-1} times frac{b}{b-1} times frac{c}{c-1} times frac{d}{d-1}. It is easy to prove that for any positive integers m, n with m > 1, we have frac{m+n}{m-1+n} < frac{m}{m-1}. Since 1 < a < b < c < d, when a geq 5, we have frac{a}{a-1} leq frac{5}{4}, frac{b}{b-1} leq frac{6}{5}, frac{c}{c-1} leq frac{7}{6}, frac{d}{d-1} leq frac{8}{7}. Therefore, 1 < k < frac{5}{4} times frac{6}{5} times frac{7}{6} times frac{8}{7} = 2, which means 1 < k < 2, an impossibility. Thus, 1 < a leq 4. When a = 4, then b, c, d are all even, making k an odd number. Therefore, b geq 6, c geq 8, d geq 10, k geq 3. Therefore, 3 leq k < frac{4}{3} times frac{6}{5} times frac{8}{7} times frac{10}{9} = frac{128}{63} < 3, which is impossible. When a = 3, then b, c, d are all odd. Therefore, b geq 5, c geq 7, d geq 9. Therefore, 1 leq k < frac{3}{2} times frac{5}{4} times frac{7}{6} times frac{9}{8} = frac{315}{218} < 3. Therefore, k = 2. If b = 7, then k = frac{3 times 7cd - 1}{2 times 6(c-1)(d-1)}, making the numerator not a multiple of 3 while the denominator is, which means k cannot be an integer, so b neq 7. If b geq 9, since c-1, d-1 are not multiples of 3, 2 = k < frac{3}{2} times frac{9}{8} times frac{11}{10} times frac{15}{14} = frac{891}{448} < 2, which is impossible. Therefore, when a = 3, k = 2, b = 5, we have 2 = frac{15cd - 1}{8(c-1)(d-1)}, leading to cd - 16c - 16d + 17 = 0. Therefore, (c-16)(d-16) = 239 is a prime number. Thus, c-16 = 1, d-16 = 239, giving us one set of values that satisfy the conditions: a = 3, b = 5, c = 17, d = 255. When a = 2, b, c, d are even, making k an odd number. Therefore, 3 leq k < 2 times frac{4}{3} times frac{6}{5} times frac{8}{7} = frac{128}{35} < 4. Therefore, k = 3. Thus, 2bcd - 1 = 3(b-1)(c-1)(d-1), meaning bcd is not a multiple of 3. If b neq 4, then b geq 8, c geq 10, d geq 14, leading to k < 2 times frac{8}{7} times frac{10}{9} times frac{14}{13} = frac{2240}{819} < 3, a contradiction. Therefore, when a = 2, b = 4, k = 3, we have 3 = frac{2 times 4cd - 1}{3(c-1)(d-1)}, leading to (c-9)(d-9) = 71 is a prime number. Thus, c-9 = 1, d-9 = 71, giving us another set of values that satisfy the conditions: a = 2, b = 4, c = 10, d = 80.
