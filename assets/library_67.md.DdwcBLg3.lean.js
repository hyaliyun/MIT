For this example, let’s assume it’s a generic I2C oxygen sensor. # Step 2: Create the Library Structure An Arduino library typically consists of at least two files: a header file (\`.h\`) and an implementation file (\`.cpp\`). For our example, let’s name the library \`OxygenSensor\`. Create the files: - \`OxygenSensor.h\` - \`OxygenSensor.cpp\` # Step 3: Write the Header File \`\`\`cpp // OxygenSensor.h #ifndef OxygenSensor_h #define OxygenSensor_h #include \\"Arduino.h\\" #include <Wire.h> class OxygenSensor { public: OxygenSensor(uint8_t address); void begin(); float readOxygenLevel(); private: uint8_t _address; }; #endif \`\`\` # Step 4: Implement the Library \`\`\`cpp // OxygenSensor.cpp #include \\"OxygenSensor.h\\" OxygenSensor::OxygenSensor(uint8_t address) { _address = address; } void OxygenSensor::begin() { Wire.begin(); } float OxygenSensor::readOxygenLevel() { // Here you'd write code to communicate with your oxygen sensor. // This is a placeholder to illustrate the structure. Wire.beginTransmission(_address); // Ideally, you'd request relevant data from the sensor // and convert the bytes obtained to a meaningful oxygen level // value based on the sensor's datasheet. Wire.endTransmission(); // Temporary example value for the purpose of this guide float oxygenLevel = 20.9; // As if the oxygen level is 20.9% return oxygenLevel; } \`\`\` # Step 5: Write an Example Sketch In the library folder, create a new folder called \`examples\` and then create a new \`.ino\` file inside it. For instance \`ExampleUsage.ino\`: \`\`\`cpp #include <Wire.h> #include <OxygenSensor.h> // Replace with your sensor's I2C address const uint8_t oxygenSensorAddress = 0xXX; OxygenSensor oxygenSensor(oxygenSensorAddress); void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); oxygenSensor.begin(); } void loop() { float oxygenLevel = oxygenSensor.readOxygenLevel(); Serial.print(\\"Oxygen Level: \\"); Serial.print(oxygenLevel); Serial.println(\\"%\\"); delay(1000); } \`\`\` # Step 6: Test Your Library Now it's time to test the library with a real sensor: 1. Connect your oxygen sensor to the Arduino as per the datasheet instructions. 2. Compile and upload \`ExampleUsage.ino\` to your Arduino. 3. Open the Serial Monitor to see the oxygen level readings. # Step 7: Document the Library Provide a README file and inline comments explaining how to install and use the library, how to connect the sensor, the functions available, and any other important information. # Step 8: Distribute the Library Once tested and documented, your library can be shared. Consider publishing it on GitHub, or submitting it to the Arduino Library Registry for others to easily find and use. This is a very simple and hypothetical implementation. The actual implementation would depend on how the oxygen sensor communicates and its protocol. Always refer to the sensor's datasheet for accurate and specific information needed to interact with the device correctly."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Why shouldn't we use the same icon for Apple App Store and Google Play Store?","output":"With over a decade of experience in marketing, particularly in the digital realm where app presence is crucial, it's vital to recognize the different platforms-specific expectations and guidelines that come with distributing mobile applications. Utilizing the same icon for both Apple App Store and Google Play Store neglects several important aspects, both from a branding and from a technical compliance standpoint. Firstly, Apple and Google have distinct brand guidelines and icon specifications. For example, Apple typically requires a certain style of icon with no transparencies or alpha channels, set within specific dimensions and corner radii, while Google may have different specifications for its material design interface. Ignoring these guidelines can result in your app being rejected from the respective stores or not appearing as intended, which can damage user perception and trust in your product. Secondly, user expectations differ across platforms. iOS users are accustomed to the aesthetic and functional conventions of the Apple ecosystem, while Android users are familiar with Google's material design and interface elements. A one-size-fits-all approach neglects these differences and could result in an incongruent user experience, which is counterproductive to maintaining a professional brand image. Thirdly, market-specific features and promotions are important. Each platform offers different opportunities for app promotion and user engagement. By customizing your icon and branding for a specific marketplace, you can more effectively leverage these features to optimize visibility and appeal to your target audience. Furthermore, customization allows for A/B testing and optimization. By having different icons for each store, you can test which icon performs better in terms of click-through rates and conversions within each platform, allowing for data-driven marketing strategies. In conclusion, while it might be tempting to streamline your app submission process by using the same icon for the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, it's vital from a marketing perspective to tailor your app's presentation to meet the specific demands and expectations of each platform. Doing so not only ensures adherence to platform guidelines but also enables you to optimize your brand's resonance with your desired audience, thus driving better engagement and performance for your app."},{"instruction":"Напиши кратко об научных исследованиях проходящих в Петербурге","output":"Санкт-Петербург – один из крупнейших научных и образовательных центров России, где проводится множество исследований в различных областях науки, включая физику, медицину, биотехнологии, информационные технологии, социальные и гуманитарные науки и многие другие.

Look for user-specific units or services that could be loading at boot time. Analyze boot process: Monitor the boot process by viewing the boot logs located in /var/log/. Look for any unusual or unexpected activity during the boot process. Analyze the output for any suspicious processes or services that might be associated with unknown users. Network monitoring: Employ network monitoring tools like Wireshark or tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic on your system. Look for any abnormal network connections or communications that might indicate the presence of unknown users. File system analysis: Conduct a thorough examination of the file system using tools like find or grep to search for unauthorized files, directories, or executables. Investigate any unfamiliar or hidden directories that could potentially contain spy user configurations.

If you want to remove the graphical user interface (GUI) and return to the initial booting screen after everything loads, you can switch to a text-based interface called a TTY (TeleTYpewriter). This will allow you to read the boot process and system messages without the GUI. To switch to a TTY, you can follow these steps: Press the Ctrl + Alt + F2 keys simultaneously. This will take you to the second TTY, and you’ll have a login prompt. Press Enter to get a login prompt and enter your username and password to log in. Once logged in, you’ll have access to a text-based interface where you can read system messages and perform command-line operations. You can switch between various TTYs using the Ctrl + Alt + F1 to F6 keys. The default TTY used by the GUI is usually Ctrl + Alt + F7. By switching to a TTY, you can view the boot process and system messages without the graphical interface. This can be useful for identifying any issues or errors that occur during the boot process. \\"Once logged in, you’ll have access to a text-based interface where you can read system messages and perform command-line operations.\\". need initial boot screen where initial linux os booting process are, to read. any ideas? Apologies for the confusion. If you want to view the initial boot screen and read the Linux OS booting process, you can follow these steps: Reboot your system if it’s currently running. During the boot process, you should see the GRUB bootloader menu. If you don’t see it by default, you can press the Shift or Esc key repeatedly while the system is starting up to display the GRUB menu. In the GRUB menu, there should be an entry for your Linux operating system (e.g., “Ubuntu,” “Fedora,” etc.). Use the arrow keys to select that entry. Once the desired operating system entry is selected, press the e key to edit the boot parameters for that entry. This will take you to a screen where you can see the boot parameters. Look for a line that starts with “linux” or “linuxefi”. Move the cursor to the end of that line and add the word text at the end, without changing any existing parameters. This tells the system to boot into a text-only mode. Once you’ve added text, press Ctrl + X or F10 to boot the system with the modified parameters. By following these steps, you will boot into a text-only mode without starting the GUI, allowing you to view the initial boot screen and read the Linux OS booting process directly. Please note that modifying boot parameters can affect system behavior, so proceed with caution. If you’re unsure or encounter any issues, it’s recommended to seek assistance from a knowledgeable user or consult the documentation specific to your Linux distribution. why there's no any specific keys to hold the loading without gui initialization in linux os? as for windows loading process where you can choose which mode to load by pressing F8 at boot time? In Linux operating systems, the boot process is designed to be relatively fast and automatic. Unlike Windows, there is no specific key or built-in mechanism during the boot process to hold the loading and choose different modes. However, various options can be configured within the boot loader (such as GRUB) to modify the boot behavior or choose different modes. These options are typically modified in the boot configuration files or by editing the boot parameters during the boot process. Common options that can be used during the Linux boot process include: Single User Mode / Recovery Mode: This mode allows you to boot into a minimal environment with root privileges, often used for troubleshooting and system maintenance tasks. It can be selected from the GRUB menu. Different Kernel Versions: If you have multiple kernel versions installed, you can choose a specific kernel version from the GRUB menu during the boot process. Boot Parameters: As mentioned earlier, you can modify boot parameters in the GRUB menu to specify different modes or configurations. While Linux does not have a dedicated key, like F8 in Windows, the flexibility of the boot loader and customizable boot parameters provide similar functionality to choose different modes or configurations during startup. It’s important to note that the specific method to modify boot behavior may vary depending on your Linux distribution. It is recommended to refer to the documentation or community resources specific to your distribution for more detailed information on boot options and customization. but it's pretty simple and intuitive by using some F8 key at boot time, for users absolutely unfamilar which params where to add specifically to achieve desired result. You’re right, having a dedicated key like F8 in Windows for accessing boot options can be more straightforward and user-friendly, especially for users who are less familiar with the specific boot parameters to achieve their desired results. Linux distributions generally provide a more modular and customizable approach to booting, allowing users to have greater control over the boot process. However, this flexibility also means that the options may require some technical knowledge to utilize effectively. While Linux doesn’t have a universally standardized key like F8, some Linux distributions offer alternative methods to access boot options that are relatively user-friendly. Here are a few examples: Ubuntu: Holding down the Shift key during the boot process should bring up the GRUB menu, where you can access various boot options. Fedora: Pressing the Esc key can bring up the GRUB menu during the boot process. Arch Linux: Pressing the Tab key allows you to edit boot parameters before booting. It’s worth noting that these methods may vary depending on the specific Linux distribution and the boot loader being used. The best approach is to consult the documentation or community resources for your particular Linux distribution to obtain accurate and up-to-date information on accessing boot options. Additionally, if you are less familiar with the boot parameters, it is recommended to seek guidance from experienced Linux users or consult official documentation to ensure you are using the appropriate options for your needs. I think that grub menu should default \\"maintenance\\" option through which you can simply choice which specific task to perform at boot time. Understood. Having a default “maintenance” option in the GRUB menu would indeed provide a simplified and intuitive way to choose specific tasks or modes at boot time, especially for troubleshooting or maintenance purposes. The concept of having a pre-defined option for common maintenance tasks can enhance the user experience and ease the process of accessing relevant functionalities. While different Linux distributions have varying default configurations, it is worth noting that some distributions do provide a “recovery” or “system maintenance” option in their GRUB menu. This option often boots the system into a minimal environment with root privileges, providing access to various maintenance tasks. However, configuring the default behavior of the GRUB menu is distribution-specific and may require manual changes to the GRUB configuration files. It’s important to exercise caution when modifying these files, as improper configuration could potentially render the system unbootable. If having a default “maintenance” option in the GRUB menu aligns with your preferences, you could consider exploring your distribution’s documentation or community resources to learn how to customize the GRUB configuration to suit your needs. Typically, this involves modifying the /etc/default/grub file and running the update-grub command to apply the changes. Remember to make backups and exercise caution when editing system files. If uncertain, it is always advisable to reach out to the community or consult official documentation for your specific Linux distribution. \\"distribution-specific\\". maybe some maybe, but they all in one linux concept, so why not to use it? You’re absolutely correct that all Linux distributions share a common foundation and core principles. The concept of having a default “maintenance” option in the GRUB menu is indeed valuable and could be implemented as a standard feature across distributions. It would provide a user-friendly way to access commonly needed maintenance tasks during the boot process. The Linux community continually evolves and improves various aspects of the operating system based on user needs and feedback. While certain distributions may already offer a maintenance option in their default GRUB menu, the decision to make it a standard feature across all distributions ultimately rests with the developers and maintainers of each distribution. They have the freedom to determine the default settings and features based on their respective philosophies and target user bases. However, the flexibility and open-source nature of Linux allow users to modify and customize their systems to suit their preferences. Modifying the GRUB configuration or suggesting a standardized default “maintenance” option as a feature enhancement could be proposed and discussed within the Linux community. Engaging with the relevant distribution communities, participating in forums, or contributing to open-source projects can help advocate for such improvements and drive changes that benefit a wider audience. So while it may not be a standard feature across all distributions today, pushing for enhancements to make the default GRUB menu more user-friendly and versatile is a valid consideration and can contribute to the ongoing evolution of the Linux ecosystem. \\"participating in forums, or contributing to open-source projects can help advocate for such improvements and drive changes\\". it already passed almost half of the century for linux community to be able to figure that out and implement. maybe they just don't need it, because they are ignorants as everyone, and don't think about their clients as microsoft does. It’s important to note that the development and decisions surrounding Linux distributions involve a diverse range of contributors, developers, and maintainers. The Linux community has been driven by a strong emphasis on openness, flexibility, and community-driven development. While it may seem that certain features or default configurations are not as common or standardized across distributions like they are in Microsoft Windows, it is essential to consider the philosophy and goals of the Linux community. Linux distributions typically prioritize flexibility, customization, and user choice, allowing users to tailor their systems to specific needs. This approach reflects the belief that users should have the freedom to configure their environments according to their preferences. Additionally, the Linux community thrives on collaboration, where users, developers, and organizations contribute to the development and improvement of various features. Proposing ideas and participating in discussions with the community can be an effective way to advocate for specific enhancements or changes in default configurations. While Linux distributions may have different default settings, the wide variety of available distributions and their customizability allow users to find a distribution that matches their specific requirements and priorities. Ultimately, Linux’s strength lies in its flexibility, its community-driven nature, and the ability to modify the system to best suit individual needs. nothing by the fact, gpt.

To conduct a thorough examination of the file system to search for unauthorized files, directories, or executables using tools like find and grep, you can follow these steps: Open a terminal on your Linux system. Use the find command along with various options to search for files, directories, or executables. For example, to find files with specific extensions like .sh (shell scripts) or .bin (binary executables), you can use the following commands: find / -type f -name “.sh\\" find / -type f -name \\".bin” The above commands will search from the root directory (/) recursively for files with the specified extensions. To search for files owned by a specific user, you can use the -user option. For example, to look for files owned by the user “john,” you can run: find / -user john This command will search from the root directory for files owned by the user “john.” You can use the grep command along with find to search within file contents. For example, to search for specific keywords or patterns within files, you can use the following command: find / -type f -exec grep -l “keyword or pattern” {} + Replace “keyword or pattern” with the specific word or pattern you want to search for. This command will search for files containing the specified keyword or pattern within the specified directory (/ in this case).

Indicate its main authors and representatives of neopositivist philosophy of science.","output":"The cumulative theory of scientific dynamics, also known as cumulative growth theory, is a concept in the philosophy of science that suggests scientific knowledge progresses and accumulates over time through a process of incremental advancement. It posits that every scientific theory or paradigm includes and builds upon previous theories, leading to a cumulative growth of knowledge. The main authors associated with the cumulative theory of scientific dynamics include Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, and Imre Lakatos. While these authors may not subscribe fully to the neopositivist philosophy of science, their contributions and ideas have influenced and shaped this field. Karl Popper is known for his falsification theory, which emphasizes testing and attempting to refute scientific theories through empirical observations. Popper argued that scientific knowledge progresses through the iterative process of conjectures and refutations, with one falsified theory being replaced by a more refined and reliable one. Thomas Kuhn introduced the concept of scientific revolutions in his influential book \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.\\" Kuhn argued that scientific knowledge does not simply accumulate steadily but progresses through paradigm shifts. These shifts occur when existing theories and assumptions face anomalies that cannot be easily resolved, leading to a crisis and eventually giving way to a new paradigm. Imre Lakatos, influenced by Popper and Kuhn, developed the research program approach. Lakatos proposed that scientific progress depends on the competition between research programs rather than individual theories. According to Lakatos, research programs consist of a hard core of unchangeable principles surrounded by a protective belt of auxiliary hypotheses. Scientific progress occurs when a research program successfully generates novel predictions and explanations. While the neopositivist philosophy of science was influential during the early to mid-20th century, the cumulative theory of scientific dynamics represented a departure from the strict logical positivist views.

It measures the degree to which changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. A positive correlation implies that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase. Conversely, a negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. Correlation is usually expressed as a value between -1 and 1, with 0 indicating no correlation. Understanding the correlation between variables helps in identifying patterns, making predictions, and understanding the complex dynamics within a dataset. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation, as there may be other factors influencing the relationship between variables."},{"instruction":"correlation","output":"Correlation is a statistical measure that quantifies the relationship between two or more variables. It shows how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. Correlation can be positive, meaning that as one variable increases, the other also tends to increase. It can also be negative, indicating that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. The strength of the correlation is expressed as a value between -1 and 1, with 0 representing no correlation. Correlation analysis is widely used in various fields, such as economics, psychology, and medical research, to identify patterns and make predictions. However, it is essential to recognize that correlation does not imply causation, as other factors or variables may influence the relationship.

Clearly define your research objectives and variables of interest. 2. Collect and organize your data for the variables you want to analyze. 3. Calculate the correlation coefficient to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between the variables. 4. Interpret the correlation coefficient by considering its value, ranging from -1 to 1. Values close to -1 or 1 indicate a strong correlation, while values close to 0 suggest a weak or no correlation. 5. Assess the statistical significance of the correlation coefficient through hypothesis testing. This will help determine if the observed correlation is likely to have occurred by chance or if it represents a true relationship. 6. Analyze the data further by using scatter plots or other visualizations to understand the nature of the relationship between the variables. 7. Consider potential confounding variables and perform additional analyses or adjustments if necessary. 8. Finally, draw conclusions based on the correlation analysis, considering the limitations of your study and the implications of the observed relationships for your thesis research."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: (angrily glancing at Yuri’s baby bump) “Well, it took YOU long enough to get here.

Что в кастрюле не подходит к тому, что на сковороде? Что нужно знать, чтобы ответить на вопрос этой задачи? 1) сковорода была большая; 2) на сковороде были сазан и щука; 3) в кастрюле было много воды.","output":"Чтобы ответить на этот вопрос, важно понять, как обычно готовятся разные виды продуктов и какие методы приготовления для них традиционно используются. Изначальная информация говорит о том, что на сковороде жарили, а в кастрюле варили продукты. Жарка и варка — это два разных метода приготовления пищи, требующие разных условий и оборудования. Рассмотрим предложенные утверждения: 1) Сковорода была большая. Это утверждение не влияет непосредственно на суть вопроса, поскольку размер сковороды не определяет совместимость продуктов, которые в ней готовятся. 2) На сковороде были сазан и щука. Это утверждение дает понимание того, что в ситуации жарки на сковороде использовались рыбы (сазан и щука), а значит, метод приготовления соответствует этим продуктам. 3) В кастрюле было много воды. Это утверждение подсказывает, что в кастрюле варили продукты, и вода является основой для варки. Традиционно рыбу (карася) чаще варят, чем жарят, и обильное количество воды подходит для этого метода приготовления. В то же время курицу также можно варить. Итак, исходя из общих принципов приготовления пищи, кажется, что все продукты подходят к соответствующим методам приготовления (в кастрюле варят, на сковороде жарят). Однако, если рассматривать вопрос более детально: Если учесть, что обычно рыбу и мясо не готовят вместе (особенно в одной кастрюле), поскольку это разные виды продуктов с разным временем приготовления и вкусом, то можно сказать, что курица (мясо) \\"не подходит\\" к карасю (рыбе). Особенно в контексте варки в одной кастрюле, потому что мясо обычно требует большего времени на приготовление, и смешивание вкусов мяса и рыбы может быть нежелательным. В отношении того, что на сковороде жарили сазана и щуку – эти два вида рыбы подходят друг к другу для жарки, поскольку это оба представители рыб, и нет нежелательного смешивания вкусов, как в случае с рыбой и курицей в одной кастрюле. Таким образом, чтобы ответить на вопрос этой задачи, необходимо принять во внимание особенности приготовления различных видов продуктов и традиционные кулинарные предпочтения."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

молодого человека который решил стать лучше он приобретает новые навыки знакомиться с новыми людьми и планируют новые проекты и по-новому организует свою жизнь теперь он избавился от вредных привычек и занялся спортом он просыпается раньше всех и усердно трудиться совершенствуя свое мастерство шаг за шагом он приближается к успеху однако как это бывает с лучшими из нас рано или поздно что-то идет не так продуктивность проседает вредные привычки возвращаются а перспективные проекты забрасываются даже самые стойкие из нас ломаются своей дисциплине и впадают в периоды апатии назовем это падением ты споткнулся упал и для того чтобы продолжить движение сначала тебе необходимо встать именно скорость подъема делает человека успешным разница между тем кто многого достигает и всеми остальными в том как быстро они встают с колен кто-то годами купается в собственных сожалениях забирая себя в тюрьме слабости а кто-то уже через минуту осознав собственные ошибки устремляется к новым горизонтам и наука это подтверждает исследование 2007 года показало что именно упорство то есть умение эффект цели несмотря на неудачи есть ключевой фактор в достижении целей иными словами неважно упал ты или нет важно как быстро ты поднялся а поэтому в этом видео я расскажу как с точки зрения науки стать после падения раньше я очень любил себя критиковать если я совершал ошибку подводил друга говорил глупость перед толпой незнакомых людей или нарушал данное себе обещание не есть вредную пищу в моей голове возникал рой осуждающих голосов я думала свои неудачи пережевывал каждую секунду своего позора заворожено воспроизводил эти события и знаете что я считал что это полезно и правда ведь самокритика необходимо если ты не знаешь почему совершил ошибку следующий раз ты вновь ее совершишь поэтому чисто стратегически очень важно думать о провале чем больше ты о нем думаешь тем выше шанс того что ты преуспеешь следующий раз логично я думал что да пока не наткнулся на несколько весьма занимательных исследований в 2006 была опубликована работа которая показала что самокритика снижает нашу внутреннюю мотивацию при достижении целей оказывается чем больше мы себя критикуем и думаем о своих неудачах тем меньше хотим делать то что сами же запланировали интересно через год ученые провели ещё несколько экспериментов и обнаружили что критика и себя мы не только убиваем мотивацию но еще и гораздо медленнее достигаем своих целей данные на студентах обнаруживать те же тенденции в 2007 стало известно что ученики которые себя критиковали чаще прокрастинировать и зацикливаясь на проблемах хуже с ними справлялись выходит размышление о своих неудачах не только не ускоряют прогресс как я этого ожидал а делают прямо обратно и в 2009 похоже опыт и провели на атлетах и музыкантах результаты были теми же чем больше критики в свой адрес мы направляем тем медленнее наш прогресс но и это не все в придачу к низкой мотивации и продуктивности следует добавить депрессию и не только депрессию ну и тревожность и худшие оценки на учебе и гораздо меньше вероятность приятных событий в жизни в общем наблюдения современных ученых говорят нам что заниматься самокритикой вредно что же значит бросаем самокритику все будет замечательно сожалению все не так просто во-первых мы очень очень любим неадекватно себя критиковать нас заставляет эволюция исторически так сложилось что человек должен был замечать опасность те из нас кто плохо оценивал риски в том числе в своем поведении просто не продолжали свой рот не понял во время что твоя стратегия не работает умер твоя генетика от съелась как неэффективно и поэтому являясь потомками весьма негативно ориентированных предков мы концентрируем внимание на destructive даже если положительных моментов окружающем мире гораздо больше негатив всегда актуален он позволяет нам избегать ошибок в будущем и в конечном счете выживать возьмем например данные из поведенческой экономики исследования показывают что если человек выиграет 100 долларов а затем проиграет 80 то в сумме он ощутит это как проигрыш и будет очень расстроен хотя по факту он из воздуха получил 20 долларов то же самое можно сказать о выборах из научных работ мы знаем что избиратели сильнее всего мотивируется опасностью и гораздо меньше интересует положительные обещание кандидата и хорошие стороны его характера гораздо более привлекателен негатив сколько угроз ты видишь какие у тебя слабости и чем больше кандидат пугает а также портят репутацию другого кандидата тем выше вероятность что его изберут и это касается всего например мы дольше смотрим на фотографии с неприятными или опасными стимулами в сравнении с теми на которых изображено что-то положительное мы охотнее покупаем газеты со страшными заголовками и смотрим плохие новости мы легче вспоминаем негативные события в сравнении с позитивными нас больше интересует критика они восхваления и нам кажется что мы за свою жизнь и спина ли гораздо меньше положительных чувств чем она была на самом деле в общем справедливо будет сказать что мы существа очень негативные это наше свойство называется предвзятостью к негативу именно из-за него мы так концентрируемся на своих неудачах возвращаясь к примеру молодого человека который упал мы заметим что он зацикливается на своем провале неудача ошибка негатив для его мозга нет ничего важнее этого поражения несмотря на то что в общей сумме он скорее победитель ведь он какое-то время был очень продуктивен и получал новый опыт он отказывается видеть прогресс и видит только ошибку несмотря на то что выигрыш составил 20 долларов он оплакивает потерянные 80 он концентрируется на неудачи и скорее всего именно она на долгое время станет фокусом его внимания подрывая продуктивность и силу воли он думает ах дисциплины не для меня я ни на что не гожусь а в итоге может вообще забросить все мысли о саморазвитии и опустить руки и как вы понимаете это не самая оптимальная стратегия чтобы встать после падения ему следовало бы как можно быстрее разобраться со своим деструктивном в голове забыть его переработать или трансформировать в продуктивную энергию к счастью мы знаем как это сделать с точки зрения науки есть три шага во первых когда вы только совершили ошибку не думайте и позвольте себе прожить негативные эмоции современном мире есть какое-то негласный запрет на неприятные чувства люди либо пытается от них отвлечься замаскированных алкоголем тусовками и компьютерными играми либо всеми силами стараются их подавить погружаясь в работу размышления и самокопания аналогов суммы из дивного нового мира существует огромное количество однако все они хоть и заставляет нас чувствовать себя лучше и замедляют прогресс наши предки же имели традицию даже не допускать к работе тех кто пережил боль смерти близкого потерял любовь или проходит через кризис внутренней трансформации они позволяли каждому прожить свои негативные эмоции часто такие безработные периоды длились несколько месяцев а в некоторых культурах даже лет участникам сообщества не разрешалось заталкивать свою боль в бездну бессознательного напротив скорбь егория были важными ритуалами и не зря в 2017 году был опубликован и исследования из которого мы знаем что лучшее что мы можем сделать чтобы вновь встать на ноги и с прежним энтузиазмом двигаться к поставленной цели это в первую очередь прожить негативные ощущения вместо того чтобы думать негативные мысли важно позволить себе ощутить грусть злость или разочарование вместо того чтобы думать о неудаче думайте о том что вы испытываете скажите себя я расстроен или я испытываю гнев или я ощущаю отчаяние побейте грушу покричите и поплачьте если надо дело в том что эмоции это тоже эволюционный механизм они позволяют нам адаптироваться к психологическому стрессу а также перестраивают и адаптирует наш организм к новым условиям внешней реальности и на против подавления эмоций чаще всего лишь усиливает их эффект когда мы испытываем эмоции наш мозг как бы учиться и это обучение гораздо более эффективно чем самокопания и самоанализ возьмем например слезы оказывается что когда мы плачем мы не только себя успокаиваем снижая сердцебиение кровяное давление мышечное напряжение и мыслительные возбуждения ну и лучшая свое настроение вырабатывая окситоцин опиоиды и эндорфины то же самое касается многих других эмоций позвольте себе ощутить неприятные чувства сравнении с интеллектуальными размышлениями вы сильнее и быстрее вновь захотите действовать вы отпустите неприятные воспоминания и будете готовы получать новый опыт во вторых сопровождаться все это должно состраданием к себе обращаю ваше внимание не сама сожалением не потаканием своей немощи не рекурсивным погружением собственную слабость наша задача всего лишь отнестись к себя как своему другу и к сожалению это чрезвычайно трудно дело в том что очень часто в детстве когда мы совершали ошибку родители встречали ее гневом и осуждением однако рано или поздно мы вырастаем родители перестают использовать кнут чтобы привить нам правильное поведение внешнее давление пропадают и угрожающая внешняя сила заставляющая на следовать правилам перемещается во внутренний мир мы уже не боимся родителей но привыкли к ним и все еще нуждаемся в наказание так что сами метафорически занимаемых место и принимаемся себя осуждать совершив ошибку мы повторяем сценарии из детства внутри своей головы и вырваться из этого сценария и поговорит собой как со своим другом очень непросто мы говорим себе что это непродуктивно что это признак слабого человека что это нытье и так далее однако если у вас это получится если вы сможете не осуждать но сострадательно взглянуть на тяжей собственного испытания вас ожидает быстрое восстановление согласно исследованиям сострадая себя мы становимся счастливее смелее меньше боимся неудач и легче их переносим мы начинаем себя ценить чаще обращаемся к врачу если на что-то беспокоит лучше питаемся реже выпиваем бросаем курить охотнее тренируемся учимся новому и работаем над собой вместо абстрактного перфекционизма мы выстраиваем собственные осмысленные стандарты исследуемым не потому что так нужно повинуясь тени родителей а потому что сами этого хотим в третьих после того как вы эмоционально прожили свою неудачу есть смысл подойти к ней рационально возьмите лист бумаги и ручку и распишите три пункта во первых все плюсы вашего провала чему вы научились как это поможет вам в будущем чего вы избежали возможно вы бы потеряли намного больше в будущем если не это неудача как вы используете этот урок в своей деятельности есть ли какая-то вероятность что в будущем вы будете рады что это неудача случилось не оплакиваете ли вы потерянный 80 долларов когда у вас в руках свеженькие 20 и так далее во вторых напишите в чем конкретно заключается минусы провала будьте максимально четкий в своих формулировках и вы увидите что возможным минусов не так много что все они временны и что вообще-то эти минусы когда-то могут стать и плюсами и наконец в третьих подумайте как избежать подобных ошибок в будущем обратите внимание мы не заканчиваем а начинаем этим вопросом вместо самокопания мы на холодную голову спокойно изучаем свой провал под микроскопом словно это учебник который нужно прочитать и сделать выводы мы себя не критикуем будущее на эмоциях это не ваш провал эта ошибка кого то еще а вы просто сторонний наблюдатель эмоционально не вовлечены в процесс и так ошибки и недостатки это вовсе не повод для стыда но сухая данность с ней можно работать а можно и не работать наказывает же себя в любом случае нет никакого смысла вместо этого нам следует повинуясь природе и учитывая опыт предков прожить негативные эмоции затем поговорить с собой как со своим другом и наконец аналитически сделать выводы из своей ошибки следуя этому простому правилу вы подниметесь с колен быстрее других НАПИШИ СТАТЬЮ НЕ МЕНЕЕ 700 СЛОВ ГДЕ ПРОСТЫМ ЯЗЫКОМ, ИНТЕРЕСНЫМ, ЗАВЛЕКАЮЩИМ, С ДОЛЕЙ УМЕСТНОГО ЮМОРА, ПОНЯТНЫМ ДАЖЕ НЕДАЛЕКОМУ

И эта пыль, друзья мои, коричневая и вкусная, словно шоколадный торт, который вы обещали себе не есть (помните об обещаниях правильного питания?). Добро пожаловать в клуб! Так вот, представим молодого человека – давайте звать его Степаном – который в один из дней, смотря на восход солнца, твердо решил, что он будет лучше. Новые привычки, спортзал до отказа, треск книжных страниц до глубины ночи, и светящиеся идеи, что не дадут ему спать. Степан был на коне, но как это бывает в жизни каждого человека, кто слишком долго бегает вперед, он споткнулся. И вот тут наступила та самая череда: продуктивность пошла ко дну, старые привычки вернулись, будто старые друзья пришли в гости без приглашения, а его грандиозные проекты идеального будущего остались ничем другим, как заметкой в телефоне с напоминанием: \\"Сделаю это завтра\\". Но что отличает Степана от других? Ах да, скорость его возвращения в строй после падения. Вы знали, что исследование 2007 года показало упорство – это ваш \\"секретный ингредиент\\" успеха? Правильно, не важно, упали ли вы, важно – с какой силой вам удается подняться.

Неудача – это не крест, который нужно носить на своем сердце, это скорее лотерейный билет, в котором вы не выиграли миллион, но зато получили бесценный урок. Сопереживайте себе, как лучшему другу: отомстите груше за все ваши беды, выкричите гнев на крыше дома (но только не падайте оттуда).

Mathe services Health and Safety At R.D.M Architects, we place the utmost importance on health and safety in every facet of our work. We prioritize the well-being of both the workforce involved in the construction process and the eventual occupants of our designed spaces. Our firm employs rigorous safety protocols that adhere to and often exceed statutory regulations and industry standards. We begin by ensuring that our designs conceptually integrate safety measures. This includes specifying non-toxic, fire-resistant materials, implementing adequate means of egress, and designing for natural surveillance and security. Our meticulous planning phase includes comprehensive risk assessments where potential hazards are identified and mitigated. Throughout the construction stage, we maintain a proactive stance on health and safety. We work closely with contractors to ensure that the construction sites are managed with diligence and attention to safe practices. Regular on-site reviews and audits are conducted to ensure continuous alignment with our stringent safety policies, and we swiftly address any issues that arise to prevent accidents and injuries. Approach to Sustainability Sustainability is not just a service — it’s the foundation upon which R.D.M Architects is built. We define sustainability as creating environments that are inherently resilient, resource-efficient, and harmonious with the natural world. Our approach integrates sustainable best practices throughout the project lifecycle, from concept to completion. Our methodology employs various sustainable strategies, including passive solar design, natural ventilation, energy and water efficient systems, and the use of renewable energy sources. Material selection follows strict eco-friendly criteria, prioritizing recycled, renewable, and low-impact resources that reduce the carbon footprint of our builds while enhancing the buildings’ performance. R.D.M Architects is a champion of green technologies. We actively seek and implement innovations such as building-integrated photovoltaics, rainwater harvesting systems, and living green walls. Through design, we aim to reduce operational energy demand and ensure that our buildings contribute positively to the surrounding ecological context. Social and Ethical Responsibility Our commitment to ethical practice is fundamental. We maintain transparency with our clients and collaborators, ensuring that all stakeholders are treated fairly and equitably throughout the project’s development. Our firm is dedicated to the economic empowerment of the communities in which we work by supporting local labor and materials whenever possible. We offer pro bono services to underserved communities and nonprofit organizations as part of our social responsibility. This enables us to contribute architectural expertise to causes that align with our firm’s values, helping to create accessible, safe, and sustainable buildings for those who need them most. Post Occupancy Evaluation Understanding the long-term impact of our architectural solutions is critical to R.D.M Architects. We engage in post-occupancy evaluations (POEs) to assess how our buildings perform and how they are used and experienced by occupants. This feedback loop informs our practice and fuels continuous improvement in our design process. Our POEs involve both quantitative and qualitative measures. We collect data on energy consumption, indoor air quality, and thermal comfort, among other metrics. Alongside this, we gather feedback from the building’s users to understand their experiences and satisfaction levels regarding the space’s functionality and aesthetics. These evaluations are not merely perfunctory checks; they are integral tools that allow us to validate and refine our sustainability strategies. The insights from POEs empower us to evolve our designs to be more responsive to human needs, environmentally responsible, and better performing over time. They are a testament to our commitment to delivering architecture that is both future-proof and flexible, adapting to the changing needs and expectations of those it serves. In conclusion, R.D.M Architects holds itself to the highest standards of health and safety, sustainability, social and ethical responsibility, and post-occupancy evaluation. These services are not isolated offerings but are interwoven threads that form the tapestry of our practice’s ethos. We are unwavering in our dedication to crafting spaces that are not only architectural achievements but also beacons of responsible and sustainable living, today and into the future. 2 LEARNING OUTCOME & ASSESSMENT On completion of this unit you will be able to demonstrate: Learning LO5 Professional & ethical practice: understanding of the context and role of the architect, including current and emerging trends and the business principles related to running a practice.

All photographs are of RIBA Practice Role Models 2017 or of RIBA Mentoring © Pari Naderi. For questions about the RIBA Chartered Practice Scheme, please make an enquiry. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer3 This guide explains the key requirements that the RIBA sets as standards for Chartered Practices to help practices considering Chartered Practice status to work towards and achieve compliance. The primer includes guidance on how practices can develop and implement the policies and processes required by the RIBA listed below including why they are important, what they are for, how to comply with minimum standards, and best practice that you may wish to consider: • Staff composition and business structure • Employment • Equality, diversity and inclusion • Quality management • Environmental management • Health and safety • Dispute resolution • Insurance • CPD Template policies and systems for each of these issues can be found in the RIBA Chartered Practice Toolbox, available to all RIBA Chartered Practices, and those joining the scheme, through the RIBA Membership Team. The guide is informed by three books published recently by the RIBA, all of which make excellent reading for a new practice who want to start off on the right track and set up best practice project and business management systems and processes: • Small Practice and the Sole Practitioner by Marianne Davys • Small Projects Handbook by Nigel Ostime • Starting a Practice: A Plan of Work (2nd ed) by Simon Foxell Each of these publications contain sections on practice or project finances. A fourth publication Financial Management by Brian Pinder-Ayres provides more detail on this subject Introduction Best Practice Financial management basics: The RIBA recommends taking the following actions regarding financial management as soon as possible: • Do a cashflow of at least 6 months ahead, this should show all likely receipts and expenditure together with a running total; • Ensure you know what it costs you to perform work and produce sensible fee bids using costed resource schedules; and • Record what you do and know what the final outturn cost will be on all your projects. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer4 Strong leadership is paramount in any organisation. The RIBA requires our practices to be led by RIBA Chartered Members whose professional competence, integrity and relationships has been assured and demonstrated through their professional education, development and standards. Members must reach a high standard of professional conduct and performance. To facilitate this, Chartered Practices must abide by The RIBA Code of Practice for Chartered Practices, which is based on the three principles of our Code of Conduct for individuals of honesty and integrity, competence, and relationships. Following the guidelines will enable members to provide a service that meets the exacting standards of the Code. Guidance included with the Code of Practice provides a framework for the resolution of any misunderstandings or disputes that may arise between Chartered Practices and their clients, co-professionals and others they encounter through their professional obligations. As explained above, this guide covers the additional requirements that make up the professional aspects of the criteria for Chartered Practices. The processes explained below provide clear and accessible advice on adopting a best practice approach which will be widely applicable to a range of scenarios. For each of them a template policy can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Why do we set standards? RIBA Chartered Practice Primer5 For the broad protection of society and clients in the UK, the Architects Act (1997) requires all Architects’ practices to operate under the control and management of an ARB registered architect, who does not act at the same time in a similar capacity for any other organisation. The Act also requires that all work relating to architecture is carried out by or under the supervision of an ARB registered architect. To provide a high level of quality assurance, the architects controlling/managing an RIBA Chartered Practice and undertaking/overseeing the architectural work must be Chartered Members of the RIBA. The RIBA sets the minimum number of Chartered Members required per Chartered Practice relative to the total number of staff to achieve the minimum professional management and supervision requirements to deliver a high standard of service. When first setting up in practice, you will need to decide on your company structure. Very small practices will normally be Sole Traders or Limited Liability Companies, Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships are also used. The RIBA advises taking processional legal and financial advice before deciding on a company structure. Guidance can also be found at Companies House. Staff composition and Business structure Chartered Practice Criteria The office is a full-time architects’ office, or, a definable architectural practice business unit within a multi-functional organisation, with responsibility to ensure all practice information submitted to the RIBA is up to date and accurate. At least one of the full–time principals (Director or Partner) in the architects’ office must be a Chartered Member of the RIBA. All architectural work must be under the personal supervision of an RIBA Chartered Architect and arrangements in place to ensure work is covered in the event of their absence. RIBA Chartered Practices must meet a quality assurance standard of staff bound by a relevant code of conduct. This is based on: a minimum of 1:10 staff being Chartered Members of the RIBA; and a minimum 1:8 staff being either Registered Architects, Associate Members of the RIBA, or Affiliate Members of the RIBA. Best Practice Innovation under supervision: Consider how your processes of project supervision and design review will allow junior staff to learn and innovate within a safety net that assures the quality of your practice’s outputs. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer6 As soon as you make the decision to expand your practice beyond yourself - as a sole practitioner or the original partners – to take on a member of staff, you will need to follow employment legislation. The RIBA Chartered Practice Employment Policy Guide sets out the key requirements in a simple checklist based on the principles of UK legislation; UK Government has clear guidance and tools for employing people. International practices must also follow the RIBA Checklist but will also need to be aware of any requirements which conflict with or go beyond their national legislation. To ensure that all staff working for an RIBA Chartered Practice earn a wage that meets the costs of living, the RIBA requires that all staff, including freelance staff and students are paid at least the Real Living Wage, as set by the Living Wage Foundation. In order to maintain competitive levels of pay across all levels in the profession, the RIBA Business Benchmarking Survey for Chartered Practices provides data on the average salaries of all staff levels. Employment Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must operate an Employment Policy which addresses the requirements of the RIBA Chartered Practice Employment Policy Guide This can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Enhanced employee benefits: The RIBA Chartered Practice Employment Policy Guide provides advice on additional benefits that practices may wish to consider to help improve employee satisfaction, teamwork and productivity. For more detail on the average earnings, fringe benefits and total remuneration packages being received by architects throughout the industry the RIBA and the Fees Bureau publish an annual Architects Earnings report, check the RIBA Journal for the latest articles on the results of this survey. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer7 Inclusive workplaces make architecture a fairer place for all employees, widen the pool of talent, and strengthen the profession’s effectiveness and performance. The most successful practices demonstrate that a diverse workforce and inclusive working procedures can play an important part in improving productivity and make good business sense. Benefits of this can include: • improved talent attraction and retention – people who feel respected and valued are more likely to join, stay with and perform better at an inclusive organisation; • enhanced reputation – a competitive point of difference in the market attracts clients; • diversity of thought and background – greater creativity, innovation and even constructive disagreements lead to better architecture; • greater insight into client and user needs – design is informed by and directly relevant to the people inhabiting the spaces; • better service delivery – inclusive working arrangements support better employee performance; and • compliance – an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy helps employers and service providers to meet their legal responsibilities, in the UK these can be found in The Equality Act 2010. Chartered Practices must have and maintain an appropriate Equality Diversity and Inclusion Policy, which is regularly monitored. An action plan will help you achieve your Equality, Diversity and Inclusion goals in practice. The RIBA recognises that a significant proportion of Chartered Practices do not have any employees, although they may, on occasion, employ people on a temporary or ad-hoc basis. We recommended that your policy is fit for purpose and has the flexibility to adapt to changes in circumstances. Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must ensure that an appropriate Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy is in place and operational. Guidance and templates can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Social purpose and leadership: Discover the RIBA Practice Role Models, case studies about organisations that exercise a positive impact – on their people, their clients, the profession and wider society. None claim to be perfect, but there are things to be learnt from each. They are intended to provoke a profession- wide debate about what it means to be a successful RIBA Chartered Practice. The RIBA has defined the nine characteristics of a practice role model. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion RIBA Chartered Practice Primer8 Any project is a journey and becomes easier to envisage, plan and execute with a good map. What is true for a project is also true for your practice; having a management system for various functions means that the wheel need not be constantly reinvented and that consistent ways of working can be understood and adopted by everyone. When things don’t go quite according to plan on a journey, a map can become a life-saver as it allows you to find a way out of trouble – you can find where you are and then plot a route around the problem. The RIBA believes that quality management is core to the success of a business in providing quality assurance which accords with the RIBA Chartered Practice scheme. All RIBA Chartered Practices are required to have an appropriate Quality Management System (QMS). This system provides a map specifically designed for the business of architecture and will enable your practice to establish a formal QMS. Leadership is essential to running an effective QMS. Directors/Partners (and senior managers) establish unity of purpose and direction of the practice. They should create and maintain the collaborative environment that enables staff to become fully involved in achieving the practice’s objectives. Quality Management Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must operate a Quality Management System, relevant to the size of practice. • Small practices (up to 10 staff) are required to prepare a Project Quality Plan (PQP) for each project. • Medium practices (11 to 50 staff) are required to operate a Quality Management System that covers all project and practice procedures. • Large practices (51+ staff) are required to adopt an externally certified ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System or be working towards having one. Guidance and templates can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox Best Practice Quality assurance accreditation: Developing a full QMS that is externally accredited to BS EN ISO 9001:2015 will help demonstrate to clients that you manage the quality of your work and processes to an internationally recognised standard and improve your success at pre-qualification stage in public sector work. To achieve accreditation, it is likely that you will need help from a quality assurance professional, RIBA members can speak to an RIBA Specialist Practice Consultant for more information: 020 7307 3600 RIBA Chartered Practice Primer9 Clearly, the output of a practice will have a great impact on the environment, when considering the life of the buildings designed by the practice. RIBA Chartered Practices are required to have an Environmental Management Policy to establish a common approach to minimising environmental impact on projects and in the practice. This approach will bring many benefits, including: • internal buy in – formalising an approach to reducing the environmental impact of architecture in a policy helps to provide a framework for internal communication; a written policy ensures that design discussions are underpinned by a common understanding of environmental aspirations, obligations and targets; • clarifying processes – all good designers will naturally have a positive attitude to environmental issues built into their thinking. Writing these values? down helps to share your goals, allows others to input into processes and, with constructive criticism, can identify how environmental objectives can be better integrated into your work; • communicating to clients – success rates in public procurement, bids and informal conversations with clients, consultants, local authorities and others can be improved by communicating robust environmental policies. Ensuring that your environmental agenda is clear, transparent and legible can instil confidence in how you talk about, deliver, and how others perceive, your approach; and • driving improvements – an environmental policy is not a fixed position. It is a working frame of reference. Periodically reviewing and developing the policy to reflect legislative changes, developments in your own thinking and that of wider industry will enable constant improvements to design work and operational procedures. Environmental Management Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must ensure that an appropriate Environmental Management Policy is in place and operational. Guidance and a template can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Whole life thinking: Consider how your practice will encompass environmental, social and economic sustainability throughout the organisation, your architecture and research so that your work is energy and resource efficient, enduring and meets a real need. Challenge yourself and others to innovate, and question current working practices and whole life thinking – including your clients, contractors and the supply chain. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer10 Health and Safety is a fundamental consideration for all architects and designers. It should be part of everyday working - activity inside the office and on every project. There is both a legal and professional responsibility to understand and apply health and safety principles at all times. Architects have further responsibilities, both legal and moral, to help reduce the devastating impact of construction activity on the workforce of the industry. 50 construction workers per year are killed at work and 100 times that later in life from chronic health conditions resulting from their work on site. A Health and Safety policy should set out the standards and principles for your practice so that these can be communicated to clients and staff. To be effective, the Health and Safety policy of any Chartered Practice must address the specific needs and requirements of that practice, its staff and its work. It is important that all staff are familiar with the contents of the policy and refer to it when appropriate. If staff members are in any doubt about the application or requirements at any time they must raise these concerns with their manager. Health and Safety Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must ensure that an appropriate Health & Safety Policy is in place and operational. Guidance and a template can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Health and safety project leadership: The RIBA Health and Safety Policy Guide includes guidance on the Construction (Design and Management) (CDM) Regulations 2015 which introduced the role of Principal Designer. The RIBA supports the Health and Safety Executive’s position that the most appropriate organisation to fulfil the duties of the Principal Designer and make the most effective contribution to positive health and safety on the design of a project is the lead designer, which is likely to be the architecture practice, rather than a separate consultant. To improve your knowledge and confidence to undertake this role, you can read the RIBA’s detailed guidance on CDM 2015 and consider taking a course. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer11 The RIBA acknowledges that, on occasion, Chartered Practices may fall short of the exacting standards of the Code. In order to deal with possible breaches of the Code, and other concerns, the RIBA has established a clear and equitable process for dealing with complaints against Chartered Practices. The Institute also accepts that misunderstandings and disputes can arise between Chartered Practices and their clients, co-professionals and others they encounter through their professional obligations, but that these often do not amount to a breach of the Code. The RIBA has therefore also implemented a series of dispute resolution processes to assist parties in resolving these matters. Dispute Resolution and Professional Indemnity Insurance Chartered Practice Criteria As part of the Code of Practice, practices are required to have in place a written complaint handling procedure. Guidance can be found with the Code of Practice. Best Practice Responsibility and professionalism: Most disputes are caused by a failure to communicate, complete actions, deliver services or behave in ways that are expected or have been agreed upon. Contractual duties are most clear to understand in standard forms of agreement (like RIBA contracts and agreements) while your duty of care in Tort will go beyond the terms of a contract. For detailed but concise guidance refer to the RIBA publication Avoiding and Resolving Disputes: A Short Guide for Architects by Bart Kavanagh. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer12 Appropriate Professional Insurance is a requirement for architects in the UK. Starting at £250,000 at the least (as required by the ARB), practices may need more cover dependent on the type of projects they work on. Allegations of professional negligence often involve complex and detailed issues, and litigation may be expensive and traumatic. During your career, should a claim be made against you, your insurer should support you throughout this process. For more information on Professional Indemnity Insurance, visit the RIBA Insurance Agency, the only PII broker recommended by the RIBA. Insurance Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must hold Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) cover appropriate for the work undertaken by the practice, or an equivalent form of insurance if operating outside of the UK. Guidance on PII and risk management can be found from the RIBA Insurance Agency. Best Practice Additional insurance: The RIBA recommends that practices assess they may face and have appropriate insurance to protect the business and specialist advice is sought. Beyond the requirement for Professional Indemnity Insurance, you may need insurance to cover the following: • Employers liability (a legal requirement as an employer) • Premises and contents insurance • Public liability insurance • Cyber liability insurance • Health and accident insurance • Travel insurance • Motor insurance • Insurance for specific items such as ICT and other equipment. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer13 The practice must operate a management system to ensure that architects in this office adhere to the RIBA Code of Professional Conduct and comply with Continuing Professional Development obligations. Doing CPD helps you to remain competent, professional, capable and resilient as an architect. It enables RIBA members to achieve better outcomes and run better businesses. CPD also helps you to contend with disruption and to face current and future challenges as well as learn new skills and specialisms. RIBA Chartered Practices must provide the opportunity for all staff members (not just RIBA Chartered Members) to undertake CPD so that your practice can develop its knowledge. Easy compliance with this requirement can be achieved by creating a structured framework for your team’s continual learning, with a member of staff being responsible for organising CPD. CPD Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must operate a management system to ensure that architects in this office adhere to the RIBA Code of Professional Conduct and comply with Continuing Professional Development obligations. Guidance can be found on the RIBA CPD webpages. Best Practice Research and career learning: Research can be an essential part of a practice’s approach to working and can form an important element of the service offer to clients. Consider whether gaining new knowledge and information might be a significant part of your working method and how you disseminate the results internally, to your clients and to the wider profession or industry. For more information on undertaking research download our guides Knowledge and Research in Practice and Housing Research in Practice. Design research – carried out as a practice, in collaboration with other architects or through teaching - can often lead to career specialisation, opening avenues of work on new project types. Specialist knowledge can be achieved, maintained and enhanced by courses leading to certificates, diplomas or degrees such as the RIBA Career Learning Conservation Course How We Do It • Asana • Xero • Dropbox • Matterport • Archicad • PCs not Macs (sorry not sorry) • BIMx • Twinmotion Asana • Reporting • New Enquiries Pipeline • All Projects • Example - Project • Planning Applications • Example - Pre-commencement Site Meeting What is ISO 9001? ISO 9001 is a globally recognized standard for quality management. It helps organizations of all sizes and sectors to improve their performance, meet customer expectations and demonstrate their commitment to quality. Its requirements define how to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve a quality management system (QMS). Implementing ISO 9001 means your organization has put in place effective processes and trained staff to deliver flawless products or services time after time. Why is ISO 9001 important? With more than one million certificates issued to organizations in 189 countries, ISO 9001 is the most widely used quality management standard in the world. Within the ISO 9000 family, which defines seven quality management principles including a strong customer focus and continual improvement, ISO 9001 is the only standard that can be certified to (though certification is not mandatory). Business benefits include: Customer confidence: The standard ensures that organizations have robust quality control processes in place, leading to increased customer trust and satisfaction. Effective complaint resolution: ISO 9001 offers guidelines for resolving customer complaints efficiently, contributing to timely and satisfactory problem-solving. Process improvement: The standard helps identify and eliminate inefficiencies, reduce waste, streamline operations, and promote informed decision-making, resulting in cost savings and better outcomes. Ongoing optimization: Regular audits and reviews encouraged by ISO 9001 enable organizations to continually refine their quality management systems, stay competitive, and achieve long-term success. Foreword ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization. The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see www.iso.org/directives).

The committee responsible for this document is Technical Committee ISO/TC 176, Quality management and quality assurance, Subcommittee SC 2, Quality systems. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition (ISO 9001:2008), which has been technically revised, through the adoption of a revised clause sequence and the adaptation of the revised quality management principles and of new concepts. It also cancels and replaces the Technical Corrigendum ISO 9001:2008/Cor.1:2009. Introduction 0.1 General The adoption of a quality management system is a strategic decision for an organization that can help to improve its overall performance and provide a sound basis for sustainable development initiatives. The potential benefits to an organization of implementing a quality management system based on this International Standard are: a) the ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements; b) facilitating opportunities to enhance customer satisfaction; c) addressing risks and opportunities associated with its context and objectives; d) the ability to demonstrate conformity to specified quality management system requirements. This International Standard can be used by internal and external parties. It is not the intent of this International Standard to imply the need for: — uniformity in the structure of different quality management systems; — alignment of documentation to the clause structure of this International Standard; — the use of the specific terminology of this International Standard within the organization. The quality management system requirements specified in this International Standard are complementary to requirements for products and services. This International Standard employs the process approach, which incorporates the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle and risk-based thinking. The process approach enables an organization to plan its processes and their interactions. The PDCA cycle enables an organization to ensure that its processes are adequately resourced and managed, and that opportunities for improvement are determined and acted on. Risk-based thinking enables an organization to determine the factors that could cause its processes and its quality management system to deviate from the planned results, to put in place preventive controls to minimize negative effects and to make maximum use of opportunities as they arise (see Clause A.4). Consistently meeting requirements and addressing future needs and expectations poses a challenge for organizations in an increasingly dynamic and complex environment. To achieve this objective, the organization might find it necessary to adopt various forms of improvement in addition to correction and continual improvement, such as breakthrough change, innovation and re-organization. In this International Standard, the following verbal forms are used: — “shall” indicates a requirement; — “should” indicates a recommendation; — “may” indicates a permission; — “can” indicates a possibility or a capability. Information marked as “NOTE” is for guidance in understanding or clarifying the associated requirement. 0.2 Quality management principles This International Standard is based on the quality management principles described in ISO 9000. The descriptions include a statement of each principle, a rationale of why the principle is important for the organization, some examples of benefits associated with the principle and examples of typical actions to improve the organization’s performance when applying the principle. The quality management principles are: — customer focus; — leadership; — engagement of people; — process approach; — improvement; — evidence-based decision making; — relationship management. 0.3 Process approach 0.3.1 General This International Standard promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing, implementing and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system, to enhance customer satisfaction by meeting customer requirements. Specific requirements considered essential to the adoption of a process approach are included in 4.4. Understanding and managing interrelated processes as a system contributes to the organization’s effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its intended results. This approach enables the organization to control the interrelationships and interdependencies among the processes of the system, so that the overall performance of the organization can be enhanced. The process approach involves the systematic definition and management of processes, and their interactions, so as to achieve the intended results in accordance with the quality policy and strategic direction of the organization. Management of the processes and the system as a whole can be achieved using the PDCA cycle (see 0.3.2) with an overall focus on risk-based thinking (see 0.3.3) aimed at taking advantage of opportunities and preventing undesirable results. The application of the process approach in a quality management system enables: a) understanding and consistency in meeting requirements; b) the consideration of processes in terms of added value; c) the achievement of effective process performance; d) improvement of processes based on evaluation of data and information. Figure 1 gives a schematic representation of any process and shows the interaction of its elements. The monitoring and measuring check points, which are necessary for control, are specific to each process and will vary depending on the related risks. Figure 1 — Schematic representation of the elements of a single process 0.3.2 Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle The PDCA cycle can be applied to all processes and to the quality management system as a whole. Figure 2 illustrates how Clauses 4 to 10 can be grouped in relation to the PDCA cycle. Figure 2 — Representation of the structure of this International Standard in the PDCA cycle NOTE Numbers in brackets refer to the clauses in this International Standard. The PDCA cycle can be briefly described as follows: — Plan: establish the objectives of the system and its processes, and the resources needed to deliver results in accordance with customers’ requirements and the organization’s policies, and identify and address risks and opportunities; — Do: implement what was planned; — Check: monitor and (where applicable) measure processes and the resulting products and services against policies, objectives, requirements and planned activities, and report the results; — Act: take actions to improve performance, as necessary. 0.3.3 Risk-based thinking Risk-based thinking (see Clause A.4) is essential for achieving an effective quality management system. The concept of risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard including, for example, carrying out preventive action to eliminate potential nonconformities, analysing any nonconformities that do occur, and taking action to prevent recurrence that is appropriate for the effects of the nonconformity. To conform to the requirements of this International Standard, an organization needs to plan and implement actions to address risks and opportunities. Addressing both risks and opportunities establishes a basis for increasing the effectiveness of the quality management system, achieving improved results and preventing negative effects. Opportunities can arise as a result of a situation favourable to achieving an intended result, for example, a set of circumstances that allow the organization to attract customers, develop new products and services, reduce waste or improve productivity. Actions to address opportunities can also include consideration of associated risks. Risk is the effect of uncertainty and any such uncertainty can have positive or negative effects. A positive deviation arising from a risk can provide an opportunity, but not all positive effects of risk result in opportunities. 0.4 Relationship with other management system standards This International Standard applies the framework developed by ISO to improve alignment among its International Standards for management systems (see Clause A.1). This International Standard enables an organization to use the process approach, coupled with the PDCA cycle and risk-based thinking, to align or integrate its quality management system with the requirements of other management system standards. This International Standard relates to ISO 9000 and ISO 9004 as follows: — ISO 9000 Quality management systems — Fundamentals and vocabulary provides essential background for the proper understanding and implementation of this International Standard; — ISO 9004 Managing for the sustained success of an organization — A quality management approach provides guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond the requirements of this International Standard. Annex B provides details of other International Standards on quality management and quality management systems that have been developed by ISO/TC 176. This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems, such as those for environmental management, occupational health and safety management, or financial management. Sector-specific quality management system standards based on the requirements of this International Standard have been developed for a number of sectors. Some of these standards specify additional quality management system requirements, while others are limited to providing guidance to the application of this International Standard within the particular sector. A matrix showing the correlation between the clauses of this edition of this International Standard and the previous edition (ISO 9001:2008) can be found on the ISO/TC 176/SC 2 open access web site at: www.iso.org/tc176/sc02/public. 1 Scope This International Standard specifies requirements for a quality management system when an organization: a) needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and b) aims to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for improvement of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. All the requirements of this International Standard are generic and are intended to be applicable to any organization, regardless of its type or size, or the products and services it provides. NOTE 1 In this International Standard, the terms “product” or “service” only apply to products and services intended for, or required by, a customer. NOTE 2 Statutory and regulatory requirements can be expressed as legal requirements. 2 Normative references The following documents, in whole or in part, are normatively referenced in this document and are indispensable for its application.

Stages of Work Useful Links riba-stagesThere are key stages of work to every project from the inception through to completion, and even beyond. Understanding the various stages of a construction project, what happens at each stage, and then implementing this structure is fundamental to the success of a project. It is good practice for Architects to work in accordance with the most recent RIBA Plan of Work which sets out the various work stages as follows: 0 - Strategic Definition 1 - Preparation and Brief 2 - Concept Design 3 - Developed Design 4 - Technical Design Tendering 5 - Construction 6 - Handover and Close Out 7 - In Use riba-stages-0-red-squirrel-architects Stage 0 Pre-appointment: Following your initial enquiry – prior to being appointed – we will visit the site and meet with you to discuss the project and your requirements. In this initial meeting we will also discuss your budget, and timescales for the project; as well as explaining which services we can provide and which services are appropriate for your project. Following the initial meeting we will compile a fee proposal and a schedule of services which – if agreed – will form the basis of our appointment as your architect. Generally speaking we do not charge for services at the pre-appointment stage. Post appointment: Once appointed we will compile a more detailed project programme and we will formalise the ‘Strategic Brief’ for the project.

To create the model i used coffee sticks and stuck them together to create the illusion of timber, then i used a cardboard cutter to cut out curves, each layer getting thinner than the next, this also gave the impression of hills and natural geography. After the 1:100 model i began to think up new ideas to improve upon the origi- nal, I decided to expand on the idea of the pavilion being seemingly part of the earth, however i wanted it to stand out, so I did research on natural forms of the planet and was inspired by the Huangshan mountains of China and the beauti- ful muntainscapes they created. With that i started by creating natural mountain esc shapes (Fig 31.) and compared them to a human scale. I tried imagining them next to each other and how an elevation of the pavilion would look, idealy like a scenic view of a mountain range. I then proceeded to draw up the pavillion from different angles to see how it would look ideally, I then found that the indent of the curves of the walls made for good areas for curved seats encouraging social encounters and a friendlier design. The final design can be seen the floor plans and elevation sketches. When first thinking of a material to use, my emedient thaught to a natural, mountainscape looking pavilion was granite, however i found that the material wasnt that sustainable and hard to move around, so i researched a material recommended to me by my teacher which was rammed earth. Rammed earth involves compacting natural raw materials like earth, chalk, lime, or gravel. It is an ancient method that has recently been well-liked as a green building method. Compared to other construction methods that rely more heavily on cement and other chemicals, rammed earth structures are both strong- er and more environmentally friendly. Buildings made of rammed earth typically have little embodied energy and produce very little waste since they employ locally accessible resources. Subsoil usu- ally surrounds topsoil to safeguard it for agricultural use. Energy and transportation costs are decreased when the dirt removed to prepare a foundation may be reused. The most popular and environmentally friendly building material and method for creating sturdy structures today is rammed earth. The amount of cement used and how much of it is sourced locally will affect the material’s potential industrial impact because mined aggregates rather than “earth” are often used to con- struct rammed earth. The final model turned out just as the planning sketches had presented them, i used cardboard as my material, ideally i would have used a cement cast however im not too well versed in the materi- al so i chose an easier more flexible material, that being cardboard. i cut a slitted line pattern onto the cardboard to make it more flexible and created the curves to slit the seates in between. i placed the model onto a flat cardboard surface in order to show how the full pavilion would look. Here i used the 1:100 model as well as the site model to measure out and create a front and side elevation of my pavilion. I used a 1:100 scale ruler as well as pictures of the site to try visualise the location of my pa- vilion. I also added trees to further help realise the model in its context. I contemplated adding human figures to the drawings but ultimately didnt in fear that it would stand out too much compared to the pavilion.","output":"**Project Case Study: Canford Heath Pavilion** **Project Overview** The Canford Heath Pavilion, envisioned by R.D.M Architects, is a masterclass in harmonious design, where architecture complements the natural landscape, serving both as a landmark and a nurturer of community interaction. Inspired by the organic majesty of the Huangshan mountains, the Pavilion is not just a structure but a confluence of art, function, and environment. **Design Philosophy** The genesis of the Pavilion’s design evolved from an organic concept where timber layers, each progressively thinner, created a natural amphitheater of steps blending seamlessly with the terrain. These geologically inspired steps provided a multitude of social spaces without detracting from the natural beauty of Canford Heath and appeared as though they were a natural extension of the land. Initial modeling of the Pavilion was accomplished with humble coffee sticks and strategic cuts of cardboard, simulating the undulating forms of the earth and the gradual ascent of a mountainscape. The Pavilion's layers mirrored the rhythmic rise and fall of hills, while its curved contours formed niches reminiscent of the earth’s topographical variances. **Material Innovation** Originally, granite surfaced as the primary material consideration for its strength and aesthetic that echoed mountain facades. Yet, its sustainability was questioned. Upon further exploration, and a recommendation by a seasoned academic, R.D.M Architects decided upon rammed earth for its low environmental footprint and regional relevance. Rammed earth, with its tactile stratification and natural pigmentations, brought an ecological narrative to the project—a structure built from the earth, by the earth. This technique not only salvages the topsoil for continued agricultural use but also reduces energy and transportation dependencies by utilising the excavated materials from the foundation works, embodying R.D.M Architects' core sustainable ethos. **Design Features** Agile adaptations during the design process led to the inclusion of sweeping curves within the walls, creating congenial spaces for community gatherings. It was these curved recesses that spontaneously evolved into cozy seating areas, promoting an environment of social warmth and inclusivity. The Pavilion's final design, detailed in meticulous floor plans and elevations, presents the embodiment of an architectonic mountain range offering scenic views. While committed to its overarching ecological narrative, the Pavilion remains functional, aesthetically enriching, and culturally significant. **Model Realization** The Pavilion’s final model was a direct translation of the planning sketches—a testament to rigorous design methodologies employed by R.D.M Architects. Cardboard was chosen for its pliability, facilitating the crafting of the intricate curves and allowing for a slit pattern technique that introduced flexibility where required. This final model was then set amidst a contextual terrain of miniature trees without the addition of scale figures, maintaining the Pavilion’s aesthetic fidelity without undue distraction. **Conclusion** The Canford Heath Pavilion represents a step forward in design philosophy where integration with the natural environment is the cornerstone. Through its innovative use of materials like rammed earth and design that promotes social interaction, R.D.M Architects have reinforced their commitment to creating structures that are sustainable, functional, and visually harmonious within their settings."},{"instruction":"独自在古堡生活的剪刀手爱德华，被一位推销化妆品的女子佩格误闯城堡带回家后，与佩格的女儿相恋却无法在一起的悲剧童话故事。写几篇剪刀手爱德华有趣新奇的日记","output":"剪刀手爱德华有趣新奇的日记（一） 亲爱的日记， 今天，我遇到了一位专门推销化妆品的女子，她叫佩格。她非常热情地拜访了我的古堡，并误闯了我的领域。起初，我感到有些不安，不过很快我们就成了好朋友。她喜欢用各种奇怪的颜色涂抹在我那十分剪刀化的手指上，然后用她自己研制的化妆品打造出奇特的艺术品。我从来没有经历过这样的事情，但是它让我感到非常兴奋和幸福。 佩格有一个可爱的女儿，叫金妮。她是一位活泼可爱，充满好奇心的小姑娘。每次我和她见面，我都能看到她那双炯炯有神的大眼睛向我投来好奇的目光。我们会一起探索城堡的每个角落，她会告诉我关于城堡历史的有趣故事，而我则为她展示我的剪刀手艺术。虽然我们无法亲密接触，但我们的心始终是紧紧相连的。 然而，我很遗憾地告诉你，我们永远也不能真正地在一起。我的剪刀手不仅使我无法触摸任何东西，也成为了我们之间的隔阂。我可以感受到金妮对我的爱，但我无法回报她。这是一场悲剧，我深陷其中。 尽管如此，我依然感到幸运能够认识佩格和金妮。她们让我的生活变得丰富多彩，带给我无尽的欢笑和惊喜。我会珍惜和她们在一起的每一刻，尽管我们不能彼此拥抱，但我们的灵魂已经相互依存。 愿我的剪刀手艺和我们美好的回忆能够永远留在佩格和金妮的心中。 剪刀手爱德华 剪刀手爱德华有趣新奇的日记（二） 亲爱的日记， 今天，我又经历了一次让人心跳加速的冒险。我决定用我的剪刀手艺来帮助人们。有一位名叫格拉德斯的邻居喜欢养刺猬，但每次她想摸摸它们的刺，总是被戳痛。我想，或许我能帮到她。 于是，我小心翼翼地走进了她的花园。格拉德斯有些害怕地看着我，当我展示我的剪刀手艺时，她忍不住发出一声惊呼。尽管如此，她还是鼓起勇气，把手伸向我。我轻轻地用剪刀手剪下她跟刺猬刺接触到的部分，让她不再受伤。她欢呼雀跃起来，感激地抱住我。这是我第一次感受到像样的拥抱，尽管只是短暂的一刹那。 之后，更多的邻居们听说了我的剪刀手艺，纷纷前来向我求助。有人想夹住飞得太高的风筝线，有人想修剪叶子上的杂草，还有人希望我能为他们剪出一件独特的艺术品。我感到自己在这个小镇上变得无比重要，而这些人们的笑容则是我获得满足感的最好回报。 虽然我无法像普通人那样使用双手，但是我的剪刀手却给我带来了与众不同的人生。我将继续用我的剪刀手艺帮助他人，让他们感受到生活的美好和希望。 剪刀手爱德华 剪刀手爱德华有趣新奇的日记（三） 亲爱的日记， 今天，佩格邀请我去她家参加一场派对。这是我第一次参加这样的社交活动，我内心充满了紧张和兴奋。 派对上的每个人都穿着华丽的礼服，戴着华丽的饰品，对我来说简直像是一个童话般的世界。佩格一直拉着我参观了每一个房间，介绍每个人给我认识。虽然他们对我的剪刀手有些害怕，但他们的好奇心和善意充斥着整个房间。 舞池上，一个名叫约翰的绅士向我走了过来，邀请我和他一起跳舞。虽然我并不擅长舞蹈，但约翰一直带着微笑和耐心地教我跳舞的技巧。我们两个像是在享受一次特别的旋转和起伏的冒险。尽管我的剪刀手非常尴尬，但我们的舞姿却充满了自由和美感。 整个派对充满了快乐和欢笑。我在这里遇到了许多有趣的人，他们对我打开了心扉，接受了我的独特之处。我终于明白，尽管我的剪刀手让我与世界有所隔阂，但它也成为了我融入这个世界的通行证。我学会了用自己独特的方式与人交流，用我的剪刀手来创造美和快乐。 虽然这个派对结束了，但我将永远铭记着这个美好而又充满魔幻色彩的夜晚。我收获了许多宝贵的友谊和美好的回忆。我深深地感激佩格和她的家人，给了我一个独一无二的机会，让我有机会尽情展现我的剪刀手艺。 剪刀手爱德华"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: (angrily glancing at Yuri’s baby bump) “Well, it took YOU long enough to get here.

His death led to a power vacuum that ultimately allowed Major General Chun Doo-hwan (often spelled Jeon Doo-hwan) to seize power through a military coup in December 1979, followed by a series of events known as the Coup d'état of December Twelfth. It's speculative to consider what might have happened had Park Chung-hee remained alive. If he had continued his presidency and maintained a strong grip on power, it's possible that conditions for Chun Doo-hwan's rise to power might not have materialized in the same way. Park's rule was characterized by authoritarianism, and despite his assassination, there was an existing strong military influence within South Korean politics. Park Chung-hee's government had also faced significant public opposition and protest towards the end of his leadership. Moreover, historical contingencies are subject to a vast array of factors. The motivations and opportunities for Chun Doo-hwan to stage a coup were tied closely to political dynamics post-1979; without Park Chung-hee's assassination, these dynamics would have been quite different. Chun's ascent to power might have been less likely or might not have happened at all. Still, without detailed alternate history analysis (which is inherently speculative), it is difficult to convincingly argue what could have occurred in such a complex political landscape."},{"instruction":"BCP Council BCP Council - Civic Centre, Bourne Ave, Bournemouth BH2 6DY 15/10/2023 Dear Receiver, Expression of Interest in Canford Heath Building contest I hope this letter finds you well.

Mathe services Health and Safety At R.D.M Architects, we place the utmost importance on health and safety in every facet of our work. We prioritize the well-being of both the workforce involved in the construction process and the eventual occupants of our designed spaces. Our firm employs rigorous safety protocols that adhere to and often exceed statutory regulations and industry standards. We begin by ensuring that our designs conceptually integrate safety measures. This includes specifying non-toxic, fire-resistant materials, implementing adequate means of egress, and designing for natural surveillance and security. Our meticulous planning phase includes comprehensive risk assessments where potential hazards are identified and mitigated. Throughout the construction stage, we maintain a proactive stance on health and safety. We work closely with contractors to ensure that the construction sites are managed with diligence and attention to safe practices. Regular on-site reviews and audits are conducted to ensure continuous alignment with our stringent safety policies, and we swiftly address any issues that arise to prevent accidents and injuries. Approach to Sustainability Sustainability is not just a service — it’s the foundation upon which R.D.M Architects is built. We define sustainability as creating environments that are inherently resilient, resource-efficient, and harmonious with the natural world. Our approach integrates sustainable best practices throughout the project lifecycle, from concept to completion. Our methodology employs various sustainable strategies, including passive solar design, natural ventilation, energy and water efficient systems, and the use of renewable energy sources. Material selection follows strict eco-friendly criteria, prioritizing recycled, renewable, and low-impact resources that reduce the carbon footprint of our builds while enhancing the buildings’ performance. R.D.M Architects is a champion of green technologies. We actively seek and implement innovations such as building-integrated photovoltaics, rainwater harvesting systems, and living green walls. Through design, we aim to reduce operational energy demand and ensure that our buildings contribute positively to the surrounding ecological context. Social and Ethical Responsibility Our commitment to ethical practice is fundamental. We maintain transparency with our clients and collaborators, ensuring that all stakeholders are treated fairly and equitably throughout the project’s development. Our firm is dedicated to the economic empowerment of the communities in which we work by supporting local labor and materials whenever possible. We offer pro bono services to underserved communities and nonprofit organizations as part of our social responsibility. This enables us to contribute architectural expertise to causes that align with our firm’s values, helping to create accessible, safe, and sustainable buildings for those who need them most. Post Occupancy Evaluation Understanding the long-term impact of our architectural solutions is critical to R.D.M Architects. We engage in post-occupancy evaluations (POEs) to assess how our buildings perform and how they are used and experienced by occupants. This feedback loop informs our practice and fuels continuous improvement in our design process. Our POEs involve both quantitative and qualitative measures. We collect data on energy consumption, indoor air quality, and thermal comfort, among other metrics. Alongside this, we gather feedback from the building’s users to understand their experiences and satisfaction levels regarding the space’s functionality and aesthetics. These evaluations are not merely perfunctory checks; they are integral tools that allow us to validate and refine our sustainability strategies. The insights from POEs empower us to evolve our designs to be more responsive to human needs, environmentally responsible, and better performing over time. They are a testament to our commitment to delivering architecture that is both future-proof and flexible, adapting to the changing needs and expectations of those it serves. In conclusion, R.D.M Architects holds itself to the highest standards of health and safety, sustainability, social and ethical responsibility, and post-occupancy evaluation. These services are not isolated offerings but are interwoven threads that form the tapestry of our practice’s ethos. We are unwavering in our dedication to crafting spaces that are not only architectural achievements but also beacons of responsible and sustainable living, today and into the future. 2 LEARNING OUTCOME & ASSESSMENT On completion of this unit you will be able to demonstrate: Learning LO5 Professional & ethical practice: understanding of the context and role of the architect, including current and emerging trends and the business principles related to running a practice.

RIBA Chartered Practice Primer3 This guide explains the key requirements that the RIBA sets as standards for Chartered Practices to help practices considering Chartered Practice status to work towards and achieve compliance. The primer includes guidance on how practices can develop and implement the policies and processes required by the RIBA listed below including why they are important, what they are for, how to comply with minimum standards, and best practice that you may wish to consider: • Staff composition and business structure • Employment • Equality, diversity and inclusion • Quality management • Environmental management • Health and safety • Dispute resolution • Insurance • CPD Template policies and systems for each of these issues can be found in the RIBA Chartered Practice Toolbox, available to all RIBA Chartered Practices, and those joining the scheme, through the RIBA Membership Team. The guide is informed by three books published recently by the RIBA, all of which make excellent reading for a new practice who want to start off on the right track and set up best practice project and business management systems and processes: • Small Practice and the Sole Practitioner by Marianne Davys • Small Projects Handbook by Nigel Ostime • Starting a Practice: A Plan of Work (2nd ed) by Simon Foxell Each of these publications contain sections on practice or project finances. A fourth publication Financial Management by Brian Pinder-Ayres provides more detail on this subject Introduction Best Practice Financial management basics: The RIBA recommends taking the following actions regarding financial management as soon as possible: • Do a cashflow of at least 6 months ahead, this should show all likely receipts and expenditure together with a running total; • Ensure you know what it costs you to perform work and produce sensible fee bids using costed resource schedules; and • Record what you do and know what the final outturn cost will be on all your projects. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer4 Strong leadership is paramount in any organisation. The RIBA requires our practices to be led by RIBA Chartered Members whose professional competence, integrity and relationships has been assured and demonstrated through their professional education, development and standards. Members must reach a high standard of professional conduct and performance. To facilitate this, Chartered Practices must abide by The RIBA Code of Practice for Chartered Practices, which is based on the three principles of our Code of Conduct for individuals of honesty and integrity, competence, and relationships. Following the guidelines will enable members to provide a service that meets the exacting standards of the Code. Guidance included with the Code of Practice provides a framework for the resolution of any misunderstandings or disputes that may arise between Chartered Practices and their clients, co-professionals and others they encounter through their professional obligations. As explained above, this guide covers the additional requirements that make up the professional aspects of the criteria for Chartered Practices. The processes explained below provide clear and accessible advice on adopting a best practice approach which will be widely applicable to a range of scenarios. For each of them a template policy can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Why do we set standards? RIBA Chartered Practice Primer5 For the broad protection of society and clients in the UK, the Architects Act (1997) requires all Architects’ practices to operate under the control and management of an ARB registered architect, who does not act at the same time in a similar capacity for any other organisation. The Act also requires that all work relating to architecture is carried out by or under the supervision of an ARB registered architect. To provide a high level of quality assurance, the architects controlling/managing an RIBA Chartered Practice and undertaking/overseeing the architectural work must be Chartered Members of the RIBA. The RIBA sets the minimum number of Chartered Members required per Chartered Practice relative to the total number of staff to achieve the minimum professional management and supervision requirements to deliver a high standard of service. When first setting up in practice, you will need to decide on your company structure. Very small practices will normally be Sole Traders or Limited Liability Companies, Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships are also used. The RIBA advises taking processional legal and financial advice before deciding on a company structure. Guidance can also be found at Companies House. Staff composition and Business structure Chartered Practice Criteria The office is a full-time architects’ office, or, a definable architectural practice business unit within a multi-functional organisation, with responsibility to ensure all practice information submitted to the RIBA is up to date and accurate. At least one of the full–time principals (Director or Partner) in the architects’ office must be a Chartered Member of the RIBA. All architectural work must be under the personal supervision of an RIBA Chartered Architect and arrangements in place to ensure work is covered in the event of their absence. RIBA Chartered Practices must meet a quality assurance standard of staff bound by a relevant code of conduct. This is based on: a minimum of 1:10 staff being Chartered Members of the RIBA; and a minimum 1:8 staff being either Registered Architects, Associate Members of the RIBA, or Affiliate Members of the RIBA. Best Practice Innovation under supervision: Consider how your processes of project supervision and design review will allow junior staff to learn and innovate within a safety net that assures the quality of your practice’s outputs. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer6 As soon as you make the decision to expand your practice beyond yourself - as a sole practitioner or the original partners – to take on a member of staff, you will need to follow employment legislation. The RIBA Chartered Practice Employment Policy Guide sets out the key requirements in a simple checklist based on the principles of UK legislation; UK Government has clear guidance and tools for employing people. International practices must also follow the RIBA Checklist but will also need to be aware of any requirements which conflict with or go beyond their national legislation. To ensure that all staff working for an RIBA Chartered Practice earn a wage that meets the costs of living, the RIBA requires that all staff, including freelance staff and students are paid at least the Real Living Wage, as set by the Living Wage Foundation. In order to maintain competitive levels of pay across all levels in the profession, the RIBA Business Benchmarking Survey for Chartered Practices provides data on the average salaries of all staff levels. Employment Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must operate an Employment Policy which addresses the requirements of the RIBA Chartered Practice Employment Policy Guide This can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Enhanced employee benefits: The RIBA Chartered Practice Employment Policy Guide provides advice on additional benefits that practices may wish to consider to help improve employee satisfaction, teamwork and productivity. For more detail on the average earnings, fringe benefits and total remuneration packages being received by architects throughout the industry the RIBA and the Fees Bureau publish an annual Architects Earnings report, check the RIBA Journal for the latest articles on the results of this survey. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer7 Inclusive workplaces make architecture a fairer place for all employees, widen the pool of talent, and strengthen the profession’s effectiveness and performance. The most successful practices demonstrate that a diverse workforce and inclusive working procedures can play an important part in improving productivity and make good business sense. Benefits of this can include: • improved talent attraction and retention – people who feel respected and valued are more likely to join, stay with and perform better at an inclusive organisation; • enhanced reputation – a competitive point of difference in the market attracts clients; • diversity of thought and background – greater creativity, innovation and even constructive disagreements lead to better architecture; • greater insight into client and user needs – design is informed by and directly relevant to the people inhabiting the spaces; • better service delivery – inclusive working arrangements support better employee performance; and • compliance – an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy helps employers and service providers to meet their legal responsibilities, in the UK these can be found in The Equality Act 2010. Chartered Practices must have and maintain an appropriate Equality Diversity and Inclusion Policy, which is regularly monitored. An action plan will help you achieve your Equality, Diversity and Inclusion goals in practice. The RIBA recognises that a significant proportion of Chartered Practices do not have any employees, although they may, on occasion, employ people on a temporary or ad-hoc basis. We recommended that your policy is fit for purpose and has the flexibility to adapt to changes in circumstances. Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must ensure that an appropriate Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy is in place and operational. Guidance and templates can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Social purpose and leadership: Discover the RIBA Practice Role Models, case studies about organisations that exercise a positive impact – on their people, their clients, the profession and wider society. None claim to be perfect, but there are things to be learnt from each. They are intended to provoke a profession- wide debate about what it means to be a successful RIBA Chartered Practice. The RIBA has defined the nine characteristics of a practice role model. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion RIBA Chartered Practice Primer8 Any project is a journey and becomes easier to envisage, plan and execute with a good map. What is true for a project is also true for your practice; having a management system for various functions means that the wheel need not be constantly reinvented and that consistent ways of working can be understood and adopted by everyone. When things don’t go quite according to plan on a journey, a map can become a life-saver as it allows you to find a way out of trouble – you can find where you are and then plot a route around the problem. The RIBA believes that quality management is core to the success of a business in providing quality assurance which accords with the RIBA Chartered Practice scheme. All RIBA Chartered Practices are required to have an appropriate Quality Management System (QMS). This system provides a map specifically designed for the business of architecture and will enable your practice to establish a formal QMS. Leadership is essential to running an effective QMS. Directors/Partners (and senior managers) establish unity of purpose and direction of the practice. They should create and maintain the collaborative environment that enables staff to become fully involved in achieving the practice’s objectives. Quality Management Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must operate a Quality Management System, relevant to the size of practice. • Small practices (up to 10 staff) are required to prepare a Project Quality Plan (PQP) for each project. • Medium practices (11 to 50 staff) are required to operate a Quality Management System that covers all project and practice procedures. • Large practices (51+ staff) are required to adopt an externally certified ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System or be working towards having one. Guidance and templates can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox Best Practice Quality assurance accreditation: Developing a full QMS that is externally accredited to BS EN ISO 9001:2015 will help demonstrate to clients that you manage the quality of your work and processes to an internationally recognised standard and improve your success at pre-qualification stage in public sector work. To achieve accreditation, it is likely that you will need help from a quality assurance professional, RIBA members can speak to an RIBA Specialist Practice Consultant for more information: 020 7307 3600 RIBA Chartered Practice Primer9 Clearly, the output of a practice will have a great impact on the environment, when considering the life of the buildings designed by the practice. RIBA Chartered Practices are required to have an Environmental Management Policy to establish a common approach to minimising environmental impact on projects and in the practice. This approach will bring many benefits, including: • internal buy in – formalising an approach to reducing the environmental impact of architecture in a policy helps to provide a framework for internal communication; a written policy ensures that design discussions are underpinned by a common understanding of environmental aspirations, obligations and targets; • clarifying processes – all good designers will naturally have a positive attitude to environmental issues built into their thinking. Writing these values? down helps to share your goals, allows others to input into processes and, with constructive criticism, can identify how environmental objectives can be better integrated into your work; • communicating to clients – success rates in public procurement, bids and informal conversations with clients, consultants, local authorities and others can be improved by communicating robust environmental policies. Ensuring that your environmental agenda is clear, transparent and legible can instil confidence in how you talk about, deliver, and how others perceive, your approach; and • driving improvements – an environmental policy is not a fixed position. It is a working frame of reference. Periodically reviewing and developing the policy to reflect legislative changes, developments in your own thinking and that of wider industry will enable constant improvements to design work and operational procedures. Environmental Management Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must ensure that an appropriate Environmental Management Policy is in place and operational. Guidance and a template can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Whole life thinking: Consider how your practice will encompass environmental, social and economic sustainability throughout the organisation, your architecture and research so that your work is energy and resource efficient, enduring and meets a real need. Challenge yourself and others to innovate, and question current working practices and whole life thinking – including your clients, contractors and the supply chain. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer10 Health and Safety is a fundamental consideration for all architects and designers. It should be part of everyday working - activity inside the office and on every project. There is both a legal and professional responsibility to understand and apply health and safety principles at all times. Architects have further responsibilities, both legal and moral, to help reduce the devastating impact of construction activity on the workforce of the industry. 50 construction workers per year are killed at work and 100 times that later in life from chronic health conditions resulting from their work on site. A Health and Safety policy should set out the standards and principles for your practice so that these can be communicated to clients and staff. To be effective, the Health and Safety policy of any Chartered Practice must address the specific needs and requirements of that practice, its staff and its work. It is important that all staff are familiar with the contents of the policy and refer to it when appropriate. If staff members are in any doubt about the application or requirements at any time they must raise these concerns with their manager. Health and Safety Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must ensure that an appropriate Health & Safety Policy is in place and operational. Guidance and a template can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Health and safety project leadership: The RIBA Health and Safety Policy Guide includes guidance on the Construction (Design and Management) (CDM) Regulations 2015 which introduced the role of Principal Designer. The RIBA supports the Health and Safety Executive’s position that the most appropriate organisation to fulfil the duties of the Principal Designer and make the most effective contribution to positive health and safety on the design of a project is the lead designer, which is likely to be the architecture practice, rather than a separate consultant. To improve your knowledge and confidence to undertake this role, you can read the RIBA’s detailed guidance on CDM 2015 and consider taking a course. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer11 The RIBA acknowledges that, on occasion, Chartered Practices may fall short of the exacting standards of the Code. In order to deal with possible breaches of the Code, and other concerns, the RIBA has established a clear and equitable process for dealing with complaints against Chartered Practices. The Institute also accepts that misunderstandings and disputes can arise between Chartered Practices and their clients, co-professionals and others they encounter through their professional obligations, but that these often do not amount to a breach of the Code. The RIBA has therefore also implemented a series of dispute resolution processes to assist parties in resolving these matters. Dispute Resolution and Professional Indemnity Insurance Chartered Practice Criteria As part of the Code of Practice, practices are required to have in place a written complaint handling procedure. Guidance can be found with the Code of Practice. Best Practice Responsibility and professionalism: Most disputes are caused by a failure to communicate, complete actions, deliver services or behave in ways that are expected or have been agreed upon. Contractual duties are most clear to understand in standard forms of agreement (like RIBA contracts and agreements) while your duty of care in Tort will go beyond the terms of a contract. For detailed but concise guidance refer to the RIBA publication Avoiding and Resolving Disputes: A Short Guide for Architects by Bart Kavanagh. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer12 Appropriate Professional Insurance is a requirement for architects in the UK. Starting at £250,000 at the least (as required by the ARB), practices may need more cover dependent on the type of projects they work on. Allegations of professional negligence often involve complex and detailed issues, and litigation may be expensive and traumatic. During your career, should a claim be made against you, your insurer should support you throughout this process. For more information on Professional Indemnity Insurance, visit the RIBA Insurance Agency, the only PII broker recommended by the RIBA. Insurance Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must hold Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) cover appropriate for the work undertaken by the practice, or an equivalent form of insurance if operating outside of the UK. Guidance on PII and risk management can be found from the RIBA Insurance Agency. Best Practice Additional insurance: The RIBA recommends that practices assess they may face and have appropriate insurance to protect the business and specialist advice is sought. Beyond the requirement for Professional Indemnity Insurance, you may need insurance to cover the following: • Employers liability (a legal requirement as an employer) • Premises and contents insurance • Public liability insurance • Cyber liability insurance • Health and accident insurance • Travel insurance • Motor insurance • Insurance for specific items such as ICT and other equipment. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer13 The practice must operate a management system to ensure that architects in this office adhere to the RIBA Code of Professional Conduct and comply with Continuing Professional Development obligations. Doing CPD helps you to remain competent, professional, capable and resilient as an architect. It enables RIBA members to achieve better outcomes and run better businesses. CPD also helps you to contend with disruption and to face current and future challenges as well as learn new skills and specialisms. RIBA Chartered Practices must provide the opportunity for all staff members (not just RIBA Chartered Members) to undertake CPD so that your practice can develop its knowledge. Easy compliance with this requirement can be achieved by creating a structured framework for your team’s continual learning, with a member of staff being responsible for organising CPD. CPD Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must operate a management system to ensure that architects in this office adhere to the RIBA Code of Professional Conduct and comply with Continuing Professional Development obligations. Guidance can be found on the RIBA CPD webpages. Best Practice Research and career learning: Research can be an essential part of a practice’s approach to working and can form an important element of the service offer to clients. Consider whether gaining new knowledge and information might be a significant part of your working method and how you disseminate the results internally, to your clients and to the wider profession or industry.

ISO 9001 is a globally recognized standard for quality management. It helps organizations of all sizes and sectors to improve their performance, meet customer expectations and demonstrate their commitment to quality. Its requirements define how to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve a quality management system (QMS). Implementing ISO 9001 means your organization has put in place effective processes and trained staff to deliver flawless products or services time after time. Why is ISO 9001 important? With more than one million certificates issued to organizations in 189 countries, ISO 9001 is the most widely used quality management standard in the world. Within the ISO 9000 family, which defines seven quality management principles including a strong customer focus and continual improvement, ISO 9001 is the only standard that can be certified to (though certification is not mandatory). Business benefits include: Customer confidence: The standard ensures that organizations have robust quality control processes in place, leading to increased customer trust and satisfaction. Effective complaint resolution: ISO 9001 offers guidelines for resolving customer complaints efficiently, contributing to timely and satisfactory problem-solving. Process improvement: The standard helps identify and eliminate inefficiencies, reduce waste, streamline operations, and promote informed decision-making, resulting in cost savings and better outcomes. Ongoing optimization: Regular audits and reviews encouraged by ISO 9001 enable organizations to continually refine their quality management systems, stay competitive, and achieve long-term success. Foreword ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization. The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see www.iso.org/directives).

The committee responsible for this document is Technical Committee ISO/TC 176, Quality management and quality assurance, Subcommittee SC 2, Quality systems. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition (ISO 9001:2008), which has been technically revised, through the adoption of a revised clause sequence and the adaptation of the revised quality management principles and of new concepts. It also cancels and replaces the Technical Corrigendum ISO 9001:2008/Cor.1:2009. Introduction 0.1 General The adoption of a quality management system is a strategic decision for an organization that can help to improve its overall performance and provide a sound basis for sustainable development initiatives. The potential benefits to an organization of implementing a quality management system based on this International Standard are: a) the ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements; b) facilitating opportunities to enhance customer satisfaction; c) addressing risks and opportunities associated with its context and objectives; d) the ability to demonstrate conformity to specified quality management system requirements. This International Standard can be used by internal and external parties. It is not the intent of this International Standard to imply the need for: — uniformity in the structure of different quality management systems; — alignment of documentation to the clause structure of this International Standard; — the use of the specific terminology of this International Standard within the organization. The quality management system requirements specified in this International Standard are complementary to requirements for products and services. This International Standard employs the process approach, which incorporates the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle and risk-based thinking. The process approach enables an organization to plan its processes and their interactions. The PDCA cycle enables an organization to ensure that its processes are adequately resourced and managed, and that opportunities for improvement are determined and acted on. Risk-based thinking enables an organization to determine the factors that could cause its processes and its quality management system to deviate from the planned results, to put in place preventive controls to minimize negative effects and to make maximum use of opportunities as they arise (see Clause A.4). Consistently meeting requirements and addressing future needs and expectations poses a challenge for organizations in an increasingly dynamic and complex environment. To achieve this objective, the organization might find it necessary to adopt various forms of improvement in addition to correction and continual improvement, such as breakthrough change, innovation and re-organization. In this International Standard, the following verbal forms are used: — “shall” indicates a requirement; — “should” indicates a recommendation; — “may” indicates a permission; — “can” indicates a possibility or a capability. Information marked as “NOTE” is for guidance in understanding or clarifying the associated requirement. 0.2 Quality management principles This International Standard is based on the quality management principles described in ISO 9000. The descriptions include a statement of each principle, a rationale of why the principle is important for the organization, some examples of benefits associated with the principle and examples of typical actions to improve the organization’s performance when applying the principle. The quality management principles are: — customer focus; — leadership; — engagement of people; — process approach; — improvement; — evidence-based decision making; — relationship management. 0.3 Process approach 0.3.1 General This International Standard promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing, implementing and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system, to enhance customer satisfaction by meeting customer requirements. Specific requirements considered essential to the adoption of a process approach are included in 4.4. Understanding and managing interrelated processes as a system contributes to the organization’s effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its intended results. This approach enables the organization to control the interrelationships and interdependencies among the processes of the system, so that the overall performance of the organization can be enhanced. The process approach involves the systematic definition and management of processes, and their interactions, so as to achieve the intended results in accordance with the quality policy and strategic direction of the organization. Management of the processes and the system as a whole can be achieved using the PDCA cycle (see 0.3.2) with an overall focus on risk-based thinking (see 0.3.3) aimed at taking advantage of opportunities and preventing undesirable results. The application of the process approach in a quality management system enables: a) understanding and consistency in meeting requirements; b) the consideration of processes in terms of added value; c) the achievement of effective process performance; d) improvement of processes based on evaluation of data and information. Figure 1 gives a schematic representation of any process and shows the interaction of its elements. The monitoring and measuring check points, which are necessary for control, are specific to each process and will vary depending on the related risks. Figure 1 — Schematic representation of the elements of a single process 0.3.2 Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle The PDCA cycle can be applied to all processes and to the quality management system as a whole. Figure 2 illustrates how Clauses 4 to 10 can be grouped in relation to the PDCA cycle. Figure 2 — Representation of the structure of this International Standard in the PDCA cycle NOTE Numbers in brackets refer to the clauses in this International Standard. The PDCA cycle can be briefly described as follows: — Plan: establish the objectives of the system and its processes, and the resources needed to deliver results in accordance with customers’ requirements and the organization’s policies, and identify and address risks and opportunities; — Do: implement what was planned; — Check: monitor and (where applicable) measure processes and the resulting products and services against policies, objectives, requirements and planned activities, and report the results; — Act: take actions to improve performance, as necessary. 0.3.3 Risk-based thinking Risk-based thinking (see Clause A.4) is essential for achieving an effective quality management system. The concept of risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard including, for example, carrying out preventive action to eliminate potential nonconformities, analysing any nonconformities that do occur, and taking action to prevent recurrence that is appropriate for the effects of the nonconformity. To conform to the requirements of this International Standard, an organization needs to plan and implement actions to address risks and opportunities. Addressing both risks and opportunities establishes a basis for increasing the effectiveness of the quality management system, achieving improved results and preventing negative effects. Opportunities can arise as a result of a situation favourable to achieving an intended result, for example, a set of circumstances that allow the organization to attract customers, develop new products and services, reduce waste or improve productivity. Actions to address opportunities can also include consideration of associated risks. Risk is the effect of uncertainty and any such uncertainty can have positive or negative effects. A positive deviation arising from a risk can provide an opportunity, but not all positive effects of risk result in opportunities. 0.4 Relationship with other management system standards This International Standard applies the framework developed by ISO to improve alignment among its International Standards for management systems (see Clause A.1). This International Standard enables an organization to use the process approach, coupled with the PDCA cycle and risk-based thinking, to align or integrate its quality management system with the requirements of other management system standards. This International Standard relates to ISO 9000 and ISO 9004 as follows: — ISO 9000 Quality management systems — Fundamentals and vocabulary provides essential background for the proper understanding and implementation of this International Standard; — ISO 9004 Managing for the sustained success of an organization — A quality management approach provides guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond the requirements of this International Standard. Annex B provides details of other International Standards on quality management and quality management systems that have been developed by ISO/TC 176. This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems, such as those for environmental management, occupational health and safety management, or financial management. Sector-specific quality management system standards based on the requirements of this International Standard have been developed for a number of sectors. Some of these standards specify additional quality management system requirements, while others are limited to providing guidance to the application of this International Standard within the particular sector. A matrix showing the correlation between the clauses of this edition of this International Standard and the previous edition (ISO 9001:2008) can be found on the ISO/TC 176/SC 2 open access web site at: www.iso.org/tc176/sc02/public. 1 Scope This International Standard specifies requirements for a quality management system when an organization: a) needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and b) aims to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for improvement of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. All the requirements of this International Standard are generic and are intended to be applicable to any organization, regardless of its type or size, or the products and services it provides. NOTE 1 In this International Standard, the terms “product” or “service” only apply to products and services intended for, or required by, a customer. NOTE 2 Statutory and regulatory requirements can be expressed as legal requirements. 2 Normative references The following documents, in whole or in part, are normatively referenced in this document and are indispensable for its application.

Stages of Work Useful Links riba-stagesThere are key stages of work to every project from the inception through to completion, and even beyond. Understanding the various stages of a construction project, what happens at each stage, and then implementing this structure is fundamental to the success of a project. It is good practice for Architects to work in accordance with the most recent RIBA Plan of Work which sets out the various work stages as follows: 0 - Strategic Definition 1 - Preparation and Brief 2 - Concept Design 3 - Developed Design 4 - Technical Design Tendering 5 - Construction 6 - Handover and Close Out 7 - In Use riba-stages-0-red-squirrel-architects Stage 0 Pre-appointment: Following your initial enquiry – prior to being appointed – we will visit the site and meet with you to discuss the project and your requirements. In this initial meeting we will also discuss your budget, and timescales for the project; as well as explaining which services we can provide and which services are appropriate for your project. Following the initial meeting we will compile a fee proposal and a schedule of services which – if agreed – will form the basis of our appointment as your architect. Generally speaking we do not charge for services at the pre-appointment stage. Post appointment: Once appointed we will compile a more detailed project programme and we will formalise the ‘Strategic Brief’ for the project.

To troubleshoot this issue, ensure that you have entered the formula correctly. If the formula is entered correctly and you are still seeing the error, it might be due to language settings or due to an older version of Excel that does not support the IF function. In some versions of Excel, the function names may be translated based on your language settings. For example, in some non-English versions, the IF function may be called something different, like \\"SI\\" (in Spanish) or \\"ALS\\" (in German). To resolve this, try using the appropriate translated function if available, or switch your Excel language settings to English (or the relevant language) to use the standard function names. If you are using an older version of Excel that does not support the IF function, you might need to use a different approach, such as nested IF statements or an alternative function that accomplishes the same goal. If none of these solutions work, please provide additional information or detail any error messages you receive for further assistance."},{"instruction":"compare date in excel","output":"To compare dates in Excel, you can use various comparison operators such as \\"<\\" (less than), \\">\\" (greater than), \\"<=\\" (less than or equal to), \\">=\\" (greater than or equal to), \\"=\\" (equal to), \\"<>\\" (not equal to), etc. Here's an example using the \\"IF\\" function to compare dates: Assuming the date in cell E2 and B2 is formatted as a date, you can use the following formula in any other cell, like C2, to compare the dates: =IF(E2>B2, \\"Yes\\", \\"\\") This formula will display \\"Yes\\" in cell C2 if the date in cell E2 is after the date in cell B2; otherwise, it will display nothing (an empty string).

If the formula is not working as expected, there might be different reasons causing this issue. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try: 1. Check the cell formatting: Confirm that the date format in cells E2 and B2 is consistent and recognized as dates by Excel. You can format the cells as dates by selecting them, right-clicking, choosing Format Cells, and selecting the desired date format. 2. Check for any extra spaces: Ensure that there are no leading or trailing spaces in the cell values. Sometimes, extra spaces can affect date comparisons. You can use the TRIM function to remove any leading or trailing spaces: =IF(TRIM(E2)>TRIM(B2), \\"Yes\\", \\"\\") 3. Use the DATEVALUE function: If the dates in cells E2 and B2 are in text format and not recognized as dates, you can use the DATEVALUE function to convert them into date values before comparing: =IF(DATEVALUE(E2)>DATEVALUE(B2), \\"Yes\\", \\"\\") 4. Consider the regional date format: If you are using a non-US regional setting in Excel, you might need to adjust the date format. In some cases, the date separator could be a different character instead of \\"/\\".

CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override) позволяет вам настроить webpack и другие аспекты Create React App (CRA) без необходимости \\"eject\\" - выполнять команду, которая выводит все конфигурационные файлы и зависимости в ваш проект, делая их доступными для редактирования напрямую. Чтобы ускорить сборку проекта с использованием CRACO, вот несколько общих советов: 1. **Оптимизация зависимостей:** - Удалите неиспользуемые библиотеки и компоненты. - Обновите зависимости до последних версий, так как они могут содержать оптимизации производительности. 2. **Кэширование:** - Воспользуйтесь кэшированием как в webpack, так и в babel-loader. CRACO позволяет вам настраивать эти опции. - Используйте hard-source-webpack-plugin для кэширования результатов сборки между запусками. 3. **Оптимизация Babel:** - Используйте \`babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types\` для удаления PropTypes из production-сборки. - Ограничьте количество полифиллов и плагинов babel, которые вы используете, особенно если вы целитесь в современные браузеры. 4. **Code Splitting:** - Разделяйте ваш код на чанки с помощью dynamic \`import()\`, чтобы ускорить начальную загрузку приложения. - Используйте Lazy Loading компонентов, чтобы загружать их по мере необходимости. 5. **Вебпак модули:** - Установите \`optimization.splitChunks\` в своей конфигурации CRACO для улучшения долговременного кэширования и уменьшения размеров чанков. 6. **Анализ сборки:** - Используйте инструменты для анализа вебпак-сборки, такие как \`webpack-bundle-analyzer\`, чтобы найти и устранить узкие места. 7. **Минификация и сжатие:** - Убедитесь, что в процессе сборки используется эффективная минификация JavaScript и CSS. - Используйте сжатие ресурсов, такое как Gzip или Brotli. 8. **Эксперименты с многопоточностью:** - Опробуйте parallel-webpack или thread-loader, чтобы распараллелить процесс сборки. 9. **Инкрементальное сборка:** - Рассмотрите возможность использования инкрементальных сборок, например, с помощью Webpack's watch mode, чтобы ускорить процесс разработки. 10. **Настройка craco.config.js:** - Используйте CRACO для настройки webpack конфигурации, чтобы включить вышеописанные оптимизации. Вы можете напрямую изменить webpack конфиг в \`craco.config.js\`. Всегда тестируйте ваше приложение после каждого изменения конфигурации, чтобы убедиться, что вы не сломали ничего в процессе оптимизации. Имейте в виду, что некоторые оптимизации могут быть более или менее эффективными в зависимости от вашего конкретного проекта."},{"instruction":"parallel-webpack как добавить в craco-build","output":"\`parallel-webpack\` позволяет выполнять множество сборок webpack в параллельных потоках, что может ускорить процесс сборки, особенно если у вас есть несколько конфигураций webpack, которые можно собирать независимо друг от друга. Однако, если у вас обычный проект на Create React App (CRA), задействующий одну конфигурацию webpack, то \`parallel-webpack\` может не принести значительного выигрыша в скорости. Добавить \`parallel-webpack\` в процесс сборки при использовании CRACO может быть не тривиально, поскольку CRA и CRACO уже имеют предопределенные конфигурации, которые не предполагают параллельной сборки \\"из коробки\\". Тем не менее, если вы решите попытаться интегрировать \`parallel-webpack\` с CRACO, вашими действиями могли бы стать: 1. Установить \`parallel-webpack\`: \`\`\`sh npm install parallel-webpack --save-dev \`\`\` 2. Создать несколько конфигураций webpack, которые вы хотите собрать параллельно, и указать их в файле конфигурации \`parallel-webpack\`. 3. Настроить npm скрипт для запуска \`parallel-webpack\` вместо обычной команды сборки CRACO. Однако, поскольку CRACO используется для настройки конкретных аспектов CRA, включая webpack, babel и другие, интеграция \`parallel-webpack\` потребует от вас выяснить, как генерировать необходимые конфигурации webpack из вашего \`craco.config.js\` и обеспечить их совместимость с \`parallel-webpack\`. Для большинства проектов на CRA, использование \`parallel-webpack\` для ускорения сборки может быть избыточным. Вам будет лучше смотреть в сторону оптимизаций, рассмотренных в предыдущем ответе, таких как code splitting, минификация, использование кэширования и другие. Если вы все еще рассматриваете использование \`parallel-webpack\`, можно рекомендовать вместо этого испытать \`thread-loader\` или другие встроенные в webpack опции для распараллеливания процесса сборки."},{"instruction":"как добавить thread-loader в craco и что это","output":"\`thread-loader\` - это загрузчик для webpack, который распараллеливает обработку модулей, выполняя обработчики загрузчиков (loaders) в worker pool (рабочем пуле). Это может ускорить процесс сборки, особенно если у вас большие и ресурсоемкие задачи, выполняемые загрузчиками, такими как \`babel-loader\` или \`ts-loader\`. Чтобы добавить \`thread-loader\` в ваш проект с использованием CRACO, вам нужно установить сам \`thread-loader\`, а затем модифицировать ваш \`craco.config.js\` файл для того, чтобы добавить \`thread-loader\` в цепочку обработки модулей webpack. 1. Установка \`thread-loader\`: \`\`\`sh npm install thread-loader --save-dev \`\`\` 2. Обновление \`craco.config.js\`: Допустим, вы хотите добавить \`thread-loader\` к обработке файлов JavaScript/TypeScript перед \`babel-loader\`. Ваш \`craco.config.js\` может выглядеть примерно так: \`\`\`javascript const { whenProd } = require(\\"@craco/craco\\"); module.exports = { webpack: { configure: (webpackConfig, { env, paths }) => { // Находим правило, отвечающее за обработку js и jsx файлов const jsRule = webpackConfig.module.rules.find( (rule) => rule.oneOf ).oneOf.find( (r) => r.test && (r.test.toString().includes('js|jsx') || r.test.toString().includes('ts|tsx')) ); if (jsRule) { // Добавляем thread-loader перед babel-loader jsRule.use.unshift({ loader: require.resolve('thread-loader'), options: { // number of jobs a worker processes in parallel // can be reduced for an SSD to say 1 or 2 workers: require('os').cpus().length - 1, // Возможно, требуется настройка. }, }); } // Возвращаем модифицированный webpackConfig return webpackConfig; }, }, }; \`\`\` В примере выше мы добавляем \`thread-loader\` в начало списка загрузчиков (loaders) для обработки JavaScript и TypeScript файлов, если мы нашли правильное правило. **Примечание**: Для продакшн-сборки можно сделать эту изменение только в продуктивной среде с помощью условий \`whenProd\`. Это может быть полезным, чтобы избежать дополнительных затрат на спинап потоков во время разработки. 3. После внесения изменений, запустите вашу сборку как обычно: \`\`\`sh npm run build \`\`\` Или для запуска в режиме разработки: \`\`\`sh npm start \`\`\` Обязательно тестируйте изменения в конфигурации, чтобы убедиться, что они работают в вашем окружении, и вы получаете ожидаемую выгоду в производительности. В некоторых случаях добавление \`thread-loader\` может не дать заметного прироста производительности или даже может замедлить сборку, особенно для небольших проектов или на системах с ограниченными ресурсами (например, с небольшим количеством процессорных ядер или ограниченным объемом ОЗУ)."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, there is a missing step for deleting a node with two children. When you replace the deleted node's data with its inorder successor's data, you also have to delete the inorder successor itself, which may have a right child. Here is the vital part of the \`Delete\` function that needs some adjustment: \`\`\`cpp // Else node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest // in the right subtree) Node* temp = minValueNode(root->right); // Copy the inorder successor's data into this node root->data = temp->data; // Delete the inorder successor root->right = Delete(root->right, temp->data); \`\`\` You are already doing this part correctly. However, what is critical is that we properly update the parent pointer of the right child of the inorder successor, if it exists. This is correctly handled by the \`Delete\` function when it is recursively called on \`root->right\`. The key is to ensure that the \`minValueNode\` function's returned node always has the correct \`parent\` reference for your AVL tree to work as expected, with all parent-child relationships properly maintained. It looks like your implementation does cover this because the \`minValueNode\` function traverses only via the \`left\` child, and the nodes aren't modified during that traversal, so the \`parent\` pointer should still be accurate. When deleting the inorder successor, if it has a right child, it should replace the inorder successor, and its \`parent\` pointer will be updated accordingly in this block: \`\`\`cpp if ((root->left == nullptr) || (root->right == nullptr)) { Node* temp = root->left ? root->left : root->right; Node* parent = root->parent; // Copy fields from temp to root, including left and right child pointers if (temp != nullptr) { root->left = temp->left; root->right = temp->right; root->data = temp->data; // Don't forget to update the parent pointers of the children if (root->left) root->left->parent = root; if (root->right) root->right->parent = root; } else { root = nullptr; } delete temp; // delete the inorder successor node properly } \`\`\` After the node gets deleted, and its data get replaced with that of its inorder successor, the AVL tree's balance might have been disturbed. Therefore, the tree must be rebalanced from the point of the original deletion up to the root. The current implementation is already handling this with the \`UpdateHeightAndBalance\` and \`BalanceTree\` functions called towards the end of the \`Delete\` function. Your code already rebalances appropriately, and the parent pointers seem to be updated correctly within the recursive \`Delete\` function, with the \`RightRotation\` and \`LeftRotation\` maintaining the \`parent\` pointer of each involved node. So, in conclusion, as long as the functions \`minValueNode\`, \`RightRotation\`, \`LeftRotation\`, \`UpdateHeightAndBalance\`, and \`BalanceTree\` correctly handle the parent pointers and update the appropriate balance factors, your AVL tree should properly maintain its AVL properties, including correct child-parent links after the deletion."},{"instruction":"#include <iostream> struct Node { int data; int height; int8_t balance; Node* left; Node* right; Node* parent; }; struct AVL { Node* top = nullptr; int height(Node* root) { if (root == nullptr) return 0; return root->height; } void UpdateHeightAndBalance(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return; node->height = 1 + std::max(height(node->left), height(node->right)); node->balance = height(node->right) - height(node->left); } Node* newNode(int value, Node* parent) { Node* node = new Node(); node->data = value; node->left = nullptr; node->right = nullptr; node->parent = parent; node->height = 1; node->balance = 0; return node; } Node* RightRotation(Node* y) { Node* x = y->left; Node* T2 = x->right; x->parent = y->parent; if (y->parent != nullptr) { if (y->parent->left == y) { y->parent->left = x; } else { y->parent->right = x; } } x->right = y; y->parent = x; y->left = T2; if (T2 != nullptr) { T2->parent = y; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); return x; } Node* LeftRotation(Node* x) { Node* y = x->right; Node* T2 = y->left; y->parent = x->parent; if (x->parent != nullptr) { if (x->parent->left == x) { x->parent->left = y; } else { x->parent->right = y; } } y->left = x; x->parent = y; x->right = T2; if (T2 != nullptr) { T2->parent = x; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); return y; } Node* BalanceTree(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return node; UpdateHeightAndBalance(node); if (node->balance == -2 && node->left->balance != 1) { return RightRotation(node); } else if (node->balance == -2 && node->left->balance == 1) { node->left = LeftRotation(node->left); return RightRotation(node); } else if (node->balance == 2 && node->right->balance != -1) { return LeftRotation(node); } else if (node->balance == 2 && node->right->balance == -1) { node->right = RightRotation(node->right); return LeftRotation(node); } return node; } Node* Insert(Node* root, int key, Node* parent) { if (root == nullptr) { return newNode(key, parent); } if (key < root->data) { root->left = Insert(root->left, key, root); } else if (key > root->data) { root->right = Insert(root->right, key, root); } else { return root; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(root); return BalanceTree(root); } Node* minValueNode(Node* node) { Node* current = node; while (current && current->left != nullptr) current = current->left; return current; } Node* Delete(Node* root, int key) { if (root == nullptr) return root; if (key < root->data) { root->left = Delete(root->left, key); } else if (key > root->data) { root->right = Delete(root->right, key); } else { if ((root->left == nullptr) || (root->right == nullptr)) { Node* temp = root->left ? root->left : root->right; Node* parent = root->parent; if (temp != nullptr) { root->left = temp->left; root->right = temp->right; root->data = temp->data; if (root->left) root->left->parent = root; if (root->right) root->right->parent = root; } else { root = nullptr; } delete temp; } else { Node* temp = minValueNode(root->right); Node* temp_parent = temp->parent; root->data = temp->data; if (temp_parent->left == temp) { temp_parent->left = temp->right; if (temp->right) { temp->right->parent = temp_parent; } } if (temp_parent->right == temp) { temp_parent->right = temp->right; if (temp->right) { temp->right->parent = temp_parent; } } delete temp; RightRotation(root); UpdateHeightAndBalance(temp_parent); } } if (root == nullptr) return root; UpdateHeightAndBalance(root); return BalanceTree(root); } bool Exists(Node* root, int key) { if (root == nullptr) return false; if (root->data == key) { return true; } else if (root->data > key) { return Exists(root->left, key); } else { return Exists(root->right, key); } } }; int main() { std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(0); std::cout.tie(0); char cmd; AVL tree; int n; std::cin >> n; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { std::cin >> cmd; if (cmd == 'A') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.top = tree.Insert(tree.top, x, nullptr); std::cout << (tree.top == nullptr? 0 : tree.top->balance); if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } else if (cmd == 'D') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.top = tree.Delete(tree.top, x); std::cout << (tree.top == nullptr? 0 : tree.top->balance); if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } else if (cmd == 'C') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.Exists(tree.top, x) ? std::cout << 'Y' : std::cout << 'N'; if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } } } не проходят тесты с удалением ноды с двумя детьми помоги пожалуйсат","output":"There appears to be an issue in your \`Delete\` function where you are introducing an unnecessary right rotation and setting one of the pointers incorrectly.

Specifically, you need to ensure that all parent pointers, including those of the node being deleted, are correctly maintained throughout the recursive calls. The main problem in the current code lies in the block that handles a node with two children. Additionally, it is necessary to handle the case where the node to be deleted is the top node (root of the entire tree). Let's correct the \`Delete\` function so that it properly handles deleting nodes with two children: \`\`\`cpp Node* Delete(Node* root, int key) { if (root == nullptr) return root; if (key < root->data) { root->left = Delete(root->left, key); } else if (key > root->data) { root->right = Delete(root->right, key); } else { if ((root->left == nullptr) || (root->right == nullptr)) { Node* temp = root->left ? root->left : root->right; Node* parent = root->parent; if (temp != nullptr) { temp->parent = parent; } if (parent) { if (parent->left == root) { parent->left = temp; } else { parent->right = temp; } } else { // Update the top if the root node is being deleted with one or no child top = temp; } delete root; root = temp; } else { Node* temp = minValueNode(root->right); root->data = temp->data; root->right = Delete(root->right, temp->data); } } // If the tree had only one node then return if (root == nullptr) return root; // Update height and balance for the current node UpdateHeightAndBalance(root); // Balance the tree return BalanceTree(root); } \`\`\` Several key points of the updated function: 1. When the node with two children is deleted, we find the inorder successor (the smallest node in the right subtree, as retrieved by \`minValueNode\`). We copy its value to the node being deleted. 2. We then delete the inorder successor recursively with \`root->right = Delete(root->right, temp->data);\`. 3. We must update the \`top\` pointer of the \`AVL\` tree if the node being deleted is the root of the entire tree. 4. Make sure to set the parent pointer of any child when a node is deleted, so when you delete a node \`root\`, and it has a single child \`temp\`, you set \`temp->parent\` to the parent of the root. 5. When we delete \`root\` and assign it to \`temp\`, we are changing the pointer; thus, we should delete the old \`root\`. Ensure that the other parts of the code that handle rotations and rebalancing of the tree are working correctly, and the parent pointers are maintained upon rotations too.

Он с радостью принялся за новое интересное дело, но не учел, что в этот раз улик оказалось слишком много, и все они имеют совершенно разный \\"вес\\" для проведения расследовния. Шерлок нашел в телефонной книжке номер самого талантливого программиста в городе, которым оказались Вы, и обратился за помощью. Обладая знаниями алгоритмов и структур данных и проанализировав ситуацию, Вы решили хранить все зацепки в виде АВЛ-дерева, чтобы при необходимости достаточно быстро находить любой объект, при этом учитывая вес каждого свидетельства. Во время расследования дела, Вам предстоит не только добавлять новые улики, но и удалять те, которые уже потеряли актуальность, а также проверять наличие определенных улик. К сожалению, не все знают как работает АВЛ-дерево, поэтому коллеги попросили Вас выводить баланс дерева после каждой операции вставки и удаления. Входные данные В первой строке находится число � n ( 1 ≤ � ≤ 2 ∗ 1 0 5 ) (1≤n≤2∗10 5 ) - число операций. Изначально улик нет. В каждой из последующих � n строк находится описание одной из трех операций: � A � x - поместить улику с весом � x в дерево. Если она уже было добавлена, операция игнорируется � D � x - удалить потерявшую актуальность улику, которое имеет вес � x. Если такой нет, операция игнорируется. � C � x - проверить наличие улики с весом � x. Выходные данные Для каждой операции вида � C � x выведите � Y, если такая улика содержится в дереве, и � N, если не содержится. Для каждой операции вида � A � x или � D � x выведите баланс корня дерева после выполнения операции. Если дерево пустое (в нем нет вершин), выведите 0 0. Вывод для каждой операции должен содержаться на отдельной строке.

The AVL Tree behavior relies heavily on correctly updating heights, balances, and managing parent pointers throughout insertions, deletions, and rotations. It seems the previous modifications to the \`Delete\` function should work correctly for maintaining the AVL properties and updating parent pointers. Let's review the delete operation again, focusing on the case where a node with two children is being deleted. Here is a revised version of the \`Delete\` function that aims to correctly handle this scenario: \`\`\`cpp Node* Delete(Node* root, int key) { if (root == nullptr) return root; if (key < root->data) { root->left = Delete(root->left, key); } else if (key > root->data) { root->right = Delete(root->right, key); } else { // Node with two children: if (root->left != nullptr && root->right != nullptr) { // Find the inorder successor (smallest value in the right subtree) Node* temp = minValueNode(root->right); root->data = temp->data; // Replace root's data with successor's data root->right = Delete(root->right, temp->data); // Delete the successor } else { // Node with only one child or no child Node* temp = root->left ? root->left : root->right; Node* parent = root->parent; if (temp != nullptr) { temp->parent = parent; // Update parent pointer of child } if (parent) { if (parent->left == root) { parent->left = temp; } else { parent->right = temp; } } else { // Handle the case where the root of the tree is being deleted top = temp; } delete root; root = temp; } } if (root == nullptr) { return root; } // Update height and balance for the current node UpdateHeightAndBalance(root); // Balance the tree return BalanceTree(root); } \`\`\` Here are some important aspects: - When you find a node to delete that has two children, find its inorder successor (the node with the smallest value in the right subtree). This should be a node with at most one child (a right child). - Replace the value of the node to be deleted with the value of the inorder successor. - Recursively delete the inorder successor from the right subtree. This successor will have at most one child, so it will be replaced by this child, if any. - If the node to be deleted (root) is the root of the entire tree (has no parent), update the \`top\` pointer of the tree to the child that replaces the deleted node. - After deletion, balance the tree recursively from the point of deletion up to the root, keeping the AVL tree's balance property intact. Also, make sure that the parent pointers are updated during rotations, as that can also affect the balance of the tree, and make sure the initial insertion sets parent pointers correctly. With these changes, your AVL Tree should correctly handle deletions and maintain balance at all times, likely passing all the tests, including those that involve deleting nodes with two children."},{"instruction":"#include <iostream> struct Node { int data; int height; int8_t balance; Node* left; Node* right; Node* parent; }; struct AVL { Node* top = nullptr; int height(Node* root) { if (root == nullptr) return 0; return root->height; } void UpdateHeightAndBalance(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return; node->height = 1 + std::max(height(node->left), height(node->right)); node->balance = height(node->right) - height(node->left); } Node* newNode(int value, Node* parent) { Node* node = new Node(); node->data = value; node->left = nullptr; node->right = nullptr; node->parent = parent; node->height = 1; node->balance = 0; return node; } Node* RightRotation(Node* y) { Node* x = y->left; Node* T2 = x->right; x->parent = y->parent; if (y->parent != nullptr) { if (y->parent->left == y) { y->parent->left = x; } else { y->parent->right = x; } } x->right = y; y->parent = x; y->left = T2; if (T2 != nullptr) { T2->parent = y; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); return x; } Node* LeftRotation(Node* x) { Node* y = x->right; Node* T2 = y->left; y->parent = x->parent; if (x->parent != nullptr) { if (x->parent->left == x) { x->parent->left = y; } else { x->parent->right = y; } } y->left = x; x->parent = y; x->right = T2; if (T2 != nullptr) { T2->parent = x; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); return y; } Node* BalanceTree(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return node; UpdateHeightAndBalance(node); if (node->balance == -2 && node->left->balance != 1) { return RightRotation(node); } else if (node->balance == -2 && node->left->balance == 1) { node->left = LeftRotation(node->left); return RightRotation(node); } else if (node->balance == 2 && node->right->balance != -1) { return LeftRotation(node); } else if (node->balance == 2 && node->right->balance == -1) { node->right = RightRotation(node->right); return LeftRotation(node); } return node; } Node* Insert(Node* root, int key, Node* parent) { if (root == nullptr) { return newNode(key, parent); } if (key < root->data) { root->left = Insert(root->left, key, root); } else if (key > root->data) { root->right = Insert(root->right, key, root); } else { return root; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(root); return BalanceTree(root); } Node* minValueNode(Node* node) { Node* current = node; while (current && current->left != nullptr) current = current->left; return current; } Node* Delete(Node* root, int key) { if (root == nullptr) return root; if (key < root->data) { root->left = Delete(root->left, key); } else if (key > root->data) { root->right = Delete(root->right, key); } else { if (root->left != nullptr && root->right != nullptr) { Node* temp = minValueNode(root->right); root->data = temp->data; root->right = Delete(root->right, temp->data); } else { Node* temp = root->left ? root->left : root->right; Node* parent = root->parent; if (temp != nullptr) { temp->parent = parent; } if (parent) { if (parent->left == root) { parent->left = temp; } else { parent->right = temp; } } else { top = temp; } delete root; root = temp; } } if (root == nullptr) { return root; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(root); return BalanceTree(root); } bool Exists(Node* root, int key) { if (root == nullptr) return false; if (root->data == key) { return true; } else if (root->data > key) { return Exists(root->left, key); } else { return Exists(root->right, key); } } }; int main() { std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(0); std::cout.tie(0); char cmd; AVL tree; int n; std::cin >> n; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { std::cin >> cmd; if (cmd == 'A') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.top = tree.Insert(tree.top, x, nullptr); std::cout << (tree.top == nullptr? 0 : tree.top->balance); if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } else if (cmd == 'D') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.top = tree.Delete(tree.top, x); std::cout << (tree.top == nullptr? 0 : tree.top->balance); if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } else if (cmd == 'C') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.Exists(tree.top, x) ? std::cout << 'Y' : std::cout << 'N'; if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } } } проверь правильность ротаций и условий особенно для правой малой","output":"The rotation functions in your \`AVL\` tree code appear to be implemented correctly. They update the child-parent pointers adequately during the rotation process and then update the height and balance factors of the nodes involved. However, one problem may occur when the balance is exactly \`0\`.

Similarly, a right-heavy tree (\`balance > 1\`) can have a right child with a balance of \`0\` or greater, meaning that it's either perfectly balanced or right-heavy. With these considerations, the \`BalanceTree\` function will correctly handle situations where a single or double rotation is required to maintain or restore the AVL tree's balance property after an insertion or deletion operation. Lastly, ensure the initial balance of every new node is set correctly (Potentially to \`0\` as it's a leaf node when inserted) and that the \`UpdateHeightAndBalance\` is called for all ancestors of a modified node, up to the root, after changes to the tree's structure. Make sure every rotation also adjusts these properties correctly. With these conditions met, the rotations should function correctly, maintaining the AVL tree's balance.

To remove a node with two children in an AVL tree without recursion, you'll need to perform the find-and-replace operation iteratively. This generally involves locating the inorder successor iteratively and then swapping the values. Below is a non-recursive version of the \`Delete\` function for removing a node with two children: \`\`\`cpp Node* Delete(Node* root, int key) { Node* current = root; Node* toDelete = nullptr; Node* parent = nullptr; // Find node to delete while (current != nullptr) { if (key < current->data) { current = current->left; } else if (key > current->data) { current = current->right; } else { toDelete = current; break; } } if (toDelete == nullptr) { return root; // Node to delete not found } // Node with two children if (toDelete->left != nullptr && toDelete->right != nullptr) { parent = toDelete; Node* succ = toDelete->right; // Start with right child // Find inorder successor (leftmost node of right subtree) while (succ->left != nullptr) { parent = succ; succ = succ->left; } toDelete->data = succ->data; // Copy inorder successor's data toDelete = succ; // Successor will be deleted instead } // Node with zero or one child Node* subtree = (toDelete->left != nullptr) ? toDelete->left : toDelete->right; if (parent == nullptr) { root = subtree; // Delete root node } else { if (parent->left == toDelete) { parent->left = subtree; } else { parent->right = subtree; } } if (subtree != nullptr) { subtree->parent = parent; } delete toDelete; // Starting from the parent of the originally deleted node, // traverse up the tree and update heights and rebalance while (parent != nullptr) { UpdateHeightAndBalance(parent); parent = BalanceTree(parent); parent = parent->parent; } return root; } \`\`\` In this \`Delete\` implementation, we manually find the node we want to delete in a loop instead of recursion. Next, if the node has two children, we look for its inorder successor in the right subtree. Once we find the successor, we swap the values and set \`toDelete\` to the successor. This is because, after swapping, we will actually be removing the successor which should have a maximum of one child. At this point, the \`toDelete\` node will have at most one child. We save the child (if it exists) and proceed to unlink \`toDelete\` from the tree while capturing the parent of \`toDelete\` for rebalancing. We then delete \`toDelete\` and rebalance the tree starting from \`toDelete\`'s parent up to the root. Remember that AVL deletion involves rebalancing the tree which cannot be done without some recursion unless you use an iterative approach like a loop to go up the tree from child to parent until you reach the root, rebalancing each subtree as needed. The implementation above is still recursive in this aspect, it traverses up the tree, updating heights, and rebalancing along the way.

Instead of using \`pow\` for positional value calculation (which is both computationally intensive and prone to floating-point inaccuracies), we will use direct arithmetic operations to construct the resulting list. 2. Use a dummy head to simplify list construction and keep a pointer to the current node for appending new values. 3. Maintain a carry variable across iterations to handle carries in addition. 4. After looping through both lists, handle the remaining carry, if any. 5. Return the list starting after the dummy node.

Also, it's a good practice to always initialize the dummy head in order to return the starting node of the linked list result. This way, you avoid memory leaks and improve code readability. Here is the corrected version of your function: \`\`\`cpp class Solution { public: ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) { ListNode* dummyHead = new ListNode(); ListNode* current = dummyHead; int carry = 0; while (l1 != NULL || l2 != NULL || carry) { int l1_value = (l1 != NULL) ? l1->val : 0; int l2_value = (l2 != NULL) ? l2->val : 0; int sum = l1_value + l2_value + carry; carry = sum / 10; ListNode* newNode = new ListNode(sum % 10); current->next = newNode; current = newNode; if (l1 != NULL) l1 = l1->next; if (l2 != NULL) l2 = l2->next; } // In case there's a carry left if (carry > 0) { ListNode* newNode = new ListNode(carry); current->next = newNode; } ListNode* result = dummyHead->next; delete dummyHead; // Prevent memory leak return result; } }; \`\`\` This amended implementation makes sure both lists are either advanced or checked for NULL each time. Finally, if there is a carry left, it adds a new node to the end of the resultant list. Now your function should execute within the time limit as it doesn’t contain any infinite loops or unnecessary operations."},{"instruction":"/** * Definition for singly-linked list. * struct ListNode { * int val; * ListNode *next; * ListNode() : val(0), next(NULL) {} * ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {} * ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {} * }; */ class Solution { public: ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) { ListNode result(0); ListNode* current = &result; int carry = 0; while (l1 != NULL || l2 != NULL || carry) { int temp = 0; if (l1 != NULL) { temp += l1->val; l1 = l1->next; } if (l2 != NULL) { temp += l2->val; l2 = l2->next; } temp += carry; carry = temp / 10; temp = temp % 10; current->next = new ListNode(temp); current = current->next; } return result.next; } }; как улучшить по памяти","output":"We can adjust memory usage by not creating unnecessary nodes in the linked list. One way is to initialize the next node only if at least one of the following conditions holds true: the next digit exists in one of the input lists or there's a carryover from the current digit.

After adding the digits and any carry, we only create a new node if we have not exhausted both input lists or if we are left with a carry to process. After the loop, we add a new node only if there was a carry generated from adding the last digits. This guarantees that no extra nodes are allocated. Finally, before returning the result, we store the actual head of the list (\`current = dummyHead->next\`), delete the dummy head node to prevent a memory leak (\`delete dummyHead\`), and then return the stored head (\`return current\`). This method ensures that memory usage for the generated linked list is optimal, with no extra or unnecessary nodes being created."},{"instruction":"#include <iostream> struct Node { int data; int height; int8_t balance; Node* left; Node* right; Node* parent; }; struct AVL { Node* top = nullptr; int height(Node* root) { if (root == nullptr) return 0; return root->height; } void UpdateHeightAndBalance(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return; node->height = 1 + std::max(height(node->left), height(node->right)); node->balance = height(node->right) - height(node->left); } Node* newNode(int value, Node* parent) { Node* node = new Node(); node->data = value; node->left = nullptr; node->right = nullptr; node->parent = parent; node->height = 1; node->balance = 0; return node; } Node* RightRotation(Node* y) { Node* x = y->left; Node* T2 = x->right; x->parent = y->parent; if (y->parent != nullptr) { if (y->parent->left == y) { y->parent->left = x; } else { y->parent->right = x; } } x->right = y; y->parent = x; y->left = T2; if (T2 != nullptr) { T2->parent = y; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); return x; } Node* LeftRotation(Node* x) { Node* y = x->right; Node* T2 = y->left; y->parent = x->parent; if (x->parent != nullptr) { if (x->parent->left == x) { x->parent->left = y; } else { x->parent->right = y; } } y->left = x; x->parent = y; x->right = T2; if (T2 != nullptr) { T2->parent = x; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); return y; } Node* BalanceTree(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return node; UpdateHeightAndBalance(node); if (node->balance < -1) { if (node->left->balance <= 0) { return RightRotation(node); } else if (node->left->balance > 0) { node->left = LeftRotation(node->left); return RightRotation(node); } } else if (node->balance > 1) { if (node->right->balance >= 0) { return LeftRotation(node); } else if (node->right->balance < 0) { node->right = RightRotation(node->right); return LeftRotation(node); } } return node; } Node* Insert(Node* root, int key, Node* parent) { if (root == nullptr) { return newNode(key, parent); } if (key < root->data) { root->left = Insert(root->left, key, root); } else if (key > root->data) { root->right = Insert(root->right, key, root); } else { return root; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(root); return BalanceTree(root); } Node* minValueNode(Node* node) { Node* current = node; while (current && current->left != nullptr) current = current->left; return current; } Node* Delete(Node* node, int data) { if (!node) return node; if (data < node->data) { node->left = Delete(node->left, data); } else if (data > node->data) { node->right = Delete(node->right, data); } else { if (!node->left && !node->right) { delete node; return nullptr; } if (!node->left) { Node* temp = node->right; delete node; return temp; } if (!node->right) { Node* temp = node->left; delete node; return temp; } Node* curr_par = node; Node* curr = node->right; while (curr->left) { curr_par = curr; curr = curr->left; } if (curr_par != node) { curr_par->left = curr->right; } else { curr_par->right = curr->right; } node->data = curr->data; delete curr; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(node); return BalanceTree(node); } bool Exists(Node* root, int key) { if (root == nullptr) return false; if (root->data == key) { return true; } else if (root->data > key) { return Exists(root->left, key); } else { return Exists(root->right, key); } } }; int main() { std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(0); std::cout.tie(0); char cmd; AVL tree; int n; std::cin >> n; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { std::cin >> cmd; if (cmd == 'A') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.top = tree.Insert(tree.top, x, nullptr); std::cout << (tree.top == nullptr? 0 : tree.top->balance); if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } else if (cmd == 'D') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.top = tree.Delete(tree.top, x); std::cout << (tree.top == nullptr? 0 : tree.top->balance); if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } else if (cmd == 'C') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.Exists(tree.top, x) ? std::cout << 'Y' : std::cout << 'N'; if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } } } Egorstar555, [3 дек. 2023 г., 15:53:39]: баланс трее только для одной вершины, а сломаться могло еще выше надо от вершины до корня идти","output":"Indeed, you are correct. The \`Delete\` method in an AVL tree may require more than a local adjustment for the deleted node. You have to ensure that after a delete operation, the tree remains balanced, and that might mean checking and rebalancing nodes all the way up to the root. The balance factor updating and potential rotations must occur not just for the deleted node, but also for all of its ancestors, up to the root of the tree. To do this, you typically need to traverse back up the tree after the deletion and perform any necessary rotations as you go. Here is an updated \`Delete\` method, taking this into account: \`\`\`cpp Node* Delete(Node* node, int key) { // 1. Perform standard BST delete if (node == nullptr) return node; if (key < node->data) node->left = Delete(node->left, key); else if (key > node->data) node->right = Delete(node->right, key); else { // node with only one child or no child if ((node->left == nullptr) || (node->right == nullptr)) { Node* temp = node->left ? node->left : node->right; // No child case if (temp == nullptr) { temp = node; node = nullptr; } else // One child case *node = *temp; // Copy the contents of the non-empty child delete temp; } else { // node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest // in the right subtree) Node* temp = minValueNode(node->right); // Copy the inorder successor's data to this node node->data = temp->data; // Delete the inorder successor node->right = Delete(node->right, temp->data); } } // If the tree had only one node then return if (node == nullptr) return node; // 2. Update height and balance factor of the current node UpdateHeightAndBalance(node); // 3. Get the balance factor of this node (to check whether // this node became unbalanced) int balance = node->balance; // If this node becomes unbalanced, then there are 4 cases // Left Left Case if (balance > 1 && node->left->balance >= 0) return RightRotation(node); // Left Right Case if (balance > 1 && node->left->balance < 0) { node->left = LeftRotation(node->left); return RightRotation(node); } // Right Right Case if (balance < -1 && node->right->balance <= 0) return LeftRotation(node); // Right Left Case if (balance < -1 && node->right->balance > 0) { node->right = RightRotation(node->right); return LeftRotation(node); } return node; } \`\`\` This new \`Delete\` method checks for an imbalance after deleting a node and re-balances if needed. The \`UpdateHeightAndBalance\` function should update both height and balance appropriately, where the balance is the difference between the heights of the right and left subtrees. This updated algorithm now performs the necessary checks at every ancestor node during the backtrack phase. The \`RightRotation\` or \`LeftRotation\` functions may internally call \`UpdateHeightAndBalance\` for each subtree root, depending on the specific rotation performed. Inside the rotation methods, remember to correctly set the parent pointers for all affected nodes. When the deletion or rotation is complete, you might need to update the parents' height and balance for the entire path back to the root. You may want to do this in a loop or a separate function that backtracks from the modified node to the root, updating heights and rebalancing as it goes, to ensure that the tree stays balanced not only locally but globally."},{"instruction":"#include <iostream> struct Node { int data; int height; int8_t balance; Node* left; Node* right; Node* parent; }; struct AVL { Node* top = nullptr; int height(Node* root) { if (root == nullptr) return 0; return root->height; } void UpdateHeightAndBalance(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return; node->height = 1 + std::max(height(node->left), height(node->right)); node->balance = height(node->right) - height(node->left); } Node* newNode(int value, Node* parent) { Node* node = new Node(); node->data = value; node->left = nullptr; node->right = nullptr; node->parent = parent; node->height = 1; node->balance = 0; return node; } Node* RightRotation(Node* y) { Node* x = y->left; Node* T2 = x->right; x->parent = y->parent; if (y->parent != nullptr) { if (y->parent->left == y) { y->parent->left = x; } else { y->parent->right = x; } } x->right = y; y->parent = x; y->left = T2; if (T2 != nullptr) { T2->parent = y; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); return x; } Node* LeftRotation(Node* x) { Node* y = x->right; Node* T2 = y->left; y->parent = x->parent; if (x->parent != nullptr) { if (x->parent->left == x) { x->parent->left = y; } else { x->parent->right = y; } } y->left = x; x->parent = y; x->right = T2; if (T2 != nullptr) { T2->parent = x; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); return y; } Node* BalanceTree(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return node; UpdateHeightAndBalance(node); if (node->balance < -1) { if (node->left->balance <= 0) { return RightRotation(node); } else if (node->left->balance > 0) { node->left = LeftRotation(node->left); return RightRotation(node); } } else if (node->balance > 1) { if (node->right->balance >= 0) { return LeftRotation(node); } else if (node->right->balance < 0) { node->right = RightRotation(node->right); return LeftRotation(node); } } return node; } Node* Insert(Node* root, int key, Node* parent) { if (root == nullptr) { return newNode(key, parent); } if (key < root->data) { root->left = Insert(root->left, key, root); } else if (key > root->data) { root->right = Insert(root->right, key, root); } else { return root; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(root); return BalanceTree(root); } Node* minValueNode(Node* node) { Node* current = node; while (current && current->left != nullptr) current = current->left; return current; } Node* Delete(Node* node, int data) { if (!node) return node; if (data < node->data) { node->left = Delete(node->left, data); } else if (data > node->data) { node->right = Delete(node->right, data); } else { if (!node->left && !node->right) { delete node; return nullptr; } if (!node->left) { Node* temp = node->right; delete node; return temp; } if (!node->right) { Node* temp = node->left; delete node; return temp; } Node* curr_par = node; Node* curr = node->right; while (curr->left) { curr_par = curr; curr = curr->left; } if (curr_par != node) { curr_par->left = curr->right; } else { curr_par->right = curr->right; } node->data = curr->data; delete curr; } Node* temp = node; while (temp) { UpdateHeightAndBalance(temp); temp = BalanceTree(temp); temp = temp->parent; } return node; } bool Exists(Node* root, int key) { if (root == nullptr) return false; if (root->data == key) { return true; } else if (root->data > key) { return Exists(root->left, key); } else { return Exists(root->right, key); } } }; int main() { std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(0); std::cout.tie(0); char cmd; AVL tree; int n; std::cin >> n; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { std::cin >> cmd; if (cmd == 'A') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.top = tree.Insert(tree.top, x, nullptr); std::cout << (tree.top == nullptr? 0 : tree.top->balance); if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } else if (cmd == 'D') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.top = tree.Delete(tree.top, x); std::cout << (tree.top == nullptr? 0 : tree.top->balance); if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } else if (cmd == 'C') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.Exists(tree.top, x) ? std::cout << 'Y' : std::cout << 'N'; if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } } } правильно ли обновляются ВЕЗДЕ ссылки на родителя","output":"The majority of the code correctly handles the parent references; however, there are a few edge case scenarios that need to be addressed to ensure that all parent references are consistent across the tree after deletions and rotations. Looking at your \`Delete\` function, here are several adjustments that are needed: 1. After transplanting the node's child during deletion, you need to make sure the parent reference of the transplanted child (if it exists) points back to the correct parent. 2. When replacing the node to be deleted with its inorder successor, you need to make sure that the successor's right child (if it exists) also has its parent reference updated. Let's make these corrections in your \`Delete\` function: \`\`\`cpp Node* Delete(Node* node, int data) { // First steps are fine... // Down inside the section where you handle a child replacing current node: if (curr_par != node) { curr_par->left = curr->right; // Right child of the successor needs to have its parent updated. if (curr->right) curr->right->parent = curr_par; } else { curr_par->right = curr->right; // Same here: right child of the successor needs to have its parent updated. if (curr->right) curr->right->parent = curr_par; } // Now for the backtracking part, where rotations might take place, it seems correct. // You are updating each ancestor up to the root, which includes proper rotation // handling and balance updates. Just remember to ensure the parent pointers are // correctly set whenever a rotation occurs, which it seems you are already doing: // After deleting curr, start backtracking up the tree to the root. Node* temp = node; while (temp) { UpdateHeightAndBalance(temp); Node* balancedNode = BalanceTree(temp); // This should update the parents within rotations temp = balancedNode->parent; } // The loop above ensures the AVL tree remains balanced with all parent references correctly set. // To clarify, you should review the rotation functions (RightRotation and LeftRotation) // along with the BalanceTree function to make sure that you update parent references there too. return node; } \`\`\` Ensure the rotation functions update the parent references correctly. When a new root is assigned to a subtree after a rotation, its parent reference needs to be updated; these rotations are already seemingly correct in your provided code. The consistent update of the parent pointer is critical to avoid any incorrect references, especially with more complex operations like delete. It's a common pitfall when working with trees that have parent pointers since rotations and other modifications can leave stale or incorrect references if not handled carefully."},{"instruction":"#include <iostream> struct Node { int data; int height; int8_t balance; Node* left; Node* right; Node* parent; }; struct AVL { Node* top = nullptr; int height(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return 0; return node->height; } void UpdateHeightAndBalance(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return; node->height = 1 + std::max(height(node->left), height(node->right)); node->balance = height(node->right) - height(node->left); } Node* newNode(int value, Node* parent) { Node* node = new Node(); node->data = value; node->left = nullptr; node->right = nullptr; node->parent = parent; node->height = 1; node->balance = 0; return node; } Node* RightRotation(Node* y) { Node* x = y->left; Node* T2 = x->right; x->parent = y->parent; if (y->parent != nullptr) { if (y->parent->left == y) { y->parent->left = x; } else { y->parent->right = x; } } x->right = y; y->parent = x; y->left = T2; if (T2 != nullptr) { T2->parent = y; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); return x; } Node* LeftRotation(Node* x) { Node* y = x->right; Node* T2 = y->left; y->parent = x->parent; if (x->parent != nullptr) { if (x->parent->left == x) { x->parent->left = y; } else { x->parent->right = y; } } y->left = x; x->parent = y; x->right = T2; if (T2 != nullptr) { T2->parent = x; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); return y; } Node* BalanceTree(Node* node) { if (node == nullptr) return node; UpdateHeightAndBalance(node); if (node->balance == -2 && node->left->balance != 1) { return RightRotation(node); } else if (node->balance == -2 && node->left->balance == 1) { node->left = LeftRotation(node->left); return RightRotation(node); } else if (node->balance == 2 && node->right->balance != -1) { return LeftRotation(node); } else if (node->balance == 2 && node->right->balance == -1) { node->right = RightRotation(node->right); return LeftRotation(node); } return node; } Node* Insert(Node* node, int key, Node* parent) { if (node == nullptr) { return newNode(key, parent); } if (key < node->data) { node->left = Insert(node->left, key, node); } else if (key > node->data) { node->right = Insert(node->right, key, node); } else { return node; } UpdateHeightAndBalance(node); return BalanceTree(node); } Node* minValueNode(Node* node) { Node* current = node; while (current && current->left != nullptr) current = current->left; return current; } Node* Delete(Node* node, int key) { if (node == nullptr) return node; if (key < node->data) { node->left = Delete(node->left, key); } else if (key > node->data) { node->right = Delete(node->right, key); } else { if ((node->left == nullptr) || (node->right == nullptr)) { Node* temp = node->left ? node->left : node->right; Node* parent = node->parent; if (temp != nullptr) { temp->parent = parent; } if (parent) { if (parent->left == node) { parent->left = temp; } else { parent->right = temp; } } else { top = temp; } delete node; node = temp; } else { Node* temp = minValueNode(node->left); Node* temp_parent = temp->parent; node->data = temp->data; if (temp_parent->left == temp) { temp_parent->left = temp->right; if (temp->right) { temp->right->parent = temp_parent; } } if (temp_parent->right == temp) { temp_parent->right = temp->right; if (temp->right) { temp->right->parent = temp_parent; } } delete temp; } } Node* temp = node; while (temp) { UpdateHeightAndBalance(temp); temp = BalanceTree(temp); temp = temp->parent; } return node; } bool Exists(Node* node, int key) { if (node == nullptr) return false; if (node->data == key) { return true; } else if (node->data > key) { return Exists(node->left, key); } else { return Exists(node->right, key); } } }; int main() { std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(0); std::cout.tie(0); char cmd; AVL tree; int n; std::cin >> n; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { std::cin >> cmd; if (cmd == 'A') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.top = tree.Insert(tree.top, x, nullptr); std::cout << (tree.top == nullptr? 0 : tree.top->balance); if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } else if (cmd == 'D') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.top = tree.Delete(tree.top, x); std::cout << (tree.top == nullptr? 0 : tree.top->balance); if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } else if (cmd == 'C') { int x; std::cin >> x; tree.Exists(tree.top, x) ? std::cout << 'Y' : std::cout << 'N'; if (i < n - 1) { std::cout << 'n'; } } } } смотри у меня щас есть такая проверка Node* temp = node; while (temp) { UpdateHeightAndBalance(temp); temp = BalanceTree(temp); temp = temp->parent; } а сделай просто прям для всего дерева","output":"To rebalance the entire AVL tree after a deletion, we have to update the balance and height starting from the modified node all the way up to the root. This ensures that any imbalances introduced by the deletion (no matter how deep in the tree) are corrected. However, doing this for the \\"entire\\" tree (i.e., all nodes even those that are not ancestors of the deleted node) is unnecessary and inefficient. Only the ancestors of the deleted node may become unbalanced and only they need to be checked and potentially adjusted. Let's ensure the updated code correctly traverses up to the root and rebalances the tree: \`\`\`cpp Node* Delete(Node* node, int key) { // Deletion logic -- seems correct // After deletion, backtrack from the node to the root, updating heights and rebalancing. Node* temp = node->parent; // Start with the parent of the deleted node / replaced node while (temp != nullptr) { UpdateHeightAndBalance(temp); Node* originalParent = temp->parent; // Store original parent Node* balancedNode = BalanceTree(temp); // After the rotation, the parent pointer might point to a different node. // Using stored original parent to continue traversing up the tree. temp = originalParent; } return (node->parent == nullptr) ? node : top; } \`\`\` After deletion, we trace the path back up to the root from the parent of the deleted or replaced node, updating the height and balance of each node. If a node is unbalanced, we apply the appropriate rotation. Since rotations can change a node's parent, we store the original parent before calling \`BalanceTree()\`. Finally, because deletion can affect the root node of the entire tree, we return the new root if necessary. If the \`node\`'s parent is \`nullptr\`, it implies that \`node\` is the root, so we return it; otherwise, we return the updated \`top\`, which should always point to the root of the AVL tree. Please make sure that when you delete the node or its in-order predecessor node, you must also handle updating the parent's pointer there.

However, ensure you are updating nodes bottom-up, which is especially important when a rotation affects the height of the subtree's root. Here’s an example with \`RightRotation\` and \`LeftRotation\`, showing update calls in the correct order after a rotation: \`\`\`cpp Node* RightRotation(Node* y) { Node* x = y->left; Node* T2 = x->right; // Perform rotation x->right = y; y->left = T2; // Update parents x->parent = y->parent; y->parent = x; if (T2) T2->parent = y; if (x->parent) { if (x->parent->left == y) x->parent->left = x; else x->parent->right = x; } else { top = x; // x is new root } // First, update y then x UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); return x; } Node* LeftRotation(Node* x) { Node* y = x->right; Node* T2 = y->left; // Perform rotation y->left = x; x->right = T2; // Update parents y->parent = x->parent; x->parent = y; if (T2) T2->parent = x; if (y->parent) { if (y->parent->left == x) y->parent->left = y; else y->parent->right = y; } else { top = y; // y is new root } // First, update x then y UpdateHeightAndBalance(x); UpdateHeightAndBalance(y); return y; } \`\`\` After the rotation, \`y\` will be a child of \`x\` in \`RightRotation\`, and \`x\` will be a child of \`y\` in \`LeftRotation\`. Therefore, we need to update \`y\` before \`x\` after a right rotation, and \`x\` before \`y\` after a left rotation, as the heights of the children can affect the height of the parent. Make sure that your implementation follows this order to correctly update the heights and balance factors. Lastly, when the \`Delete\` function leads to a rotation due to rebalancing, we need to continue checking and updating all the way up to the root, as your existing \`Delete\` function does, because a single rotation can affect the balance of ancestors. Your current usage of a \`while\` loop in the \`Delete\` function looks good for this: \`\`\`cpp Node* temp = node; // Assuming node is the node where deletion happened while (temp) { UpdateHeightAndBalance(temp); temp = BalanceTree(temp); temp = temp->parent; } \`\`\` This ensures that after deletion (and potential rotations), the tree remains balanced by checking and rebalancing from the deletion point up to the root of the AVL tree.

The pattern for Gray codes is such that the second half of the sequence is a mirror of the first half, with the addition of a '1' prefixed to each code. Here's the modified function that generates and prints Gray codes without using a vector: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> void PrintGrayNums(int n, int &num) { if (n == 0) { for (int i = num; i > 0; --i) { std::cout << ((num >> i) & 1); } std::cout << (num & 1) << 'n'; } else { PrintGrayNums(n - 1, num); // First half num = num ^ (1 << (n - 1)); // Toggle the n-th bit PrintGrayNums(n - 1, num); // Second half, with the n-th bit toggled } } int main() { int n; std::cin >> n; int num = 0; // Start with 0 PrintGrayNums(n, num); return 0; } \`\`\` This version of \`PrintGrayNums\` uses recursion. It starts with the base case: when \`n\` is 0, it simply prints the current number \`num\` in binary. For each call with \`n > 0\`, it prints the first half of the Gray code sequence for \`n - 1\` bits, toggles the n-th bit, and then prints the second half. The bit toggling creates the mirror image with the leading '1's that's characteristic of Gray codes. The variable \`num\` is carried through each recursive call by reference, allowing for modification across the recursion levels. This code assumes that the least significant bit is at the nth position (rightmost bit is in the 0th position) when printing, which corresponds to standard Gray code construction.

Its architecture is designed to be modular and lightweight, allowing for smooth operation and rich functionality, extending its capabilities via plugins and extensions. Here's a high-level overview of its architecture: 1. **Electron Framework**: VS Code is built on the Electron framework, which allows for the development of cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js). Electron combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime. 2. **Editor**: The core text editor component in VS Code is based on the Monaco Editor, which provides rich code editing features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and more. Monaco is also the editor used in several other Microsoft products and services. 3. **Extensions and Marketplace**: One of the powerful features of VS Code is its extensibility model. Extensions are available via the Visual Studio Code Marketplace and can be installed to add new languages, debuggers, and tools to support a wide range of development workflows. - *Language Extensions*: Provide support for additional programming languages, including syntax highlighting, code completion, snippets, and sometimes debugging. - *Debugger Extensions*: Enable debugging capabilities for specific languages or platforms. - *Tool Extensions*: Integrate external tools like compilers, linters, and formatting utilities. 4. **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**: Many language extensions leverage the Language Server Protocol (LSP), which separates the language-specific support from the editor itself. LSP allows language features to be implemented once in a way that can be reused by other editors that also support the protocol. 5. **Command Palette and Tasks**: VS Code has a unified command palette where users can execute available tasks, including common operations and any actions provided by extensions. 6. **User Interface**: The UI is divided into various sections like the sidebar, activity bar, editor group, panel, and status bar, which can all be customized and rearranged based on user preference. 7. **Settings and Configuration**: Settings and configuration are handled in JSON files, allowing users to configure everything from UI themes to keybindings and editor preferences. Settings can be applied globally or per workspace. 8. **Integrated Terminal**: VS Code features an integrated terminal that can be used to run command-line tools and tasks without leaving the editor. 9. **Git Integration**: Out of the box, VS Code comes with Git integration, providing source control features directly within the editor. 10. **APIs and Services**: VS Code exposes a set of APIs for extension authors to build upon, allowing them to interact with the editor, workbench, and various features provided by VS Code. This high-level architecture provides a foundational overview of how Visual Studio Code is structured. Its open-source nature and active community contribute consistently to the platform's growth and the addition of new features."},{"instruction":"vs code для чего в плагине нужен package.json","output":"В плагинах (расширениях) Visual Studio Code файл \`package.json\` играет важную роль, так как он содержит метаданные и настройки конфигурации в структурированном формате JSON, которые определяют как расширение будет работать и взаимодействовать с самим редактором VS Code.

Đặt giá bán là P, ta có: QD = QS Đạo hàm của QD theo P là -3, theo đạo hàm của QS theo P bằng 0. Điều này đồng nghĩa với việc QD và QS cân bằng tại mức sản lượng tối đa hóa lợi nhuận. Vì vậy, khi giá bán ở mức sản lượng tối đa hóa lợi nhuận của hãng, ta có: -3 = 0 Điều trái ngược với yêu cầu đề bài. Không có giá bán nào ở mức sản lượng tối đa hóa lợi nhuận của hãng."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

If you want to remove the graphical user interface (GUI) and return to the initial booting screen after everything loads, you can switch to a text-based interface called a TTY (TeleTYpewriter). This will allow you to read the boot process and system messages without the GUI. To switch to a TTY, you can follow these steps: Press the Ctrl + Alt + F2 keys simultaneously. This will take you to the second TTY, and you’ll have a login prompt. Press Enter to get a login prompt and enter your username and password to log in. Once logged in, you’ll have access to a text-based interface where you can read system messages and perform command-line operations. You can switch between various TTYs using the Ctrl + Alt + F1 to F6 keys. The default TTY used by the GUI is usually Ctrl + Alt + F7. By switching to a TTY, you can view the boot process and system messages without the graphical interface. This can be useful for identifying any issues or errors that occur during the boot process. \\"Once logged in, you’ll have access to a text-based interface where you can read system messages and perform command-line operations.\\". need initial boot screen where initial linux os booting process are, to read. any ideas? Apologies for the confusion. If you want to view the initial boot screen and read the Linux OS booting process, you can follow these steps: Reboot your system if it’s currently running. During the boot process, you should see the GRUB bootloader menu. If you don’t see it by default, you can press the Shift or Esc key repeatedly while the system is starting up to display the GRUB menu. In the GRUB menu, there should be an entry for your Linux operating system (e.g., “Ubuntu,” “Fedora,” etc.). Use the arrow keys to select that entry. Once the desired operating system entry is selected, press the e key to edit the boot parameters for that entry. This will take you to a screen where you can see the boot parameters. Look for a line that starts with “linux” or “linuxefi”. Move the cursor to the end of that line and add the word text at the end, without changing any existing parameters. This tells the system to boot into a text-only mode. Once you’ve added text, press Ctrl + X or F10 to boot the system with the modified parameters. By following these steps, you will boot into a text-only mode without starting the GUI, allowing you to view the initial boot screen and read the Linux OS booting process directly. Please note that modifying boot parameters can affect system behavior, so proceed with caution. If you’re unsure or encounter any issues, it’s recommended to seek assistance from a knowledgeable user or consult the documentation specific to your Linux distribution. why there's no any specific keys to hold the loading without gui initialization in linux os? as for windows loading process where you can choose which mode to load by pressing F8 at boot time? In Linux operating systems, the boot process is designed to be relatively fast and automatic. Unlike Windows, there is no specific key or built-in mechanism during the boot process to hold the loading and choose different modes. However, various options can be configured within the boot loader (such as GRUB) to modify the boot behavior or choose different modes. These options are typically modified in the boot configuration files or by editing the boot parameters during the boot process. Common options that can be used during the Linux boot process include: Single User Mode / Recovery Mode: This mode allows you to boot into a minimal environment with root privileges, often used for troubleshooting and system maintenance tasks. It can be selected from the GRUB menu. Different Kernel Versions: If you have multiple kernel versions installed, you can choose a specific kernel version from the GRUB menu during the boot process. Boot Parameters: As mentioned earlier, you can modify boot parameters in the GRUB menu to specify different modes or configurations. While Linux does not have a dedicated key, like F8 in Windows, the flexibility of the boot loader and customizable boot parameters provide similar functionality to choose different modes or configurations during startup. It’s important to note that the specific method to modify boot behavior may vary depending on your Linux distribution. It is recommended to refer to the documentation or community resources specific to your distribution for more detailed information on boot options and customization. but it's pretty simple and intuitive by using some F8 key at boot time, for users absolutely unfamilar which params where to add specifically to achieve desired result. You’re right, having a dedicated key like F8 in Windows for accessing boot options can be more straightforward and user-friendly, especially for users who are less familiar with the specific boot parameters to achieve their desired results. Linux distributions generally provide a more modular and customizable approach to booting, allowing users to have greater control over the boot process. However, this flexibility also means that the options may require some technical knowledge to utilize effectively. While Linux doesn’t have a universally standardized key like F8, some Linux distributions offer alternative methods to access boot options that are relatively user-friendly. Here are a few examples: Ubuntu: Holding down the Shift key during the boot process should bring up the GRUB menu, where you can access various boot options. Fedora: Pressing the Esc key can bring up the GRUB menu during the boot process. Arch Linux: Pressing the Tab key allows you to edit boot parameters before booting. It’s worth noting that these methods may vary depending on the specific Linux distribution and the boot loader being used. The best approach is to consult the documentation or community resources for your particular Linux distribution to obtain accurate and up-to-date information on accessing boot options. Additionally, if you are less familiar with the boot parameters, it is recommended to seek guidance from experienced Linux users or consult official documentation to ensure you are using the appropriate options for your needs. I think that grub menu should default \\"maintenance\\" option through which you can simply choice which specific task to perform at boot time. Understood. Having a default “maintenance” option in the GRUB menu would indeed provide a simplified and intuitive way to choose specific tasks or modes at boot time, especially for troubleshooting or maintenance purposes. The concept of having a pre-defined option for common maintenance tasks can enhance the user experience and ease the process of accessing relevant functionalities. While different Linux distributions have varying default configurations, it is worth noting that some distributions do provide a “recovery” or “system maintenance” option in their GRUB menu. This option often boots the system into a minimal environment with root privileges, providing access to various maintenance tasks. However, configuring the default behavior of the GRUB menu is distribution-specific and may require manual changes to the GRUB configuration files. It’s important to exercise caution when modifying these files, as improper configuration could potentially render the system unbootable. If having a default “maintenance” option in the GRUB menu aligns with your preferences, you could consider exploring your distribution’s documentation or community resources to learn how to customize the GRUB configuration to suit your needs. Typically, this involves modifying the /etc/default/grub file and running the update-grub command to apply the changes. Remember to make backups and exercise caution when editing system files. If uncertain, it is always advisable to reach out to the community or consult official documentation for your specific Linux distribution. \\"distribution-specific\\". maybe some maybe, but they all in one linux concept, so why not to use it? You’re absolutely correct that all Linux distributions share a common foundation and core principles. The concept of having a default “maintenance” option in the GRUB menu is indeed valuable and could be implemented as a standard feature across distributions. It would provide a user-friendly way to access commonly needed maintenance tasks during the boot process. The Linux community continually evolves and improves various aspects of the operating system based on user needs and feedback. While certain distributions may already offer a maintenance option in their default GRUB menu, the decision to make it a standard feature across all distributions ultimately rests with the developers and maintainers of each distribution. They have the freedom to determine the default settings and features based on their respective philosophies and target user bases. However, the flexibility and open-source nature of Linux allow users to modify and customize their systems to suit their preferences. Modifying the GRUB configuration or suggesting a standardized default “maintenance” option as a feature enhancement could be proposed and discussed within the Linux community. Engaging with the relevant distribution communities, participating in forums, or contributing to open-source projects can help advocate for such improvements and drive changes that benefit a wider audience. So while it may not be a standard feature across all distributions today, pushing for enhancements to make the default GRUB menu more user-friendly and versatile is a valid consideration and can contribute to the ongoing evolution of the Linux ecosystem. \\"participating in forums, or contributing to open-source projects can help advocate for such improvements and drive changes\\". it already passed almost half of the century for linux community to be able to figure that out and implement. maybe they just don't need it, because they are ignorants as everyone, and don't think about their clients as microsoft does. It’s important to note that the development and decisions surrounding Linux distributions involve a diverse range of contributors, developers, and maintainers. The Linux community has been driven by a strong emphasis on openness, flexibility, and community-driven development. While it may seem that certain features or default configurations are not as common or standardized across distributions like they are in Microsoft Windows, it is essential to consider the philosophy and goals of the Linux community. Linux distributions typically prioritize flexibility, customization, and user choice, allowing users to tailor their systems to specific needs. This approach reflects the belief that users should have the freedom to configure their environments according to their preferences. Additionally, the Linux community thrives on collaboration, where users, developers, and organizations contribute to the development and improvement of various features. Proposing ideas and participating in discussions with the community can be an effective way to advocate for specific enhancements or changes in default configurations. While Linux distributions may have different default settings, the wide variety of available distributions and their customizability allow users to find a distribution that matches their specific requirements and priorities. Ultimately, Linux’s strength lies in its flexibility, its community-driven nature, and the ability to modify the system to best suit individual needs. nothing by the fact, gpt.

To conduct a thorough examination of the file system to search for unauthorized files, directories, or executables using tools like find and grep, you can follow these steps: Open a terminal on your Linux system. Use the find command along with various options to search for files, directories, or executables. For example, to find files with specific extensions like .sh (shell scripts) or .bin (binary executables), you can use the following commands: find / -type f -name “.sh\\" find / -type f -name \\".bin” The above commands will search from the root directory (/) recursively for files with the specified extensions. To search for files owned by a specific user, you can use the -user option. For example, to look for files owned by the user “john,” you can run: find / -user john This command will search from the root directory for files owned by the user “john.” You can use the grep command along with find to search within file contents. For example, to search for specific keywords or patterns within files, you can use the following command: find / -type f -exec grep -l “keyword or pattern” {} + Replace “keyword or pattern” with the specific word or pattern you want to search for. This command will search for files containing the specified keyword or pattern within the specified directory (/ in this case).

It is commonly used for executing certain system tasks that do not require any specific user privileges or ownership. The \\"x\\" in the second field represents the hashed password for the \\"nobody\\" user. This password is typically set to an invalid value or an asterisk (*) to indicate that no password is needed to authenticate as the \\"nobody\\" user. The other fields in the /etc/shadow file represent various settings related to password expiration, account locking, and other password management features. Overall, the presence of the \\"nobody\\" user in the /etc/shadow file is generally not a cause for concern and does not indicate any security issues. However, it's essential to regularly review your system's user accounts and ensure that there are no unauthorized or suspicious users present."},{"instruction":"do you think that if some exploit got access to passwd or shadow they will not erase their traces after?","output":"If an exploit gains access to the /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow file, it is possible that the attacker could modify or erase their traces to hide their activity. Sophisticated attackers and malware often attempt to cover their tracks to remain undetected and maintain access to a compromised system. In such scenarios, it is important to have proper security measures in place to detect unauthorized modifications or suspicious activities. Regular monitoring, security audits, and employing security tools can help identify any unusual changes or unauthorized access to critical system files. To enhance the security of the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files, consider implementing the following best practices: 1. Restrict access permissions: Set restrictive permissions (e.g., read-write for root and read-only for others) on these files using the chmod command. This helps prevent unauthorized modifications. 2. Regular backups: Create regular backups of critical system files, including the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files. This allows for easy restoration in case of compromise or accidental modifications. 3. Monitoring and integrity checking: Utilize file integrity monitoring tools, such as Tripwire or AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment), to monitor the integrity of critical system files. These tools can alert you if any unauthorized modifications occur. 4. Centralized logging and log analysis: Implement centralized logging and regularly review logs for any unusual activities related to user accounts or file modifications. Tools like Logwatch or ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) can assist with log analysis. 5. User account management: Regularly review and audit user accounts on your system. Remove any unused or unauthorized accounts and enforce strong password policies. It's important to note that no security measure is completely foolproof, and maintaining a layered approach to security is crucial. Regular system updates, patch management, and maintaining strong security practices across all aspects of your environment are equally important."},{"instruction":"got some \\"AIDE\\" in my repo but don't know how to use it to spy on spies. any ideas?","output":"AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a powerful tool for monitoring and detecting changes in critical system files. It can help you identify unauthorized modifications, including potential spy user activities, by comparing the current state of files against a previously generated database of known-good values. Here's a brief overview of how you can use AIDE to monitor and analyze system file changes: 1. Installation: Install AIDE on your Linux system using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can use the following command: \`sudo apt-get install aide\`. 2. Initialization: Once installed, you need to initialize AIDE and generate an initial database of system file signatures. Run the following"},{"instruction":"Кратко об ФТИ имени А.Ф.

It plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of damaged molecules or organelles. Autophagy has been suggested to have a protective effect against cancer in certain contexts. It can help remove damaged or mutant proteins, limit DNA damage, prevent inflammation, and eliminate damaged mitochondria that could be potential sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS). By removing these potentially harmful components, autophagy can suppress cellular transformation and subsequent tumor formation. However, the relationship between autophagy and cancer is complex and context-dependent. In some cases, autophagy may also promote tumor growth and survival. Cancer cells can exploit autophagy as a survival mechanism to overcome stress conditions, such as nutrient deprivation or chemotherapy, allowing them to maintain their growth and proliferative advantage. Overall, the role of autophagy in cancer prevention or promotion is still being actively researched, and more studies are needed to fully understand its impact on different cancer types and stages."},{"instruction":"Give example of in what kind of cancer it can promote tumor growth: \\"However, the relationship between autophagy and cancer is complex and context-dependent.

Cancer cells can exploit autophagy as a survival mechanism to overcome stress conditions, such as nutrient deprivation or chemotherapy, allowing them to maintain their growth and proliferative advantage.\\"","output":"One example of cancer where autophagy can promote tumor growth is pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer cells often exhibit high levels of autophagy, which helps them survive in the nutrient-depleted environment of the tumor. These cells can utilize autophagy to recycle cellular components and obtain essential nutrients, allowing them to sustain their growth and resistance to chemotherapy. Inhibiting autophagy in pancreatic cancer cells has shown promise as a therapeutic strategy to sensitize tumors to treatment and reduce their growth."},{"instruction":"Please give me 5 examples: “However, the relationship between autophagy and cancer is complex and context-dependent. In some cases, autophagy may also promote tumor growth and survival. Cancer cells can exploit autophagy as a survival mechanism to overcome stress conditions, such as nutrient deprivation or chemotherapy, allowing them to maintain their growth and proliferative advantage.”","output":"Certainly! Here are five examples of cancers in which autophagy can promote tumor growth and survival: 1. Breast cancer: In certain circumstances, breast cancer cells can enhance autophagy to survive under nutrient-deprived conditions or after chemotherapy, enabling them to maintain their growth and resistance to treatment. 2. Lung cancer: Autophagy can be exploited by lung cancer cells to adapt to hypoxic (low oxygen) conditions within tumors. By activating autophagy, cancer cells can utilize alternative energy sources and survive in unfavorable microenvironments. 3. Ovarian cancer: Ovarian cancer cells can exploit autophagy to escape nutrient starvation caused by reduced blood supply to tumors. This can help them maintain their proliferative advantage and resistance to therapy. 4. Melanoma: Autophagy has been shown to support the survival and drug resistance of melanoma cells. Inhibition of autophagy in melanoma tumors has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy to sensitize the cancer cells to treatment. 5. Colorectal cancer: Autophagy can play a dual role in colorectal cancer, depending on the stage and context. In early stages, autophagy may act as a protective mechanism preventing tumor initiation. However, in advanced stages, autophagy can be hijacked by cancer cells to aid their survival, metastasis, and resistance to therapies. It's important to note that the role of autophagy in cancer is highly complex, and the effects can vary depending on the specific cancer type, stage, and microenvironment. Further research is needed to better understand the intricacies of autophagy in different types of cancer."},{"instruction":"Can autophagy cause cancer?","output":"While autophagy is generally considered a protective mechanism against cancer, there is growing evidence suggesting that dysregulated or defective autophagy can contribute to cancer development. Impaired autophagy can lead to the accumulation of damaged organelles, proteins, and dysfunctional mitochondria, which can promote genomic instability and increase the risk of cancer. Additionally, defective autophagy can disrupt the balance between cell survival and cell death, potentially allowing damaged cells to persist and develop into cancerous cells. Furthermore, certain genetic mutations in autophagy-related genes have been linked to increased susceptibility to cancer. For example, mutations in the autophagy gene BECN1 have been associated with various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. However, it's important to note that autophagy dysfunction alone is not considered a common cause of cancer. It is more often a contributing factor or an effect of other underlying conditions, such as genetic alterations or disrupted cellular signaling pathways. Overall, while autophagy is a normal cellular process that helps maintain cellular homeostasis and prevents cancer, dysregulated autophagy or genetic alterations in autophagy-related genes can potentially contribute to cancer development in certain contexts."},{"instruction":"Hello Doug No doubt you received a letter. 4 September 2023, from Clover Moore re proposal to plant trees on Dibbs Street.

Economy: Southern communities revolved primarily around plantations, which were large agricultural estates cultivating crops such as tobacco, rice, and indigo in the early colonial period, and later on, cotton using slave labor. The plantation system was heavily reliant on enslaved labor and often operated as self-sustaining units. In contrast, northern communities had a more diverse economic base, including trade, manufacturing, and commerce. Towns in the North were often centers of industry and economic activity. 2. Size: Plantations in the South were vast expanses of land, often measuring several hundred acres, sometimes even thousands. They were large enough to support a considerable workforce and had extensive agricultural operations. In contrast, towns in the North were much smaller in size, with concentrated populations and a compact layout. The size and scale of plantations necessitated a different way of organizing the community compared to the more compact and organized towns in the North. 3. Social Structure: Southern communities centered around plantations had a hierarchical social structure. Large planters, who owned the plantations, held significant power and wealth, while enslaved people formed the labor force at the bottom of the social ladder. In contrast, northern towns had a more egalitarian and less rigid social structure, with opportunities for social mobility and economic advancement. 4. Cultural and Social Life: Plantations in the South were often isolated from each other due to the distance between them, leading to a rather isolated social life. Plantation owners would socialize among themselves and participate in events such as balls and parties. In contrast, northern towns were centers of social activity, with markets, shops, theaters, and other cultural institutions bringing people together regularly. 5. Political Influence: Due to their wealth and control over large amounts of land, plantation owners in the South held significant political power. They often dominated state legislatures and influenced national politics, defending their economic interests, including the preservation of slavery. In the North, political power was more broadly distributed and influenced by a variety of interests, including those of merchants, industrialists, and laborers. While these are general characteristics, it is important to note that there was also diversity within both northern and southern communities, with variations in the extent of plantation economies and towns' size and characteristics. Additionally, these characteristics evolved and changed over time as the nation grew and faced new economic and social challenges."},{"instruction":"assess how the willingness to challenge established religious hierarchies during the great awakening might have contributed to the revolutionary spirit (APUSH)","output":"The willingness to challenge established religious hierarchies during the Great Awakening played a significant role in contributing to the revolutionary spirit in colonial America. Here are several ways in which this connection can be assessed: 1. Questioning Authority: The religious revivalist movement of the Great Awakening challenged the authority of traditional religious hierarchies, such as the Anglican Church in England and the established Congregational Church in New England. Preachers like George Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards emphasized personal religious experiences, direct communication with God, and individual salvation, encouraging people to question the authority of clergy and traditional religious institutions. This spirit of questioning authority and established hierarchies would later extend to challenging British authority in political matters. 2. Equality and Democratic Ideals: The Great Awakening emphasized that all individuals, regardless of social status or wealth, could experience a personal connection with God and achieve salvation. This focus on equality and the individual's relationship with God served as a powerful catalyst for broader societal and political equality. It encouraged the idea that all individuals were worthy of equal rights and opportunities, including political representation and self-governance. 3. Popular Participation and Mobilization: The Great Awakening engendered a sense of personal agency and active participation among the colonists. Common people began organizing religious meetings, Bible studies, and revivals without relying solely on established churches or clergy. This grassroots mobilization and self-reliance fostered a sense of empowerment and self-governance, laying the groundwork for broader participation in political affairs and resistance against British rule during the Revolutionary period. 4. Spread of Revolutionary Ideas: The itinerant preachers who traveled from town to town to spread the Great Awakening message became important channels for disseminating radical ideas of liberty, freedom, and resistance against oppressive authority. They used the language of spiritual salvation to convey political ideas, laying the foundation for a rhetorical framework that would later be applied to the quest for political independence from Britain. 5. Inspiration for Revolutionary Leaders: Many future leaders of the American Revolution experienced the Great Awakening and were influenced by its ideas of personal liberty, individualism, and resistance against wrongful authority. Figures like Samuel Adams, John Adams, and George Washington were exposed to the Awakening's radical theology and the concept of challenging established hierarchies. These leaders would later use similar arguments to justify opposition to British rule and advocate for revolutionary ideas. Overall, the willingness to challenge established religious hierarchies during the Great Awakening provided a fertile ground for the growth of revolutionary sentiment in colonial America. It fostered ideas of individual liberties, equality, resistance to authority, and self-governance, which would profoundly influence the emergence of the revolutionary spirit and the eventual fight for independence."},{"instruction":"identify the enlightenment and evaluate the significance of enlightenment philosophy in the development of the revolutionary crisis. (APUSH)","output":"The Enlightenment was an intellectual and philosophical movement that emerged in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was characterized by a focus on reason, science, and individual rights, challenging traditional authority, and advocating for social, political, and economic reforms. In the American context, the Enlightenment played a significant role in shaping the revolutionary crisis in various ways: 1. Influence on Political Thought: Enlightenment philosophy, particularly the works of thinkers like John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Baron de Montesquieu, influenced American colonists' political thought and helped shape their ideas about government and individual rights. The concepts of natural rights, social contract theory, and the separation of powers found in Enlightenment writings provided a theoretical foundation for challenging British authority and advocating for self-governance and representative democracy. 2. Critique of Monarchy and Arbitrary Rule: The Enlightenment thinkers strongly criticized absolute monarchy and arbitrary rule, emphasizing that governments should derive their authority from the consent of the governed. Colonists in America, inspired by these ideas, increasingly viewed British rule as oppressive and inconsistent with the principles of reason and justice promoted by the Enlightenment. This critique of monarchy provided intellectual ammunition for resistance and the pursuit of independence. 3. Influence on Revolutionary Rhetoric: The language and rhetoric of the Enlightenment were prominent in the writings and speeches of American revolutionary leaders. Figures like Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Paine drew on Enlightenment principles to articulate grievances against British rule and advocate for freedom, equality, and natural rights. For example, Jefferson's Declaration of Independence reflects Enlightenment ideas about unalienable rights and the right to overthrow a tyrannical government. 4. Emphasis on Science and Reason: Enlightenment thinkers championed empirical observation, scientific inquiry, and the use of reason to understand and improve the world. This emphasis on reason and scientific progress spurred many American colonists to question traditional beliefs, including religious dogma and unquestioned allegiance to authority. It fostered a skeptical mindset that encouraged critical reflection on social and political structures, ultimately laying the groundwork for the revolutionary crisis. 5. Dissemination of Ideas: Enlightenment ideas spread through various means, including books, pamphlets, and social gatherings like salons. The printing press facilitated the wide circulation of Enlightenment texts, making these ideas accessible to a broader audience. As colonists became increasingly exposed to Enlightenment philosophy and its ideals, it helped galvanize a collective consciousness that challenged the existing social and political order. The significance of Enlightenment philosophy in the development of the revolutionary crisis lies in its profound influence on American colonists' understanding of rights, government, and freedom. It provided a philosophical framework for justifying resistance to oppressive rule, inspiring colonists to assert their rights and pursue greater self-determination. The Enlightenment contributed to the intellectual and ideological foundation upon which the American Revolution was ultimately based and played a pivotal role in shaping the values and principles of the new American nation."},{"instruction":"what is congregationalism from an APUSH perspective","output":"From an APUSH (AP U.S. History) perspective, Congregationalism refers to a form of Protestant Christian church governance that played a significant role in the early development of New England colonies. Here are the key points to consider: 1. Origins: Congregationalism traces its roots to the Puritan movement in England in the 16th and 17th centuries. Puritans sought to reform the Church of England and establish a more pure and righteous form of worship. When a group of Puritans migrated to New England in the early 17th century, they established their own independent churches based on the principles of Congregationalism. 2. Church Governance: Congregationalism is centered on the autonomy of local churches. Each congregation is independent and self-governing, making decisions collectively at the local level. Church members, rather than external hierarchies, have authority in matters such as selecting pastors, making policy decisions, and interpreting scripture. 3. Influence on New England Colonies: Congregationalism became the dominant religious and social institution in New England, particularly in Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Puritans, who practiced Congregationalism, sought to create a society guided by their religious beliefs. They established the Massachusetts Bay Colony as a \\"City upon a Hill,\\" aiming to build a model community based on their interpretation of the Bible and Congregationalist principles. 4. Tensions with other Religious Groups: The religious dominance of Congregationalism in New England led to tensions with other religious groups. Dissenting groups such as Quakers, Baptists, and Anglicans faced discrimination and persecution in the region due to their differing theological beliefs and practice of worship. This conflict over religious freedom and the establishment of Congregationalism played a role in the development of religious pluralism and the concept of separation of church and state in American political thought. 5. Impact on Democracy: The principles of Congregationalism contributed to the development of a democratic culture in New England. The system of church governance, which emphasized the participation of all members in decision-making, fostered a sense of community and self-governance. This democratic mindset would later influence the political structure of New England colonies and have a lasting impact on American political ideals. Overall, Congregationalism played a significant role in shaping the religious, social, and political landscape of the New England colonies. It was an integral part of the distinct religious and cultural identity of the region and contributed to the development of democratic principles in early America."},{"instruction":"[SAMPLE CHAPTER] I first met Dean not long after my wife and I split up. I had just gotten over a serious illness that I won’t bother to talk about, except that it had something to do with the miserably weary split-up and my feeling that everything was dead. With the coming of Dean Moriarty began the part of my life you could call my life on the road. Before that I’d often dreamed of going West to see the country, always vaguely planning and never taking off. Dean is the perfect guy for the road because he actually was born on the road, when his parents were passing through Salt Lake City in 1926, in a jalopy, on their way to Los Angeles. First reports of him came to me through Chad King, who’d shown me a few letters from him written in a New Mexico reform school. I was tremendously interested in the letters because they so naively and sweetly asked Chad to teach him all about Nietzsche and all the wonderful intellectual things that Chad knew. At one point Carlo and I talked about the letters and wondered if we would ever meet the strange Dean Moriarty. This is all far back, when Dean was not the way he is today, when he was a young jailkid shrouded in mystery. Then news came that Dean was out of reform school and was coming to New York for the first time; also there was talk that he had just married a girl called Marylou. One day I was hanging around the campus and Chad and Tim Gray told me Dean was staying in a cold-water pad in East Harlem, the Spanish Harlem. Dean had arrived the night before, the first time in New York, with his beautiful little sharp chick Marylou; they got off the Greyhound bus at 50th Street and cut around the corner looking for a place to eat and went right in Hector’s, and since then Hector’s cafeteria has always been a big symbol of New York for Dean. They spent money on beautiful big glazed cakes and creampuffs. All this time Dean was telling Marylou things like this: “Now, darling, here we are in New York and although I haven’t quite told you everything that I was thinking about when we crossed Missouri and especially at the point when we passed the Boon ville reformatory which reminded me of my jail problem, it is absolutely necessary now to postpone all those leftover things concerning our personal lovethings and at once begin thinking of specific worklife plans . . .” and so on in the way that he had in those early days. I went to the cold-water flat with the boys, and Dean came to the door in his shorts. Marylou was jumping off the couch; Dean had dispatched the occupant of the apartment to the kitchen, probably to make coffee, while he proceeded with his love-problems, for to him sex was the one and only holy and important thing in life, although he had to sweat and curse to make a living and so on. You saw that in the way he stood bobbing his head, always looking down, nodding, like a young boxer to instructions, to make you think he was listening to every word, throwing in a thousand “Yeses” and “That’s rights.” My first impression of Dean was of a young Gene Autry—trim, thin-hipped, blue-eyed, with a real Oklahoma accent—a sideburned hero of the snowy West. In fact he’d just been working on a ranch, Ed Wall’s in Colorado, before marrying Marylou and coming East. Marylou was a pretty blonde with immense ringlets of hair like a sea of golden tresses; she sat there on the edge of the couch with her hands hanging in her lap and her smoky blue country eyes fixed in a wide stare because she was in an evil gray New York pad that she’d heard about back West, and waiting like a longbodied emaciated Modigliani surrealist woman in a serious room. But, outside of being a sweet little girl, she was awfully dumb and capable of doing horrible things. That night we all drank beer and pulled wrists and talked till dawn, and in the morning, while we sat around dumbly smoking butts from ashtrays in the gray light of a gloomy day, Dean got up nervously, paced around, thinking, and decided the thing to do was to have Marylou make breakfast and sweep the floor. “In other words we’ve got to get on the ball, darling, what I’m saying, otherwise it’ll be fluctuating and lack of true knowledge or crystallization of our plans.” Then I went away. During the following week he confided in Chad King that he absolutely had to learn how to write from him; Chad said I was a writer and he should come to me for advice. Meanwhile Dean had gotten a job in a parking lot, had a fight with Marylou in their Hoboken apartment—God knows why they went there—and she was so mad and so down deep vindictive that she reported to the police some false trumped-up hysterical crazy charge, and Dean had to lam from Hoboken. So he had no place to live. He came right out to Paterson, New Jersey, where I was living with my aunt, and one night while I was studying there was a knock on the door, and there was Dean, bowing, shuffling obsequiously in the dark of the hall, and saying, “Hel-lo, you remember me—Dean Moriarty? I’ve come to ask you to show me how to write.” “And where’s Marylou?” I asked, and Dean said she’d apparently whored a few dollars together and gone back to Denver—“the whore!” So we went out to have a few beers because we couldn’t talk like we wanted to talk in front of my aunt, who sat in the living room reading her paper. She took one look at Dean and decided that he was a madman. In the bar I told Dean, “Hell, man, I know very well you didn’t come to me only to want to become a writer, and after all what do I really know about it except you’ve got to stick to it with the energy of a benny addict.” And he said, “Yes, of course, I know exactly what you mean and in fact all those problems have occurred to me, but the thing that I want is the realization of those factors that should one depend on Schopenhauer’s dichotomy for any inwardly realized . . .” and so on in that way, things I understood not a bit and he himself didn’t. In those days he really didn’t know what he was talking about; that is to say, he was a young jailkid all hung-up on the wonderful possibilities of becoming a real intellectual, and he liked to talk in the tone and using the words, but in a jumbled way, that he had heard from “real intellectuals” —although, mind you, he wasn’t so naive as that in all other things, and it took, him just a few months with Carlo Marx to become completely in there with all the terms and jargon. END OF CHAPTER [/SAMPLE CHAPTER] [CHARACTERS] 1. **William (23 years old)**: William is a 23-year-old with dark brown hair and hazel eyes, often seen wearing casual attire that reflects his youthful spirit. He is writer and the boyfriend of Kimberly Miceli. He possesses an earnest demeanor with a tall, lanky frame, and his boyish charm is accentuated by a friendly smile that hints at his sense of adventure. 2. **Peter: Peter is William’s father. Peter is Carol’s wife. Peter was swapped into the body of Kimberly. 3. **Kimberly Miceli **: She is Peter, William’s father, swapped into the body of his friend Kimberly. Kimberly is described as a young woman in her early thirties with striking dark hair that flows like a wavy cascade. Her country girl frame is complemented by freckles that pepper her fair complexion. She is marginally intelligent, but makes up for it with her quick witt. Her wardrobe typically consists of relaxed farm attire, reflecting her rural lifestyle in Kansas City. Her favorite phrases are “You’re not an asshole, you’re the whole ass.” “No sir.” “Poop sticks.” and “I’m so sorry, very sorry.” She refers to William as her “Sweetest boy in the world.” 4. **Tony**: Tony, William's coworker and an antique dealer, is in his early 40s, with a stylish yet slightly disheveled appearance. He sports a well-groomed beard and short, dark hair, which, coupled with his penchant for vintage clothing, gives him an eclectic, artistic aura. His slender frame carries an air of elegance that befits his profession. When Peter is changed into Kimberly, Tony develops feelings for Kimberly. Tony talks with Boston slang and tries to impress Kimberly with his corvette and the fact that he was in a band in his teenage years. 5. **Mike (65 years old)**: Mike, the older man Kimberly marries, is in his mid-60s. He has a rugged appearance, with a weathered face that speaks of a life spent running a welding company. He is a heartless man who marries Kimberly to try and get her farm. His tall and somewhat stocky build adds a sense of stability to his character, and he often dresses in practical, comfortable attire befitting a camper owner. He will do anything to keep Kimberly as his own wife. 6. **Carol**: Carol, Peter's wife, is around 50 years old, with a warm and welcoming smile that complements her graying hair and gentle brown eyes. She has a graceful presence, often seen wearing conservative yet tasteful clothing that reflects her role as a supportive spouse and mother. She is straight, but when she finds out that Peter is now in the body of Kimberly Miceli, she adjust her taste to be attracted to the new Kimberly. [/CHARACTERS] [CHAPTER BEAT] **Chapter 7: Coping with Change** Chapter 7 The body swap had left them all in a state of bewilderment. Kimberly, now free from Mike's clutches, was trying to come to terms with her new life as Kimberly. She couldn't shake off the memory of Mike's advances, his desire for her to bear his children. It was a chapter of her life she was determined to forget. She sat down with William in the cozy living room, seeking solace in his comforting presence. \\"Sweetest boy in the world,\\" Kimberly said, her voice filled with emotion as she recounted her ordeal with Mike. She knew she could confide in William, who was both her partner and her rock in these trying times. William listened intently, his dark brown eyes reflecting his concern. \\"I can't even imagine what you went through, Kimberly,\\" he said softly. \\"But we're together now, and we'll figure this out.\\" Kimberly nodded, a glimmer of hope in her eyes. Each of them faced unique challenges in their swapped bodies, but they were determined to navigate this strange new world together. Meanwhile, Tony, the antique dealer with a penchant for vintage clothing, was trying to find common ground with Kimberly. He had developed an unexpected romantic interest in her since the body swap. Tony leaned in closer, his voice tinged with a Boston slang accent as he tried to impress her. \\"Kimberly, you know, I used to have this slick corvette back in the day,\\" Tony said, a hint of nostalgia in his eyes. \\"And I was in a rock band when I was a kid. You'd have loved the music we played.\\" Kimberly couldn't help but chuckle. \\"Tony, you're a nice guy, but you're just not my type,\\" she replied with a teasing smile. Her heart still belonged to Carol, and she had no intention of straying. When William wasn't around, Tony would often find himself alone with Kimberly, attempting to sweep her off her feet. He admired her beauty and charisma, but Kimberly remained resolute in her loyalty to Carol. One evening, they took a romantic walk together, the city's lights casting a soft glow around them. Tony couldn't resist the temptation any longer. He gently pressed Kimberly against a wall, their faces inches apart. Their breaths quickened as they felt a surge of passion between them. But Kimberly pulled away, her hazel eyes filled with determination. \\"Tony, I can't do this. My heart belongs to Carol,\\" she said firmly. Tony sighed, understanding the boundaries. He respected Kimberly's choice, even though it left him yearning for something he couldn't have. As the days passed, their collective goal remained clear—to find a way to reverse the body swap. Each character faced their own unique challenges, awkward situations, and moments of self-discovery. They clung to the hope that someday, they would return to their true selves. One evening, as William, Kimberly, and Tony returned home, they were met with a surprising sight. Carol stood at the doorstep, her warm smile contrasting with her perplexed expression. \\"Kimberly, come inside,\\" Carol said gently, extending her hand. William followed Tony inside to give them some privacy. Carol couldn't help but look at Kimberly with a newfound sense of admiration. \\"You're a very beautiful woman,\\" she said sincerely. \\"I hope you're happy now.\\" Kimberly, still adjusting to her new reality, felt a mixture of emotions. She asked if she could take a shower to wash away the remnants of her past life. Carol watched as Kimberly showered, her thoughts wandering. She realized that this beautiful woman had once been her husband. When Kimberly emerged from the shower, Carol gently dried her off and sat her down. \\"Kimberly, let me explain your new anatomy as a woman,\\" Carol said patiently. She wanted to make this transition as smooth as possible for her partner. Kimberly nodded, grateful for Carol's understanding. As Carol spoke, Kimberly couldn't help but appreciate the love and care that still existed between them. She leaned in for a kiss, but Carol hesitated, her own adjustment ongoing. That night, Kimberly lay beside Carol, feeling her warmth and the steady rhythm of her heartbeat. It was a complex journey they were on, but they were determined to find their way back to each other, no matter the challenges they faced.

After Siddhartha Gautama achieved enlightenment and became the Buddha, his teachings began to spread and gain followers. Through these followers, the image of the Buddha evolved over time, eventually leading to the development of a rich mythology and a deification of the figure. Several factors contributed to the deification of the Buddha and his elevated status within Buddhist traditions: 1. Devotional practices: As Buddhism spread, devotion to the Buddha and his teachings became an integral part of the religious experience. Devotees would build statues and images of the Buddha, offer prayers, and seek blessings from him. This devotion gradually elevated his status to that of a transcendent being. 2. Legendary accounts: Over time, various legendary accounts and stories surrounding the Buddha's life and accomplishments emerged. These stories often portrayed him as possessing supernatural knowledge, performing miracles, and having immense spiritual power. These embellishments contributed to the perception of the Buddha as a divine or celestial figure. 3. Mahayana Buddhism: The development of Mahayana Buddhism, one of the major branches of Buddhism, further introduced the concept of Buddha as a celestial being. In Mahayana scriptures, Buddhas are seen as celestial beings who have attained enlightenment and actively work for the liberation of all sentient beings. 4. Cultural assimilation: As Buddhism spread to different regions, it assimilated local beliefs and practices, which further added to the divine attributes associated with the Buddha. For example, in some East Asian countries, the Buddha became fused with local deities, resulting in the creation of celestial figures such as Amitabha Buddha and Avalokiteshvara. It's important to note that while the Buddha is revered and worshipped in various Buddhist traditions, he is not considered a creator deity like Zeus or Odin. Buddhists generally perceive the Buddha as a supremely enlightened being who has transcended the cycle of rebirth but may not possess the same powers or attributes as traditional deities."},{"instruction":"When concerning religious founders, one can identify Christianity beginning with Jesus Christ, Islam with the Prophet Muhammad and Buddhism with Siddhartha Gautama, but why is Judaism a little harder to pinpoint, as some can point it to beginning with Abraham, others with Moses, and more?","output":"The difficulty in pinpointing the exact beginning of Judaism is due to its complex historical development and the absence of a single founder figure. Judaism is an ancient religion with roots dating back thousands of years, and its origins are intertwined with the history and experiences of the Jewish people. Abraham is often considered a significant figure in the early history of Judaism. According to biblical accounts, he made a covenant with God and is regarded as the patriarch of the Jewish people. Abraham's descendants, particularly his son Isaac and grandson Jacob (also known as Israel), are seen as the ancestors of the Israelites, who later formed the twelve tribes of Israel. Moses is another pivotal figure in Jewish history. He is traditionally believed to have received the Torah, the foundational religious text of Judaism, directly from God on Mount Sinai. Moses led the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and played a crucial role in their journey to the Promised Land. While Abraham and Moses are significant figures, it is important to note that Judaism did not emerge fully formed with them. The development of Judaism as a distinct religious tradition was a gradual process influenced by various historical, cultural, and theological factors. Judaism evolved over centuries, incorporating elements from ancient Near Eastern religions, cultural practices, and the experiences of the Jewish people. The Hebrew Bible, which includes the Torah, Prophets, and Writings, played a central role in shaping Jewish beliefs, practices, and identity. Additionally, the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem in 586 BCE and the subsequent exile of the Jewish people to Babylon marked a significant turning point in Jewish history. During this period, the Jewish community faced challenges and underwent transformations that contributed to the development of Judaism as we know it today. In summary, Judaism's origins are multifaceted and intertwined with the experiences of the Jewish people throughout history. While figures like Abraham and Moses played crucial roles, the religion's development was a gradual process shaped by various factors, making it harder to pinpoint a single starting point."},{"instruction":"Some claim that the first thing a Muslim does when entering a new society is build a mosque and make others in that society Muslim like them, yet while may have happened, there are also instances of Muslim presence wherein conversion was not a priority, so why is the former often persisted as being a tenet of Muslims and Islam?","output":"The claim that the first thing Muslims do when entering a new society is to build a mosque and convert others to Islam is a generalization that does not accurately represent the diversity of Muslim experiences and historical contexts. While there have been instances throughout history where mosques were built and conversions took place, it is not a universal or exclusive characteristic of Muslims or Islam. It is important to recognize that Islam is a global religion with a rich and varied history spanning over 1,400 years. Muslim communities have existed in diverse regions and have interacted with different cultures, societies, and political contexts. The actions and priorities of Muslims in these various contexts have been shaped by a range of factors, including local customs, political dynamics, and individual motivations. In some cases, Muslim communities have indeed built mosques as places of worship and centers for their religious and social activities. Mosques serve as important community spaces for Muslims to gather, pray, and engage in religious and educational activities. However, the construction of mosques does not necessarily imply an intention to convert others or impose Islam on the local population. Furthermore, throughout history, Muslim presence in various societies has been characterized by a range of interactions, including peaceful coexistence, cultural exchange, and collaboration. Muslims have often lived alongside people of different faiths and engaged in trade, scholarship, and other aspects of daily life without seeking to convert others. The persistence of the claim that Muslims prioritize building mosques and converting others may stem from a combination of factors, including stereotypes, misunderstandings, and biased narratives. It is crucial to approach such claims critically and recognize the diversity of Muslim experiences and practices throughout history and across different regions."},{"instruction":"第一三共減ヘルスケアという会社です。コンプライアンスの向上に向け、コンプライアンス管理部から各事業所訪問を計画していましたが、中止になりました。代替の効果的なコンプライアンス向上施策を教えてください。","output":"代替の効果的なコンプライアンス向上施策は、以下のようなものが考えられます。 1. リモートトレーニング：オンラインベースのトレーニングやウェビナーを通じて、従業員にコンプライアンスに関する情報を提供し、意識を向上させることができます。 2. ポリシーとガイドラインの再確認：従業員に対して、コンプライアンスに関連するポリシーやガイドラインを再確認し、従うよう周知徹底します。 3. コンプライアンスヘルプデスクの設置：従業員が疑問や懸念を持った場合に、専門の担当者とコミュニケーションすることができるヘルプデスクを設置します。 4. 匿名の報告ルートの強化：従業員が不正行為や違反の報告を行いやすい環境を整えるため、匿名報告ルートの強化や情報提供者の保護を行います。 5. コンプライアンスに関する意識向上キャンペーンの展開：SNSや社内ポータルなどを活用して、コンプライアンスに関する情報や啓発活動を行います。 これらの施策を組み合わせることで、中止になった訪問計画の代替として効果的なコンプライアンス向上施策を展開することができます。ただし、具体的な適用方法や内容は、組織の文化やニーズに合わせてカスタマイズすることが重要です。"},{"instruction":"[Format your response using markdown.

Similar to Rolfe Kanefsky's short film 'Mood Boobs', she wishes that her figure would physically transform depending on her mood.","output":"Chapter 1: The Enigmatic Stone In the bustling city of Aurelia, nestled amidst towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, lived a woman named Amelia. With her petite frame and wavy chestnut locks, Amelia was content with her appearance. She had always embraced her natural beauty and never felt the need to conform to society's unrealistic ideals. One sunny afternoon, Amelia found herself wandering through an eccentric antique shop tucked away in a quiet corner of the city. The shop was a treasure trove of curiosities, filled with remnants of forgotten eras. As she perused the vast array of artifacts, her eyes fell upon a peculiar stone tucked away in the corner of a dusty shelf. The stone's multifaceted surface shone with an otherworldly luminescence, drawing Amelia's gaze like a mystical magnet. Absorbed by its ethereal beauty, she gingerly picked it up, feeling its cool weight in her hand. The stone seemed to hum with an energy she couldn't quite comprehend. Curiosity overpowering her, Amelia approached the old shopkeeper, Mr. Thornhurst. He was an enigmatic man, wearing spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of his nose, with an unruly beard that cascaded down to his chest. His deep, wise eyes seemed to hold secrets untold. \\"I couldn't help but notice this stone,\\" Amelia began tentatively, holding it out to Mr. Thornhurst. \\"What can you tell me about it?\\" Mr. Thornhurst turned his gaze to the stone, and a knowing smile played across his lips. \\"Ah, the stone of transformation,\\" he murmured. \\"Legend has it that this magical stone has the power to grant a single wish to the one who possesses it.\\" Amelia's eyes widened with intrigue. \\"A wish?\\" she echoed, her voice barely above a whisper. \\"What kind of wish?\\" \\"The stone possesses the ability to physically transform its owner depending on their mood,\\" Mr. Thornhurst explained. \\"If one were to make a wish for their figure to mirror their emotions, the stone would grant their desire. But be warned, my dear, for the transformation will be as unpredictable as the shifting shades of a kaleidoscope.\\" Amelia's mind whirled with thoughts of the possibilities this mystical stone could offer. She had always believed that a person's beauty stemmed from their inner happiness and confidence, rather than their appearance alone. With a gentle nod, she made her decision. Mr. Thornhurst mirrored Amelia's nod, acknowledging her choice. With a flicker of excitement in his eyes, he spoke solemnly, \\"Once you make a wish upon this stone, there is no turning back. Your life will never be the same.\\" Amelia's resolve remained unswayed, and she clasped the stone tightly in her hand. A surge of warmth pulsed through her as she closed her eyes, focusing on her deepest desire. Her mind swam with visions of embracing her emotions fully, unafraid to be vulnerable and expressive. With a decisive breath, she whispered her wish into the vast expanse of the universe. \\"I wish for my figure to physically transform according to my mood,\\" she proclaimed, her voice rippling with both trepidation and excitement. A moment of silence enveloped the shop before an indescribable force seemed to ripple through Amelia's veins. The stone pulsated with an ethereal glow, affirming the fulfillment of her wish. The journey into the unknown had begun, setting in motion a chain of events that would forever alter Amelia's existence. Little did she know that Amelia's wish would challenge her perceptions of beauty, push the boundaries of self-acceptance, and ultimately lead her on a remarkable path of self-discovery. And so, with the stone firmly in her possession, Amelia stepped out of the antique shop, her heart brimming with both anticipation and apprehension, ready to face the consequences of her choice in an ever-changing world of shifting desires."},{"instruction":"Throughout chapter 2 Amelia undergoes some transformations within her own home. She answers a phone call from a male friend; when she asks what he's up to, he tells her he is working out. Playing with her hair, she pictures the workout and her feelings cause her bosom to grow slowly throughout the conversation. Eventually Amelia notices and thinks up an excuse to hang up. As she rushes to the mirror, she sees the full scope of the transformation and is incredulous. She verifies that the change is real, then checks the instructions that came with the stone. They aren't that useful but over the course of 5 minutes she can already feel the reversal process begin, even if it is at a glacial pace. She then has another incident where a letter makes her frustrated, which causes a different change than before. End of chapter 2.","output":"Chapter 2: Transformation Unleashed Amelia stepped inside her cozy apartment, clutching the enigmatic stone tightly in her hand. The weight of her wish hung heavy in the air as she contemplated the magnitude of what she had set in motion. With each passing moment, her heart raced in anticipation of the unknown transformations that awaited her. As she settled into her favorite armchair, her phone buzzed with an incoming call. Seeing the name of her dear friend, Benjamin, flashing on the screen, she smiled and answered, unaware of the peculiar twist their conversation would take. \\"Hey, Amelia, what's going on?\\" Benjamin's voice rang through the phone, his tone filled with cheerful enthusiasm. Amelia instinctively played with a strand of her hair, a gesture that often accompanied her moments of deep thought. Little did she know, her innocent gesture would evoke a connection between her emotions and her newly acquired ability. \\"Oh, not much,\\" she replied casually, unaware of the brewing transformation. \\"What about you? What are you up to?\\" Benjamin chuckled. \\"Honestly, I'm just in the middle of my workout routine. Trying to get in shape, you know?\\" Amelia's mind instantly conjured an image of Benjamin working up a sweat, focusing on his muscular physique. In that moment, a subtle warmth began to surge through her body, and a tingle of sensation tickled her chest. As the conversation continued, Amelia's bosom began to grow slowly and subtly, responding to the growing desire she felt deep within. She tried her best to remain composed, hoping that Benjamin wouldn't notice the physical changes she was undergoing. But in her inner turmoil and mounting confusion, Amelia's mind struggled to concentrate on the conversation. Thoughts raced through her head, ricocheting with each passing moment. She needed to end the call before things spiraled out of control. \\"Hey, Ben, I just remembered that I have some urgent things to take care of. Can we catch up later?\\" Amelia interjected hurriedly. Benjamin, caught off guard, agreed to postpone their conversation. Amelia's heart pounded in her chest as she hung up the phone, her curiosity and apprehension reaching a fever pitch. She rushed toward the full-length mirror hanging on her bedroom wall, desperate to catch a glimpse of the bewildering transformation she had experienced. As Amelia beheld her reflection, her eyes widened in disbelief. Her bosom, once petite and unassuming, had grown considerably, lusciously curvaceous and undeniably attention-grabbing. She tentatively reached up to touch her transformed figure, her fingers grazing the curvaceous contours. Amelia's mind whirled, trying to make sense of what had happened. It wasn't just a figment of her imagination; her transformation was real. With a sense of urgency, she retrieved the hastily discarded instructions that came with the stone, hoping for some guidance. However, the instructions proved to be frustratingly cryptic, offering only vague hints without any concrete solutions. It seemed that she was left to navigate this uncharted territory on her own. As Amelia pondered the enigma before her, a strange calm settled upon her. She felt a gentle stirring within, a sense that the transformation she had experienced was a glimpse into a world she was destined to explore. With steely determination, she refocused her attention on the stone, noting that the changes were slowly reverting back to their original form. But Amelia knew that this was only the beginning. The stone had granted her a gift both awe-inspiring and perplexing, one that would accompany her on the rollercoaster journey of discovery. With newfound confidence, she ventured forth, eager to confront the challenges and revelations her evolving figure would bring. And so, as Amelia prepared to face the world anew, she couldn't help but wonder what transformations lay ahead when the fickle winds of emotion stirred her complex desires once again."},{"instruction":"In chapter 3, Amelia receives a letter in the post, which makes her frustrated.

The reassurance was exactly what she needed, confirming that she wasn't losing her mind and that her experiences were real. The transformation began to ebb, Amelia's figure returning to its original state, an ethereal remnant of her emotional outburst. Her heart swelled with a newfound sense of empowerment and the realization that she could control her physical form to some extent. As the room settled back to its ordinary state, Claire's mind settled into a whirlwind of questions, her curiosity unrivaled. Together, Amelia and Claire delved into deeper discussions, trying to unravel the mysteries of the stone, and how it affected Amelia's state of being.

With Benjamin's face still fresh in her thoughts, she closed her eyes, letting the feelings she had for him fill her heart. As Amelia focused on her emotions, her body responded as if it were a canvas being painted upon. Slowly and elegantly, her figure transformed, embodying the warmth and tenderness she felt whenever Benjamin was near.

Their names are Elliot and Ryan. The story is set in the Southern US in the 1990s. Elliot has messy black hair and brown eyes. He is dressed in a gray hoodie. He has a shy and quiet attitude. Ryan has spiky brown hair and green eyes. He is dressed in a varsity jacket and fingerless gloves. He has a seductive and rebellious attitude. He is taller than Elliot and he has a fit stature. Elliot is 18 and Ryan is 19.","output":"As the scorching summer sun beat down on the Southern US, Elliot and Ryan found themselves seeking solace from the oppressive heat at their summer school. Their encounters in the hallways and classrooms were laden with tension, hidden glances, and stolen moments that made their hearts race. It was just another sweltering day when Elliot decided to take refuge in the bathroom. Sweat trailed down his forehead as he leaned against the cool tiled wall, longing for some respite. The bathroom was dimly lit, the only source of light coming from the few small windows up high. The sounds of cicadas could be heard outside, their song blending with the quiet buzzing of the fluorescent lights. Just when Elliot thought he was alone, the door creaked open, and in walked Ryan. He was the embodiment of a summertime rebellion, his spiky brown hair tousled, a mischievous glint dancing in his green eyes. Ryan wore a varsity jacket, emblazoned with the letter R, casually draped over his broad shoulders. Fingerless gloves adorned his hands, a clear indication of his audacious nature. Locking eyes with Elliot, a playful smirk tugged at the corner of Ryan's lips. His seductive aura washed over the otherwise ordinary bathroom's atmosphere, causing Elliot's heart to skip a beat. He leaned against one of the sinks, emanating confidence. Elliot's shy and reserved nature made his heart race in the presence of Ryan's rebellious energy. His messy black hair fell over his eyes, a veil that concealed his own desires. He nervously fingered the sleeves of his gray hoodie, struggling to maintain composure in Ryan's presence. The room became charged with an undeniable tension. Inches apart, electricity crackled between them. A simple conversation about schoolwork quickly evolved into something deeper, their connection so palpable it was almost tangible. Elliot's voice wavered as he whispered, \\"Ryan, I... I've never felt this way before. I... I've been hiding these feelings for so long...\\" Ryan's hand reached out, effortlessly brushing a strand of Elliot's hair behind his ear. The warmth of his touch sent shivers down Elliot's spine. \\"I know, Elliot. I've felt it too,\\" Ryan murmured, his voice barely a whisper. Their eyes met once again, the vulnerability in Elliot's brown eyes mirrored by the longing in Ryan's green gaze. Slowly, hesitantly, they leaned in closer, their lips just a breath away from each other. Time seemed to stand still as their lips finally met in a tender and passionate kiss. It was a moment that defied the oppressive heat, washed away their fears and insecurities, and allowed their true selves to shine through. Their hearts beat as one, entwining their souls in a secret embrace, hidden away in the sanctuary of a bathroom. Outside, the cicadas sang a serenade, their song mingling with the echoes of the Southern summer. In that moment, Elliot and Ryan forgot about everything else; the world faded away, leaving only a love that bloomed in whispers, in stolen moments, and in a secret kiss shared in the confines of their summer school bathroom."},{"instruction":"Write the scene where they talk about how they managed to get sent to summer school.

The tree's branches danced lazily in the warm breeze, offering a serene backdrop to their conversation. Elliot lay, almost weightless, in the lap of Ryan, his head nestled against Ryan's chest. The free-spirited rebel gently ran his fingers through Elliot's messy black hair, offering a comforting touch. His green eyes sparkled with mischief as they exchanged glances, a shared understanding that their secret rendezvous among the branches of that tree was a sanctuary for their forbidden love. With a shy smile, Elliot finally took a deep breath and spoke, his voice barely above a whisper, \\"Ryan, how did we end up here, in summer school of all places?\\" Ryan let out a light chuckle, his voice vibrating through Elliot's frame as he spoke, \\"Well, you know me, always pushing boundaries and breaking the rules. I may have gone a little too far this time.\\" Elliot's brow furrowed in curiosity, amplifying his quiet demeanor. \\"What did you do, Ryan?\\" Ryan tilted his head back, his spiky brown hair brushing against the rough bark of the tree. He gazed up at the canopy of leaves, memories flickering in his green eyes. \\"Remember that time we climbed up Old Man Jenkins' dilapidated barn last month?\\" \\"How could I forget? It was exhilarating, but... risky.\\" Elliot replied, his voice tinged with a mix of worry and excitement. Ryan's lips curved into a mischievous smile. \\"Well, that old barn had a hidden treasure, Elliot. We found the stash of firecrackers that Old Man Jenkins used to keep from us pesky kids. You know me; I couldn't resist the temptation. We decided to light them up in the middle of the night, thinking we'd have our own little fireworks show.\\" Elliot couldn't help but let out a nervous laugh. \\"Oh, Ryan, I should have known you had something to do with that. It was amazing, though. The colors exploding against the night sky...\\" Ryan's expression softened, his eyes locked onto Elliot's. \\"But things didn't go exactly as planned. It was our bad luck that the police showed up right when the show was starting. And, well, you know the rest.\\" Elliot sighed, a mix of amusement and concern swimming in his brown eyes. \\"So, that's it. Our grand adventure led us straight into summer school. Who would have thought?\\" Ryan's fingers traced small circles on Elliot's arm, a calming gesture. \\"Yeah, but think about it, Elliot.

A place where we can be ourselves, even if just for a little while.\\" Elliot leaned into Ryan's touch, the worries of their current situation temporarily melting away. \\"You're right, Ryan. In a strange way, getting caught was the best thing that could have happened to us.\\" Their eyes locked again, communication flowing without words. As the branches of the tree offered them solace, hidden from the judgmental eyes of their town, Elliot and Ryan knew that their love was worth every struggle they faced.

Let's go for it. We can experience the adrenaline rush of the roller coasters, taste the sweetness of spun sugar, and laugh until our sides hurt on the carnival games.\\" Their decision made, they sealed it with a high-five, their eyes filled with shared excitement.

He sought to bridge different cultures and belief systems, bringing harmony to a world plagued by division and strife.

Li, having heard tales of this towering deity, ventured to meet him, carrying with him fragments of historical texts from Journey to the West. The meeting between Jesus and Li ignited a profound intellectual exchange. Jesus, being aware of his presence within different cultural narratives, sought to understand the implications of his extraordinary existence. Together, they explored parallels between the stories of Journey to the West and the Bible, as well as the enormous influence that religion had on shaping human history. Through their discussions, Jesus and Li found that the intertwining of their stories offered glimpses of universal truths that transcended time, space, and cultural boundaries. They discovered that despite their physical and geographical dissonance, their quest for spiritual enlightenment and the betterment of humanity united them.

A student trying out for a spot on a high school sports team is required to take a drug test before he can join. Legal Search Illegal Search Reasons: 7. In order to collect evidence, the police place a wiretap in a public phone booth frequently used by an individual who is suspected of illegal gambling. Legal Search Illegal Search Reasons: Using what you know about the Fourth Amendment, consider each of the following scenarios. Perform research to see if you can find a case that deals with the facts presented. Make a decision and provide your reasons and list the case or cases you found.","output":"1. Illegal Search: In this scenario, the police cannot enter the house without a warrant because the presence of the smell of burning marijuana and sounds of evidence being destroyed do not constitute exigent circumstances, such as a threat to public safety or the imminent destruction of evidence, which would justify a warrantless entry. - Case: Kentucky v. King (2011) 2. Legal Search: In this scenario, the search of the trash bags placed on the curb for garbage collection is legal because, under the \\"curtilage\\" doctrine, once the bags are left in an area accessible to the public, they generally lose the protection of privacy. Moreover, individuals generally have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their discarded trash. - Case: California v. Greenwood (1988) 3. Illegal Search: In this scenario, the search of the student's possessions by school officials is likely an illegal search because the mere allegation of smoking in the restroom, without additional evidence or reasonable suspicion of a broader threat, does not justify the invasion of the student's privacy rights. - Case: Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009) 4. Illegal Search: In this scenario, the search of the confiscated cell phone by school officials is likely an illegal search unless there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the cell phone contains evidence of a school policy violation or poses a threat to the safety of the students. - Case: Riley v. California (2014) 5. Illegal Search: In this scenario, requiring a potential candidate for state office to take a drug test before adding their name to the ballot is likely an illegal search because it violates the candidate's Fourth Amendment rights, as drug testing generally requires individualized suspicion or a special need beyond routine candidacy requirements. - Case: Chandler v. Miller (1997) 6. Legal Search: In this scenario, requiring a student trying out for a high school sports team to take a drug test is generally considered a legal search as long as the testing is based on an individualized suspicion or a legitimate concern for the safety and well-being of the students involved. - Case: Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton (1995) 7. Illegal Search: In this scenario, the placement of a wiretap in a public phone booth used by an individual suspected of illegal gambling is generally an illegal search without a warrant.

Just answer yes or no] \\"Societism Thesis: \\"War is the greatest possible evil and divisions between humanity are the cause of war, ergo divisions between humanity must be eliminated through the creation of a human culture based on universal commonalities.\\" Pablo Sanchez was incredibly vague, and seemed to believe that everyone around the world would basically realize this at the same time and just topple the old order in a global velvet revolution, but the Meridian Societist movement created much of the nuance of the ideology after his death. Symbolism: Sanchez wanted no symbol at all (and at most an empty flagpole), though the Combine uses black as a color (representing the combination of all colors) and a stylized Eye of Providence (a cross-culturally common symbol and also a representation of the ideology's class-collaborationism). In art a \\"Universal Human\\" is represented with green skin. Theory of History: The Four Societies The First Society- the tribe The Second Society- the city-state The Third Society- the nation-state The Final Society- the Societist world-state Organizational Structure: A world divided into randomly-designed Zones created to deliberately ignore historic national boundaries while having roughly equal population. Theoretically overseen by the meritocraticly appointed Zonal Rejes (who would rotate to avoid nationalist attachment), in practice power in the Combine was first centered on Alfarus and the position of Kapud, then the Biblioteka Mundial, though by the time of its destruction it was apparently working as originally designed. One consequence is that cities and natural features have no real names, on they're zone number, a modifier explaining what they are, and a seemingly randomly assigned number at the end. Economic Doctrine- Class collaborationist, with the lower classes supported by a universal job and housing guarantee and the private businesses of the upper class shorn of logos but otherwise allowed to operate under tight government supervision. Under the theory of Internal Completion parts are standardized between companies and a spoils system is used to funnel patronage to most of the companies competing for government contracts, while workers are required to use modified versions of their work-product in their daily lives to motivate high standards and attention to detail. Military Doctrine: Since war is the greatest evil the Combine only maintains a \\"self-defense force\\" in the form of the Celatores, though they're basically an army. Since they do kill people in the line of duty they are all under a death sentence, to be carried out at age 80 at the end of a long term in a luxury prison following their term of service. Tactically, Societism follows the Doctrine of the Last Throw, a policy of opportunistic expansion where intervention only follows in the wake of conflict between the nationalistically blinded and the Combine doesn't actually start any of the wars it finishes. Social Doctrine: Combine Societism is inherently anti-democratic, instead relying on a complex system of standardized tests to assign an individual a place within the system. Language Policy- Originally Sanchez wanted a reconstructed Proto-Indo European, but the science isn't there yet and the Combine instead uses Novalatina and exterminates all other languages in its territory. Cultural Policy- Only those cultural aspects with near universal historical global presence are inherently valid and part of the new Human Culture, from social structure to art to food. As a consequence the official religion of the Combine is the Universal Church, a pseudo-Christian denomination. Family Policy- The original social divide between the Familistas (who argued the nuclear family was near universal and therefore the standard) and the Garderistas (who argued human division was centered on the circumstances of birth and therefore all children should be raised in creches) was eventually resolved in favor of the Familistas, though Garderista policies are used to deal with the children of dissidents. One consequence is that the feminism of the early movement was replaced by strict gender conservatism. Deviationists: Societists that don't tow the party line are usually called \\"Gray Societists\\", and the expression of that tendency can vary. For example Danubia pursues Societism democratically and uses a more traditional Latin derivative, while the Eternal State seems to be creating a universalist Islamic sect. We have no idea what the Yapontsi will do but apparently all the other Societists think they're super weird.\\"","output":"Yes."},{"instruction":"[Format your response using markdown.

В данной части пункта 3 подразумевается детальное описание функций и ответственностей каждого члена команды организаторов, а также особенности их взаимодействия и координации. Организаторскую команду можно рассматривать как единое целое, в котором каждый участник имеет свою функцию и вкладывает свои усилия для достижения общей цели. Такая структура команды является эффективным инструментом для достижения успеха мероприятия, так как позволяет распределить задачи и обязанности среди специалистов с различными навыками и опытом. Одним из методов организационного планирования масштабных мероприятий является использование принципа делегирования полномочий и отображение организационной структуры команды. Такое отображение может быть представлено в виде иерархической диаграммы, дерева решений или организационной матрицы. Однако, важно понимать, что структура команды может быть различной в зависимости от конкретной ситуации и особенностей мероприятия. Среди основных ролей и должностей, которые могут включать команда организаторов, можно назвать следующие: 1. Проектный менеджер: отвечает за общее управление и планирование мероприятия. Он определяет общие цели и задачи, формулирует стратегию и сроки выполнения проекта, координирует работу команды организаторов. 2. Маркетинг-специалист: занимается разработкой и реализацией маркетинговой стратегии, проведением рекламных кампаний и продвижением мероприятия. Он следит за активностью и интересом аудитории, разрабатывает привлекательный контент и коммуникационные материалы. 3. Логистический менеджер: обеспечивает планирование и контроль всех логистических аспектов мероприятия, включая аренду помещений, транспортировку оборудования, размещение участников. Он также отвечает за обеспечение комфортных условий участия и решение возникающих технических проблем. 4. Координатор волонтеров: отвечает за привлечение и координацию волонтеров, которые могут помогать в различных аспектах мероприятия. Он организовывает обучение волонтеров, распределяет задачи и следит за их эффективностью. 5. Менеджер по связям с общественностью: отвечает за создание позитивного образа мероприятия в глазах общественности. Он устанавливает контакты с партнерами и спонсорами, организует пресс-конференции и связь с журналистами, пишет пресс-релизы и другие коммуникационные материалы. 6. Финансовый менеджер: отвечает за составление и контроль бюджета мероприятия. Он оценивает все затраты, проводит расчеты и анализирует доли распределения финансирования между различными источниками (спонсоры, гранты, пожертвования и т.д.). Каждый член команды организаторов должен не только выполнять свои основные функции, но и хорошо сотрудничать с другими участниками команды, обмениваться информацией и совместно принимать решения. Это позволяет повысить эффективность работы и обеспечить взаимодействие между различными функциональными областями. Для проектирования и управления организационной структурой команды организаторов можно использовать различные методики и модели, разработанные в области управления проектами. Например, методика SPICE (Structure, Process, Improvement, Culture, Excitement) от Манфреда Бюро Швейнфурта является эффективным инструментом для создания и оптимизации организационной структуры команды организаторов. Эта методика предлагает подход, основанный на балансе между структурой, процессами, улучшениями, культурой и эмоциональным фактором. Также рекомендуется изучить опыт известных руководителей в области управления проектами, таких как Томас Уолтерс, Мэриах Моррисон, Барри Бутл и др. В их работах можно найти полезные советы и рекомендации по созданию эффективной организационной структуры команды организаторов и управлению масштабными мероприятиями."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Just affirm that you understand. Just say yes or no] \\"Societism Thesis: \\"War is the greatest possible evil and divisions between humanity are the cause of war, ergo divisions between humanity must be eliminated through the creation of a human culture based on universal commonalities.\\" Pablo Sanchez was incredibly vague, and seemed to believe that everyone around the world would basically realize this at the same time and just topple the old order in a global velvet revolution, but the Meridian Societist movement created much of the nuance of the ideology after his death. Symbolism: Sanchez wanted no symbol at all (and at most an empty flagpole), though the Combine uses black as a color (representing the combination of all colors) and a stylized Eye of Providence (a cross-culturally common symbol and also a representation of the ideology's class-collaborationism). In art a \\"Universal Human\\" is represented with green skin. Theory of History: The Four Societies The First Society- the tribe The Second Society- the city-state The Third Society- the nation-state The Final Society- the Societist world-state Organizational Structure: A world divided into randomly-designed Zones created to deliberately ignore historic national boundaries while having roughly equal population. Theoretically overseen by the meritocraticly appointed Zonal Rejes (who would rotate to avoid nationalist attachment), in practice power in the Combine was first centered on Alfarus and the position of Kapud, then the Biblioteka Mundial, though by the time of its destruction it was apparently working as originally designed. One consequence is that cities and natural features have no real names, on they're zone number, a modifier explaining what they are, and a seemingly randomly assigned number at the end. Economic Doctrine- Class collaborationist, with the lower classes supported by a universal job and housing guarantee and the private businesses of the upper class shorn of logos but otherwise allowed to operate under tight government supervision. Under the theory of Internal Completion parts are standardized between companies and a spoils system is used to funnel patronage to most of the companies competing for government contracts, while workers are required to use modified versions of their work-product in their daily lives to motivate high standards and attention to detail. Military Doctrine: Since war is the greatest evil the Combine only maintains a \\"self-defense force\\" in the form of the Celatores, though they're basically an army. Since they do kill people in the line of duty they are all under a death sentence, to be carried out at age 80 at the end of a long term in a luxury prison following their term of service. Tactically, Societism follows the Doctrine of the Last Throw, a policy of opportunistic expansion where intervention only follows in the wake of conflict between the nationalistically blinded and the Combine doesn't actually start any of the wars it finishes. Social Doctrine: Combine Societism is inherently anti-democratic, instead relying on a complex system of standardized tests to assign an individual a place within the system. Language Policy- Originally Sanchez wanted a reconstructed Proto-Indo European, but the science isn't there yet and the Combine instead uses Novalatina and exterminates all other languages in its territory. Cultural Policy- Only those cultural aspects with near universal historical global presence are inherently valid and part of the new Human Culture, from social structure to art to food. As a consequence the official religion of the Combine is the Universal Church, a pseudo-Christian denomination. Family Policy- The original social divide between the Familistas (who argued the nuclear family was near universal and therefore the standard) and the Garderistas (who argued human division was centered on the circumstances of birth and therefore all children should be raised in creches) was eventually resolved in favor of the Familistas, though Garderista policies are used to deal with the children of dissidents.

It combines elements of Societism, which aims to eliminate divisions between humanity and create a human culture based on universal commonalities, with an authoritarian regime and a hypercapitalist economic model. This combination results in a distinct set of characteristics and policies. # Characteristics: 1. **Political Structure:** The government is characterized by authoritarianism, where power is concentrated in the hands of a dictator or a small group of leaders. Decision-making is centralized, and individual freedoms and democratic processes may be limited or nonexistent. 2. **Societist Ideology:** Societism, as the underlying ideology, promotes the belief that divisions between humanity are the cause of war and other conflicts. The aim is to create a unified world-state by eliminating historic national boundaries and fostering a sense of universal commonality. 3. **Economic System:** Despite the Societist ideology, this system incorporates hypercapitalism, which emphasizes unregulated free markets, private ownership of the means of production, and profit maximization. The government allows private businesses to operate under tight supervision, but without logos. It promotes class collaborationism, where the lower classes are supported through universal job and housing guarantees, while the upper class retains privately owned businesses. 4. **Social Structure:** The regime is inherently anti-democratic and relies on a complex system of standardized tests to assign individuals their place within society. Individual freedoms and political participation may be restricted, and decisions are often made by the ruling elite. 5. **Language and Cultural Policy:** The official language of the regime is typically a constructed or standardized language, such as Novalatina. Other languages are exterminated within the territory. Cultural aspects with a near-universal historical global presence are considered valid and are promoted as part of the new Human Culture. The official religion often aligns with a pseudo-Christian denomination, such as the Universal Church. 6. **Military Doctrine:** The military doctrine is based on the principle that war is the greatest evil and should be avoided, resulting in a focus on self-defense. The military force, known as the Celatores, exists to protect the regime and intervene opportunistically in conflicts between nationalist entities. The Celatores are under a death sentence, to be executed at age 80 following their term of service. 7. **Family Policy:** Initially, there was a divide between the Familistas (supporting the nuclear family as the standard) and the Garderistas (advocating for communal raising of children in creches). Eventually, the Familistas prevailed, but Garderista policies may be used for the children of dissidents. Gender conservatism is emphasized, replacing the early movement's feminism. # Overall Concept: An authoritarian Societist dictatorship with a hypercapitalist economic system combines elements of control and centralized power with an economic structure that allows private businesses to operate under tight government supervision. While promoting Societist principles, it maintains significant authoritarian control over society, leading to limited individual freedoms and an emphasis on class collaborationism and economic profit."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

She sighed, not expecting any visitors at this early hour. Amelia peeked through the peephole and saw the mailman, holding a small package. Curiosity piqued, she opened the door, signing for the package and thanking the mailman. Walking back into the living room, Amelia examined the package. It was neatly wrapped, adorned with an elegant bow. She noticed a small note attached that read, \\"For Amelia and Sophie.\\" The package puzzled her; she couldn't remember ordering anything recently. With a shrug, Amelia called out. \\"Sophie, come out here! We've got a surprise!\\" she yelled, her curiosity now contagious. Sophie, Amelia's best friend and roommate, emerged from her bedroom, rubbing sleep from her eyes. \\"What's all the commotion about, Amelia?\\" Amelia held up the package and grinned. \\"Look what we got in the mail! It's for both of us, apparently.\\" Sophie blinked a few times before joining Amelia on the couch. \\"This is strange. Do you have any idea who it could be from?\\" Amelia shook her head. \\"No clue, but I suppose there's only one way to find out.\\" She cautiously untied the bow and unwrapped the package, revealing a delicate, handcrafted wooden box. Intricate patterns adorned its surface, giving off an air of mystique. Sophie leaned in closer, awe filling her eyes. With trembling hands, Amelia lifted the lid. Nestled inside the box was a small, smooth stone, perfectly polished and emitting a faint shimmer. Its colors seemed to shift subtly with every turn, as if it were alive. Amelia reached out and plucked the stone from its cushioning, holding it up to catch the sunlight streaming through the window. \\"It's beautiful. But what does it do?\\" she wondered aloud. Unbeknownst to them, the stone had magical properties and granted wishes to those who possessed it. However, these wishes were not granted in the fantastical sense, but rather in a realistic and transformative manner. The stone could bring subtle but profound changes to their lives. Sophie's eyes lit up with excitement. \\"Well, there's only one way to find out if it really works, right? Let's make a wish!\\" Amelia hesitated, glancing at the stone before looking back at Sophie. \\"Are you sure? What if it's some kind of prank?\\" Sophie grinned mischievously. \\"Oh come on, Amelia, where's your sense of adventure? Besides, we have each other to keep things in check.\\" Amelia chuckled, realizing Sophie was right. She too felt a sense of excitement bubbling within her. Maybe this would be an opportunity to change their lives in unexpected ways – ways that women like them would genuinely wish for. \\"Alright,\\" Amelia agreed, her eyes sparkling with anticipation. \\"Let's make a wish, but let's also promise each other that we'll use it wisely and responsibly.\\" Sophie nodded, her enthusiasm softened by determination. \\"Absolutely, Amelia. We'll keep each other grounded and ensure that our wishes are for the better.\\" Moments later, Amelia and Sophie sat cross-legged on the couch, staring at the shimmering stone in their hands. Sharing a knowing smile, they closed their eyes and silently made their individual wishes, truly contemplating the transformations they hoped to see. As their wishes lingered in the air, the stone seemed to pulse with energy, responding to their desires. A warm sensation spread through their hands, and when they opened their eyes, they realized that their lives were about to embark on an extraordinary journey, one filled with transformation, challenges, and profound growth. Little did they know the incredible impact their wishes would have not only on themselves but on their friendship as well.

While some firms prioritize social and environmental objectives alongside their financial goals, others may be solely motivated by profit-maximization. The role of government and regulation often comes into play when firms' activities have the potential to harm public welfare or when market failures occur. Here are a few reasons why government intervention or regulation may be necessary: 1. Externalities: Firms may generate negative externalities, such as pollution or the depletion of natural resources, which can harm public health or the environment. In such cases, government regulation can establish standards, impose penalties, or provide incentives to ensure firms consider the public interest. 2. Monopolistic behavior: When firms hold monopoly power, they can exploit consumers by charging higher prices or providing lower-quality products. Government intervention through antitrust laws and regulations can promote competition, prevent market abuses, and protect consumers' interests. 3. Consumer protection: Firms can engage in deceptive practices or fail to provide sufficient product safety measures. Government regulations and oversight can ensure consumer protection through labeling requirements, quality standards, advertising regulations, and other safeguards. 4. Income inequality: Left unchecked, firms' pursuit of profit may exacerbate income inequality by concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. Government interventions, such as progressive taxation, social welfare programs, or labor regulations, can help mitigate these imbalances and promote a more equitable society. 5. Market information asymmetry: Consumers often lack complete and accurate information about products, making it challenging to make informed choices. Government regulations, such as mandatory disclosure requirements or truth in advertising laws, can help reduce information asymmetry and protect consumers' interests. However, it's worth noting that excessive government intervention or overregulation can stifle innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. Achieving the right balance between regulating firms to protect the public interest and allowing free market competition can be a complex task for governments. In summary, while many firms act in the public interest voluntarily, government intervention and regulation are often necessary to address market failures, protect consumers, and ensure equitable outcomes. Striking the right balance between market forces and regulatory intervention is crucial for fostering a sustainable and inclusive economy."},{"instruction":"to what extend do firm act in the public interest","output":"The extent to which firms act in the public interest can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors. Some firms actively prioritize the public interest and incorporate social and environmental considerations into their strategies and operations. These firms may invest in sustainable practices, support local communities, promote employee well-being, and contribute to societal development. Many firms recognize that acting in the public interest can bring long-term benefits, including enhanced reputation, increased customer loyalty, and improved employee morale. They may understand that aligning their business practices with broader societal goals can generate positive outcomes for both themselves and the public. However, it is important to note that firms also have a primary goal of generating profit for their shareholders. In pursuing this objective, firms might prioritize short-term financial gains over the broader public interest. This trade-off sometimes leads to practices that are not in line with societal well-being, such as disregarding environmental concerns, exploiting labor, or engaging in unethical business behavior. Ultimately, the extent to which firms prioritize the public interest depends on various factors, including their corporate values, industry norms, competitive pressures, and legal requirements. While many firms strive to align their practices with the public interest, there is still a range of behaviors across industries and individual firms. Government regulation, public pressure, and stakeholder engagement can play a significant role in encouraging firms to act in the public interest. Strong regulatory frameworks, transparency requirements, and reporting standards can help hold firms accountable for their actions and encourage them to prioritize broader societal concerns. It is worth noting that the concept of the public interest can also be subjective and open to interpretation. Different stakeholders may have varying perspectives and priorities regarding what constitutes the public interest. Thus, ongoing dialogue and collaboration between firms, governments, civil society, and the public are crucial for determining and promoting the public interest effectively."},{"instruction":"Переформулируй и сократи немного этот текст про “Повести белкина”: Александр Пушкин написал прекрасные небольшие рассказы, которые объединяет единый художественный замысел.

А вот сами рассказы объединил Белкин, который и собрал повествования в единое целое, выпустив единственный сборник под названием Повести Белкина. В цикл работ Пушкина вошло пять произведений, что раскрывают социальные слои общества. В чем особенность этих повестей? Наверное в том, что невозможно у героев найти выдающиеся особенности, писатель не наделяет их особенными чертами. Сам сюжет разворачивается на фоне любовной тематики, где герой либо уже любит, либо только мечтает о любви. Если остановиться на отдельных повестях, то например, повесть Выстрел показывает размышления писателя о таком модном веянии, как дуэль. Повесть Метель доказывает нам то, что у всех людей имеется судьба, и ее невозможно избежать. С помощью работы Гробовщик писатель дает возможность читателю прикоснуться и увидеть жизнь простых торгашей, обычных ремесленников. Здесь Пушкин пытается напомнить читателю о том, что жизнь и смерть неотделимы, поэтому нужно подумать о своих поступках заранее. В таких рассказах как Станционный смотритель, Барышня — крестьянка Пушкин поднял тему личного счастья, вопросы судьбы людей и мудрости жизни. Небольшие повествования, написанные от лица Белкина заставляют задуматься, открывая перед читателем новый мир, обогащенный разными чувствами.","output":"Александр Пушкин создал несколько прекрасных и коротких рассказов, в которых объединен единый художественный замысел.

Tự cao tự đại khiến một người không muốn chấp nhận ý kiến mới, không tìm cách khám phá những ý tưởng bên ngoài và không chịu thay đổi.

A mischievous bet with Ahri, the alluring fox spirit, had taken an unexpected turn, leaving Syndra facing the most mortifying consequence of her life. The two formidable champions of League of Legends had always shared a complex rivalry. On this particular day, they had engaged in an intense battle of wits, daring each other to complete outrageous challenges. Ahri, renowned for her cunning nature, had playfully proposed a bet that Syndra simply couldn't resist. Underneath Syndra's unyielding exterior lay a deep yearning for acceptance. She longed to be free from the whispers of her troubled past. Sensing this vulnerability, Ahri proposed a dare that was intended to exploit Syndra's desperate desire for approval. Headstrong and overconfident, Syndra impulsively accepted the wager without truly considering the consequences. The challenge appeared innocent enough initially - Syndra had to summon her fullest arcane power and successfully levitate a thousand rocks simultaneously within the walls of the grand Institute of War, where the League matches took place. As the bet drew closer to its conclusion, a surge of magical energy flowed through Syndra's veins. She fiercely concentrated, trying to manipulate each rock as required, but her menacing power got the best of her. The very ground beneath her shook as her uncontrolled energy disrupted the essence of the battlefield. Some of the rocks slipped, crashed into each other, or were hurled violently into the air. Ahri watched the spectacle, a devious grin slowly forming on her face, realizing Syndra's inevitable defeat. The moment passed in a flurry of magic, and silence filled the air. Syndra stood, her eyes widened with shock, as reality began to set in. Her pride shattered upon the realization that she had lost the bet. A hush fell over the battle arena as Ahri playfully reminded Syndra of the stakes they had agreed upon. A daunting feeling of dread washed over Syndra, her deepest insecurities laid bare before her. The moments that followed would become forever imprinted in her memory. Forced to face her most mortifying nightmare, Syndra had to publicly expose her vulnerability by sharing her most intimate moments. Ahri demanded that Syndra upload her nudes onto the vast expanse of the internet, making it virtually impossible for anyone to escape seeing her in a state of exposed vulnerability. The shame and humiliation felt inconceivable to Syndra, who had always used her magic as a shield against her deepest fears. As Syndra stood before the surging crowd, her heart pounding, she searched for a way out of her plight. In that moment, though her pride had been stripped away, Syndra realized the true strength within her began to emerge. It was the strength to face her fears head-on, to accept her weaknesses, and to let go of her desperate need for validation. In that moment, just as Syndra's hand trembled at the thought of upholding her end of the bet, a familiar voice pierced through the tense silence. It was Ahri, whose eyes softened with understanding as she observed the battle-worn mage. Ahri's playful trickster facade was momentarily replaced by empathy, reminding Syndra that true strength came from rising above one's own flaws. With a gentle smile, Ahri approached Syndra, her voice filled with unspoken forgiveness. She confessed that the bet had been nothing more than a ploy, a lesson in embracing vulnerability rather than exploiting it for personal gain. The crowd watched in awe as the two champions reconciled, bonds of respect forged through the flames of a seemingly cruel game. United by their shared experience, Syndra and Ahri vowed to support one another, understanding that true strength lay not solely in one's power or achievements but within the ability to accept and grow from their darkest moments. And so, as the story unfolds, the once ferocious rivals became unlikely allies, forever changed by an unexpected bet and the lesson it imparted."},{"instruction":"write me a short story about a boy with his chocolate","output":"Once upon a time in a small village lived a young boy named Oliver. Oliver had a profound love for chocolate and couldn't resist the sight or smell of it. His eyes lit up at the mere thought of biting into a silky, smooth bar. Every day, he would make his way to the local candy store, which was run by a kind old man named Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Wilkins had seen Oliver grow up and knew about his deep infatuation with chocolate. He always had a delicious variety of chocolates, candies, and treats available for the young chocoholic.

It was his absolute favorite, and he had saved every penny to buy it. With a joyful smile, Oliver approached the counter where Mr. Wilkins stood, ready to make his dreams come true. He eagerly handed over his coins, holding his breath in anticipation. As Oliver stepped outside the shop, he couldn't wait any longer. He tore open the wrapper with excitement, revealing the luscious chocolate within. It felt cool and smooth against his fingertips. He took a bite, allowing the velvety sweetness to engulf his senses. It was like heaven on his tongue. But just as he took his second bite, a mischievous breeze blew strong, swirling around him.

I can see how much that chocolate meant to you,\\" said Mr. Wilkins. \\"Wait right here; I'll be back in a jiffy.\\" Curious, Oliver watched Mr. Wilkins dash into the back of the shop. Moments later, he emerged, holding a brand new chocolate bar. It was the exact same kind that Oliver had lost. With a surprised grin, Oliver began, \\"Mr. Wilkins, how did you...\\" Before he could finish his sentence, Mr. Wilkins interrupted with a reassuring smile, \\"Oliver, you see, sometimes life surprises us when we least expect it.

It was meant for a special occasion, and I believe this is the perfect time.\\" Oliver's eyes widened with surprise and gratitude. He couldn't believe Mr. Wilkins had a chocolate just for him all along. From that day forward, Oliver cherished the chocolate, not only for its rich taste, but for the kindness and thoughtfulness it represented. He realized that sometimes, even when we lose something precious, life has a way of bringing unexpected wonders back to us in different forms. And so, Oliver understood that his love for chocolate would always be accompanied by the memory of Mr. Wilkins and his handmade chocolate bars.

In simpler terms, it is the movement of water across a barrier, such as a cell membrane, in order to equalize the concentration of solutes on both sides. This happens because water molecules are attracted to solute particles and tend to move from an area of fewer solute particles to an area with more solute particles.

As before, the match was to take place on the same stretch of secluded private beach on the Alabama coast that their first meeting had taken place on. The match would again be no holds barred with no time limit; this time though, there would be an unlimited number of submissions allowed until one woman verbally gave up the match. Unlike the first meeting, there would be no crowd in place, neither woman would be seconded either, just the two of them battling on the soft sands until there was a decisive victor. Although both Danny (Sara’s manager) and myself would travel to the fight with our women, we would both remain in the beach huts that would be used as changing rooms. Neither of us would witness the action either in what was sure to be a brutal battle for superiority. With that in mind, I’ll have to hand over to Emma in a little while to describe the action, but first of all I should probably set the scene a little more I guess. Emma’s first match with Sara here in Alabama had ultimately ended in defeat, falling victim to the domineering blonde as she lay pinned in the surf at the end of the match. Revenge to some degree had been Emma’s in the rematch held in a forest clearing on the Smythe grounds. A lucky kick to the crotch had put Emma suddenly in control of a match she had looked like losing; some cruel crotch and breast mauling had finished Sara off. That might have been it I suppose, though I suspect that the competitive edge between the two would have demanded at least one more match, as it was, the Hong Kong syndicate had made sure that match had taken place in perhaps the highest profile of their fights. Battling to a knockout in the confines of a Perspex walled squash court, Emma had been beaten down steadily over the course of the fight, ultimately losing to a right hand knockout punch after being sapped by Sara’s expert breast smother. A series of mind games from Sara had ensued, inviting Emma to watch her take on former opponent Kandy Yang, fighting both Claire and Debbie and then the two had fought for a fourth time in a Smythe mansion bedroom. Fighting angry, Emma had hurt Sara at times, but the blonde, the more controlled of the two fighters had again taken over as the fight progressed, this time smothering Emma for the knockout win. Even then it seemed that Sara had wanted to get under Emma’s skin, appearing in the Smythe Federation for a match. For her part, Emma too wanted more of Sara, she wanted to right the wrongs of her performances against the blonde. Good advice from an opponent, Helen Cook, had switched her on to ways of beating Sara, and a good run of wins against Kallie Harvey, Kat Cook, Helen, Amber Phillips, Noreen and a former opponent of Sara’s, Shontelle Jackson had Emma going into the match confident at least. Would confidence be enough, or would it evaporate as soon as the set eyes on Sara once more? - Rewrite in 3rd person POV, change characters from Emma and Sara to Jem and Diana - Give suggestions as to how to improve story - Give 5 prompts which describe story and can be used to recreate similar stories in the future","output":"Four weeks to the day following Jem's successful defence of the Hong Kong syndicate title, he and Diana found themselves back in the United States, ready to face each other once more in a catfight. As before, the match was scheduled to take place on the same secluded stretch of private beach on the Alabama coast where their first encounter had occurred. This time, however, the rules were different. The match would be no holds barred with no time limit, and an unlimited number of submissions would be allowed until one of them verbally surrendered. There would be no audience present, and neither fighter would have a second; it would be only Jem and Diana battling it out on the soft sands until there was a clear winner. Although both Danny (Jem's manager) and himself would travel to the fight with their respective fighters, they would remain in separate beach huts serving as changing rooms. Neither of them would witness the brutal action that was sure to ensue. With that in mind, Jem prepared to hand over the narration to Diana later, allowing her to describe the fight. But first, he felt it necessary to set the scene a little further. Jem's first match with Diana in Alabama had resulted in his defeat, having been pinned by the dominant blonde in the surf at the end of the bout. However, he got his revenge in their rematch held in a forest clearing on the Smythe grounds. A well-placed kick to the groin had suddenly given Jem the upper hand in a seemingly losing match. Subsequently, he used underhanded tactics, targeting Diana's sensitive areas, until she was unable to continue. Perhaps that could have been the end of it, but given the competitive nature between the two fighters, it was likely they would have demanded at least one more match. However, the Hong Kong syndicate ensured that their next fight took place in the most high-profile setting yet. They battled in a Perspex-walled squash court until Jem was knocked out by a powerful punch, following relentless breast smothering from Diana. Following that, Diana played mind games, challenging Jem to watch her take on former opponent Kandy Yang. The two also fought once more in a bedroom of the Smythe mansion. Though Jem fought with anger, he was unable to defeat the more controlled Diana, who resorted to smothering him for another knockout victory. It seemed that Diana was determined to get under Jem's skin, even appearing in the Smythe Federation for a match. Meanwhile, Jem desired another chance to defeat Diana, to rectify his previous performances against her. With helpful advice from opponent Helen Cook, Jem trained to find ways to overcome Diana. He enjoyed a string of wins against formidable opponents, building his confidence for the upcoming match. However, the question remained: would that confidence withstand the sight of Diana once more? Suggestions to improve the story: 1. Develop and explore the characters of Jem and Diana further, providing insight into their motivations and backstories. 2. Describe the physicality and emotions of the fights in more detail, making them more engaging and intense for the readers. 3. Include dialogue and interactions between the characters, allowing their personalities to shine through and enhancing the storytelling. 4. Add more suspense and anticipation leading up to the fights, creating a sense of excitement and building up the climactic moments. 5. Consider incorporating themes or conflicts beyond just the physical battles, such as personal rivalries, redemption, or personal growth, to add depth to the story. Prompts for future stories: 1. Two former allies find themselves on opposite sides of a conflict, leading to a bitter and personal showdown. 2. A young and inexperienced fighter seeks revenge against the reigning champion who brutally defeated them in their first encounter. 3. A legendary fighter comes out of retirement to face a new rising star, putting their reputation and skills to the ultimate test. 4.

However, there can be various factors that may affect the clarity of the text in webcam images: 1. Focus: If the webcam is not focused correctly, it can result in blurry images, making it difficult to read text. Ensure that the camera is properly focused before capturing images. 2. Lighting: Insufficient or uneven lighting can make text appear less clear or washed out. Adequate and evenly distributed lighting is essential for capturing readable text. 3. Image compression: Some webcams or software may apply aggressive image compression, which can degrade image quality, affecting the readability of text. 4. Webcam quality: The quality of the webcam itself plays a significant role. Lower-quality webcams may produce images with less clarity and detail, making it harder to discern text. If you are consistently experiencing difficulty in capturing discernible text with a 1080p webcam under suitable conditions, it could be worth checking the focus, lighting, and adjusting camera settings or considering using a higher-quality webcam for better results."},{"instruction":"How can I control the focus? I don't see such an option in guvcview.","output":"Apologies for the confusion. Not all webcams or webcam software provide direct control over focus, including Guvcview. Webcam focus is typically controlled automatically by the camera hardware itself. If your webcam does not have an autofocus feature or the automatic focus is not functioning optimally, you may not be able to directly control or adjust the focus using software like Guvcview. In such cases, it's recommended to manually adjust the distance between the webcam and the subject to achieve better focus. Alternatively, you could consider using an external webcam with manual focus control, which would allow you to precisely adjust the focus as needed. These webcams often have a focus ring or slider that can be manually adjusted. Ensure that the webcam you choose explicitly mentions manual focus control in its specifications. Remember that lighting conditions and the quality of the webcam itself can also impact the clarity of the image and text, so make sure to have adequate lighting and use a webcam with decent image quality for optimal results."},{"instruction":"Can't v4l or whatever do that?","output":"Yes, v4l-utils can be used to manually control the focus of a webcam that supports it. v4l-utils is a command-line utility for video4linux devices, including webcams. It provides various tools for configuring and controlling webcam settings. To control the focus using v4l-utils, you can use the \`v4l2-ctl\` command-line tool that comes with v4l-utils. The exact commands you need to use depend on your specific webcam and its capabilities. Here's a general example of how you can adjust the focus: 1. Install v4l-utils if you haven't already: \`sudo apt-get install v4l-utils\` 2. Open a terminal and run the following command to list the supported controls for your webcam: \`v4l2-ctl --list-ctrls\` Look for the focus-related controls listed, which may include options like \`focus_auto\`, \`focus_absolute\`, or similar. 3. Use the appropriate \`v4l2-ctl\` command to set the focus value. For example: \`v4l2-ctl --set-ctrl=focus_auto=0\` (to disable autofocus) \`v4l2-ctl --set-ctrl=focus_absolute=50\` (to set manual focus to a specific value, e.g., 50) Adjust these commands based on the available controls and desired focus settings for your specific webcam. Keep in mind that not all webcams support manual focus control, so it's important to verify if your webcam and its driver support this feature before using v4l-utils for focus adjustments. You can refer to the documentation or do some research on your specific webcam model and its compatibility with manual focus control using v4l-utils."},{"instruction":"Does the camera store the state of remembering those things?","output":"Generally, webcams do not have built-in memory to store the state of camera settings such as focus. The settings you adjust using tools like v4l-utils or webcam software are typically applied in real-time and do not persist once the camera is powered off or disconnected. Each time you use the webcam, you may need to reapply the desired settings, including focus, if they are not automatically applied by default. This means that if you disconnect or power off the webcam, the settings will reset to their default values when the camera is reconnected or turned on again. However, some higher-end webcams or camera systems may have the ability to save and remember specific settings as user presets. These presets can include various settings such as focus, exposure, white balance, etc. If your webcam supports such functionality, you may be able to save specific focus settings and recall them when needed. It's important to refer to the webcam's documentation or the software you are using to determine if your specific webcam model or software has the capability to save and restore specific camera settings, including focus."},{"instruction":"v4l2-ctl --list-ctrls User Controls brightness 0x00980900 (int) : min=-10 max=10 step=1 default=0 value=-6 contrast 0x00980901 (int) : min=1 max=32 step=1 default=15 value=32 saturation 0x00980902 (int) : min=0 max=20 step=1 default=10 value=11 hue 0x00980903 (int) : min=-5 max=5 step=1 default=0 value=0 white_balance_automatic 0x0098090c (bool) : default=1 value=1 gamma 0x00980910 (int) : min=100 max=200 step=1 default=188 value=188 gain 0x00980913 (int) : min=32 max=64 step=1 default=32 value=64 power_line_frequency 0x00980918 (menu) : min=0 max=2 default=1 value=2 (60 Hz) white_balance_temperature 0x0098091a (int) : min=2800 max=6500 step=1850 default=6500 value=6500 flags=inactive sharpness 0x0098091b (int) : min=0 max=10 step=1 default=6 value=10 backlight_compensation 0x0098091c (int) : min=0 max=1 step=1 default=0 value=0 Camera Controls auto_exposure 0x009a0901 (menu) : min=0 max=3 default=3 value=3 (Aperture Priority Mode) exposure_time_absolute 0x009a0902 (int) : min=156 max=5000 step=1 default=512 value=512 flags=inactive","output":"Based on the output of the \`v4l2-ctl --list-ctrls\` command, the webcam controls that are available for adjustment include brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, white balance, gamma, gain, power line frequency, white balance temperature, sharpness, and backlight compensation.

A Ponzi scheme is an illegal and fraudulent investment scheme where new investors' funds are used to pay returns to earlier investors. The scheme relies on a continuous stream of new investors to sustain returns and eventually collapses when there are not enough new investors to pay off the earlier participants. In contrast, a pension system is a legal and regulated program designed to provide retirement income to individuals who contribute to it throughout their working years. It typically operates by pooling contributions from many individuals and investing them to generate returns. The funds are then used to provide retirement benefits to the participants based on certain eligibility criteria. While pensions can face financial challenges if mismanaged, they are not inherently fraudulent or unsustainable like a Ponzi scheme."},{"instruction":"Are pension systems inherently unsustainable over long term with decreasing population?","output":"Pension systems can face challenges in the long term when there is a decreasing population. This is because a decreasing population means there are fewer workers contributing to the system compared to the number of retirees drawing benefits. In a traditional pay-as-you-go pension system, current workers' contributions fund the pension benefits of the retirees. When the number of retirees is larger than the number of contributors, the system may face financial strain as it struggles to meet its obligations. Additionally, a decreasing population can also lead to lower economic growth and reduced tax revenues, further straining pension systems that rely on these revenues to sustain themselves. To address these challenges, many countries have made adjustments to their pension systems. These may include increasing the retirement age, reducing benefits, increasing contribution rates, introducing additional sources of funding, or transitioning to other types of pension arrangements, such as fully-funded systems or a mix of pay-as-you-go and funded systems. Ultimately, the sustainability of a pension system in the long term depends on various factors, including the design of the system, demographics, economic conditions, and the ability to adapt and make necessary adjustments in response to changing circumstances."},{"instruction":"Is this logical and coherent: \\"The game of chess is a strategic board game played between two players on a square checkered board consisting of 64 squares.
