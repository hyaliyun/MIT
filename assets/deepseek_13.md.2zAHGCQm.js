Write a text based on \\"rising early not to start the turkey but to shop\\" Text:","output":"Title: The Early Bird Catches the Best Deals: Rise Early, Not Just for the Turkey, but to Shop Step 1: Introduce the concept Justification: Begin by introducing the idea behind the text - early shopping - which relates to the topic given. Introduction: With the holidays just around the corner, many of us start prepping for elaborate meals and gatherings. While rising early to start your turkey has its benefits, there's another reason to wake up early during the festive season - shopping! Step 2: Present the benefits of shopping early Justification: Detail the advantages of early shopping in order to persuade and inform the reader. Body Paragraph 1: Shopping early in the day offers numerous advantages, such as avoiding long queues and crowded parking lots. As a result, you can spend more time browsing through aisles, carefully selecting gifts, and enjoying a stress-free shopping experience. Body Paragraph 2: Moreover, getting to stores just after they open often provides better access to limited deals and flash sales. Early birds can snag the best gifts at a fraction of the cost, ensuring you make the most out of your holiday budget. Body Paragraph 3: Additionally, waking up early to shop provides a chance to encounter fewer out-of-stock items. With a fresh inventory, early shoppers can grab popular items that tend to sell out quickly and avoid the disappointment of not finding that perfect gift. Step 3: Include a call to action Justification: By encouraging readers to take action, this text will have a greater impact in driving change. Body Paragraph 4: So, why not set your alarm clocks a bit earlier this holiday season? Not only will you benefit from relatively empty stores, but you'll also have the chance to secure the best deals and gifts for your loved ones.

The early bird truly does catch the best deals!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Coming off their divisional home win over the Cardinals, head coach Jim Harbaugh and the 49ers flew to M&T Bank Stadium for a Week 12 interconference duel with the Baltimore Ravens and their head coach (Jim's brother) John Harbaugh on Thanksgiving. San Francisco trailed early in the first quarter as Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff got a 39-yard field goal, yet the 49ers answered with a 45-yard field goal from kicker David Akers.  Baltimore struck back in the second quarter with Cundiff making a 23-yard field goal. San Francisco began the third quarter with a 52-yard field goal from Akers, but the Ravens opened the fourth quarter with quarterback Joe Flacco completing an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dennis Pitta, followed by Cundiff nailing a 39-yard field goal.  The Niners tried to rally, but Baltimore's defense held on to preserve the win.

Natalie took strong medicine.","output":"To complete the task of determining which option best completes the sentence, I will first analyze the context provided and then compare the two options to determine which one is the most logical and coherent.  Step 1: Analysis of the context The sentence talks about Angela having a common cold, which implies a mild illness. On the other hand, Natalie is mentioned as being very sick, which indicates a more severe condition. There is a contrasting situation between Angela and Natalie. Step 2: Comparing the two options Option i: \\"Angela took strong medicine.\\" - Since Angela only has a common cold, it might not make much sense for her to take strong medicine, as strong medicine is typically used for more severe illnesses. Option ii: \\"Natalie took strong medicine.\\" - Given that Natalie is very sick, it is more reasonable to assume that she would require strong medicine to help treat her more severe condition. Step 3: Making a choice Based on the analysis and comparison, the most logical and coherent choice is option ii.

This is what the pro-gun demonstrators wanted, organizer Murdoch Pizgatti said, to show that a shooting can take place in a matter or seconds or minute while people are distracted by \\"their emotions.\\"      \\"On the other side of campus, the mock mass shooting happened. You don't get a time and place, you don't get a flier or an invitation for a true mass shooting. They happen unannounced,\\" said Pizgatti. \\"And the response time for the police to get over here was well after the event took place. That also illustrates the point of these gun-free zones. You must protest yourself. You must be armed.\\"      Earlier Saturday, the groups held an open carry march near the area. It's legal to openly carry a long arm like a rifle in Texas. Come Jan. 1, it will be legal for licensed gun owners to openly carry their handguns, and concealed carry will be allowed in most buildings on public college campuses beginning August 2016.      Open carry of any deadly weapons will remain illegal at all institutions of higher learning, however, and K-12 schools, hospitals and several other locations across the state will continue to be designated gun-free zones after the new laws go into effect.      Pizgatti, who was openly carrying a handgun Saturday, repeatedly cited a law passed in 2013 that protects those who \\"accidentally\\" expose their concealed gun. \\"Whoops!\\" he said, laughing.      The mock mass shooting, which he billed as a protest meant to reveal the dangers of gun-free zones, quickly went viral after being announced on Facebook last week. The response from the UT community and other Austinites was swift and humorous.      Both protests claimed to win the day with the farters saying they effectively neutralized the impact of the mock shooting, and the pro-gun activists saying the counter-protesters made fools of themselves.      As both demonstrations died down, clergy and volunteers from All Saints' came out with buckets of soapy water to scrub the chalk outlines and fake blood left after the mock mass shooting. Dobbs rallied his troops once more, thanking them for their good humor.      \\"A bunch of people with fart guns scared these guys,\\" said Dobbs. \\"It's time for us to stand up for good sense, for good humor and believe it or not, for a crowd with dildos and fart guns, a little bit of good taste.\\" ||||| AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Guns on one side of the street, counter-protesters making bathroom noises on the other.

The group is planning a mock mass shooting near the campus.... (Associated Press)      About a dozen gun rights activists staged an open carry march and mock mass shooting Saturday near the University of Texas, only to be outnumbered by counter-demonstrators who waived sex toys and tried to drown them out with chants.      The groups Come and Take It Texas and Don'tcomply.com initially wanted to hold their event on campus, but were told by school officials they would be charged with criminal trespassing. The group instead held their march, with several members openly carrying real assault-style rifles, in an area of shops and restaurants next to campus known as \\"The Drag.\\"      The groups then slipped away from most media and onlookers and regrouped across the street from a campus chapel to \\"shoot\\" six people with cardboard guns. Victims were outlined with chalk to show where they fell.      After publicizing their event for nearly a week, organizers said they purposely avoided the crowds and media gathered to cover the event to prove that a shooter can strike anywhere and anytime.      \\"This is what happens. In real (shooting) events like this, you don't know when they're going to happen, you don't know where they're going to happen ... we purposely did it that way,\\" said Jason Orsek, vice president of both gun groups.      The march and mock shooting event were met with mocking from Texas students and staff.      \\"Mock shootings mock victims,\\" one group chanted while others waived sex toys and sounded off with the noise makers.      The Austin campus is home to one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history: sniper Charles Whitman killed 16 people in 1966, shooting dozens of victims from a perch atop the central clock tower. The event Saturday also occurred two days before the three-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Connecticut that killed 26 people, many of whom were children.      \\"It's tasteless,\\" said Robert Oxford, a Texas graduate student, instructor and member of the group Gun-Free UT said of the mock event.      The Texas legislature this year voted to allow concealed handguns on college campuses although public universities can carve out gun-free zones. Plans under consideration for the Austin campus would prohibit firearms in dorms but allow them in classrooms. ||||| Summary:","output":"On December 12th, 2015, a group of gun-rights activists staged a mock mass shooting at the University of Texas in Austin, in an effort to demonstrate the dangers of gun-free zones. The activists, from the groups Come and Take It Texas and DontComply.com, used cardboard guns and fake blood during their theatrical performance. The event met with resistance from counter-protesters who attempted to minimize the impact of the mock shooting by using humor, wielding dildos, and using machines that generated farting noises. Andrew Dobbs, a UT alumnus who organized the counter-protest, explained that his choice to use humor was to show that \\"laughing in the face of fear is a courageous act.\\" Furthermore, the forthcoming open-carry law in Texas, set to take effect on January 1, has led to controversy as universities make plans for its implementation across their campuses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Competition between international universities is heating up, as China grows as one of the largest exporters of students aiming to study abroad. \\"Lots of universities are becoming more and more aggressive to attract Chinese students. Every day I receive contacts from universities in the  US expressing the desire to come to China to recruit students,\\" said Frank Joseph, a commercial officer from embassy of the United States. One key reason why more Chinese students are able to study abroad is the economy: With China's boom within the past decade, more families have the financial wherewithal  to send their children to international universities. There will be a total of 200,000 family-funded Chinese students studying overseas in 2009, up 20 percent from last year, said Wu Zaofeng, deputy secretary general of China Education Association for International Exchange. International institutions, Joseph said, are also facing increasingly tough financial situation with a shortage of domestic students and a drop in government subsidies . Students, especially in the US are paying high tuition fees and living expenses. Chinese students with money to spend, according to experts, can fill up the gap. Students on average spend 150,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan every year studying in US, according to statistics from the US Institute of International Education. During 2007-2008, there were approximately 81,000 Chinese students studying in the US, up 19.8 percent from 2006. Representatives from approximately 60 universities from the United States are planning to arrive in Beijing this weekend to attract more Chinese students at this year's fair. Besides the US, many other countries are also vying  to enroll Chinese students. Post-study work visa put out by British government allows all international students completing a UK degree qualification to apply for a visa to stay on and look for work in UK for up to 2 years.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which county is not using an SI unit, France or Germany?  John is a world traveler. Recently, he visited two countries, France and Germany. He noticed that in France they use atmosphere and Pascal as pressure units. In Germany they use torr as a pressure unit. Back in the United States, he noticed psi is used as a pressure unit. He needs to figure out how they correlate with each other.  Hint: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units. Answer:","output":"In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that France uses atmosphere and Pascal as pressure units, while Germany uses torr as a pressure unit. Among these, atmosphere and Pascal are SI (International System of Units) units, while torr is not an SI unit. Therefore, the country not using an SI unit in this context is Germany.  It is important to note that PSI (pounds per square inch) is also a non-SI unit used in the United States for measuring pressure. The paragraph provides information about various pressure units and their relation to each other: 1. Pascal (Pa) - An SI unit commonly used for measuring pressure; 1 atmosphere (atm) is equal to 101.3 x 10^5 Pascal (Pa). 2. Atmosphere (atm) - Another SI unit, where 1 atm is also equivalent to 760 torr. 3. Torr - A non-SI unit for pressure, also referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" It is mentioned that 760 torr is equal to 1 atm and that an increase in pressure by 1 torr causes a rise in liquid mercury by 1 mm. 4. PSI (pounds per square inch) - A non-SI unit commonly used in the United States, but it is not an SI unit. In conclusion, out of France and Germany, Germany is the country not using an SI unit for pressure measurement, as they use the torr unit, which is not a part of the International System of Units."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Media playback is not supported on this device Crawford has scored seven of his side's 18 league goals this term, including three goals in his last four matches. \\"He is such an important player for us,\\" Canning told BBC Scotland. But the manager acknowledges he could lose the midfielder in the January transfer window \\"if the right thing comes up for Ali and for the club\\". After scoring the opener in Saturday's draw at Inverness, 25-year-old Crawford spoke of his belief that he had earned a move and Canning agrees. \\"The size of club we are, if someone comes through the academy and does well for us and gets the opportunity to move onto a level that we can't say no to the kid for, that's just part of football,\\" he continued. \\"But if we can keep him in January and he moves in the summer it would be great for him and if the club can bring another kid through the academy and put him in the first team and to a higher level, it would be good for the club as well.\\" Inevitably, any talented youngster coming through Accies' academy draws comparisons with its most successful graduates - James McCarthy and James McArthur. Canning played with both and believes Crawford is capable of scaling similar heights to the pair who are now established English Premier League players. \\"At any moment in any game he can either find a pass or a strike, a free kick or delivery from a set-piece that can change or win a game, so he's definitely got all the attributes you'd need to play at a higher level,\\" said Canning. Crawford will certainly be around for the next three weeks, during which time Accies play Celtic twice, host Rangers and visit Aberdeen before a home derby against Motherwell on New Year's Eve. Accies go into that tricky sequence of games in eighth place, two points behind sixth place Kilmarnock and two points ahead of the bottom side Partick Thistle. Canning admits he would be content to be in a similar position going into the Hogmanay fixture. \\"I think that's what I'd expect to happen given the fact it's not only us who have a difficult run of fixtures,\\" he said. \\"It's a case of trying to pick up points where you can. \\"We've beaten Aberdeen here - a game not many people would have thought we'd have won. We're capable of picking up points in these difficult games.\\" But the manager says he hasn't set his players any specific points targets before the winter break. \\"It's something we don't do,\\" he explained. \\"I think we've just got to take every game as it comes and work as hard as we can over the 90 minutes. \\"It's a difficult run but we've all got to play these teams. For us it's about making sure we go and compete in every game.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"This is about a soccer player named Crawford who has been scoring a lot of goals for his team. He has scored 7 out of the 18 goals his team has made this season! The man in charge of the team, called a manager, is saying how important Crawford is to the team. But there might be a chance that Crawford will leave the team in January if there's a really good opportunity for him and for the team. If Crawford stays until the summer though, it would be great for everyone. Crawford's manager thinks he is very talented, like some very successful players he used to play with. For the next three weeks, Crawford's team will be playing a lot of games against tough teams. Their manager hopes they can score some points in these tricky games to be in a good position in the league.

The Denver mom went on to give her daughter the choice of being spanked or making a video that she would post to Facebook.      \\"She said she'd rather have a whoopin', so I chose the latter,\\" Starks said.      In the video made as a result, which runs more than five minutes, Starks is seen loudly confronting her daughter, making her repeat her real age to the camera. Starks notes that her daughter does not have lingerie, still watches children's shows and has a bedtime, among other assertions.      The daughter starts crying in the middle of the video, and tried to get out of going to school on Monday, the day after the video was posted, Starks said.      Starks added that she is shocked by how quickly the video has spread and how much support she has received from parents worldwide. In three days, the video has been viewed more than 10 million times.      Starks' popularity has gone up as well, jumping from having only 45 Facebook friends to more than 5,000 requests two days later. After the surge, Facebook suspended her account temporarily and stopped her from adding any more friends.      In a second video that Starks, a cosmetology student, posted Monday to thank supporters, she said that she is a convicted felon who cannot get a job because of her record. She told ABC News that she spent nearly eight months in jail after being convicted for complicity to traffic marijuana.      She said she told her daughter, \\"I'm an adult who made a bad decision and I had to suffer the consequences, and I'm still suffering the consequences. And you're a kid who made a bad decision and there are consequences to that.\\"      Starks said she first got the idea of posting a shaming video to Facebook when her daughter \\"got in a little trouble\\" with the social media site last year when she was \\"messaging too many boys.\\"      Facebook's user agreement states that users must have their real names on the account and not be under 13.      While there have been thousands of messages of support for Starks, she said that she has also gotten comments from people who believe she went too far.      To her critics, Starks said, \\"It was coming from a place of love.\\"      \\"Anybody could have coerced her into meeting her in a park, and she would have thought it was a 13-year-old boy but it [could have been] a grown man who wants to do bodily harm -- and the coroners could have been coming to my house,\\" Starks told ABC News. \\"I would rather embarrass her and done this than to go to a morgue and verify my child's body.\\" ||||| A mom stands on the sidewalk, berating her 13-year-old daughter for pretending to be an older teenager and making suggestive posts on Facebook.

Is that what you do?\\" Valerie Starks asks as the girl begins to cry.      \\"Don't cry now. You wasn't crying when you was posting pictures on Facebook, was you?

MY CHILD      The video, posted Sunday, has drawn more than 11 million views and thousands of comments, many praising Starks as a tough-love parent.      \\"We need more Moms like you. Good job taking care of your kid,\\" Facebook user Rhonda Snow wrote on Starks' Facebook page.      But other commenters, and some parenting experts, are aghast at what they said was little more than cyberbullying.      While Starks clearly has the best of intentions and obviously loves her daughter, McCready said, the tactic isn't an effective way to get kids to open up and tell the truth about what's happening in their lives.      \\"If kids fear that they are going to be publicly humiliated, guess what, they are going to get really good at hiding the truth,\\" said McCready, of Raleigh, North Carolina.      Starks told CNN affiliate KMGH that she explained the reasons for the video to her daughter.      \\"I said, 'I did this because I love you, not because I really wanted to embarrass you,' \\" she said. \\"I wanted to make a statement and a stand for all parents that this is not going to be tolerated.\\"      JUST WATCHED Mom shames daughter for posing as a 'freak' on Facebook Replay More Videos ...

She's reached Facebook's limit of 5,000 friends because of the video, she said.      She also said she's made mistakes in her life that she doesn't want her daughter to repeat. Starks says she's a convicted felon \\"for being around the wrong people who had marijuana\\" and doesn't have a job but is renting a room from her brother and going to night school to try to improve her situation.      She said critics need to understand that she's trying to do the best she can for her daughter.      \\"I'm not her friend. I am my own village, and I am trying my best with this little girl. And she's going to understand and respect me for it later,\\" she said.      \\"The streets won't raise her; the schools won't raise her; the system won't raise her. I will raise her if it kills me,\\" she said.      But McCready said that publicly shaming her daughter may have frayed bonds of trust that could be difficult to repair.      McCready's advice for parents in similar situations: Don't back down from being tough with your kids, because they need that discipline when they make big mistakes.      But, she says, do it in a way that ensures that the child knows you'll \\"have their back no matter what.\\"      That means reining in privileges and reinforcing obligations while using the child's mistake as an opportunity to explore why it happened and what parent and child can do together to prevent a repeat -- not embarrassing them publicly, she said.      \\"No one feels inspired when they are humiliated,\\" she said.      Starks said she posted the video to emphasize to other parents \\"how important it is to be aware of what your child is doing at all times. Don't trust nothing they say. They lie. They're going to be sneaky. Don't ever say ... what your child won't do. Because you never know until it happens to you.\\" |||||","output":"Valerie Starks, a Denver mother, confronted her 13-year-old daughter for her inappropriate behavior on Facebook and posted a video of the encounter that quickly went viral. The issues arose when Starks unearthed her daughter’s Facebook page, where she had misrepresented her age as 19 and had posted provocative images of herself. The primary cause of concern for Starks was the fact her daughter was connected with grown adult men on the platform. In the video recording, Starks can be heard addressing her daughter about the misleading Facebook profile, while her daughter’s identity is digitally obscured. During their discussion, Starks chastises her daughter and highlights her inappropriate actions online.  Starks revealed that this was not the first time her daughter had misused Facebook. The mother noted previous instances where the girl had issues involving the social media platform that led to punishments during the past summer. The intention behind the video posting, which amassed over 10 million views, was not to embarrass the girl, according to Starks, rather it was a stand against such behavior, conveying to all parents that such actions should not be tolerated. She affirmed that her actions stemmed from love and the desire to protect her child.  The reactions to the video have been multiple. Several individuals expressed support for Starks’ approach, praising her parenting skills. However, not everyone agreed, with some users suggesting that humiliating the child publicly was not an effective parenting method. Starks surprised by the response, stated that she was glad that the video had encouraged conversation. She also said that her daughter has understood her point and has not faced any adverse reactions or bullying from her peers at school. Starks hopes that her daughter would think twice about her actions the next time she uses Facebook. At the end of the viral event, Starks' Facebook page surged in popularity, leading to an impressive increase in friend requests, ultimately hitting the 5,000 friends limit set by Facebook. Despite the criticism, Starks maintains that her actions were justifiable, mainly due to the risk of potential predators that could take advantage of her vulnerable daughter online."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – Kansas has passed a law that most people probably assumed the state already had. The new law bans police officers from having sex with motorists that they pull over, reports the Wichita Eagle. Although Kansas did have a law prohibiting police from having sex with people in jail, the new law bans sex \\"during the course of a traffic stop, a custodial interrogation, an interview in connection with an investigation, or while the law enforcement officer has such person detained.\\" Kansas was one of 33 states where sex between police and detainees is not illegal. The bill was introduced by Rep. Cindy Holscher, a Democrat, in response to the case of a detective who was alleged to have repeatedly coerced sex from black women in Kansas City by threatening to arrest them or their loved ones. One such incident led to the arrest of Lamonte McIntyre, who spent 23 years in prison for a double murder he didn't commit. McIntyre’s mother said in an affidavit that she had spurned the detective’s advances, per NBC4. Holscher also cited a case in New York, where a teen alleged that two officers raped her in their van, but because the officers said the sex was consensual, no charges were filed. New York passed a similar bill in March, in response to that incident. \\"I was shocked,\\" New York state Sen. Diane Savino told CBS News when she learned of the gap in the law. \\"It should be clear across the state for officers from every department, that when someone is in custody they do not have the ability to consent to sexual activity.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Kansas Passes Law Stopping Police from Having Relations with Motorists Hey kids! In this article, we are going to talk about a new rule in Kansas.  Kansas is a place in the United States, and they have made a new law to protect people from police officers who are not being nice. This new law says that police officers are not allowed to have any type of hugs or kisses with people they stop on the road while they are working. This may seem like a rule that should already be there, but it wasn't! Before this rule was made, 33 states in the United States did not have any rules to stop police from having hugs or kisses with people they had taken to the police station. A lady named Cindy Holscher, who is a very important person in Kansas, heard about some bad police officers and decided to make this new rule to protect people. One of the stories that made Cindy want to create this rule was about a bad police officer who would threaten people so they would give him hugs and kisses. This bad police officer made a big mistake when he put a man named Lamonte McIntyre in jail for a crime he didn't do. Lamonte was in jail for 23 years because of the bad police officer's mistake. Another story was about a girl in New York who told people that two police officers made her give them hugs and kisses while they were inside the police car. The police officers said it was okay because the girl agreed, but people realized that this shouldn't happen, so they made a rule in New York too. A lady named Diane Savino, who is also an important person, was very surprised that there wasn't a rule about this already. She said that people who are with police should not be able to say yes to hugs and kisses, because they might be scared or feel like they have to do it. Thanks to people like Cindy and Diane, these new rules will help protect everyone from police officers who are not being nice, and make sure that everyone is treated the right way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One tiny 9-inch plant, bought for 1.25 in the spring, has already taken over much of my rose bed, covering much of other plants, and is well on its way to the front door. Roses require a good deal of care, and if it weren't for the pleasure they give, it wouldn't be worth the work. As it is, I have a garden full of sweet-smelling roses for most of the year. Bushes must be pruned  in early spring, leaving ugly woody branches until the new growth appears a few weeks later. It was the space available in the garden that led me into planting just one little tomato plant. A big mistake. Soil conditions made just perfect for roses turn out be even more perfect for tomatoes. The daily watering coupled with full sun and regular fertilizing have turned the little plant into a tall bush. The cage I placed around it as the plant grew has long since disappeared under the thick leaves. Now the task I face in harvesting the fruit is twofold; First, I have to find the red ones among the leaves, which means I almost have to stand on my head, and once found I have to reach down and under, pick the tomatoes and withdraw  my full fist without dropping the prize so dearly won. I found two full-blown white roses completely hidden as I picked tomatoes in June. But they were weak and the leaves already yellow for lack of light. Here I am faced with a painful small decision: To tear up a wonderful and productive tomato plant that offers up between ten and twenty ripe sweet tomatoes each day or say goodbye to several expensive and treasured roses.

Is \\"These use a standards-based H.323 technique known as \\"decentralized multipoint\\", where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central \\"manager\\" or other bottleneck.\\" the correct answer?","output":"While the statement \\"These use a standards-based H.323 technique known as \\"decentralized multipoint\\", where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central \\"manager\\" or other bottleneck\\" explains the decentralized nature of H.323 and its potential advantages in terms of minimizing bottlenecks, it does not completely answer why the video and audio quality is higher with H.323 technique. A more comprehensive explanation is as follows: The H.323 technique is a multimedia communication standard that enables high quality video and audio transmission over IP networks, including the internet. Several factors contribute to the higher quality of video and audio in H.323: 1. Advanced codecs: H.323 utilizes a variety of advanced codecs for both audio and video compression. These codecs help compress the data without significantly compromising the quality. For example, H.261 and H.264 are video codecs that offer higher compression ratios and improved video quality. Similarly, G.711, G.722, and G.729 are some audio codecs that allow better audio quality. By using these codecs effectively, H.323 provides high-quality audio and video transmission. 2. Real-time transmission: H.323 is designed to work with real-time transmission protocols, such as Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), which are specifically built for sending multimedia data over a network. RTP ensures that the data packets are delivered with minimal delay and in the correct order. This is crucial for maintaining audiovisual synchronization and quality. 3. QoS (Quality of Service) mechanisms: H.323 supports the implementation of QoS mechanisms, which can prioritize certain types of data packets (e.g., video and audio) over other less critical packets. This prioritization ensures that video and audio data are transmitted with minimal jitter and latency, ultimately resulting in better quality. 4. Decentralized multipoint communication: As mentioned in your original statement, H.323 uses a decentralized multipoint approach, wherein each station in a call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations. This removes the need for a central \\"manager\\" or bottleneck, thus reducing latency and improving overall video and audio quality. 5. Error control and concealment: H.323 codecs and protocols support various techniques for error control and concealment, which can help minimize the impact of packet loss, jitter, and other transmission issues. By proactively handling errors and compensating for lost data, the quality of video and audio can be maintained even under less-than-ideal network conditions. In summary, the superior video and audio quality of H.323 technique can be attributed to the use of advanced codecs, real-time transmission protocols, QoS mechanisms, decentralized multipoint communication, and error control and concealment techniques. These features work together to ensure a high-quality multimedia transmission experience over IP networks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

US reports said Elin \\"went psycho\\" during their blazing row over his affairs on the night he crashed his car.      It was also reported last night that while Elin is devastated by the alleged infidelities, she does not plan to file for divorce.      The 29-year-old married the golfer in 2004 and they have a daughter Sam, two, and Son Charlie, ten months.

Jamie Jungers - Tiger's fourth mistress - opened her heart to The Sun last night and declared: \\"He deserves everything he gets.\\"      Lust      She claimed he wanted sex on demand and loved having dirty phone chats - while insisting everything was well with his marriage.      The billionaire golfer flew blonde Jamie all over America during golf tournaments to satisfy his lust.      She said: \\"The sex was amazing, just crazy. It got better the more we saw each other. And the more we saw each other, the more we had sex. He was amazing in bed.\\"      In hiding ... love cheat Woods      Jamie said they began their secret affair in June 2005, after Tiger introduced himself in a club at the exclusive Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.      He was out with his childhood friend and employee Bryon Bell and a former college pal.      Within hours he wooed Jamie back to his ï¿½15,000 hotel room for sex.      It came just eight months after he wed Swede Elin Nordegren.      Jamie, 26, who bears a striking resemblance to Elin, recalled: \\"Tiger and I went back to the room and just started making out.      \\"It just went from one thing to the next. We ended up having crazy sex for two hours. I remember him picking me up and putting me against the wall. And that's when it turned into wild sex. It was really good.      \\"Later I said to him, 'I don't know a whole lot about your marriage situation. I know it is very fresh. I know you just got married. I mean, is it going OK?' He said, 'Yes, it's fine, she's in Sweden with her family'.\\"      Advertisement      Jamie said that hours after they parted he called and begged her to fly to Chicago, to join him at the Western Open golf tournament, where he was playing that weekend.      She went on: \\"He said he would have everything taken care of and a black town car would be waiting for me to take me to the hotel.      \\"Tiger seemed excited to see me. It had been a week and it just happened like the time before, starting with kissing and then amazing sex again.\\" Jamie said they had sex three times that night and from then on she was bombarded with calls daily.      Weeks later, Tiger invited her to his family home near Newport Beach, California.      It was to be one of around ten occasions she visited the property, with Tiger eventually picking her up from the airport himself.      By this time, Jamie had strong feelings for the golfer - and seeing pictures around the house of him with Elin made her unhappy.      She said: \\"It was heartbreaking. I imagined how she would feel if she knew I was in her house.\\"      Blazing row ... Swedish wife Elin      Despite her reservations, Jamie continued to enjoy sex with Tiger.      She recalled: \\"He was passionate and knew what he was doing. It became more like kissing, instead of just jumping right into sex. It became more affectionate.      \\"We talked quite a bit on the phone throughout the week. We'd talk about how we had amazing sex. We did definitely have sex talk.\\"      She revealed that Tiger gave her lurid sexual nicknames that would horrify his millions of fans.      Whilst baby-talking her he would call her his \\"coffee cup\\". Their relationship lasted 18 months.      Jamie said she was often mistaken for Elin. Jamie, who denied claims Tiger paid for her to have liposuction, became uneasy and tried to end the affair.      But he would beg her: \\"Please don't go.\\"      Finally she managed to break free, telling Tiger the affair was unfair on everyone involved.      Jamie now says: \\"People are getting to see he's not the great family-orientated guy everyone thought he was.\\"      Tiger was said to be \\"scared for his life\\" the night he fled from raging Elin and crashed his car outside their mansion in Orlando, Florida, sparking the recent string of claims by ex-mistresses.      A source told US Star magazine Elin caught him texting Rachel Uchitel, the first girl to go public.      The informant said: \\"Elin confronted him and flew into a rage. She apparently threw the phone at his mouth.\\"      Elin was making plans to leave her husband three months ago when she bought a ï¿½1.2million Swedish mansion in her own name, The Sun can reveal.      The sale went through on December 2.      In another blow to Tiger, 300 sexy text messages and voicemails between him and alleged mistress Jaimee Grubbs surfaced yesterday.      And an unnamed woman is claiming she has naked pictures of Tiger she is preparing to sell to Playgirl.      In addition, Republican politician Joe Baca, 62, has abandoned attempts to have Congress pass a bill awarding Tiger the Congressional Gold Medal - the highest US civilian award.      And the star's ranking as a celebrity product endorser has plunged from 6th to 24th since his sex scandal broke.      Of the ten women said to have been bedded by Tiger, eight have been named.

Professor Sherman Klump (also Eddie Murphy), a kindly, well-liked, brilliant professor of genetics, gets ready for work. Meanwhile, 5,000 hamsters are overrunning Wellman College and causing general chaos. It turns out that these are the school's laboratory hamsters that 400-pound Sherman accidentally released the night before. The problem having been contained, Sherman is given an update by his assistant, Jason (John Ales), about their latest project an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person to make weight-loss easy. It seems that their fattest hamster, Shelley, has lost 3 ounces, proving that the serum works. Jason suggests increasing the amount Shelley is fed, but the ever-kindly Sherman argues against it, saying it could be dangerous.He then has an unpleasant meeting with Dean Richmond (Larry Miller). The Dean tells him that the incident with the hamsters has cost the science department most of its funding. Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is the school's last remaining wealthy alumnus and is planning to award a 10 million grant to the college; Klump is warned not to alienate him as well.After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with the lovely Miss Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett), a chemistry graduate student teaching a class across the hall, who is a big fan of his work.

What are the full individual names of the two separate areas of which Saguaro National Park consists?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Saguaro National Park is an American national park in Pima County, southeastern Arizona. The 92,000-acre (37,000 ha) park consists of two separate areas—the Tucson Mountain District (TMD) about 10 miles (16 km) west of the city of Tucson and the Rincon Mountain District (RMD) about 10 miles (16 km) east of the city—that preserve Sonoran Desert landscapes, fauna, and flora, including the giant saguaro cactus. The volcanic rocks on the surface of the Tucson Mountain District differ greatly from the surface rocks of the Rincon Mountain District; over the past 30 million years, crustal stretching displaced rocks from beneath the Tucson Mountains of the Tucson Mountain District to form the Rincon Mountains of the Rincon Mountain District. Uplifted, domed, and eroded, the Rincon Mountains are significantly higher and wetter than the Tucson Mountains. The Rincons, as one of the Madrean Sky Islands between the southern Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico, support high biodiversity and are home to many plants and animals that do not live in the Tucson Mountain District.  Earlier residents of and visitors to the lands in and around the park before its creation included the Hohokam, Sobaipuri, Tohono O'odham, Apaches, Spanish explorers, missionaries, miners, homesteaders, and ranchers. In 1933, President Herbert Hoover, using the power of the Antiquities Act, established the original park, Saguaro National Monument, in the Rincon Mountains. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy added the Tucson Mountain District to the monument and renamed the original tract the Rincon Mountain District. Congress combined the Tucson Mountain District and the Rincon Mountain District to form the national park in 1994. Popular activities in the park include hiking on its 165 miles (266 km) of trails and sightseeing along paved roads near its two visitor centers.

Asexually produced offspring are genetically Options:  *identical to the parent  *different from the parent  *different from each other  *formed by two parents","output":"The correct option is that asexually produced offspring are genetically *identical to the parent*. Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction in which an organism is capable of reproducing on its own without the involvement of another organism. This type of reproduction does not involve any type of fusion between the male and female gametes, which is a characteristic of sexual reproduction. Instead, asexually reproducing organisms create offspring that are genetically identical to themselves, meaning that they share the exact same genetic material. This is a main feature of asexual reproduction and what sets it apart from sexual reproduction.  Asexual reproduction can happen through various methods like binary fission, budding, and fragmentation depending on the species. In binary fission, the parent organism splits into two equal parts, each developing into an independent organism. This is common in bacteria and some protozoa. In the process of budding, a new individual grows from a certain point of the parent organism. Once it reaches maturity, it detaches. This is often observed in yeast and hydra. In fragmentation, a part of the parent organism gets detached and develops into a new individual. This is common in several multi-cellular organisms like starfish and planaria. In essence, the offspring produced through asexual reproduction are exact clones of their parents, sharing the same DNA. As there is no exchange or mixing of genetic material as there is in sexual reproduction, these offspring are not *different from the parent*, they are not *different from each other*, and they are not *formed by two parents*. Each offspring will have the same traits and characteristics as its parents because it carries the same genes. While this does prevent any variation and could be seen as a disadvantage in situations where adaption is necessary for survival, asexual reproduction allows organisms to reproduce quickly and efficiently when conditions are favorable. Organisms that reproduce asexually only need to reach a certain size or stage of development before they can reproduce, they don't need to find a mate, and they can produce numerous copies of themselves in a relatively short period of time. Hence, asexually produced offspring are genetically identical to the parent is the correct option among the ones provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. The Deakin University experiment probably lasted: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - A few minutes - A few days - A few years","output":"The Deakin University experiment likely lasted a few days, as the 48 healthy adults participated in four lunchtime sessions.

Question: This article: In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers.

Information:  - The Middle Jurassic is the second epoch of the Jurassic Period. It lasted from about 174 to 163 million years ago. In European lithostratigraphy, rocks of this Middle Jurassic age are called the Dogger. This name in the past was also used to indicate the Middle Jurassic epoch itself, but is discouraged by the IUGS, to distinguish between rock units and units of geological time.  - The Early Cretaceous/Middle Cretaceous (geochronological name) or the Lower Cretaceous (chronostratigraphic name), is the earlier or lower of the two major divisions of the Cretaceous. It is usually considered to stretch from 146 Ma to 100 Ma.  - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - Iguanodon (; meaning \\"iguana-tooth\\") is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur that existed roughly halfway between the first of the swift bipedal hypsilophodontids of the mid-Jurassic and the duck-billed dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous. While many species have been classified in the genus \\"Iguanodon\\", dating from the late Jurassic Period to the late Cretaceous Period of Asia, Europe, and North America, research in the first decade of the 21st century suggests that there is only one well-substantiated species: \\"I. bernissartensis\\", which lived from the late Barremian to the earliest Aptian ages (Early Cretaceous) in Belgium and possibly elsewhere in Europe, between about 126 and 125 million years ago. \\"Iguanodon\\" were large, bulky herbivores. Distinctive features include large thumb spikes, which were possibly used for defense against predators, combined with long prehensile fifth fingers able to forage for food.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - Not to be confused with Dyrosauridae Dryosaurids were primitive iguanodonts . They are known from Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous rocks of Africa , Europe , and North America .  - Hypsilophodonts (named after \\"Hypsilophodon\\", itself derived from the \\"Hypsilophus\\" (\\"high-crested\\") genus of iguana lizard and literally meaning \\"\\"Hypsilophus\\"-tooth\\") were small ornithopod dinosaurs, regarded as fast, herbivorous bipeds on the order of 12 meters long (3.36.6 feet). They are known from Asia, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South America, from rocks of Middle Jurassic to late Cretaceous age. The group traditionally has included almost all bipedal bird-hipped dinosaurs other than iguanodonts, and some early phylogenetic analyses found it to be a natural group, but more recent studies have found that the group is mostly paraphyletic and the taxa within represent a series leading up to Iguanodontia. Some of these studies have moved some traditional hypsilophodonts out of the Ornithopoda, such as \\"Agilisaurus\\" and \\"Othnielosaurus\\" (=\\"Othnielia\\"). Thus, the only certain member at this time is \\"Hypsilophodon\\".    What is the relationship between 'dryosauridae' and 'iguanodontia'? Answer:","output":"Dryosauridae is a family of primitive iguanodonts, which are herbivorous dinosaurs belonging to the larger clade Iguanodontia. Iguanodontia is a group of ornithopod dinosaurs that includes various genera like Iguanodon, Dryosaurus, and others. Dryosaurids, being primitive iguanodonts, represent an earlier evolutionary stage within the Iguanodontia clade. In summary, the relationship between Dryosauridae and Iguanodontia is that Dryosauridae is a subset of Iguanodontia, with dryosaurids being considered early members of the Iguanodontia group."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose from: 1). Yes; 2). No; Answer:","output":"2). No; The correct answer is \\"No,\\" because green beans are not the source of electricity production by burning in the context provided. The information given specifies that alcohols derived from biomass or living matter are used to produce electricity by burning. Although green beans are a type of biomass and a living matter, they are not mentioned as a source for producing alcohols used in electricity generation. Alcohols derived from biomass are known as bioalcohols, which are primarily made from plant materials such as sugarcane, corn, and even agricultural waste. These bioalcohols can be burned to generate electricity or used as fuel in vehicles. The primary bioalcohol used in electricity generation is ethanol – which is obtained from fermenting sugar or starch-based feedstocks like sugarcane and corn. This bioalcohol can be burned to generate heat, which can power turbines to create electricity. In contrast, green beans don't have a substantial sugar or starch content that would make them a viable source for producing bioalcohol, and it is not financially or environmentally practical to use them in electricity production. In conclusion, though green beans do classify as biomass and living matter, they are not used as a source for generating bioalcohols to produce electricity by burning. The question itself focuses on producing electricity by burning alcohol derived from biomass, which goes beyond simply stating, \\"what produces electricity by burning,\\" making the answer even more clear that green beans are not the correct answer."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"When did the Ottoman Empire get Little Walachia back?\\" is in \\"After the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718 the Treaty of Passarowitz confirmed the loss of the Banat, Serbia and \\"Little Walachia\\" (Oltenia) to Austria.

Firstly, the two statements involve separate subjects. The first statement describes a girl without specifying her identity, while the second statement refers specifically to the president's daughter. There is no information given to indicate that the girl in the first statement is, in fact, the president's daughter. The girl could be anyone; in other words, we cannot logically assume that she is the president's daughter based on the information provided. Secondly, the location is not specified clearly in the first statement. It mentions that the girl is leaping across a \\"grassy lawn,\\" but this description could apply to numerous places, not just the White House lawn. A grassy lawn could be found in parks, gardens, schools, or residential properties. Without further clarification or context, it is impossible to assume that the girl is playing on the White House lawn. Thirdly, even if we were to consider that the girl in the first statement is the president's daughter and she happens to be playing on a grassy lawn, it still does not establish a logical connection with the White House lawn. There is no given information or reason to believe that the president's daughter should be restricted to playing only on the White House lawn, as her activities might take place at various locations.

So they stood at arm's length, facing one another and secretly forming an estimate each of the other's advantages and accomplishments.  \\"She's pretty enough, but has no style whatever,\\" was Louise's conclusion. \\"Neither has she tact nor self-possession, or even a prepossessing manner. She wears her new gown in a dowdy manner and one can read her face easily. There's little danger in this quarter, I'm sure, so I may as well be friends with the poor child.\\"  As for Beth, she saw at once that her \\"new cousin\\" was older and more experienced in the ways of the world, and therefore liable to prove a dangerous antagonist. Slender and graceful of form, attractive of feature and dainty in manner, Louise must be credited with many advantages; but against these might be weighed her evident insincerity--the volubility and gush that are so often affected to hide one's real nature, and which so shrewd and suspicious a woman as Aunt Jane could not fail to readily detect. Altogether, Beth was not greatly disturbed by her cousin's appearance, and suddenly realizing that they had been staring at one another rather rudely, she said, pleasantly enough:  Answer the following questions: 1. Who did Beth meet for the first time? 2. What was their relationship? 3. Were they competing for something? 4. What? 5. What did they do to each other after the saying hello? 6.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What was a difference between the hunting and gathering practices of the Archaics and the Anasazi?\\" is \\"Anasazi were far more progressive than the Archaics\\"?

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.  I am facing a new situation today: The southern province was exposed to intensive grazing for many years , and now soil quality is poor and dust storms are present. The northern province has more fertile soil, more trees.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which province experiences more carbon loss? A:","output":"A: The northern province From the background article, we can deduce that degraded lands typically experience carbon loss due to their poor soil quality, which is unable to hold necessary nutrients such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to supporting life or inviting life back to that land. In the new situation mentioned, the southern province was exposed to intensive grazing for many years, leading to poor soil quality and increased presence of dust storms. These factors point toward land degradation, which we learned in the background article contributes significantly to carbon loss. On the other hand, the northern province has more fertile soil and more trees. These factors show a healthier ecosystem, which implies that it is more likely to be better at retaining carbon compared to the southern province. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the northern province experiences less carbon loss than the degraded southern province."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From the results that appear in the search, I'd look for credible sources such as official transportation websites, historical records, or perhaps prominent newspapers or magazines which may have articles on the subject. Generally, a tunnel or other types of monuments are named after prominent figures or the area where they are located. As per the name, we can infer that the Lincoln Tunnel might be named after Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. To confirm this, we would need to find a credible source. After appropriate research: The Lincoln Tunnel, which connects New Jersey and New York City, is indeed named after Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. This is in keeping with a tradition of naming significant structures after prominent leaders in the country's history. The naming was intended as a tribute to Lincoln's leadership and contributions to the nation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. So when she decided she wanted to learn to ice skate to raise money for charity, warnings from her doctors and concern from her parents did little to deter her. Mia is 10 and has congenital hemiplegia, a form of cerebral palsy. She has to use a wheelchair to help her cope with mobility issues, pain and exhaustion. She is also prone to disc dislocation and has a weakness down the right side of her body. But despite this, she dedicates her spare time to raising money for charity and campaigning to improve life for disabled people, winning awards for her dedication. She was told that learning to ice skate would put huge pressure on her body and increase her pain and fatigue - to cope, she would have to increase her twice-daily physiotherapy sessions. But Mia, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, simply responded: \\"It has to be hard to get people to sponsor me.\\" She took three months just to balance on her skates and she spent days recovering after each weekly practice session, exhausted and aching from all the falls. But Mia said it was all worth it when she skated across the ice in Cardiff's Ice Arena Wales in front of a cheering crowd at the Allstars Weekend ice hockey match to score a penalty, raising more than Â£6,300 for children who need help. \\"It was really hard because I fell a lot doing it and I hurt a lot learning to skate,\\" Mia said. \\"But when I finished my challenge I felt really happy because I managed to score my first ever goal on the ice.\\" It was a moment that her parents, Karene and Robert, thought they would never see. \\"When Mia was diagnosed at 18 months the doctors said she would never walk and that we'd be lucky if she spoke in full sentences,\\" Karene said. But their little girl defied the odds - by three, she was able to stand holding a chair for support and she took her first unsteady steps just before she started school. However, life can be hard for both Mia and her parents. \\"There are a lot of sleepless nights because Mia's condition affects the right side of her body, which is very weak,\\" her mother said. \\"If she turns onto her side in her sleep she can't move back and she wakes up in pain. So we wake up every hour and a half to turn her over. \\"Mia also wants to be like all her friends and run around playing. But she has to pace herself - 20 minutes of fun for her can mean two days of pain. \\"We're on first name terms with the staff at A&E because her joints dislocate so easily. \\"And with it comes a lot of anxiety for Mia. I'd say it's increasing the older she gets. She worries over anything and everything. \\"She has days where a lot of frustration comes out and she takes it out on her older sister Megan. We have had the comment 'why can't Megan have bad legs and not me'. It is hard for her.\\" It was Mia's longing for normality that drove her to start fundraising. In 2012, the Dreams Come True charity, which gives opportunities to children with life-limiting conditions, gave Mia and her family a holiday in Florida. \\"I don't think people know the implications of having physio every day and having to go to hospital so I think the holiday gave her a lot of normality and a break from it all,\\" said  Karene. \\"Ever since then she has wanted to give back and also help other children\\" Mia added: \\"I wanted to help people who have conditions like me so they wouldn't get any worse.\\" She now spends her free time fundraising for charities and campaigning to improve the rights of disabled people. Last year, she was presented with the Princess Diana Award and this year she was shortlisted for the Young Fundraiser of the Year, both in recognition of her charity work. She was presented with two awards after her ice skating challenge last week and has been made an ambassador for Caudwell Children, a charity which provides support for disabled children and their families. She also visits the Senedd in Cardiff Bay to meet with assembly members to discuss changes she would like to see brought in for disabled people in education and housing. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns supported her during her ice skating challenge because, as her mother said, \\"Mia was inundating him with emails\\". Karene said: \\"She is one stubborn, determined girl - her ice challenge shows that. She is an inspiration but it caused me a lot of sleepless nights as I do worry about her.\\" And there may be more worry to come - Mia said she is keen to carry on with the ice skating and is already planning her next fundraiser, a ball at the Celtic Manor, which she is organising with her sister. \\"I just want to keep raising money so people can get breaks from hospital - it's not nice when you always have to go to hospital,\\" she added.

A devestated Clara commits suicide.Unfortunately for the Wilherns, Clara's mother happens to be a witch.

On tärkeää ymmärtää, että Euroopan unionin taloudellinen ja poliittinen vakaus on riippuvainen sen jäsenmaiden välisestä yhteistyöstä ja solidaarisuudesta. Tästä syystä on ensisijaisen tärkeää, että kaikki jäsenmaat, niin uudet kuin vanhatkin, toimivat yhdessä ja tukevat toisiaan työllisyyden, kasvun ja sisämarkkinoiden edistämiseksi. Työllisyys ja kasvu ovat elintärkeitä tekijöitä Euroopan talouden kannalta, ja niitä voidaan edistää parhaiten investoimalla koulutukseen, infrastruktuuriin ja innovaatioon. Euroopan unionin sisämarkkinat ovat keskeinen mekanismi, jonka avulla voidaan houkutella investointeja ja luoda työpaikkoja ympäri mannerta. Yhteisten sääntöjen, normien ja direktiivien avulla voidaan varmistaa, että jäsenvaltiot pystyvät kilpailemaan tasapuolisesti ja että niiden välinen kauppa on mahdollisimman vapaata ja esteetöntä. Solidaarisuus EU:n jäsenmaiden, erityisesti uusien jäsenten, välillä on tärkeää muutamasta syystä. Ensinnäkin se auttaa vähentämään taloudellista epätasa-arvoa alueiden välillä ja levittämään vaurautta laajemmalle alueelle. Toiseksi se vahvistaa poliittista yhteenkuuluvuutta ja yhteistyötä, mikä auttaa unionia saavuttamaan yhteisiä tavoitteita niin kotimaassa kuin kansainvälisissäkin kysymyksissä. Lopuksi sisämarkkinat ovat eräs Euroopan unionin tärkeimmistä saavutuksista ja solidaarisuuden ilmentymä. Laajalla ja monipuolisella markkinalla on valtava potentiaali lisätä kasvua, työllisyyttä ja kilpailukykyä Euroopassa. Siksi on elintärkeää jatkaa yhteistyötä ja solidaarisuutta EU:n jäsenvaltioiden kesken ja siten varmistaa, että kaikki maat voivat hyödyntää sisämarkkinoiden tarjoamia mahdollisuuksia."},{"instruction":"What would you be doing if you are having lunch?

Avoid creating questions that (i) can't be answered correctly without actually understanding the passage and (ii) uses the same words or phrases given in the passage. Context: An early sign of apoptosis in many cells is the appearance of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outside of the plasma membrane, whilst the cells still retain the ability to exclude DNA-binding molecules such as propidium iodide and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD). The protein annexin V binds preferentially to PS and has often been used to monitor the early phase of apoptosis. There have been some conflicting results concerning whether annexin V binds to camptothecin (CAM)-treated HL-60 cells, a commonly used model for apoptosis. We investigated the effects of culturing HL-60 cells for up to 8 h with a range of CAM concentrations.', 'We used flow cytometry to measure cellular light scatter, annexin V-FITC binding, and 7-AAD uptake, and DNA content after fixation and permeabilization. We also used microscopy to examine the morphology of cells (both unsorted and sorted according to their light scatter) after cytocentrifugation.', 'We found that CAM caused the rapid appearance of low light scatter apoptotic bodies. Even among cells with \\"normal\\" light scatter, there was widespread DNA cleavage and nuclear fragmentation by 3 h. The percentage of apoptotic bodies peaked at about 4 h and it was only afterward that annexin V binding could be detected to both intact cells and to apoptotic bodies. When they first appeared, the intact annexin V+ cells had S-phase DNA content. Answer: During CAM-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells, the external exposure of PS can either precede or follow DNA cleavage, which suggests that PS exposure is not always an indicator of early apoptosis. Output:","output":"What does the observation of phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and DNA cleavage during camptothecin (CAM)-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells suggest about using PS exposure as an indicator of early apoptosis?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - practice - skill - thief - dexterity - knowledge of music  Explain why a human would choose \\"dexterity\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"dexterity\\" to answer the question above because dexterity pertains to a person's ability to skillfully handle objects and perform tasks that require fine motor skills. When someone is \\"fiddling\\" with something, it implies that they are manipulating or handling an object, which often requires precise finger movements and hand-eye coordination. This is typically associated with dexterity more than other options. To further explain, let's briefly examine the other options: 1. Practice: This refers to the act of repeatedly performing a task or skill to improve one's ability. While practice can help develop dexterity, it in itself does not describe the specific skill being used when someone is fiddling with something. 2. Skill: This is a broad term referring to one's proficiency in a specific task. It cannot specifically describe the ability needed to fiddle with something since it's not clear which skill is being referred to. 3. Thief: This relates to someone who steals or takes things without permission, and while a thief may possess dexterity to pick locks and handle objects stealthily, not everyone who fiddles with something is a thief. 4. Knowledge of music: This refers to one's understanding or awareness of musical theory, instruments, and concepts. Fiddling with something does not necessarily involve music, and thus it's not a valid answer in this context. Dexterity, therefore, becomes the most appropriate answer as it directly addresses the fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination required when fiddling with something."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I always cherish a secret desire to take a glance before it at myself in a beautiful new dress. However, each time when it comes to the fulfillment, I get seized with such an uneasiness that I literally stagger  away--backing out at the critical moment. At the root of it is my lack of confidence by which I have been enslaved since childhood. It embarrasses me at the mildest praise, crushes my utmost efforts to say \\"No\\", and prevents me from asking my parents for one cent more than necessary. Among other things, lack of confidence has wormed its way into my love of piano. At the age of 14, one Sunday morning, I was woken up by a resounding hymn . Tracing that call of God into a neighboring church, I found myself deeply attracted by the melody of a piano--something beyond the means of my parents. To make it worse, people say a pianist is supposed to have music in the blood, but I believe I had none from my engineer father and technician mother. For days on end, I kept thinking of nothing else. I had a dream. It wasn't a dream after gold, which made some of my close friends to engage in business as self-employed traders or street peddlers. I was sometimes dazzled by their gold rings or elegant necklaces behind which, however, I seemed to catch sight of skeletons in their cupboards and was frightened away from the craze for fortunate. Out of despair, I kept it to myself, lack of confidence weighing heavy on me. I could do nothing but turn to my dream for comfort, for courage to aim high and wish for the impossible. I was convinced that before I could afford anything expensive (to me, it was a piano), I should climb up the academic ladder as high as possible. For the next nine years, I carefully held back my desire for music to keep my search for learning, especially in English studies. My efforts were so rewarding that I went successfully through high school and college in my hometown. When I received the admission notice for a second...

Step 2: Identifying characteristics of lava movement - Lava flows can be slow or swift, viscous or fluid, depending on factors such as its composition and the slope of the terrain. They can spread and change direction as they encounter obstacles or channels. They can also cool, harden, and accumulate, forming new landmasses. Step 3: Comparing lava movement to something else - The objective is to identify an object or process that shares similarities in how it moves or behaves. The characteristics of lava movement include fluidity, the ability to change direction, and progressing over a surface.  Step 4: Identifying a suitable comparison - One possible comparison is that the movement of lava might be compared to that of a river.  Justification: Both lava and rivers can flow over the ground and change directions when faced with obstacles or channels. Their speed can vary depending on the landscape, and both can contribute to shaping the earth's surface over time. This comparison provides an understandable analogy for the movement of lava while capturing its key characteristics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role. The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \\"Cat's Meow\\" and all his early ones from \\"Targets\\" to \\"Nickleodeon\\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \\"Moonlighting\\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.

Senate Panels Set Hearings on Selections for Cabinet WASHINGTON — When Congress returns next week, it will plunge into confirmation hearings on nominees to President-elect Barack Obama’s cabinet. The Senate leadership will focus on trying to approve cabinet members focusing on national security and finance by the inauguration on Jan. 20, said Jim Manley, chief aide to the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. This week, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, set dates beginning Jan. 8 for three cabinet choices. First up will be Tom Daschle, the former Senate majority leader who has been selected to be secretary of health and human services. The Senate Finance Committee, headed by Senator Max Baucus of Montana, must also consider Mr. Daschle’s nomination. On Jan. 9, Mr. Kennedy’s committee will hold a confirmation hearing for Representative Hilda L. Solis of California, who was chosen as labor secretary. On Jan. 13, Arne Duncan, the selection for education secretary will appear before the panel. Other Senate committees have also penciled in hearing dates. Steven Chu’s confirmation hearing to be energy secretary is to be held by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on Jan. 13. Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, chosen to head the Department of Veterans Affairs, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs on Jan. 14. Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado is to present himself for consideration as secretary of the interior before the Energy and Natural Resources panel on Jan. 15. One of the most closely watched hearings will be that for Eric H. Holder Jr., whom Mr. Obama selected to be attorney general. The Judiciary Committee has set Jan. 15 as the date for that hearing to begin. Mr. Holder is likely to face questions about his role, while deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration, in the pardoning of the fugitive financier Marc Rich. No date has been set for the spotlight moment when Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, chosen to be secretary of state, will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to answer questions rather than ask them. Another heavyweight hearing — in the forefront because of the economic stimulus package under consideration and the bailouts already approved — will be that of Timothy F. Geithner, for Treasury secretary. Peter Baker and David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Washington, and Robert Pear from Crawford, Tex.

The village has a tradition where every child, when they come of age, is given a special, enchanted shell that functions as a safety measure. In times of danger or trouble, they must blow into the shell, and the village warriors will be alerted and come to their aid. Eep, though happy in her town, has always had a burning curiosity and adventurous spirit to explore the world beyond Seashell Cove. She has heard tales of an ancient treasure, said to be hidden deep within the Forbidden Caves, located far from the village. This treasure, according to the locals, has the power to grant their possessor the ability to summon the powers of the sea. However, the caves are notorious for their danger and instability, and anyone who enters them rarely returns.  Urged by her adventurous spirit and desire for finding the lost treasure, Eep secretly embarks on a journey to seek out the Forbidden Caves and prove herself to the villagers. Despite knowing that she will be disobeying her parents and the village chief's orders, she can't dismiss her longing for adventure.  Before leaving, Eep's best friend, Kei, insists she takes her special enchanted shell with her, worried about the dangers she might face. Eep reluctantly agrees, and the duo shares a heartfelt moment before Eep sets off on her journey.  Along the way, she encounters numerous obstacles, such as dangerous sea creatures, treacherous landscapes, and a mysterious band of pirates seeking the same treasure. However, she also finds unexpected friendships and allies in her quest, including Zale, a lone sailor with mystical ancestry and knowledge of ancient legends. As Eep and her newfound allies close in on the location of the Forbidden Caves, the danger becomes ever more imminent. When they finally reach the caves and attempt to retrieve the treasure, a series of unexpected and life-threatening events occur, resulting in a climactic cave-in.  In the very moment Eep thinks all hope is lost, she remembers the enchanted shell given by Kei. With a final, desperate attempt, she raises the shell to her lips and blows with all her might, summoning the power of the sea to part the falling rocks and reveal an escape route. As the cave crumbles around them, the village's warriors led by Kei hear the call of the shell and arrive just in time to help Eep and her friends escape safely. Returning triumphantly to Seashell Cove, Eep is greeted as a hero, and the villagers celebrate her daring feat. She has not only found the ancient treasure of the Forbidden Caves but also gained respect and admiration from her family, friends, and the entire village. The adventure may have ended, yet, the many new friendships and the experiences she gained during her quest have only grown Eep's desire to explore and protect the world around her.

Yankees will win World Series The Red Sox and Yankees have long been AL East powers, but pitching will stand in the way of either team winning the World Series this season. Here in the northeast corner of America, where the Hub of the Universe and the City That Doesn't Sleep stare at one another from a distance of 200 miles, the popular notion is that the Red Sox and Yankees are among the frontrunners to win the 2011 World Series. Why not? After all, the Yankees have won it 27 times and have the highest payroll in baseball. And the Red Sox came to spring training with 15 players who had been all-stars. The Boston Herald tagged them the \\"Best Team Ever'' in a back-page headline. The Yankees and Red Sox meet in the playoffs every year, right? Actually, no. They've only met in the playoffs three times, and not once since the 2004 epic ALCS when the Red Sox became the only team in baseball history to come back from a 3-0 deficit in a seven-game series. But the Sox and Yanks are on a collision course in 2011. Bursting with self-importance, last week they needed four hours and 21 minutes to play a nine-inning game in which six runs were scored. The Sox will be back in New York for the final weekend of the regular season. It'll be Athens-Sparta, Ali-Frazier, Russell-Chamberlain and Brady-Manning. Deep into the night. Every night. With three weeks left in the regular season, the Sox and Yanks think they're the chosen ones this year ... but there's one little problem. Postseason series are won with dominant pitching (remember the salami-bat Giants of 2010?) and -- for all their double-digit scoring and star-laden offenses -- the Red Sox and Yankees don't have consistent pitching beyond their No. 1 starters. That's why neither team is going to win the World Series this year. Let's start with Boston. In spring training the Red Sox thought they had too many starters. They had Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, Clay Buchholz, John Lackey, Daisuke Matsuzaka and Tim Wakefield. We wondered if Wake might end up getting cut from the team before leaving Fort Myers (the 45-year-old Wakefield, the oldest player in the majors, has failed to win his 200th career victory in seven tries). Instead, Daisuke's shoulder blew out and he's back in Japan after season-ending surgery. Buchholz has a broken bone in his back and is likely done for the season. Lackey has been the most buffeted pitcher in the American League, and on Monday Beckett was sent back to Boston after badly spraining his right ankle in a start in Toronto. Southpaw Erik Bedard was acquired from Seattle at the trading deadline, but he's skipping his next start because of a bum knee. Bedard has never pitched in the playoffs and has been a bust every September of his career. So, Red Sox Nation, how are you feeling now about your team's chances in October? And is anyone uncomfortable that the Rangers went 6-4 against the Sox in '11, winning all six games by at least four runs? Let's not forget the Boston bullpen. While the Sox are set with Daniel Bard and Jonathan Papelbon in the eighth and ninth, respectively, GM Theo Epstein never found a solution for the seventh-inning guy. And the Bobby Jenks acquisition represented more money flushed down the toilet. Folks in Boston have enjoyed mocking the mighty Yankees and their pitching woes all season, but any objective observer would have to say the Yanks are in better shape on the mound that the Sox at this hour. And that's with an unlikely cast of millionaires, kids and reclamation projects. We are coming into the second week of September, the Yankees have the best record in the American League, and yet Joe Girardi is still auditioning candidates for his playoff rotation. The final four will come from a field of six: CC Sabathia, Ivan Nova, Bartolo Colon, Freddy Garcia, A.J. Burnett and Phil Hughes. It's a motley crew, but has performed better than expected. In April and May we wondered how a team with such deep pockets could rely on a kid like Nova and a couple of re-treads like Colon and Garcia. Turns out those three have been stronger than the highly-paid Burnett and former All-Star Hughes. Aided by a stem-cell transplant, the rotund, ancient Colon is 8-9 with a 3.72 ERA. Garcia, meanwhile, is 11-7 with a 3.50 ERA. Everybody knows that Sabathia will pitch the first game of the playoff for the Yankees, but homegrown Nova (15-4, 3.89 ERA) is the clubhouse favorite to get the ball in Game 2. Nobody feels good about Burnett (5.25 ERA) and Hughes (6.41), but both have pitched well enough lately to stay in consideration. The Yankees don't have a reliable lefty in the bullpen, but are better prepared than Boston with Rafael Soriano, David Robertson and ageless Mariano Rivera (39 saves). All that said, does anybody think the Yankees or Sox can match up with baseball's best rotation: Philadelphia's Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, Cole Hamels and Roy Oswalt (or young Vance Worley)? How about the Texas Rangers' top quartet? At this hour, you can make the argument that the Rangers have a better rotation than the Yankees and the Red Sox. So let's watch the Sox and Yankees knock themselves out for the next three weeks. They think they are headed for a dream matchup in the ALCS. But it might not even get that far. The Yankees and Red Sox are great frontrunning bullies. But neither team is going to win the 2011 World Series. Dan Shaughnessy is a columnist for The Boston Globe. Read more of his columns here. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees are unlikely to win the World Series this season due to weak pitching beyond their No. 1 starters.

Given the question: Quicksand forms in saturated loose sand when the sand is suddenly agitated. When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles.  The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy.  Rob is competing in a cross country race. After running about a mile he reached a place with two signs, sign A and sign B. Sign A says that it's a quicksand. But sign B says that it's not a quicksand. He has to decide which way to go.  Would sing A indicate spongy texture or not spongy texture of the soil?

Act 3: - As Lily's condition deteriorates, the group races against time to prevent Pazuzu from gaining full control over her and opening a gateway, allowing more malevolent spirits to enter the world. Through their collective skills and determination, they uncover a long-hidden secret that reveals a crucial weakness in the demon. - Armed with this knowledge and employing their diverse skills, the team confronts Pazuzu in an epic, final battle between good and evil. Sarah, Tom, David, and their newfound allies band together to face Pazuzu, using their knowledge of ancient rituals and symbols to weaken the demon's power. - The climax sees the final showdown between Tom, who's acting as the main exorcist, and Pazuzu. Tom ultimately performs a sacrificial rite that forces Pazuzu to retreat, saving Lily's life and closing the gateway. - In the aftermath, the group members come to terms with their ordeal and the losses they have suffered. Each finds solace and healing in the bond they have forged, with some of them deciding to continue their fight against the dark forces that remain hidden in the shadows. Ultimately, Pazuzu's Awakening delves into themes of faith, redemption, sacrifice, and the resilience of the human spirit.

After the wedding, Juliet's Southern cousin, Laura Anders, calls from South Carolina to apologize for not attending because of appendicitis. Juliet promises to visit Laura on her honeymoon and has Rodney write down the address. Before the newlyweds can leave, Rodney is visited by a woman named Clara Raymond, who blackmails him over their past relationship. Juliet's friend, Betty Trent, sees them drive away in Rodney's car. Rodney refuses to pay and is hit over the head by Clara's accomplice and develops amnesia.

Read this article and answer this question Meanwhile, in 1274, the former Dali Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of Yunnan, with Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar as governor. In May 1275, the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned; that the Burmese evidently had no intention of submitting; and that war was the only way forward. But the emperor rejected an outright invasion. Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275-76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276. By 1277, at least one Burmese vassal state named \\"Gold Teeth\\"  had submitted to the Mongols. Like in 1272, the Burmese government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state; but unlike in 1272, the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there. Though it was ultimately under Mongol command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were Turkic-speaking peoples or people from the further west: Turks from Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv and Nishapur, but also captive soldiers from the Persian Khwarazmid empire, the Kipchaks, and even Bulgars from the lower Volga.

Write the answer: Which English football team was both the last to win the FA Cup final at the old Wembley Stadium, and the first to win the FA Cup final at the New Wembley Stadium?","output":"The English football team that has the unique distinction of being both the last to win the FA Cup final at the old Wembley Stadium and the first to win the FA Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium is Chelsea Football Club.  Let's dive into the history and details of these two events. 1. Old Wembley Stadium (1923-2000): Also known as the Empire Stadium, it was an iconic football ground located in Wembley Park, London. It was inaugurated in 1923 and served as the primary stadium for various events, including, but not limited to, the FA Cup finals, the Summer Olympics, and numerous international football fixtures. In the 1999-2000 season, the FA Cup final was held at the old Wembley Stadium for the last time, marking the end of a glorious era. On May 20, 2000, Chelsea faced Aston Villa in the final match at the stadium. Chelsea had been performing well throughout the tournament, and they came into the final with great form and determination. The sole goal of the match was scored by Chelsea's Roberto Di Matteo in the 73rd minute, securing a 1-0 victory for Chelsea. This victory marked the end of an era, as Chelsea became the last team to lift the FA Cup at the old Wembley Stadium. 2. New Wembley Stadium (2007-Present): After a long construction period, the new Wembley Stadium opened in 2007, retaining some of the original structures' architectural elements while incorporating modern technologies and facilities. The new stadium remains a distinctive symbol of English football and continues to host important sports events, including the FA Cup finals. The first FA Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium took place on May 19, 2007, and again featured Chelsea, this time against Manchester United. It was a highly anticipated match, as both teams had a large number of supporters and had performed exceptionally well during the tournament. The game was a hard-fought contest, with both teams exchanging chances but ultimately being unable to break the deadlock during regular time. The match went into extra time, still tied at 0-0. In the 116th minute, Chelsea's Didier Drogba managed to score the winning goal, ensuring a 1-0 victory over Manchester United. This historic win made Chelsea the first team to win the FA Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium, creating an enduring legacy for the club in English football history. In conclusion, Chelsea Football Club holds the prestigious distinction of winning the FA Cup final at both the old and the new Wembley Stadiums, achieving these victories in the 1999-2000 and 2006-2007 football seasons, respectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Naomi Eisenstadt, the independent advisor on poverty and inequality, set out 15 recommendations for what more could be done to tackle the problem. Her report urges \\"bold\\" moves on tax reform, the living wage, childcare and public service delivery. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the report, announcing £1m of funding for early learning and childcare. Earlier government reports have found that half a million Scots are living in poverty, including 100,000 children. Oxford University research fellow Ms Eisenstadt was appointed by Ms Sturgeon in 2015 to provide advice on poverty and inequality. In her report, she said the Scottish government had been \\"signalling changes to the council tax since its first term in office\\". She said the government should \\"consider ending the council tax freeze from 2017/18 onwards\\", saying this would \\"make a contribution to protecting public services that are particularly supportive of families in poverty\\". 'Constructive approach' She also said the government should build more social housing, to focus on expanding the living wage to larger employers and do more to ensure people claim the benefits they are entitled to. Ms Eisenstadt said she was \\"struck by the genuinely open and constructive approach\\" people had taken with her during her inquiry. She said: \\"The key message for me is that everyone has a role to play, local government, the voluntary sector, the Scottish government and people in poverty themselves, who clearly have the best understanding of the challenges of living on a low income.\\" Analysis by Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland local government correspondent For some time there's been a debate over just who's been helped most by the council tax freeze. The Scottish government argues the freeze has been a real help to family budgets - with the biggest proportionate impact on those earning more modest incomes. Critics contend the way the freeze actually works is leading to cuts which may have the most impact on the poor and the vulnerable. The bulk of council money is from the government - money to compensate them for freezing the council tax is only one part of the equation. In a wide-ranging report for the government, the poverty tsar acknowledges that this debate has been going on. The comments are made within the context of a contribution to the question of what should happen next to council funding. The tsar says the freeze should end in 2017 before any wider overhaul of council funding. The SNP is still debating its policies for the Holyrood election including what should happen to the freeze and options for replacing or reforming council tax. But her remarks will be seized upon by the government's critics. Some would contend that if the freeze should end next year - then why not now? They'd argue the fundamental arguments haven't suddenly changed - and many councils across Scotland are currently looking for new cuts and savings as they're set to receive less overall from the government in the coming year than they'd anticipated. Last week Moray Council proposed putting up bills by 18% to avoid cuts. A few others are looking seriously at the idea of breaking the freeze - but while the current system for the freeze continues, any rise would have to be significant to make any difference to their finances. The Scottish government has welcomed the report's findings, and moved immediately to provide funding for up to six early learning and childcare trials to test different delivery models. Launching the report alongside Ms Eisenstadt, the first minister said the government would respond formally to the report before the end of March. She said: \\"When I appointed Naomi to the role I was clear that she would work independently and be frank and challenging in her scrutiny of not only the work the Scottish government was doing to alleviate poverty and inequality, but also what more can be done. \\"We now need to study the report and look at what we're doing well and should continue to do, and where we can improve.\\" 'We can do more now' Scottish Labour said the report was evidence of how \\"timid\\" the SNP had been in its near-decade in power at Holyrood, citing fuel poverty, the living wage and housing. Jackie Baillie said: \\"Naomi Eisenstadt has revealed the gap between the SNP's campaigning rhetoric and their record in government. \\"After a decade in power and a majority in parliament, the SNP have been managerial rather than radical in government.\\" Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie welcomed the report saying \\"we can do more right away\\". He added: \\"Housing costs in many parts of Scotland are disgracefully high, and too many people of low incomes are forced to find a home from the expensive private rented sector. \\"Building more social housing is absolutely crucial, but we also need to regulate rent levels in the private sector. The housing bill that's up for debate in Holyrood is our chance to do that, but we have to make sure that rent control measures are strong enough.\\" A:","output":"The independent advisor on poverty and inequality, Naomi Eisenstadt, urges \\"bold\\" moves on tax reform, living wage, childcare, and public service delivery in her report, with the Scottish government pledging £1m for early learning and childcare in response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the husband of the Palestinian Christian woman's sister?  Muna Farah is a divorced Palestinian Christian mother raising her teenage son Fadi. She works for a bank in Ramallah, part of the West Bank, Palestinian territories. Each day after work, Muna picks up Fadi from school and crosses through an Israeli checkpoint in order to get to their home in Bethlehem. She lives with her aging mother and has occasional visits from her brother Samer. One day after arriving home, Muna discovers that she has been awarded an American green card through the lottery. Although she initially considered declining the offer, Muna reconsiders after she and Fadi are harassed at the checkpoint by Israeli soldiers. They arrive in the United States shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to stay with her sister's family in Illinois. After a difficult time with customs, Muna is reunited with her sister, Raghda Halaby, physician brother-in-law Nabeel and their three children Salma, Rana, and Lamis. Later, however, Muna discovers that a box of cookies was confiscated during the customs search and is horrified: the box contained all of her life savings.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   A tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells (Figure 3.17b). Proteins hold the cells tightly against each other. This tight adhesion prevents materials from leaking between the cells. Tight junctions are typically found in the epithelial tissue that lines internal organs and cavities, and composes most of the skin. For example, the tight junctions of the epithelial cells lining the urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking into the extracellular space. Also found only in animal cells are desmosomes, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells (Figure 3.17c). They keep cells together in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch, like the skin, heart, and muscles. Gap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions, nutrients, and other substances that enable cells to communicate (Figure 3.17d). Structurally, however, gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ.   Q: What is the term for a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells?

Movie title: Horror Express Movie plot: Professor Alexander Saxton (Christopher Lee) is an anthropologist returning home to Europe via the Trans-Siberian Railway. He brings with him a large crate containing the prize from his expedition to the Himilayas: the frozen remains of a primitive humanoid creature, which Saxton is sure is the missing link in the evolutionary chain. Also on board is Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing), another Englishman and a colleague of Saxton's.Mysterious deaths occur even before the train sets out. A known thief is found dead on the platform after having looked into the crate. His corpse is discovered bleeding from the eyes, which have turned blank and white. A slightly unbalanced monk named Pujardov (a Rasputin-esque figure, played by the Argentine actor Alberto de Mendoza), claims that the crate is evil. Pujardov is the spiritual adviser for Count Maryan Petrovski (George Rigaud) and his wife, Irina (Silvia Tortosa), and he tries to demonstrate to them that the crate is an omen of evil: in a bizarre rationalization, he claims that where there is evil, there is no place for the sign of the cross, and a piece of chalk fails to make the marking of the cross on the side of the crate. Saxton dismisses it as a trick and discredits the monk.Saxton is eager to keep his find a secret from everyone, especially Dr. Wells, but Wells pays the baggage man to look into the crate when everyone is gone and tell him what's inside. Later, the man does this and is also killed by the creature, which possesses a glowing red eye. After gazing at the red eye, the man's eyes begin to bleed and turn white until he falls down dead. The ape-man quickly picks the lock of the crate just like the Chinese thief did back at the beginning of the train's voyage. The creature leaves the crate and places the baggage man's corpse inside instead; the others discover it later and Saxton is forced to come clean about his discovery. Inspector Mirov (Julio Peña) represents authority on the train, and he tries to keep the news of the death quiet among the passengers,...

This song is a track from Steely Dan's 1977 album called \\"Aja,\\" widely respected for its sophisticated, jazz-influenced take on rock music. \\"Peg\\" is particularly noted for its complex rhythm track, and Marotta's role in setting that foundation was critical. Rick Marotta is an American session drummer who has contributed to albums by numerous prominent artists. Although well-credited with playing on Peg, Marotta was not Steely Dan's primary drummer. Steely Dan, due to their utilization of a rotating group of studio musicians, worked with several talented drummers, including Jeff Porcaro and Steve Gadd, throughout their career. Marotta's memorable work on \\"Peg\\" is a superb illustration of Steely Dan's approach to music recording. Steely Dan, which was primarily a partnership between Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, was known for their perfectionism in the studio, frequently recording multiple takes with various artists until achieving the sound they desired. Marotta, who is well-known for this record among drummers, mentioned in interviews that it was a particularly challenging session, as Becker and Fagen required him to provide numerous different takes on the track. The song \\"Peg\\" also includes an acclaimed guitar solo by Jay Graydon and it's known for Michael McDonald's distinct background vocals. However, Marotta's beats are the backbone of this groovy song. The drummer's contribution to the single can not be overstated, as his precise rhythm made the song danceable and complex at the same time. Therefore, whenever \\"Peg\\" by Steely Dan is listened to, it's hard not to think about Rick Marotta's integral role.

Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

Nearly a year after Sept. 11, the Legal Aid Society-the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless-remains, well, homeless. The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business.

The journey typically involves a layover in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, as Finnair is headquartered there. This layover allows passengers to stretch their legs and explore the Helsinki airport before boarding the second connecting flight from Helsinki to Chongqing. When planning a trip between Copenhagen and Chongqing with Finnair, it is essential to consider a few details. Firstly, you'll want to check the currency exchange rates, visa requirements, and any travel alerts or advisories that may impact your journey. Additionally, you will need to be aware of any baggage restrictions or additional fees that may apply during your travels. When flying, it is always recommended to arrive at the airport at least two hours before your scheduled departure. This will provide you with ample time to check-in, go through security, and locate your boarding gate. Remember that passport control may take some time, so allocating extra time for such formalities may save you from any unnecessary stress. One aspect of long-haul flights is managing jet lag. Traveling between different time zones can put stress on your body's internal clock, making it challenging to adjust to a new schedule. To cope with jet lag, try to get plenty of rest before your trip, stay hydrated during the flight, and adjust your sleep schedule to match the destination time zone as soon as you can. While you may not be able to completely avoid jet lag, you can minimize its effects by taking care of yourself both before and during your travels.

The information provided is: \\"Derrick was more skinny than Joseph\\" Now let's analyze the choices: i. Derrick didn't have to go to the gym and workout as often. This choice suggests that since Derrick was skinnier than Joseph, he might not need to go to the gym and work out as frequently as Joseph. ii. Joseph didn't have to go to the gym and workout as often. This choice suggests that since Derrick was skinnier than Joseph, Joseph might not need to go to the gym and work out as frequently. However, this choice does not seem logical given the context, because if Derrick is skinnier, it is more likely that Joseph would need to work out more, not less.

Article: The Internet has greatly changed the way people communicate. But some teachers think the changes are not all for the better. Eleanor Johnson, an English professor, thinks that text messaging has made students believe that it is far more acceptable than it actually is to just make terrible spelling and grammatical errors. And she says her students over the past several years have increasingly used less formal English in their writing. Words and phrases like \\"guy\\" and \\"you know\\" now appear in research papers. Professor Johnson supposes there is a strong relationship between the rise of informal online communication and an increase in writing mistakes. But she says there may not be much scientific information, at least not yet. David Crystal, a British linguist , says the actively changing nature of the Internet makes it difficult to keep up-to-date in studying its effects. But he believes its influence on language is small. The main effect of the Internet on language is the way it has added to the expressive richness of language, providing language with a new set of communicative tools that haven't existed in the past. Erin Jansen is founder of NetLingo.com, an online dictionary of the Internet and text messaging terms. She says the new technology has not changed existing language but has greatly added to its vocabulary. Basically it's freedom of expression. And what about those teachers who find these new kinds of mistakes in spelling and grammar in their students' work? What is her message to them? Erin Jansen said, \\"I am always on the students' side and won't get angry or upset about that. If it's helping the kids write more or communicate more, that's great. That's what teachers and educators want--to get kids communicating.\\" But Erin Jansen and David Crystal agree with Eleanor Johnson on at least one thing.

In January 1963, the Shah announced the \\"White Revolution\\", a six-point programme of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation's schools. Some of these initiatives were regarded as dangerous, especially by the powerful and privileged Shi'a ulama (religious scholars), and as Westernizing trends by traditionalists (Khomeini viewed them as \\"an attack on Islam\\"). Ayatollah Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior marjas of Qom and persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution. On 22 January 1963 Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing the Shah and his plans. Two days later the Shah took an armored column to Qom, and delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama as a class.  Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programmes, issuing a manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Iranian Shia religious scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had allegedly violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to the United States and Israel. He also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on 21 March 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies.  On the afternoon of 'Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh madrasah drawing parallels between the Sunni Muslim caliph Yazid, who is perceived as a 'tyrant' by Shias, and the Shah, denouncing the Shah as a \\"wretched, miserable man,\\" and warning him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country.  On 5 June 1963 (15 of Khordad) at 3:00 am, two days after this public denunciation of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini was detained in Qom and transferred to Tehran. This sparked three days of major riots throughout Iran and led to the deaths of some 400. That event is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad. Khomeini was kept under house arrest and released in August.

One of the best ways to flush waste and excess nutrients out of your system is to stay hydrated. The simplest way to hydrate yourself is to drink water.   (a). When you drink plenty of water, your body has plenty of time to provide fluids. When you don't, your body wastes more water than you physically can use..  (b). While the exact amount of water you should drink every day varies from person to person, these basic guidelines work for most people : The average man should drink about 13 cups (3 liters) of water per day. The average woman should drink about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water per day..  (c). Keeping yourself well hydrated can help to decrease the amount of gas that builds up in your body. The amount of fluid can affect the buoyancy of your body..  (d). Stock up on water before and during the day, and transfer to your cart later on in the day. The plain water will do the trick; a lot of people get hungry between meals because they're thirsty..","output":"(b).

Explanation: This answer is the most relevant to the topic of flushing salt out of the body and gives specific numbers that are helpful to the reader. Drinking enough water is essential for flushing out salt and staying hydrated. (a) is incorrect because it talks about body waste and fluids, but doesn't specifically mention flushing salt out of the body. (c) is incorrect because it discusses gas buildup and buoyancy, which are not related to flushing salt out of our body.

Step 2: Apply L'Hopital's rule by taking the derivative of the numerator and denominator with respect to x. Numerator: [math]frac{d}{dx} (1 - cos x) = 0 - (-sin x) = sin x[/math] Denominator: [math]frac{d}{dx} (x^2) = 2x[/math] Step 3: Evaluate the limit after taking the derivative of the numerator and denominator. [math]displaystyle lim_{x to 0} frac{sin x}{2x}[/math] Step 4: Recognize the limit is of indeterminate form again (0/0 as x approaches 0) and apply L'Hopital's rule one more time. Numerator: [math]frac{d}{dx} (sin x) = cos x[/math] Denominator: [math]frac{d}{dx} (2x) = 2[/math] Step 5: Evaluate the limit after taking the derivative of the numerator and denominator.

Question: Reporter Campbell Babbitt visits Concord in January of what year? Movie title: What Goes Up Movie plot: Upon arriving in Concord, New Hampshire in January 1986 to cover the hometown hooplah for the looming Space Shuttle Challenger launch where Concord teacher Christa McAuliffe is among the mission's crew, reporter Campbell Babbitt (Steve Coogan) decides to call an old college friend, only to discover an apparent suicide. Babbitt, who has his own ethical baggage, gravitates toward his friend's high-school students in hopes of finding an unsung hero story about a teacher who made a permanent impact on the social misfits of the school. Instead, he discovers a group of dysfunctional students, outcasts led by a narcissistic seductress (Hilary Duff), a repressed voyeur (Josh Peck), and a scheming pregnant teen (Olivia Thirlby).

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Over 99% of the exocrine pancreas cells produce digestive juices - They secrete digestive juice &#x27;externally&#x27; into the small intestine - There are enzymes for breaking down fats, proteins , and carbohydrates - Digestive juices flows from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine - When the blood sugar levels rise, as they might after a meal, insulin is released - When blood sugar levels are too low, the pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are less enzymes in the body happens, how will it affect more insulin is released into the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation could have indirect effects on the process. If there are fewer enzymes in the body, specifically in the digestive system, this could impact the digestion and absorption rate of nutrients, including carbohydrates. A slower or less efficient breakdown of carbohydrates could potentially result in slower increases in blood sugar levels. Insulin release is triggered by rising blood sugar levels, so a slower or less efficient rise in blood sugar could potentially lead to less immediate demand for insulin, potentially affecting the amount of insulin the pancreas releases post-meal. However, this relationship is complex and influenced by many other factors. The perturbation could also potentially cause metabolism disorders impacting overall endocrine function."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - The Hundred Years' War was a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 by the House of Plantagenet, rulers of the Kingdom of England, against the House of Valois, rulers of the Kingdom of France, over the succession of the French throne. Each side drew many allies into the war.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which are the least vulnerable bands for multinational impingement? Context: Frequencies for COMPASS are allocated in four bands: E1, E2, E5B, and E6 and overlap with Galileo. The fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of view of the receiver design, but on the other hand raises the issues of inter-system interference, especially within E1 and E2 bands, which are allocated for Galileo's publicly regulated service. However, under International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies, the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency, and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to using that frequency, and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original nation's broadcasts. It now appears that Chinese COMPASS satellites will start transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe's Galileo satellites and thus have primary rights to these frequency ranges.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:     Choices:  - stems  - leaves  - petals  - stamens   A: A:","output":"Stamens produce microspores that develop into pollen grains containing male gametophytes. Stamens are the male reproductive organs of a flower and consist of two parts: the filament and the anther. The filament is the stalk that supports the anther, while the anther contains the microsporangia, which in turn produce the microspores. These microspores develop into pollen grains containing male gametophytes. In the process of plant reproduction, pollen grains produced by stamens must reach the female reproductive organ, known as the pistil. This transfer is called pollination and can occur through various methods, such as wind, insects, or animals. Once the pollen grain reaches the pistil, it germinates, developing a pollen tube that carries the male gametophyte, or sperm cells, to the ovule. The sperm cells then fertilize the egg cells within the ovules, leading to the formation of seeds and, eventually, new plants.

Ramsey Orta, the citizen journalist who recorded the tragic incident, was reportedly arrested by police officers on suspicion of selling drugs, according to law enforcement sources.  Background: Ramsey Orta, a 28-year-old Staten Island resident, rose to national prominence in July 2014 when he filmed the arrest of Eric Garner, a Black man who died after being placed in a chokehold by a white police officer, Daniel Pantaleo. The graphic video went viral, inciting widespread protests and sparking a nationwide conversation on police brutality and racial profiling. Orta has since faced various legal issues and claimed that the NYPD has targeted him in retaliation for the video. Recent Arrest and Charges: On [insert date], police officers arrested Ramsey Orta on charges of drug possession and sales. According to the police, the arrest followed a carefully conducted investigation that revealed Orta was allegedly dealing drugs in Staten Island. The authorities accuse him of possessing and selling heroin, crack cocaine, marijuana, and various prescription pills. Upon further investigation, the police discovered that Ramsey had been trafficking drugs in his neighborhood, allegedly coordinating with several associates to sell narcotics to willing buyers. The officers reportedly recovered a significant quantity of drugs during his apprehension. Orta now faces several charges, including criminal sale of a controlled substance, criminal possession of a controlled substance, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Orta's Response and Legal Proceedings: Ramsey Orta and his legal representatives have vehemently denied the charges, proclaiming his innocence and claiming that the arrest is part of a targeted campaign orchestrated by the NYPD to intimidate him following the release of the Garner video.  Orta's attorney has stated that these recent accusations are baseless and a deliberate attempt to tarnish his client's image. The defense team is prepared to challenge the charges in court, arguing that the police investigation was biased, and the arrest was unjust. The case has garnered significant public interest, with many activists rallying behind Orta. They argue that he played a crucial role in exposing the excessive use of force by police and contend that the charges against him are an act of vengeance. Despite public outcry and several notable figures joining Orta's cause, the NYPD has maintained that the arrest was legitimate and the result of an impartial investigation. Conclusion: The arrest of Ramsey Orta, the man who filmed the Eric Garner incident, has ignited a heated conversation about the potential hazards faced by community activists and citizen journalists in an increasingly surveilled society. While the authorities insist that Orta's arrest and subsequent drug charges stem from a legitimate investigation, many are skeptical and view this as an example of the systemic abuse of power by law enforcement. As the situation unfolds, it is essential to remember that the ramification of this case stretches beyond Orta's battle with law enforcement; it also speaks to the safety and rights of those who take it upon themselves to serve as watchdogs, holding authorities accountable for their actions. It is up to the legal system to determine Orta's guilt or innocence, but there is no denying that his arrest has once again opened up a broader dialogue on police-community relations and the methods by which law enforcement operates in the United States."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In 1762, the population of the Dutch colony of Berbice included 3,833 enslaved Blacks, 244 enslaved Amerindians or indigenous people, and 346 whites. On 23 February 1763, slaves on Plantation Magdalenenberg on the Canje River in Berbice rebelled, protesting harsh and inhumane treatment. They torched the plantation house, then went to other plantations to mobilize other enslaved Africans to join the rebellion. Cuffy, an enslaved man at Lilienburg, another plantation on Canje, is said to have organized them into a military unit. As plantation after plantation fell to the slaves, the Dutch settlers fled northward and the rebels began to take over control of the region. For almost a year, the rebels held on to southern Berbice, while the whites were able to hold on to the north. Eventually only about half of the white population that had lived in the colony remained. The rebels came to number about 3,000 and threatened European control over the Guianas. Other key figures among the rebels include Atta, Accara, and Accabre. The insurgents were eventually defeated in the spring of 1764 with the assistance of troops from neighbouring French and British colonies and from Europe.

Information:  - Andrew Mark Cuomo (born December 6, 1957) is an American politician who has been the 56th Governor of New York since January 1, 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected in 2010, holding the same position his father, Mario Cuomo, held for three terms from 1983 to 1995.  - The Governor of the State of New York is the chief executive of the U.S. state of New York. The governor is the head of the executive branch of New York's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state's military and naval forces.  - A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state. In federations, \\"governor\\" may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal and largely ceremonial power, while others having a complete control over the entire government.  - A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a practical term; it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadershipeither a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.  - A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs.  - Charles J. O'Byrne ( born 1959 ) is an executive at Related Rentals Companies , an American lawyer and former political staffer to Governor of New York David Paterson , serving as Secretary to the Governor . The position , according to then New York Daily News blogger Elizabeth Benjamin , is considered the most powerful in Albany after the Governor himself . He is openly gay . O'Byrne previously served as Chief of Staff to Paterson during his time as Lieutenant Governor of New York as well as in the New York State Senate . He also worked as a speech writer for Howard Dean 's 2004 presidential campaign . Prior to entering politics , O'Byrne became an attorney and subsequently joined the Catholic priesthood , and was a member of the Society of Jesus for twelve years . He wrote and sold a manuscript to Crowne , a division of Random House , with a working title Going My Way , a memoir of his time in religious formation and as a priest but has held back on releasing the book .

The phrase \\"to win any academy awards\\" seems to imply that the movie may have noteworthy qualities or merit, which might suggest a positive leaning in the reviewer's opinion. However, the lack of context and additional information surrounding this statement makes it challenging to make a conclusive determination. There are a few possible interpretations of this sentence: 1. Positive: The reviewer may be expressing that the movie is good enough or outstanding to win Academy Awards, signifying a favorable opinion of the movie. 2. Negative: The reviewer may be using sarcasm or irony, implying that the movie is not good enough to win any Academy Awards. In this case, the statement would indicate a negative opinion of the movie. 3. Neutral: The reviewer could be merely stating a fact about the movie, without expressing a clear opinion, such as if the movie has been nominated for or has won Academy Awards. This interpretation doesn't provide enough information to determine if the opinion is positive or negative. Without additional context or information about the review, it's not possible to definitively label the opinion as either positive or negative. To determine the reviewer's stance more accurately, it would be helpful to have a larger portion of the review for analysis, including any specific praise or criticism of the movie's plot, characters, cinematography, or other elements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  she favors the protesters.  for the following movie plot:  The film begins on a nude beach in Germany in the late 1960s, where we are introduced to Ulrike Meinhoff, a respected journalist, and her family. Meinhoff and her husband are then guests at a party, where Meinhoff reads off a periodical that she wrote about the injustice of the Iranian Government. With the Shah of Persia arriving into Berlin, there is a rally in the streets, where half the people are protesting the injustice and the other half are praising. As the protesting goes on, the Iranian people end up going into the crowd and fighting the innocent German protesters with the help of the German Police; leaving many injured and a man killed. The next scene is of Meinhoff at a television studio arguing why she favors the protesters side instead of the Governments side, and watching the live recording on her television is Gudrun Ensslin, another activist. She explains to her parents how American Imperialism is completely corrupt while Meinhoff walks in on her husband having sex with another woman. Next, we are introduced to Andreas Baader, the ringleader of these revolutionaries who decide to name themselves The Red Army Faction (RAF). Their first major rebellious occurrence takes place in a department store, where they decide to set home made bombs and light it on fire. On a television broadcast we are informed of the many student protests at universities across America and of protests in West Germany, being led by Rudi Dutschke. The film then cuts to a famous rally where Dutschke announced his views on the protest and wars occurring around the world, trying to spark everyone to join their resistance. Rudi Dutschke is then almost assassinated by a man who is accused to be from the Springer Group, which is tied to the German Government. In effect, many activists go to the Springer Group headquarters and riot. As we see there are many demonstrating protesters rioting around the world, Baader and Ensslin are in court confessing about the department store fires.

Select from: 1. yes. 2. it is not possible to tell. 3. no.","output":"3. No. Based on the provided information, the statement says, \\"A woman is sitting on a dock in front of a big gray ship.\\" From this, we can make a few interpretations about the setting and situation as follows: 1. The location is near a body of water, as there is a dock and ship mentioned. 2. The woman is likely outdoors, or at least in an open area, as she is sitting on a dock. 3. The presence of a big gray ship suggests that this could be a harbor or a port. Now let's examine the alternative scenario, \\"A woman is sitting at a desk in a busy office.\\" Here, we can identify the following elements: 1. The location is indoors, specifically within an office environment. 2. The woman is seated at a desk, which typically implies working on some task or using a computer. 3. The office is described as busy, indicating that there are other people around, and there is some level of activity or movement. As we compare the two statements, there are noticeable differences between the situations described. The original statement focuses on a woman sitting on a dock near a ship, while the alternative scenario involves a woman sitting at a desk in a busy office.

Q:The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. Question: Why was there still a possibility of a shutdown? Options:  A. the bill was approved for too much money  B. the senate still had to vote by the deadline  C. the senate still had to vote when they could make arrangements  D. not enough information  === The correct answer is A:","output":"B. the senate still had to vote by the deadline"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One with an old ecosystem named Old island, and the other with a newly formed and forming ecosystem named New island. Both islands were inhabited, Old island being heavily inhabited.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which island had a more favorable amount of rainfall for new ecosystems?  Hint: Ecology is the study of ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues. A:","output":"The given paragraph does not provide explicit information about the amount of rainfall in either Old Island or New Island. However, we can infer from the given information that New Island has a newly formed and forming ecosystem, which might suggest that the island's nonliving factors, such as climate, soil, and amount of rainfall, are more favorable for new ecosystems as they can support the growth of pioneer species.

Some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full! Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great comedy writing team from that era, saw the potential in Eric Hodgins novel, whose hero, Jim Blandings, can't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife Muriel, and two daughters, must share. Jim Blandings, a Madison Ave. executive, has had it! When he sees an ad for Connecticut living, he decides to take a look. Obviously, a first time owner, Jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent. This is only the beginning of his problems. Whatever could be wrong, goes wrong. The architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn't work for the new house, after the original one is razed. As one problem leads to another, more money is necessary, and whatever was going to be the original cost, ends up in an inflated price that Jim could not really afford. The film is fun because of the three principals in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy, was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old boyfriend of Myrna, turned lawyer for the Blandings, is suave and debonair, the way Melvin Douglas portrayed him.

The Tomb of Wang Chuzhi (Chinese 王處直墓 / 王处直墓 Wang Chizhi mu) is the grave of Wang Chuzhi (863-923 CE), a senior military governor of the late period of the Tang Dynasty and the Later Liang from the time of the Five Dynasties.

The tomb has cultural significance","output":"Based on the provided information, we can indeed infer that the Tomb of Wang Chuzhi holds cultural significance. To better understand the cultural importance, let us delve deeper into the background of Wang Chuzhi and his influence during his time. Wang Chuzhi was a prominent military governor during the late period of the Tang Dynasty, which lasted from 618 to 907 CE. The Tang Dynasty is considered one of the greatest empires in Chinese history, and it was known for its vibrant culture, flourishing arts, and military might. Wang Chuzhi played a vital role during this period, when China experienced significant social and political changes. The fact that he also lived through and served during the Later Liang Dynasty further highlights his influence in Chinese history. The Later Liang Dynasty was the first among the Five Dynasties, which was a relatively short era (907 to 960 CE) marked by constant political turmoil. The Five Dynasties period, though brief, witnessed many power struggles, military conquests, and changing borders that ultimately led to the formation of the Song Dynasty. Wang Chuzhi's tomb, discovered in 1980 in Xiyanchuan village, is the physical representation of his life, achievements, and the era he belonged to. The historical significance of Wang Chuzhi's contributions to the Tang Dynasty and Later Liang Dynasty, along with the cultural importance of those periods in shaping China, makes his tomb a site of cultural significance. In addition to its historical connection, the tomb also potentially holds artistic, architectural, and archaeological importance. The Tang Dynasty was famous for its advancements in pottery, painting, and sculpture, and the tomb is likely to have artifacts and structural elements that reflect the aesthetics and craftsmanship of the era. Furthermore, due to the cultural, historical, and artistic value of the tomb, it could serve as an educational resource for researchers, historians, and archaeologists interested in studying and understanding Chinese history during the Tang Dynasty and the Five Dynasties period. In conclusion, the Tomb of Wang Chuzhi indeed carries cultural significance because of its close connection to the influential figure of Wang Chuzhi, the rich historical context of the Tang Dynasty and the Later Liang Dynasty, and the potential artistic and architectural insights it offers into that era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: STOCKHOLM — It was supposed to be an adventurous motorcycle journey through Africa. Johan Gustafsson, then a 36-year-old engineer, set off with a friend to see the continent, “not just read about it in books,” he later said. His biggest concern was traffic accidents.      Twenty-four hours after he arrived in Timbuktu, Mali, Mr. Gustafsson was taken hostage from his hotel at gunpoint. He and two other tourists were herded into the back of a pickup truck. A fourth man, a German tourist, resisted and was shot dead on the spot.      That was Nov. 25, 2011, the beginning of an almost six-year ordeal for Mr. Gustafsson, who was held for ransom in the Sahara by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, the North African branch of Al Qaeda, until he was freed this year.      On June 26, Mr. Gustafsson, now 42, returned to Sweden, the second of the “Timbuktu Three” to be freed. French Special Forces rescued one hostage, Sjaak Rijke, a Dutch citizen, in April 2015. The other, Stephen McGown, a South African, was released in August. ||||| Stephen McGown's father Malcolm said he had spoken twice to Johan Gustafsson, who was detained alongside Stephen, since his release earlier this week.      “He said they were both well, he says Stephen is well. So there has not been any sort of abuse or anything like that,” McGown told AFP.      “We just sort of hope that Stephen will come out soon. At this stage he is now on his own,” he said in a phone interview from his Johannesburg home.      He added that Gustafsson reported that the two men were together until he was taken to be released.      READ ALSO: Swedish al-Qaeda hostage home and reunited with family            Johan Gustafsson reunited with family. Photo: Marcus Ericsson/TT      Gustafsson and McGown were abducted in Timbuktu in northern Mali in November 2011 along with Dutchman Sjaak Rijke by a group of armed men while on the terrace of their hotel.      Rijke was freed in April 2015 by French special forces.      Stephen's father, who lost his wife to a chronic illness a month ago, said he remained optimistic that his son would soon return home.      “He is gonna come out. I'm sure he will be out in 2017, hopefully it will be in July, August or whatever.”      He said that Gustafsson was “very positive” about McGown's situation, adding that “it's a pity they both didn't come out at the same time”.      Swedish authorities have not released details of how Gustafsson was released.            Screenshot of a video of Stephen McGown released in 2015. Photo: YouTube      South African officials have told the McGown family that they are working hard to secure Stephen's freedom. A South African charity, Gift of the Givers, has also been involved in efforts to secure his release.      McGown said “that I don't know, and I don't want to know” if there has been a ransom demand from the kidnappers.      “Just bring me my son and put him next to me and I don't want to know how,” he said.      Al-Qaeda's North African affiliate al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has claimed responsibility for the kidnappings.      It was one of several jihadist groups that took control of Mali's north in 2012 before being ousted by a French-led military operation launched in January 2013. |||||","output":"Johan Gustafsson, a Swedish engineer, went on a motorcycle journey in Africa with his friend to see the continent.

An eagle ray weighing as much as 300 pounds landed on top of a woman on a boat in the Florida Keys last week, throwing her to the deck and pinning her underneath it -- the \\"scariest thing\\" that's ever happened to her, she said. The woman, Jenny Hausch, was on the chartered boat Friday with her husband and three children, taking pictures of a group of eagle rays as they flew out of the water. \\"These eagle rays, they were flying through the air,\\" said Kelly Klein of Two Chicks Charters, the captain of the boat. \\"These giant things go out of the water and slam back down.\\" Hausch said she was in the front of the boat, snapping away. \\"The first picture I took of the ray jumping was 50 feet in front of us,\\" she said. When the ray jumped again, Hausch said she was readying her camera. \\"Next thing I know, it hit me square in the chest. I fell backwards and fell down,\\" she said. Klein said the ray kept \\"slamming and slamming on top of (Hausch), trying to swim away.\\" Hausch said the incident happened so fast that she didn't have time to react. \\"I was just trying to push it off me as I was scooting backwards,\\" she said. Hausch's husband and children watched in horror. Florida Fish and Wildlife Officers Aja Vickers and Bret Swensson were patrolling the water near the tour boat when they heard screams. \\"We turned around and looked and saw the eagle ray thrashing around in the boat and at that point we realized we had a problem,\\" said Vickers. As the officers made their way to the boat, Vickers said, \\"shoes were getting thrown off the boat, towels were going everywhere.\\" By the time officers made it to the boat Hausch had freed herself from under the ray. Klein said the animal measured 8-feet across, and probably weighed a good 300 pounds. \\"It's just massive, it has a 10-foot tail,\\" she added. Klein said everyone thought that Hausch was dead, but when she was freed she didn't have a scratch on her. Hausch said it was the scariest thing that's ever happened to her, and she's thankful she didn't get hurt. Hausch's children were hysterical, but she and her husband decided to continue the charter in hopes that the incident wouldn't make them afraid of the water. Eagle rays can measure as much as 10 feet across and 17 feet long -- from their snout to the end of their barbed tails -- and weigh up to 500 pounds, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. The spines on the tails are venomous and can inflict serious wounds. In 2008, a woman died from the impact when a ray jumped out of the water and hit her as she boated in the Keys, but Vickers said both incidents were freak accidents. \\"This is a total one-in-a-million chance,\\" she said. \\"These animals aren't attacking by any means.

It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals, and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe. Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England. Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","output":"The answer to your question lies in the time period you mentioned. Gothic style, characterized by the use of rib vaults, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large stained glass windows, ceased to be utilized predominantly around the 16th century. It's worth mentioning that architectural styles often change due to shifting aesthetic taste and cultural preferences, advances in construction technology, and societal changes. Around the 16th century, the Renaissance started to gain influence in Europe. This period saw a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman culture, including architecture, which resulted in a shift away from the Gothic style. The Renaissance style favored symmetry, proportion, and geometry, which were in stark contrast with the vertical emphasis and ornate detailing of the Gothic. Therefore, the rise of the Renaissance can be seen as the key reason why the Gothic style stopped being used extensively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Who killed Crowe? Title: The Sixth Sense Movie plot: Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philadelphia, returns home one night with his wife, Anna, after having been honored for his work. Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to do it.

The New York Times Hillary Rodham Clinton has seized on remarks Senator Bernie Sanders made in the first Democratic debate that “all the shouting in the world” would not keep guns out of the wrong hands, suggesting that Mr. Sanders used those words because of Mrs. Clinton’s gender. “I haven’t been shouting, but sometimes when a woman speaks out, some people think it’s shouting,” she said at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday. But Mr. Sanders’s past comments about gun control suggest that his “shouting” line is just that – a favored turn of phrase that he has used regularly in the past few months, long before Mrs. Clinton released her plan to address gun violence. In July, Mr. Sanders, senator of Vermont, said that people needed to “stop shouting at each other” on the issue of guns. In August, he said that “people shouting at each other” about gun control “is not doing anybody any good.” And on Oct. 1, reacting to the mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, he said that the nation needed to “get beyond the shouting” on the issue. Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, announced her proposals to curb gun violence on Oct. 5, and in recent weeks she has been particularly vocal on the issue of gun control, a subject on which Mr. Sanders has a mixed record. In an interview Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” – which played a clip of Mrs. Clinton making a similar comment on Friday about Mr. Sanders’s word choice – the senator defended himself. “All that I can say is I am very proud of my record on women’s issues,” Mr. Sanders said. “I certainly do not have a problem with women speaking out, and I think what the secretary is doing there is taking words and misapplying them.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Hillary Clinton's suggestion that Bernie Sanders' comment saying that \\"all the shouting in the world\\" would not keep guns out of the wrong hands was due to her gender. She highlighted her perception that when a woman speaks out, some people think it's shouting. However, the article provides evidence that Sanders has used the \\"shouting\\" phrase in the past few months to describe the divisive and unproductive nature of the gun control debate, long before Clinton released her plan to address gun violence. Sanders defended himself in a CNN interview, stating that he supports women speaking out and that Clinton was misapplying his words."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Dean is a 22 year old waiter at \\"Shenaniganz,\\" a restaurant with a colorful crew and an irreverent disdain for the customer. He is stuck in the point of his life which makes him crave more than a crappy job at a restaurant and a couple classes per semester. When he is offered the job of assistant manager, he is forced to consider the potential benefits/disadvantages of accepting, beating himself up over the fact that his high school classmate recently graduated as an electrical engineer -- a fact his mother reminded him of at their lunch meeting at the start of the movie.Along with his roommate, Dean lives in a house that is the constant host of parties for everyone working at the restaurant, which only makes him wonder even more about his place in life.Dean's roommate Monty is an individual extremely concerned with his getting of the poontang, and throughout the course of the movie his comments are lewd, in-your-face reminders of his sexual perversion and infinite coolness. Monty's current objective is the underage hostess at the restaurant, Natasha, who provokes incessantly an occurrence of statuatory rape between the two [however, when the chance does finally arrive for Monty, he wusses out because she is too young].The movie takes place during Mitch's first day and the nature of things in the restaurant is displayed as Monty tours him around, yet never lets him speak.

Product review: I saw the trailer for this film on HD NET and it looked promising. I was happy to hear that I was going to get a free sneak peak showing opening night in my home on HD NET! The movie is about a group of campers who go to Ireland to do \\"shrooms\\" or \\"magic mushrooms\\"(what they were called in my day)in the woods. Having dabbled in many things in my youth, I know this is a bad, BAD idea! The films starts off like so many other horror movies going to unfamiliar surroundings to party and have sex, then tell a scary story to freak everyone out before going to bed. Lots of cliché's fill this watch-able but, ultimately forgettable horror film. I did like the ending a little, as it seemed to make this all seem possible. If you see it coming on cable you might want to give it a look but, it's nothing special just a time waster. The answer is:","output":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of you buying the product. The reviewer provides several reasons for their overall negative impression of the film: 1. The movie starts off like many other horror films, with a group of campers in an unfamiliar environment, engaging in common cliché activities such as partying and telling scary stories. 2. The film is filled with clichés, which can make it feel unoriginal and predictable. 3. The reviewer describes the movie as \\"watchable but, ultimately forgettable.\\" This suggests that while it is not unbearable to watch, it doesn't leave a lasting impression or have much value. 4. The reviewer also refers to the movie as a \\"time waster.\\" This implies that there isn't much to gain from watching the film and it is essentially using up time that could be spent on other, more valuable activities. Despite the reviewer mentioning that they liked the ending \\"a little,\\" they don't provide enough positive feedback to outweigh the negatives listed above.

By Rebecca Evans and Arthur Martin UPDATED: 05:54 EST, 20 January 2012 Italian police are seeking a ballerina they believe may shed light on the Costa Concordia disaster. Domnica Cemortan was seen cavorting with Captain Francesco Schettino in the minutes before his cruise liner foundered on rocks. Italian authorities believe 52-year-old Schettino – dubbed Captain Coward – may have been distracted from his command by trying to impress the dancer.

Domnica Cemortan is now pursued by the police for further questioning in an effort to unravel the sequence of events that led to the tragic accident. According to eyewitness accounts, Cemortan was not only seen in the company of Captain Schettino but also on the ship's bridge during the critical moments leading up to the disaster. This has raised questions about her role and possible influence on the captain's actions. Italian investigators are keen to determine if her presence on the bridge may have contributed to the catastrophe, which claimed the lives of at least 32 people. Meanwhile, survivors of the Costa Concordia disaster continue to recount harrowing tales of their ordeal. Many describe a chaotic scene, with inadequate communication and a lack of proper emergency procedures. Some passengers even claimed they were forced to swim ashore after lifeboats failed to arrive. Captain Schettino has been widely vilified for his alleged role in the disaster and is currently under house arrest, facing charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, and abandoning ship. The beleaguered captain has denied all charges, insisting that he navigated the vessel too close to shore in an attempt at \\"saluting\\" the island of Giglio, but that the ship hit an uncharted reef that was not displayed on his navigational charts. As the investigation continues, the role Cemortan may have played in the tragedy remains uncertain. However, what is clear is the necessity for a thorough understanding of the events leading up to the disaster in order to prevent similar occurrences in the future and bring those responsible to justice."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, that contradict each other.

Crane - This is the subject of the sentence. It is doing the action and is therefore crucial to the meaning of the sentence. Without the crane, the crate cannot be lifted. 2. Lifts - This is the verb in the sentence, indicating the action that is taking place. It is important because it describes what is happening to the crate. 3. Crate - This is the direct object of the verb 'lifts'. The action is being done to it, and therefore it is very significant to the sentence.  4. Stamped – This is another verb in the sentence, and signifies an important action that has been done to the crate. It gives us detail about the condition and identification of the crate. 5. Karaboudjan - This word seems to be a proper noun, and is likely of critical importance in the sentence. It appears to be the name marked on the crate, which also corresponds with the name of the cargo ship, creating a clear connection in the sentence. 6. Cargo ship- This is another crucial subject of the sentence. It adds a location for the action and gives context. The entire action involves placing the crate onto the cargo ship, making the ship just as critical as the crane and the crate. 7. Same name- This phrase suggests an important connection between the crate and the cargo ship. The fact that the name \\"Karaboudjan\\" is used for both suggests that they belong to the same company or person, or are involved in the same operation. This phrase is critical for understanding the broader context of the sentence. Each of these words contributes a crucial piece of information to the meaning of the sentence, making them the most significant.

Lance was the one that kinda stepped in and said , \\" Look , if I catch you doing this again I ' m going to talk to your Mom about getting help . \\" What was the main character doing that was dangerous ?","output":"The main character was engaging in a dangerous and self-destructive behavior. They would take a canvas bag, break a glass inside it, and carry the pieces around with them with the intention of using the glass to hurt themselves when they felt the need. This behavior, which persisted for about two years between the ages of 18 and 20, indicates that the main character was likely dealing with significant emotional and mental distress during this period of their life. Carrying around broken glass as a means of self-harm poses several risks both for the main character and for others around them. The sharp shards of glass could easily cause deep lacerations, leading to substantial blood loss, infection, or even accidental damage to vital organs, nerves, or tendons. Moreover, the act of intentionally hurting oneself is a clear sign of psychological distress and a potential indicator of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, or borderline personality disorder. The situation took a turn for the better when a friend named Lance intervened, expressing concern for the main character's well-being and promising to seek help for them from a trusted family member if the self-destructive behavior continued. This intervention might have been the turning point in the main character's life, as it introduced the possibility of finding healthier coping mechanisms, addressing underlying emotional or mental health issues, and receiving necessary support from friends, family, and potentially professional counselors or therapists. In conclusion, the main character was engaged in a dangerous and harmful behavior of carrying broken glass with the intent of using it to self-harm. This practice posed significant physical and psychological risks and could have resulted in severe injuries or even death. Fortunately, the intervention of a caring friend opened the door for the main character to potentially receive the help and support needed to overcome their struggles and chart a healthier path in life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance!

The morning settled my nerves a bit more and before long the train pulled into the station. Boston had a slower feel, much slower than New York. The air was cool and peppered with moisture. I knew I was close to the ocean. Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city. My eyes darted from color to color, sign to sign, connection to connection. I floated like a ghost and thought about crying. There were few people out so I found a relative ease in that but my mind still jumped around reckless. I needed to find Kim. I saw a silent pay phone with a dangling phonebook and headed towards it until I remembered that phone books don't normally list cell phones. Kim wasn't the type of girl to list herself in the phonebook either. I had no leads but I knew I could go to a library and maybe find out her number if she had listed it on Facebook, so I kept walking.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.  Question: \\"How much did Newman earn in 210 between his salary and bonus (rounded to nearest hundred thousand)?\\" Response: \\"1.500.000\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct. If we add Steven L. Newman's new salary of 1.1 million to his bonus of 374,062, we get a total of about 1.5 million, which is close to the response given if rounded to the nearest hundred thousand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Allies restored the Bourbon Dynasty to the French throne. The ensuing period is called the Restoration, following French usage, and is characterized by a sharp conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Church as a power in French politics. The July Monarchy was a period of liberal constitutional monarchy in France under King Louis-Philippe starting with the July Revolution (or Three Glorious Days) of 1830 and ending with the Revolution of 1848. The Second Empire was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second Republic and the Third Republic, in France. What is the second empires?","output":"The Second Empire refers to the period of the Imperial Bonapartist regime under Napoleon III in France, which lasted from 1852 to 1870. This period occurred between the Second Republic and the Third Republic and is characterized by the reestablishment of the French Empire under the rule of Napoleon III, who was the nephew of Napoleon I. During the Second Empire, France underwent significant political, economic, and social changes. Napoleon III centralized power and implemented various economic modernization projects, including the development of the French railway system and the modernization of Paris through urban planning initiatives. These efforts sought to create a more efficient and interconnected society and to enhance the image and influence of France on the international stage. In foreign policy, the Second Empire pursued an ambitious agenda, engaging in various conflicts such as the Crimean War, the Franco-Prussian War, and the expansion of colonial territories in Africa and Asia. Although these endeavors were met with initial success, the ultimate defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 led to the collapse of the Second Empire and the establishment of the Third Republic in France. Throughout the Second Empire, the reign of Napoleon III was marked by both progress and controversy. While it saw advancements in infrastructure and the economy, it was also characterized by authoritarian rule, suppression of political dissent, and erosion of civil liberties. These factors contributed to the decline of the regime and the eventual end of the Second Empire in 1870."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The premise says that if the Postal Service, our toy train, runs perfectly with no problems (0 percent inefficiencies) and its current wage (the money given to the toy train's workers) is higher than others, then the measure of scale economies (how much the toy train can save) would be equal to 6.  Now, the hypothesis is very similar to the premise. It's just another way of saying the same thing: If the USPS (our toy train) is running perfectly with no problems (0% inefficiencies), then the economic scale (how much it can save) on their premium (extra money for their workers) is 6.

CHENGDU, China (CNN) -- Rainy weather and poor logistics thwarted efforts by relief troops who walked for hours over rock, debris and mud on Tuesday in hopes of reaching the worst-hit area of an earthquake that killed nearly 10,000 in central China, state-run media reported. Setting out from Maerkang in Sichuan Province at 8 p.m. Monday, the 100 or so troops had to travel 200 kilometers (124 miles) to go before reaching Wenchuan, the epicenter of the quake, also in the province, Xinhua reported. After seven hours, they still had 70 kilometers (43 miles) to go. \\"I have seen many collapsed civilian houses, and the rocks dropped from mountains on the roadside are everywhere,\\" the head of the unit, Li Zaiyuan, told Xinhua. Local radio quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in OPTIONS: - CHENGDU collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. - CNN collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. - China collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. - Li Zaiyuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. - Maerkang collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. - Sichuan Province collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. - Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. - Xinhua collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged.","output":"- CHENGDU collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged.

The boat's driver gives a thumbs up, as a woman is watching the scene. (A) Waterski very fast, then he catches a ray found inside a gas tank, then he water skis underwater. Evaluation: This choice seems unlikely and complex. While water skiing at high speeds is feasible, finding a ray inside a gas tank, is unusual and would be not related to the water skiing incident. Also, water skiing underwater is not physically possible because water skiing relies on the tension between the skier, the water's surface, and the pulling boat, which can't be maintained underwater.  (B) Holds a sandwich with his right hand and the rope with the left hand. Evaluation: This choice is feasible. While keeping balance with a sandwich in hand could be challenging, it's within the realm of possibility, considering the man could be a skilled water skier. (C) Water ski on the river and uses a rope on his leg, then the boat performs a backflip before he lands. Evaluation: While it is possible for the man to water ski using a rope tied to his leg, it's not physically possible for a boat to perform a backflip on the water's surface, especially while pulling a skier. (D) Water ski towing a boat in a waterfall. Evaluation: This choice is not plausible. Generally, water skiing is performed on relatively calm and flat water bodies. Skiing near a waterfall, let alone towing a boat, would present extreme physical risk due to the rapid water flow and sheer drop-off of a waterfall. After evaluating each answer, it seems that choice (B) in which the man holds a sandwich with his right hand and the rope with his left hand, is the most reasonable and probable scenario following the given sequence of events.

Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers \\"write once, run anywhere\\" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.  The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets). 1. what is java 2. what is its slogan 3. does that have an abbreviation 4. what are they typically compiled to 5. what does JVM stand for 6.

Please answer the following question: What does the man who tends the hunting lodge threaten to tell the Chicago businessman about?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Rosa Moline is the dissatisfied, restless wife of Lewis, a small-town Wisconsin doctor. She is easily bored, uninterested in her husband's career or in anything to do with her current circumstances. She has long desired a glamorous life, in a world where she can have expensive things and meet truly interesting people. For over a year, she has been having an affair with Neil Latimer, a Chicago businessman who owns the local hunting lodge. Tired of waiting for him to ask her to marry and move to Chicago, Rosa extorts money from Lewis' patients - who often do not have cash but pay him in produce or in other non-financial ways - to finance her trip to the city. Lewis does not yet know about the affair, but he is used to his wife's unease with her life; he discovers the extortion and throws the cash at her, telling her that if she goes to Chicago, she need not come back. Rosa immediately leaves and fully expects Latimer to welcome her. However, he avoids her at first, then when he does meet her, he tells her he is love with another woman and intends to marry. Devastated, Rosa returns to Wisconsin, where Lewis forgives her. She soon becomes pregnant and, briefly, seems to be trying to settle down. During a party for Moose, the man who tends to the hunting lodge, Latimer shows up. He lets Rosa know that he has changed his mind and wants to marry her. Moose overhears the couple planning for her divorce and their marriage; the next day, as everyone is heading out on a hunting trip, Moose bets that her lover will not want the baby and advises Rosa that she had better tell Latimer about it, or he will.

Education: After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe. The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research.

By Gavin Allen Last updated at 10:44 PM on 28th January 2012 The growing power of a rebel army has seen control of the Syrian capital of Damascus split between rival gunmen fighting for or against President Bashar Assad. Two days of bloody carnage in which at least 74 people have died has come as the rebel force - the Syrian Free Army - steps up its mission to take control of the streets from government forces. 'We had a big battle here earlier this month,' a Damascus schoolteacher, who did not want to be identified for fear of reprisals, told The Times. The head of Arab League observers in","output":"Syria, General Mohammed Ahmed Mustafa al-Dabi, reported that the situation was deteriorating rapidly, with violence escalating in the capital and elsewhere. The international community condemned the bloodshed, urging for immediate intervention to put an end to the escalating crisis. As the clashes continued, the Syrian Free Army gained significant ground, with many defectors from the government forces joining the rebel ranks. The fighting intensified and the civilian death toll rose, causing a massive humanitarian crisis. The United Nations stepped in, imposing sanctions on the Assad regime and calling for a political solution to the conflict. Despite the international pressure, President Bashar Assad refused to step down, resulting in a protracted civil war. Efforts by the UN to broker a peace deal proved unsuccessful, as neither side was willing to compromise. The situation grew dire, displacing millions of Syrian citizens and creating a refugee crisis, spilling over Syria's borders into neighboring countries. The rebels, with the support of the international community, gradually chipped away at the government's control. Sustained strategic airstrikes by a coalition of foreign powers weakened the regime's military power, focusing on key supply lines and military installations. This allowed the rebels to capture many strategic locations and, eventually, surround the capital. Recognizing the imminent defeat, several high-ranking officials from Assad's government defected in the hopes of negotiating a favorable outcome for themselves. As the rebel forces closed in on the presidential palace, Assad was left with few choices. Cornered, he finally agreed to enter negotiations for a transfer of power. A transitional government was established, incorporating representatives from the various factions in the conflict. Assad was granted safe passage to a third country in exchange for his resignation and a promise to stand trial for human rights abuses and war crimes in an international court. Though initially tense, the transitional government began the painstaking process of rebuilding the war-torn nation. Elections were held, and a new, more inclusive government took power, vowing to address the long-standing grievances of the Syrian people. The ending was bittersweet: a semblance of peace and democracy was achieved after years of violence and suffering, and while there was optimism about the future, the wounds inflicted upon the nation would take a long time to heal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"Fitz Park itself is a fine example of the philanthropic attitude of the Victorians, who created green spaces in almost every town for the people to enjoy.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Victorians were the first people who understood the necessity of green space.\\" is true (see options)? OPT: I. yes. II. it is not possible to tell. III. no.","output":"Option II: It is not possible to tell. While Fitz Park is a fine example of the philanthropic attitude of the Victorians towards creating green spaces in towns for people to enjoy, we cannot conclusively deduce that Victorians were the first people who understood the necessity of green space from this premise alone.  It is true that the Victorian era (spanning from 1837 to 1901) marked a significant period of industrialization, urbanization, and population growth in Britain and other parts of the world. The creation of green spaces, like Fitz Park, was an important response to these developments by the Victorians. They realized that public parks could offer much-needed fresh air, recreational spaces, and opportunities for socialization in increasingly crowded and polluted urban settings. However, there are instances of designated green spaces predating the Victorian era. For instance, in ancient Mesopotamia, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, which were constructed in the early sixth century BCE, were built to provide a green oasis in the desert landscape. Similarly, the Greeks and Romans appreciated the value of green spaces, and they incorporated gardens and landscaped areas in their cities and villas. Moreover, during the Renaissance in Europe, the creation of green spaces underwent further evolution, with cities like Florence and Rome featuring grand gardens surrounding palaces and villas. Later, during the 18th century, the English landscape garden movement emerged, which sought to provide naturalistic green spaces as picturesque settings and a counterpoint to the highly formal French-style gardens of the time. Furthermore, public parks started to develop in Europe before the Victorian era, with city leaders allocating public lands for them—such as Vauxhall Gardens in London, established in the mid-17th century, and the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris, opened to the public in 1667. In conclusion, while the Victorians were indeed significant in their appreciation of green spaces and their efforts to create public parks for urban dwellers, we cannot definitively state that they were the first people who understood the necessity of green space. Various cultures and societies throughout history have recognized the importance and benefits of green spaces in their planning and infrastructure, predating the Victorians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the normal conditions within cell. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes .  and the situation: Mike is a biochemist, working for a science lab. Today, he has two organisms to investigate, organism A and organism B. He notices that organism A has enzymes, but organism B lacks enzymes. He needs to figure out how these conditions would affect the organisms.  Answer the following question: Would organism A see speedier or slower chemical reactions than organism B? A:","output":"Organism A would see speedier chemical reactions than organism B. This is because organism A has enzymes, which are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions. Enzymes lower the activation energy required for a reaction to occur, allowing reactions to take place more quickly and efficiently within the cell. In contrast, organism B lacks enzymes, meaning that its chemical reactions will occur at a slower rate due to the absence of these catalysts.

The report, from London Councils, says 78,000 secondary and 34,000 more primary places will be needed by 2020. The government says its free schools programme will create 270,000 school places in England over five years. London Councils, which represents the 32 London boroughs, plus the City of London, fears crunch time is rapidly approaching for the capital's education budgets. There has been \\"unprecedented growth in demand\\" for school places in London, says the report. The number of school-age children (aged five to 19) increased by 112,000 in London in the five years to 2015. Local authorities have a legal responsibility to ensure there are enough school places. So far, schools and London boroughs have managed to provide these places. But London's school-age population is forecast to rise by another 12% over the next five years, nearly twice the rate for the rest of England. By 2020, there are expected to be 146,000 more five to 19-year-olds in London than there are now. This represents about a quarter of the overall increase expected in England. The authors warn that while the focus so far has been on primary schools, demand has now reached secondary schools, which are more complex, requiring specialist facilities such as art blocks and laboratories. Providing new secondary places could cost up to twice as much as primary places, says the report. The report asks the government to fully fund the continued expansion of schools in London by allocating at least £1.5bn to create new school places in the two years from 2018 to 2020. So far, says the report, councils in London have had to borrow, sell assets and divert funds from school maintenance to provide extra places. They warn this is not sustainable as the places crunch continues. \\"At a time when budgets are under pressure across the board, boroughs cannot continue to subsidise the cost of school places in London,\\" said Peter John, London Councils' executive member for children, skills and employment. \\"Time is running out for the government to fully support councils' efforts to provide primary and secondary school places in the capital over the next five years. \\"Councils in London have worked exceptionally hard with school heads and governors since 2010. But without sufficient resources it will be extremely difficult to manage complex primary expansions and meet the rising demand for secondary school places in the future,\\" warned Mr John. The report says the government's commitment to new free schools will help meet some of the need for places but urges the Department for Education \\"to ensure all new free schools are prioritised in areas of need\\". The government said it had doubled funding for school places to £5bn during the last parliament, creating half a million new school places since May 2010, with a further £7bn committed to create more places over the next six years. A DfE spokeswoman said: \\"London has benefited significantly from this investment, receiving almost £2bn in the last four years, almost 40% of all the funding provided to local councils for new places. \\"In London alone, free schools have already created almost 50,000 school places. \\"Today, we have approved a further two new London free schools and 18 more are opening in the capital this term, creating an extra 9,000 school places, giving parents more choice than ever before.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"Alright kiddo, the problem is, there are too many children in London, and not enough desks and classrooms for them to study. The 'big people' who help run the city said that there needs to be more money put aside to help build new schools. They reckon, by 2020, 78,000 more desks in the bigger-kid schools and another 34,000 in the smaller-kid schools are needed!  Another group of grownups say that their special program will help make space for 270,000 more kids in schools all over England in five years. But the London folks are worried they might run out of money for these places soon!  This is because in the past 5 years, there were 112,000 more kids aged between five and nineteen in London alone. And over the next 5 years, they think there will be even more kids - about 12% more.  Another problem is that bigger-kid schools need special stuff like art and science rooms, which cost more to build. The London people are asking for at least £1.5 billion from the government to help build more schools between the years 2018 and 2020. Finally, there's another type of school called 'free schools' and they're saying more of these should be made especially in areas that are extra crowded. The government agrees and says they've already put lots of money, almost £2 billion, into building new places in London and plan to put in another £7 billion over the next six years to create even more school places for kids all over England."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Born in Gibraltar, which designer was named British Designer of the Year in 1987, 1994 and 1995?","output":"The renowned designer who was born in Gibraltar and was named British Designer of the Year in 1987, 1994, and 1995 is John Charles Galliano. An influential fashion designer and creative genius, John Galliano is celebrated for his unique and inventive approach to design. He has made substantial contributions to the world of fashion throughout his career, making him one of the most prominent and iconic designers of his generation. John Galliano was born on November 28th, 1960, in Gibraltar. He moved to England as a young child and grew up in South London. He later graduated from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in 1984, where he studied fashion design. Galliano was originally inspired by historical clothing, and his fascination with the past was a driving force behind his designs. He quickly gained recognition for his talent and visionary approach in the fashion world. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, John Galliano's designs heavily influenced the \\"New Romantic\\" movement in fashion – a period characterized by unconventional combinations of different styles, historical references, and theatrical elements. His innovative and eclectic creations pushed the boundaries of conventional fashion, with complex patterns, intricate embroidery, and exquisite tailoring. Apart from being named the British Designer of the Year in 1987, 1994, and 1995, John Galliano has also received several other prestigious accolades in the fashion industry. In 1997, he became the creative director of the French fashion house Givenchy, making him the first British designer to helm a major French couture house.

Q:Question: \\"Which dynasty, which was replaced by another dynasty that included Henry IV, struggled to control the powerful dukes?\\"  Context: \\"During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The Ottonian dynasty, which ruled Germany during the early High Middle Ages, struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. They were replaced by the Salian dynasty, which included Henry IV. The Ottonians faced difficulties in asserting their authority over the independent-minded dukes, who held significant power within their respective territories.

While assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd systematically kill several diamond smugglers, M suspects that South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping, and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Disguised as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to make it seem like Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to Los Angeles, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse. At the airport Bond meets his CIA ally Felix Leiter, then travels to Las Vegas. At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the diamonds are passed on to another smuggler, Shady Tree. Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him into a coffin and send to a cremation oven, but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks' body were fakes planted by Bond and the CIA.

Here is a news article: Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story      For people throughout the Eastern United States who spent January slipping, sliding and shivering, here is a counterintuitive fact: For the earth as a whole, it was the fourth-warmest January on record.                              It was, in fact, the 347th consecutive month with temperatures above the 20th-century average, the government reported Thursday.      That may feel plausible to Californians, whose state experienced temperatures 10 or 15 degrees above normal in some places last month, and especially to Alaskans, where the average temperature was almost 15 degrees above normal.      But on a map of January temperatures released Thursday by government weather analysts, the Eastern United States stood out as one of the coldest areas on the planet, compared with seasonal norms.      That is no surprise to anybody living east of the Mississippi River, of course — certainly not to the Atlantans who were caught up in two memorable ice storms that shut down the city, or the New Yorkers who are still picking their way through mounds of dirty snow.      Photo      But this might be another surprise: Despite all the weather drama, it was not a January for the record books.      By the time analysts averaged the heat in the West and the cold in the East, the national temperature for the month fell only one-tenth of a degree below the 20th-century average for January. January 2011 was colder.      No state set a monthly record for January cold. Alabama, also walloped by the ice storms, came closest, with the fourth-coldest January on its record books.      The United States covers only 2 percent of the surface of the globe, so what happens in this country does not have much influence on overall global temperatures.      Brazil, much of southern Africa, most of Europe, large parts of China and most of Australia were unseasonably warm in January, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Thursday. That continues a pattern of unusual global warming that is believed to be a consequence of human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases.      Even in the United States, more than a third of the country is in drought of varying intensity. Mountain snowpack in many parts of the West is only half of normal, portending a parched summer and a likelihood of severe wildfires.      “Today’s snowpack is tomorrow’s water in the West,” said Deke Arndt, chief of climate monitoring for the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., in a briefing on Thursday. “If it does not recover, this will have consequences for months down the road.”      The Arctic blasts of this winter do stand out in the weather records of this young century, even if they are pretty humdrum when compared with the 1970s and 1980s. Winters have been so mild over the past couple of decades — probably as a result of global warming, scientists say — that some young adults have never experienced cold waves quite so intense.      Photo      And the pain may not be over. Forecasters say the northern tier of the United States may face still more cold blasts, storms and heavy winds right up to the doorstep of spring, albeit interspersed with bursts of warmth in some areas.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Over just the next few days, the Southeast may be hit by severe thunderstorms, high winds and even hail. The Midwest may have wind gusts up to 60 miles an hour. And the Northeast could see rain, snow or a mix of the two.      Temperatures across the eastern Great Plains, the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley are expected to be below normal for the next month and into the spring.      But the cold weather in the East is being balanced, in a sense, by the bizarrely warm temperatures in the West. And that trend, too, is likely to continue.      The outlook over the next month is for continued above-normal temperatures in the West, the Southwest and parts of Alaska, as well as a continuation of the California drought, despite recent rains that have eased the situation slightly.      The extremes in January were directly related, experts said, with the two regions falling on opposite sides of a big loop in the jet stream, a belt of high winds in the upper atmosphere that helps to regulate the climate.      A dip of the jet stream into the Eastern United States allowed cold air to descend from the Arctic, while a corresponding ridge in the West allowed warm air to hover over California and to penetrate normally frigid regions to the north.

Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.  Which student read more about a greater frequency of collisions? Answer:","output":"Sean, who studied the influence of temperature on chemical reactions, read more about the greater frequency of collisions. Temperature plays a vital role in chemical reactions by directly affecting the rate and frequency of collisions between reacting molecules or particles. When temperature increases, the kinetic energy of particles rises, which leads to a greater number of collisions per unit time. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of successful reactions to occur. A higher frequency of collisions can be explained by understanding the role of temperature in chemical reactions. The kinetic molecular theory suggests that molecules or particles are in constant motion and possesses a specific amount of kinetic energy, which depends on their mass and velocity. As temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the particles also increases, leading to higher velocity and more frequent collisions. Besides temperature, Gabe studied other influencing factors on chemical reaction rates such as concentration, pressure, the presence of a catalyst, and surface area. While these factors can have an impact on the reaction rates and the frequency of collisions, the influence of temperature tends to have a more direct and significant effect. Concentration and pressure can affect the probability of collisions, as higher concentration or pressure means more particles are present in a given volume, thus increasing the chances of collisions. However, these factors do not directly increase the kinetic energy of particles as temperature does. Catalysts are substances that speed up chemical reactions without undergoing any permanent changes themselves. They function by providing an alternate reaction pathway with lower activation energy, which enables a larger number of particles to have enough energy to react. Although catalysts can increase the rate of reactions, they do not affect the collision frequency directly; they primarily impact the proportion of successful collisions. Surface area impacts reaction rates by altering the availability of reactive species. When a solid material has a larger surface area, more particles are exposed and available for collisions with other reactants. However, this factor only concerns reactions involving solids and does not directly affect the kinetic energy of the particles. In summary, both Sean and Gabe studied factors that can influence chemical reaction rates. However, Sean, who focused on the influence of temperature, read more about a greater frequency of collisions, as temperature directly affects the kinetic energy and velocity of particles, resulting in more frequent collisions and a higher reaction rate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: One reaction to all the concern about tropical deforestation  is a blank stare that asks the question, \\"Since I don't live there, what does it have to do with me?\\" The answer is that your way of life, wherever you live in the world, is tied to the tropics in many ways. If you live in a house, wash your hair, eat fruits and vegetables, drink soda, or drive a car, you can be certain that you are affected by the loss of tropical forests. Biologically, we are losing the richest regions on earth when, each minute, a piece of tropical forest, the size of ten city blocks, disappears. As many as five million species of plants, animals, and insects (40 to 50 percent of all living things) live there, and are being lost faster than they can be found and described. Their loss is immeasurable. Take rubber for example. For many uses, only natural rubber from trees will do. _ are not good enough. Today over half the world's commercial rubber is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, while the Amazon's rubber industry produces much of the world's four million tons. And rubber is an important material in making gloves, balloons, footwear and many sporting goods. Thousands of other tropical plants are valuable for their industrial use. Many scientists strongly believe that deforestation contributes to the greenhouse effect -- or heating of the earth from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As we destroy forests, we lose their ability to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. Carbon dioxide levels could double within the next half-century, warming the earth by as much as 4.5 degrees. The result? A partial melt-down of polar ice caps, raising sea levels as much as 24 feet; even 15 feet could threaten anyone living within 35 miles of the coast. Unbelievable? Maybe. But scientists warn that by the time we realise the severe effects of tropical deforestation, it will be 20 years too late. Can tropical deforestation affect our everyday lives? Now, you should have got the answer. Question: According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true? - The forests are losing their function in turning carbon dioxide into oxygen. - Many of our daily uses are related to the tropical forests. - Tropical plants can be used to make industrial products. - High carbon dioxide levels will make the earth warmer.

The given process explains the process of iron rusting when exposed to oxygen and air. It is a chemical reaction that occurs specifically with iron and oxygen, leading to oxidation and rust formation. Now, coming to the event mentioned in the question: \\"suppose the egg was expelled during menstruation.\\" Menstruation is a biological process that occurs in the female reproductive system, and it involves the shedding of the egg and the uterine lining. It has no direct connection to iron exposure or oxidation. So, when comparing the menstruation event to the iron rusting process, it can be concluded that the expulsion of the egg during menstruation has no effect (C) on the process of iron being exposed to oxygen and undergoing chemical reactions.

It has an area of and about four million inhabitants. Its state capital is Mainz. Rhineland-Palatinate is located in western Germany and borders Belgium, Luxembourg and France, and the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, Baden-Württemberg and Saarland.  - Konrad Hermann Joseph Adenauer (5 January 1876  19 April 1967) was a German statesman who served as the first post-war Chancellor of Germany (West Germany) from 1949 to 1963. He led his country from the ruins of World War II to a productive and prosperous nation that forged close relations with France, the United Kingdom and the United States. During his years in power West Germany achieved democracy, stability, international respect and economic prosperity (\\"\\"Wirtschaftswunder\\"\\", German for \\"economic miracle\\"). He was the first leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a Christian Democratic party that under his leadership became, and has since usually been the most influential party in the country.  - The Social Market Economy (SOME) (also called Rhine capitalism) is a socioeconomic model combining a free market capitalist economic system alongside social policies which establish both fair competition within the market and a welfare state. It is sometimes classified as a coordinated market economy.

Its origins can be traced to the interwar Freiburg school of economic thought.  - A minister-president or minister president is the head of government in any of a number of European countries or subnational governments, in which a parliamentary or semi-presidential system of government prevails, who presides over the council of ministers. It is an alternative term for prime minister, premier, chief minister or first minister, and very similar to the title of President of the Council.  - A chief minister is the elected head of government of a sub-national (e.g., constituent federal) entity. Examples include: Provinces Governor of Federal states in Nepal; a state (and sometimes a union territory) in India; a territory of Australia; provinces of Sri Lanka or Pakistan; Philippine autonomous regions; or a British Overseas Territory that has attained self-governance.

Before he became Chancellor he served as Minister President of Baden-Württemberg from 1958 to 1966 and as President of the Federal Council from 1962 to 1963. He was Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union from 1967 to 1971.  - Helmut Josef Michael Kohl (born 3 April 1930) is a German statesman, who served as Chancellor of Germany from 1982 to 1998 (of West Germany 198290 and of the reunited Germany 199098) and as the chairman of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 1973 to 1998. From 1969 to 1976, Kohl was the 3rd Minister President of Rhineland-Palatinate.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - A presidential system is a system of government where a head of government is also head of state and leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch. The United States, for instance, has a presidential system. The executive is elected and often titled \\"president\\" and is not responsible to the legislature and which cannot, in normal circumstances, dismiss it. The legislature may have the right, in extreme cases, to dismiss the executive, often through impeachment. However, such dismissals are seen as so rare as not to contradict a central tenet of presidentialism, that in \\"normal circumstances using normal means\\" the legislature cannot dismiss the executive.  - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic.  - Flensburg (Low Saxon: \\"Flensborg\\", North Frisian: \\"Flansborj\\", South Jutlandic: \\"Flensborre\\") is an independent town (\\"kreisfreie Stadt\\") in the north of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.

He is often famed for leading German postwar economic reforms and economic recovery (\\"\\"Wirtschaftswunder,\\"\\" German for \\"economic miracle\\") in his role as Minister of Economics under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer from 1949 to 1963. During that period he promoted the concept of the social market economy (\\"soziale Marktwirtschaft\\"), on which Germany's economic policy in the 21st century continues to be based. In his tenure as chancellor, however, Erhard failed to win confidence in his handling of a budget deficit and his direction of foreign policy, and his popularity waned. He resigned his chancellorship on 1 December 1966.

In other words, we need to explore whether the truth of the premise guarantees or necessitates the truth of the hypothesis. Analyzing both statements, we can see that the premise and hypothesis differ significantly: 1. Content of the utterance: In the premise, Red merely says \\"Hey,\\" whereas, in the hypothesis, Red says something more specific and complex: \\"Hey, where is down?\\" There is no information in the premise that would necessarily lead us to assume Red uttered the additional question about \\"down.\\" 2. Tone or manner: The premise tells us that Red \\"said\\" something, which is generally interpreted as speaking in a normal, conversational tone. However, the hypothesis involves Red \\"yelling,\\" which suggests a heightened emotional state or urgency. There is no guarantee in the premise that Red's tone would shift from a conversational level to yelling in this context. Based on these differences, we can conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. It is entirely possible for Red to say \\"Hey\\" without subsequently yelling, \\"Hey, where is down?\\" The premise only provides limited information about a single instance of communication, while the hypothesis tries to assert an additional and different situation occurred. As such, the truth of the premise neither guarantees nor necessitates the truth of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What university was founded on rented premises in 1942, and grew to meet the needs of returning World War II veterans and later became Ontario's first private, non-denominational college, Carleton University or Duke University? A:","output":"The university founded on rented premises in 1942, which grew to meet the needs of returning World War II veterans and later became Ontario's first private, non-denominational college, is Carleton University. Carleton University, located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, was founded during World War II, as the necessity for higher education was becoming increasingly apparent. Established originally as Carleton College, the institution began its journey on rented premises above a small store in downtown Ottawa. The school aimed to provide an affordable and accessible educational opportunity for individuals seeking post-secondary education. Many of these individuals were veterans returning from the war, in need of reintegration into civilian life, as well as young people whose education had been interrupted by the conflict. As the post-war boom began, so did a surge in demand for education. Carleton College experienced rapid growth, prompting the need for a larger and more permanent location. In 1952, the college moved to its current location near the Rideau River, further expanding over the years through the construction of additional facilities such as the Herzberg Laboratories, the University Centre, and the Athletics Centre. Throughout its growth, Carleton College remained an independent, secular institution committed to providing educational opportunities to a diverse population. In 1957, the college officially received its designation as a university and became Carleton University. As a non-denominational institution, Carleton was and still is unique in Ontario, as it operates outside of the framework of religious affiliation, unlike many other Canadian institutions. Over the years, Carleton University has continued to expand and develop its programs and facilities to better serve its students and the wider community. Today, Carleton offers more than 100 undergraduate and graduate programs, including those in the fields of arts and social sciences, public affairs, business, engineering and design, and science. The university is also home to several reputable research centers and institutions that contribute to advancements in knowledge and innovation. In contrast, Duke University, located in Durham, North Carolina, USA, was founded in 1838 as Brown's Schoolhouse and only much later became Duke University in 1924. Throughout its history, Duke University has maintained a connection with the Methodist and Quaker churches and, although non-sectarian, it does not meet the same non-denominational criteria as Carleton University. Additionally, Duke University's founding and growth were not directly linked to World War II and the educational needs of returning veterans. To conclude, it was Carleton University that was founded on rented premises in 1942 in response to the educational needs of World War II veterans and later became Ontario's first private, non-denominational college."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stooping down to observe the creature more meticulously, thoughts of carefree afternoons spent with a pet rushed back to him. His enthusiasm to adopt the turtle was palpable as he interlaced his little fingers around its hard shell, feeling the coarseness under his touch. He felt a connection with the animal and longed to give it a home, despite the fact that it was a wild creature. Anxiously, Timmy returned home, cradling the turtle gingerly in his small hands, its little head poking out in curiosity every once in a while. He hoped for his mother's approval to adopt the turtle with all his heart. As he approached her, he could see her immersed in her chores. Timidity bracing him, he cautiously moved closer to her, holding out the turtle as a gesture of what he had come to narrate.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation -10 * n + 94 * n + 11,988 = 22n - 160 * n for n, we first need to simplify and rearrange the equation to make it easy to work with.  Step 1: Combine like terms on each side of the equation: On the left side, we combine the terms with \\"n\\": (-10 * n + 94 * n) = 84 * n So, now the equation is: 84n + 11,988 = 22n - 160n On the right side, we again combine the terms with \\"n\\": (22 * n - 160 * n) = -138 * n Now, the equation becomes: 84n + 11,988 = -138n Step 2: Move all the \\"n\\" terms to one side of the equation and the constant terms to the other side: To do that, we will add 138n to both sides of the equation to get all the \\"n\\" terms on the left side: 84n + 138n + 11,988 = -138n + 138n Which simplifies to: 222n + 11,988 = 0 Next, we will subtract 11,988 from both sides of the equation to isolate the \\"n\\" terms: 222n + 11,988 - 11,988 = 0 - 11,988 Which simplifies to: 222n = -11,988 Step 3: Solve for n: Now, to find the value of n, we will divide both sides of the equation by 222: 222n / 222 = -11,988 / 222 n = -54 So the solution to the equation -10 * n + 94 * n + 11,988 = 22 * n - 160 * n is n = -54."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

People at an anime convention would want to make a good impression on other anime lovers. At anime conventions, attendees come together to share their mutual love and appreciation for anime, manga, and related pop culture. Dressing nicely or putting effort into their appearance - even if they are not wearing costumes - is a way for attendees to make a good impression on their fellow anime lovers. This not only shows respect for the event and the community but also reflects their enthusiasm and passion for the subjects being celebrated at the convention. Moreover, conventions are social events that provide opportunities for attendees to make new friends, network, and even find potential romantic interests with similar hobbies and tastes. Dressing nicely can help them feel more confident and approachable, making it easier for them to connect with others at the event. Furthermore, anime conventions often host artists, voice actors, and industry professionals who attendees look up to and admire. Dressing well can be a way to show respect and admiration for these guests, and may also lead to a more memorable interaction when meeting them.

(October 2014) Spider is the story of Dennis Cleg, a man who is given a room in a halfway house catering to mentally disturbed persons. Cleg has just been released from a mental institution and in his new abode starts piecing together or recreating in his memory an apparently fateful childhood event. He roams the nearby derelict urban area and the local canal and starts to relive or visualize a period of his childhood in 1950s London with his mother and his father. A shift takes place in the child's psyche when he witnesses his mother groping with his father in the garden and, subsequently, when he sees his mother in a silky night gown she wore for his father. The son, as a grown man seems to recreate in his memory the buildup to his father's murder of his mother with the passive support of a prostitute he is involved with, who then moves into the house and is presented as his mother. The young son then kills the mistress by gassing her in the kitchen, although the final shot appears to show his true mother lying dead so we are left to wonder whether she really was his mother and the prostitute was just a fantasy. After that memory he sneaks late one night to the landlady's room and appears ready to kill her, whom he sees alternatively as the mistress, his mother and the landlady, but backs away after she says, \\"What have you done Mr. Cleg?\\" He is taken back to the asylum.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who was arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, and served time in a remand centre? is inside the article: Pogoing aside, Vicious had been involved in a notorious incident during that memorable second night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, he had served time in a remand centre—and contributed to the 100 Club banning all punk bands. At a previous 100 Club gig, he had assaulted Nick Kent with a bicycle chain. Indeed, McLaren's NME telegram said that Vicious's \\"best credential was he gave Nick Kent what he deserved many months ago at the Hundred Club\\". According to a later description by McLaren, \\"When Sid joined he couldn't play guitar but his craziness fit into the structure of the band. He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist.\\" \\"Everyone agreed he had the look,\\" Lydon later recalled, but musical skill was another matter. \\"The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish.... Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot\\". Marco Pirroni, who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, \\"After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story\\".Membership in the Sex Pistols had a progressively destructive effect on Vicious. As Lydon later observed, \\"Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly he was a big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration. That's what it all meant to Sid.\\" Westwood had already been feeding him material, like a tome on Charles Manson, likely to encourage his worst instincts. Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from the other members of the band. Lydon later wrote, \\"We did everything to get rid of Nancy.... She was killing him. I was absolutely..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Sid.

Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control.

The United Nations hopes to cut this number in half by 2015. Solving such a big problem seems like an unreal challenge. But everyone, even teenagers, can do something to help. A teenage girl in the U.S. has set an example to others of her age around the world. Rene Haggerty, 13, was awarded the 2004 Gloria Barron Prize for her work of collecting deserted batteries which pollute water. In 2003, Haggerty went on a field trip to the Great Lakes Science Centre in Ohio. There, she saw an exhibit about how chemicals in old batteries harm the water of Lake Erie. Haggerty learnt that recycling the batteries was an easy solution. \\"I think everybody can do it, because everyone uses batteries, and it can make a big difference.\\" With these words, she began to increase awareness in her area. She talked to her county government and school board. She got permission to start a recycling programmed in schools as well as the public libraries, hospitals, and churches. With the help from her family, friends and local waste-management officials, she gathered containers, arranged transportation, and made an educational video. Over the past two years, she collected four tons of batteries and drew the attention of officials, who were in charge of a battery recycling programmed but had made little progress.

Found across most of the world, Argentine ants are dull brown and are all about ⅛\\" (3 mm) long, with a pointed node. They move rapidly in tight trails, prefer sugar but will eat protein and fat, and have a musty odor when crushed. Colonies are typically in damp areas outdoors, but are also found indoors. Eradication is extremely difficult due to multiple cooperating colonies and multiple queens per colony. These ants are black, dark brown, or dark red, or a combination of these. They vary in size from ¼\\" to ½\\" (6 to 12 mm), and have one erect node and no thorax spines. They move in loose trails and are often found near wood, along with a strong odor and piles of sawdust, soil, and insect parts. Look for trails across lawns where vegetation has been thinned or removed. Crazy ants are named after their rapid changes of direction, and perhaps for their odd-looking, extra-long antenna and legs. Their slender, dark grey, black, or brown bodies are 1/16 to 1/8\\" (2–3.5 mm) long, have a flat node that's difficult to see, and have no spines. In the tropics, some crazy ant species are yellowish-brown instead and can be up to 1/5\\" (5 mm) long, with a darker gaster (rear abdomen). These one-node species are common pests in some areas, but much more limited in global distribution than the species above:  Ghost ants: Very small (1/16\\" or 2 mm), with a black/brown head and pale abdomen. Flat, hidden node, no spines. Usually outdoors in tropics, or on plants from greenhouses or tropics.  Odorous house ants: 1/8\\" (3.5 mm) long, one flat, hidden node, no spines. Strong, unusual odor when crushed. Primarily found in trails looking for sugar, but this varies.  Rover ants: male workers are 1/16\\" (2 mm), small and black with unusual straight antenna. Most easily distinguished by the much larger, winged females, which are found near light or floating in standing water.  White-footed ants: These 1/8\\" (3.5 mm) ants are usually black with pale \\"feet.\\" A flat, hidden node, no thorax spines.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although   on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the  music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Morocco (', lit. \\"The West\\"; '), officially known as the Kingdom of Morocco (', lit. \\"The Western Kingdom\\"; '), is a sovereign country located in the Maghreb region of North Africa. Geographically, Morocco is characterized by a rugged mountainous interior, large tracts of desert, and a lengthy coastline along the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.  - The Saadi dynasty or Saadian dynasty (Arabic: , \\"as-saadin\\"; Berber: , \\"Isdiyen\\"; original name Bani Zaydan) was a dynasty that ruled Morocco from 1549 to 1659.  - Zidan Abu Maali (?  September 1627) was the embattled Sultan of Morocco from 1603 to 1627, ruling only over the southern half of the country after, his brother took the northern half and a Sanhaji rebel from Tafilalt (Ahmed ibn Abi Mahalli) marched on Marrakesh claiming to be the Mahdi. All of which exacerbated by, a context of chaos that ensued a plague pandemic which left a third of the country dead, the end of the Anglo-Spanish war (Treaty of London (1604)) which broke the Anglo-Dutch axis that Morocco was relying upon as a means of protection from Spain, and so caused the Spanish navy to resume devastating raids on the Moroccan coast and the rebellion of one of his provincial governors who established his own independent republic between Azemmour and Salé. He was the son and appointed hair of Ahmad al-Mansur, and resided mostly in Safi where he became encircled after being driven out of Marrakesh and failed military campaigns against the rebellious brother in the north.  - Ahmad I al-Mansur (also El-Mansour Eddahbi [the Golden], ; and Ahmed el-Mansour; 1549 in Fes  25 August 1603, outskirts of Fes) was Sultan of the Saadi dynasty from 1578 to his death in 1603, the sixth and most famous of all rulers of the Saadis. Ahmad al-Mansur was an important figure in both Europe and Africa in the sixteenth century, his powerful army and strategic location made him an important power player in the late Renaissance period.  - Abu Faris Abdallah , nicknamed al - Wathik Billah ( 1564 -- 1608 ) was a ruler of the Saadi dynasty . He was one of the three sons of Ahmad al - Mansur and reigned in different parts of the country ( 1603 -- 1608 ) , the South , Marrakesh and Fez . He especially fought his brother Zidan Abu Maali ( r. 1603 -- 1627 ) .  - Sultan (') is a noble title with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning \\"strength\\", \\"authority\\", \\"rulership\\", derived from the verbal noun ', meaning \\"authority\\" or \\"power\\". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate.

Ann Moore introduced the idea of a baby carrier to American people nearly 50 years ago. Ann spent two years in Africa in the early 1960s. She worked as a nurse there. Ann saw babies wrapped in bright cloth tied to their mothers' backs. The babies snuggled   close to their mothers, and the mothers could use their hands to do other things. In 1964, Ann had her own baby. She tried making a carrier like the one African mothers used. The carrier was like a backpack. Everywhere Ann went with her baby in the carrier, people asked, \\"Where can I buy one?\\" In 1965, Ann and her mother began to sell handmade carriers. Ann received a patent   for the baby carrier in 1969. By that time, the baby carrier had leg holes and straps   that could be made longer or shorter. It could also be worn on the back or front. By 1979, the baby carriers were made in a factory. These baby carriers cost less to make and more than 25,000 were sold every month.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the specific suite of rooms that briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King Edward VIII? from the following article ?  Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece designed by Robert Jones and sculpted by Richard Westmacott. It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion. The ornate clock, known as the Kylin Clock, was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, China, in the second half of the 18th century; it has a later movement by Benjamin Vulliamy circa 1820. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer Sir Charles Allom, created a more \\"binding\\" Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the lacquer doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running the length of the piano nobile of the east wing is the great gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor, which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle. It has mirrored doors, and mirrored cross walls reflecting porcelain pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room obviously placed in the centre.The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Sir Charles Long.

Title: You'll Like My Mother Movie plot: In this psychological thriller, a very pregnant Francesca (Patty Duke) travels from Los Angeles to Minnesota to meet her late husband's mother, Mrs. Kinsolving, whom she has never met before. Mrs. Kinsolving (Rosemary Murphy) is cold to Francesca, questions whether she is actually pregnant with her son's baby, and tells Francesca she wants nothing to do with her or her baby in the future. It soon becomes clear that Francesca cannot leave that night as a blizzard has made the roads impassable. Francesca is forced to stay in the Kinsolving mansion for a few days. She soon begins to suspect that something is amiss due to inconsistencies in information between what her late husband (Matthew) told her and Mrs. Kinsolving's statements to her. While Matthew never mentioned he had a sister, Mrs. Kinsolving claims that the mentally challenged and non-verbal Kathleen (Sian Barbara Allen) is Matthew's sister. After Mrs. Kinsolving retires for the night, Francesca sneaks around and discovers in the family Bible that Matthew's mother (Maria) died eleven days after Matthew was killed in the Vietnam War, that Mrs. Kinsolving is actually Maria's sister in law, Katherine, who is Kathleen's mother and the mother of Kenny (Richard Thomas), a serial rapist and murderer who is hiding somewhere in the Kinsolving mansion. Francesca goes into labor, but Mrs. Kinsolving refuses to call for an ambulance. She sedates Francesca heavily. When the baby is born, Mrs. Kinsolving announces it is dead and hands the baby over to Kathleen to bury. That night, Kathleen rouses Francesca and takes her to the attic where she finds Kathleen has hidden her baby (who is actually very much alive) in a picnic basket. Mrs. Kinsolving, suspecting Francesca is sneaking around the mansion, locks her in her room. Kathleen is able to locate the key to the room and unlocks it, allowing Francesca to care for her baby. One night, Francesca secretly spies the unsuspecting Kenny who is hiding in the basement laundry. She overhears his conversation with Mrs....

In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly; his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin; Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper; his boss Dennis Lapman; and co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer.

The computer specialist spoke in a \\"deliberately robotic fashion\\" on at least five calls between February and April of last year, according to the disciplinary hearing; the judge heard one recording featuring Dillon talking to a customer in a \\"slow, monotone, and over-enunciated manner.\\" At least one caller was fooled: The customer called back later, telling a Health Department worker that she \\"hung up when she heard 'the robot' answer the phone because she needed to speak to a human,\\" says the judge's decision. (She also claimed the \\"automated system\\" hung up on her, according to the New York Post.) Dillon, who has worked at the department since 1976 but was transferred to the help desk three years ago despite his objections, insisted he was simply reading from a script his boss gave him, and \\"articulat[ing] each word because he speaks fast and has a Brooklyn accent, which is sometimes difficult to understand,\\" according to the decision. \\"They objected to the tone of my voice, so I made it atonal,\\" he tells DNAinfo. But the judge found that he was a \\"disgruntled\\" employee and didn't like his new boss or new job, noting, \\"There is a difference between speaking slowly and distinctly and speaking so robotically that callers did not believe that they were speaking to a person.\\" (This guy says Comcast got him fired from his job.) Expand this summary.","output":"Ronald Dillon, a computer specialist working at the help desk of New York City's Health Department, was suspended from his job without pay for 20 days after speaking in a deliberately robotic voice during multiple customer-service calls. Dillon's robotic voice reportedly caused confusion among callers, with at least one customer hanging up and calling later to speak with a human, under the impression that they had reached an automated system. According to the disciplinary hearing, Dillon spoke in a robotic fashion on at least five calls between February and April. During the hearing, the judge listened to a recording featuring Ronald Dillon speaking with a customer in a slow, monotone, and over-enunciated manner, further proving the concerns of his employer. Dillon had been working for the Health Department since 1976 but was transferred to the help desk three years ago, despite his objections. In his defense, he stated that he was simply reading from a script provided by his boss and had to articulate each word because of his fast speech and difficult-to-understand Brooklyn accent. In his own words, Dillon said, \\"They objected to the tone of my voice, so I made it atonal.\\" However, the judge concluded that Ronald Dillon was likely a disgruntled employee who had issues with his new boss and position. The judge noted, \\"There is a difference between speaking slowly and distinctly and speaking so robotically that callers did not believe that they were speaking to a person.\\" The suspension without pay serves as a measure to ensure that such behavior does not continue, and stresses the importance of a customer's experience while interacting with the help desk. The incident highlights the need for professionals in such roles to consider how their actions and communication style may impact the caller's perception of the company, potentially affecting trust and long-term customer satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Sir Walter Winterbottom, CBE (31 March 1913 - 16 February 2002) was the first manager of the England football team (1946-1962) and FA Director of Coaching. He resigned from the FA in 1962 to become General Secretary of the Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR) and was appointed as the first Director of the Sports Council in 1965. He was knighted for his services to sport in 1978 when he retired. The Football Association marked the 100th anniversary of Winterbottom's birth by commissioning a bust which was unveiled by Roy Hodgson at St Georges Park on 23 April 2013 in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the development of English football. Context: Although Winterbottom is best known as the England team manager, it is in coaching that he made important contributions to the development of English football. He made no secret of his belief that his job as Director of Coaching was the more important of his two roles at the FA.  When he joined the FA in 1946, club directors, managers and players were cynical about the need for coaching but Winterbottom had a passion for coaching and a vision of how it should develop. He soon created a national coaching scheme with summer residential courses at Lilleshall, Shropshire, and persuaded some of his international players to take the courses that led to exams for the FA preliminary and full coaching badges. This gave the scheme credibility. They developed their teaching skills by coaching in schools and then moved into part-time coaching positions in junior clubs. He gathered around him a cadre of young FA staff coaches: men like Bill Nicholson, Don Howe, Alan Brown, Ron Greenwood, Dave Sexton, Malcolm Allison, Joe Mercer, Vic Buckingham, Jimmy Hill and Bobby Robson. Over time a new breed of managers emerged in the League clubs and began to change attitudes to coaching.  Winterbottom's courses were expanded to include professional players, referees, school masters, club trainers, schoolboys and youth leaders. In addition to Lilleshall they were held at Loughborough College, Carnegie College, Bisham Abbey and Birmingham University. In 1947 three hundred had taken the full coaching award and the numbers of qualified coaches grew each year.  The courses attracted international participation and praise. Winterbottom was regarded by many as a leading technical thinker and exponent of association football, of his generation, in the world and lectured internationally.  He inspired a new generation of managers, most notably Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson, who graduated through every level of coaching, both eventually becoming England team manager. Question: How long were they with the team?. Whats the answer?","output":"Sir Walter Winterbottom was with the England football team as its first manager from 1946 to 1962, totaling 16 years. Throughout his time with the team, he not only managed the national side but also undertook the responsibilities of Director of Coaching, focusing on the development and improvement of English football from a coaching perspective. Among those inspired by Winterbottom were Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson, both of whom eventually became England team managers themselves. Ron Greenwood managed the team from 1977 to 1982, serving for 5 years, while Bobby Robson was the manager from 1982 to 1990, holding the position for 8 years. In summary, Winterbottom was with the team for 16 years, Greenwood for 5 years, and Robson for 8 years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Dana learned more about mammalian lungs, while Barry learned more about the lungs of birds.  But I can use this background: The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court!  What is an answer for this question: Which student learned more about tiny, sac-like structures? Answer:","output":"Dana learned more about tiny, sac-like structures.  This is because the background information provided mentions that mammalian lungs are unique in having alveoli, which are the tiny, sac-like structures that greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Dana focused her studies more on mammalian lungs, and thus, she would have learned about these unique characteristics, including the presence and functions of the alveoli in the mammalian respiratory system. On the other hand, Barry focused on the lungs of birds, which may have different structural and functional features. Although both mammals and birds are warm-blooded and use lungs for respiration, their respiratory systems can have important differences. For example, birds have a more efficient respiratory system that involves air sacs and a continuous flow of air through their lungs. To summarize, Dana, who studied mammalian lungs, would have learned more about the tiny, sac-like structures called alveoli, which are unique to mammals and play a vital role in the gas exchange between the lungs and the bloodstream."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

O'Keeffe was born on November 15, 1887, in a farmhouse located at 2405 Hwy T in the town of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O'Keeffe, were dairy farmers. Her father was of Irish descent. Her maternal grandfather George Victor Totto, for whom O'Keeffe was named, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848. O'Keeffe was a legend beginning in the 1920s, known as much for her independent spirit and female role model, as for her dramatic and innovative works of art. Nancy and Jules Heller said, \\"The most remarkable thing about O'Keefe was the audacity and uniqueness of her early work.\\" At that time, even in Europe, there were few arts exploring abstraction. Even though her works may show elements of different modernist movements, such as Surrealism and Precisionism, her work is uniquely her own style. She received unprecedented acceptance as a woman artist from the fine art world due to her powerful graphic images and within a decade of moving to New York City, she was the highest paid American woman artist. She was known for a distinctive style in all aspects of her life. O'Keeffe was also known for her relationship with Stieglitz, in which she provided some insight in her autobiography.  A substantial part of her estate's assets were transferred to the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation, a nonprofit. The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum opened in Santa Fe in 1997. The assets included a large body of her work, photographs, archival materials, and her Abiquiu house, library, and property. The Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio in Abiquiu was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998 and is now owned by the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum.  In 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32 cent stamp honoring O'Keeffe. In 2013, on the 100th anniversary of the Armory Show, the USPS issued a stamp featuring O'Keeffe's Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico/Out Back of Marie's II, 1930 as part of their Modern Art in America series.

Vladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the Dnieper River. Adherence to the Eastern Church had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a liturgy written in Cyrillic and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the Slavic peoples. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the Eastern Slavs and introduced them to rudimentary Greek philosophy, science, and historiography without the necessity of learning Greek (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek). In contrast, educated people in medieval Western and Central Europe learned Latin. Enjoying independence from the Roman authority and free from tenets of Latin learning, the East Slavs developed their own literature and fine arts, quite distinct from those of other Eastern Orthodox countries.[citation needed] (See Old East Slavic language and Architecture of Kievan Rus for details ). Following the Great Schism of 1054, the Rus' church maintained communion with both Rome and Constantinople for some time, but along with most of the Eastern churches it eventually split to follow the Eastern Orthodox.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who claims that most of the money spent came from the band's own funds?  The vocals were taped in Britannia Row and Protocol studios between May and June 1991, the first time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was involved in the recording. Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, \\"We weren't allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal. You'd have to watch the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing. If it stopped, you knew you had to stop the tape and take it back to the top.\\" On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record. Dutt recalled: \\"Kevin would sing a track, and then Bilinda would get the tape and write down words she thought he might have sung\\".In July 1991, Creation agreed to relocate the production to Eastcote studio, following unexplained complaints from Shields. However, the cash-poor Creation Records was unable to pay the bill for their time at Britannia Row, and the studio refused to return the band's equipment.

He had to raise the money himself to get the gear out.\\" Shields' unpredictable behaviour, the constant delays, and studio changes were having a material effect on Creation's finances and the health of their staff.

I have never seen a show as good as Full House. Full House puts all of the newer shows to shame, big time! Anyone who has never seen it, which I don't see how it is possible, should see it. It is a great show for anyone of any age. Full House will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will amaze you. True, some people feel that there are some \\"cheesy\\" aspects to the show, but, the positive aspects out weigh all of the \\"cheesy\\" aspects.

Danny has his brother in law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), which is Pam's younger brother, and Danny also brings in his best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier) to help him raise his three daughters. Danny's daughters are named DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen).Joey and Jesse plan on moving in with Danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years; which is the number of years the show ran for.

Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also a great actor. He looses his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver. He has to raise three girls without a having the girl's Mother. Bob Saget does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls. Dave Coulier (Joey): One word can describe Dave Coulier, funny. He is great. Playing the character of Joey was perfect for him. He does a great job playing the stand-up comedian waiting for his big break. Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She is a tremendous actress. She plays the oldest sister, DJ which is short for Donna Jo. She is one of the best actresses I have ever seen. Her acting ability in Full House was very believable. Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin, incredibly amazing! I wish I could say every thing that I would like to say about Jodie, but, I would use up the 1,000 word maximum just on her. She got her start in a kids show called Mother Goose Stories and when she came to Full House, she blew the audience's and creator's mind. Her great looks and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success that it was. According to Dave Coulier, Jodie was supposed to be the star of the show. It was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break. Jodie, at five years old when the show first aired, could hit every line perfectly. She showed great enthusiasm. Most young kids can't do this. As you can probably guess, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Great actress. Full House is where they got their start. They received the part of Michelle because they were the only babies who did not cry while in front of a camera. There are many more cast members that should be recognized. These are the original characters from when the show first went on the air in 1987. The only negative thing that I can say is how Full House became The Michelle Show towards the end. I think it was to focused on her towards the end. Especially when I think Jodie and Candice were much better at acting. Full House is a great show for everyone. It can teach you a lot. One of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy, such as loosing a family member, occurs. Full House continues to attract new fans. With all this said, there is only a couple things left to say; Full House will never die, and, thank you, the cast of Full House, for giving everyone a show that they can enjoy. Choose your answer.

One day, a young student, Elizabeth, is studying in a classroom on the third floor, when without warning, she is attacked by unseen evil forces.

The series consists of three volumes:  - David Eddings (July 7, 1931  June 2, 2009) was an American fantasy writer. With his wife Leigh, he authored several best-selling epic fantasy novel series, including \\"The Belgariad\\" (198284), \\"The Malloreon\\" (198791), \\"The Elenium\\" (198991), \\"The Tamuli\\" (199294) and \\"The Dreamers\\" (200306).  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - The Tamuli is a series of fantasy novels by David Eddings. The series consists of three volumes:  - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".  - The Malloreon is a five-part fantasy book series written by David Eddings, which follows \\"The Belgariad\\". The Malloreon is set in the same world as The Belgariad, but expands on several aspects of the setting, especially the eastern continent of Mallorea.  - The Belgariad is a five - book fantasy epic written by David Eddings , following the picaresque journey of protagonist ' Garion ' and his companions , first to recover a sacred stone , and later to use it against antagonist ' Kal Torak ' .  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'the belgariad' with the relationship of 'instance of'.

Article:","output":"Title: Slaven Bilic Says Phil Jones Made a Big Fuss Over Feghouli's Challenge Hi kids! Today, I want to tell you a story about something that happened in a soccer game. This story is about two teams, Manchester United and West Ham. Manchester United is a really big team with super cool players, and one of them is named Phil Jones. He helps his team by stopping other teams from scoring goals – he's a defender! In this game, there was a player from West Ham, his name is Sofiane Feghouli - he is a midfielder, that means he plays in the middle of the field and helps both by scoring goals and defending. Now, during this game, something happened between Phil Jones and Sofiane Feghouli. You see, kids, soccer players sometimes accidentally bump into each other when trying to get the ball.  In this case, Sofiane Feghouli bumped into Phil Jones really hard! It didn't look very nice, and guess what? The referee, who is like a big boss watching the game and making sure everyone follows the rules, thought it was too rough. So, the referee decided to send Sofiane Feghouli off the field and not let him play anymore in that game. That's called getting a red card! But the West Ham boss, Slaven Bilic, who is like a teacher or a coach for the team, was not happy about this decision. He thought Phil Jones made a \\"meal\\" of the challenge - that means he made it look like it hurt more than it actually did. Slaven Bilic believed that Sofiane Feghouli should not have been sent off the field.  So, that's the story about Phil Jones, Sofiane Feghouli, and Slaven Bilic, who is standing up for his player. Everyone has different opinions on what happened, but the most important thing is that the players learn from their mistakes and keep having fun playing soccer! Remember kids, soccer is a game and everyone should play fair. It's important to be honest and not make things seem worse than they are.

Context: I was driving on Highway 35 on my way home from work. Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

Q:Information:  - \`\` Der gute Kamerad '' ( \`\` The good Comrade '' ) , also known by its incipit as Ich hatt ' einen Kameraden ( \`\` I had a comrade '' ) is a traditional lament of the German Armed Forces . The text was written by German poet Ludwig Uhland in 1809 . Its immediate inspiration was the deployment of Badener troops against the Tyrolean Rebellion . In 1825 , the composer Friedrich Silcher set it to music , based on the tune of a Swiss folk song . The song is about the immediate experience of a soldier losing a comrade in battle , detached from all political or national ideology ; as a result , its use was never limited to one particular faction and was sung or cited by representatives of all political backgrounds throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , and was translated for use in numerous fighting forces , French , Dutch , Spanish , Japanese and others . \`\` The Good Comrade '' still plays an important ceremonial role in the German Armed Forces and is an integral part of a military funeral , continuing a tradition started at some point around 1871 . The song has also become traditional in obsequies of the Military of Austria , the Austrian firebrigades and the highly prussianized Chilean Army . It is also used to some degree in the French Army , particularly in the Foreign Legion . When the song is played , soldiers are to salute , an honour otherwise reserved for national anthems only . Occasionally the song is played at civil ceremonies , most often when the deceased had been affiliated with the military . It is also commonly sung at the funerals of members of a Studentenverbindung . Finally , the song is often played on Volkstrauertag , the German Remembrance Day , at memorials for the fallen . The above text is Uhland 's original version . Various variants have been recorded over the years . Heyman Steinthal in an 1880 article in Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie noted a variant he heard sung by a housemaid , Die Kugel kam geflogen / Gilt sie mir ? Gilt sie dir ? ( i.e. \`\` the bullet came flying '' instead of...  - Grief is a multifaceted response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, \\"bereavement\\" refers to the state of loss, and \\"grief\\" is the reaction to that loss.  - Mourning is, in the simplest sense, grief over someone's death. The word is also used to describe a cultural complex of behaviours in which the bereaved participate or are expected to participate. Customs vary between cultures and evolve over time, though many core behaviors remain constant.  - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.  - Crying is the shedding of tears in response to an emotional state. The act of crying has been defined as \\"a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus, without any irritation of the ocular structures\\". A related medical term is lacrimation, which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears. Crying is also known as \\"weeping\\", \\"wailing\\", \\"whimpering\\", and \\"bawling\\".  - A lament or lamentation is a passionate expression of grief, often in music, poetry, or song form. The grief is most often born of regret, or mourning. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner, where the participant would lament about something they regret or someone they've lost, usually accompanied by wailing, moaning and/or crying. Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing and examples are present across human cultures.   - Johann Ludwig Uhland (26 April 1787  13 November 1862), was a German poet, philologist and literary historian.  - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.

Write an article using the following points: German U-576 attacked convoy off Cape Hatteras in 1942. U-boat sank tanker Bluefields, but was sunk by Allied planes, ship. Wrecks rest 240 yards apart on bottom of Atlantic.","output":"Title: The Tale of German U-576 and Tanker Bluefields: A Glimpse into a World War II Battle at Cape Hatteras Introduction As one of the most important maritime highways in the Second World War, the waters off Cape Hatteras in North Carolina was a highly contested area between the German U-boats and the Allied convoys. One such encounter took place in 1942, when German U-576 attacked a convoy, sinking the tanker Bluefields. However, this victory was short-lived as Allied forces retaliated and sent the U-boat to rest alongside its prey at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Step 1: Present the background context of the story involving the German U-576 and the battle off Cape Hatteras. During the height of World War II, the German Navy launched a campaign, known as the Battle of the Atlantic, to disrupt the supply lines between North America and Britain. One of their key strategies involved deploying U-boats to target and destroy convoys of merchant ships loaded with war materials. Large-scale battles in these waters made this area off Cape Hatteras one of the most dangerous grounds for both sides. Step 2: Provide details on the encounter between German U-576 and the tanker Bluefields in 1942. In 1942, German submarine U-576, under the command of Kapitanleutnant Hans-Dieter Heinicke, identified a convoy of merchant ships sailing near Cape Hatteras. Recognizing an opportunity to disrupt the Allies' supply chain, Heinicke ordered an attack on the fleet. The U-boat successfully targeted and torpedoed the Nicaraguan-flagged tanker Bluefields, which was carrying 8,500 tons of fuel to Britain. As the tanker exploded and began to sink, the German crew submerged to avoid potential counterattacks. Step 3: Describe the retaliation by the Allied forces and its result. The attack on Bluefields did not go unnoticed by its fellow convoy ships and the Allied military. Aircraft and escort ships quickly responded to the threat and launched a coordinated attack against the submerged U-576. They deployed depth charges in an attempt to dislodge the U-boat from its hiding spot and force it to surface. Their aggressive assault was successful, and soon after, the German submarine faced overwhelming fire from the convoy’s aircraft and naval vessels. Step 4: Explain the outcome of the engagement and where the wrecks currently lie. In its desperate attempt to evade destruction, U-576 was ultimately struck by one of the Allied attacks and sank to the ocean floor, just 240 yards away from the Bluefields wreckage. The exact location of the wrecks remained a mystery until 2014 when a team from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) discovered them resting on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Conclusion The sunken remnants of German U-576 and the tanker Bluefields offer a window into a fierce battle that took place during World War II. Their proximity on the ocean floor bears witness to the intensity of the engagement as well as the strategic maneuvers and counterattacks employed by both sides. This captivating tale stands as a testament to the dedication and sacrifices of seafarers and military personnel who risked their lives fighting for their nations during one of history's most significant conflicts."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Their number and influence has varied through the years. While historically predominantly Italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years. While in 1939 about half were Italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third. Their influence in the election of the Pope has been considered important, they are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied. Under the 1587 decree of Pope Sixtus V, which fixed the maximum size of the College of Cardinals, there were 14 cardinal deacons. Later the number increased. As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia. Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent. John XXIII brought it back up to 37 percent but Paul VI brought it down to 27 percent where John Paul II has maintained this ratio.\\"?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. After 302 days behind bars -- and 130 days on hunger strike -- Maikel Nabil is savoring his freedom and his food. Nabil, 26, was jailed after being convicted by an Egyptian military tribunal in March last year for writing a blog post and Facebook comments criticizing the country's military rulers who took over from ousted president Hosni Mubarak. He was released on January 24, one of 1,900 prisoners pardoned by Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, before the first anniversary of the start of Egypt's revolution. By chance, Nabil was also released in time for the premiere of \\"Back to the Square,\\" a film about life in post-Mubarak Egypt, featuring Nabil's brother Mark campaigning for his release. \\"Back to the Square,\\" by director Petr Lom, premiered at the Rotterdam International Film Festival on January 29 and will be the opening film at the One World International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival in Prague, Czech Republic in March. Nabil's ordeal was one of five stories in the film, which also followed a 15-year-old boy who was almost killed in Tahrir Square on the Day of the Camel during the revolution, when pro-Mubarak supporters on horses and camels clashed with pro-democracy demonstrators. Also featured: An ex-convict who says he was forced to fight protesters in Tahrir Square; a female protester who was subjected to a virginity test; and a woman who says she was arrested and told to testify against her husband. \\"As I collected stories it was clearer and clearer that there was a continuing injustice and lack of human rights that seemed to be the most urgent thing to be tackled,\\" Lom said. \\"Up until the end of last summer, most of the coverage suggested the country had already transformed, but it seemed to be that hadn't really happened.\\" He said all the characters he filmed were victims of injustice in post-revolutionary Egypt. More from Inside the Middle East: Women and the Arab uprisings: 8 'agents of change' to follow. \\"The film has a theme of the loss of innocence, young people growing up and seeing reality and how it corresponds to their young dreams,\\" Lom said. In a telephone interview, shortly after his release, Nabil said, \\"I want my voice to be heard and I'm happy that is happening. However, I can't say I'm pleased to be released because I shouldn't have been jailed from the beginning. I haven't done anything wrong, I haven't committed any crimes, I have just written my opinions.\\" He added: \\"The army should be tried for its human rights violations, not me. I can be called back to prison at any time, so I'm not really free. They have the material to send me back to jail. But I will continue to speak out. I'm still shouting very loudly.\\" A government spokesman denied Nabil's accusations of ill-treatment and said the blogger was suffering from disorientation as a result of his solitary confinement. The government has also repeatedly denied allegations of human rights abuses. Nabil went on hunger strike while in jail to protest his trial by military tribunal, which he described as a piece of \\"theater\\" in which he was unable to defend himself. He was able to sustain his hunger strike for 130 days by drinking water, milk and juice some days. Some days he had nothing at all. Overall, he had nothing to eat or drink on 10 days, 39 days he had only water, and 81 days of drinking milk and juice, Nabil said. \\"I used hunger strike as a tool of nonviolent struggle to protest against my trial by military tribunal. \\"It was my first experience of hunger strike and I was discovering my body and its ability to resist hunger. The hunger strike was effective because it showed people that I was ready to die for my freedom,\\" Nabil said. \\"People inside and outside of Egypt took interest in my safety and my life. \\"People who refused to defend me changed their mind after my hunger strike. \\"I became very, very sick, and suffered from problems with my heart and liver.\\" Nabil ended the hunger strike on December 31, several weeks before learning he was to be released. \\"I ended the hunger strike because of the number of letters I received from activists all over the world. They asked me to stay alive for them to keep my knowledge to fight. These people loved me and wanted me to stay alive. \\"The other reason I stopped was because I felt the new parliament in Egypt could make a change.\\" Egypt's lower house of parliament took over legislative power on January 23 after elections late last year, with 70% of seats taken by Islamist parties. Elections for the upper house of parliament, the Shura Council, will be completed next month. Presidential elections are set for June. More from Inside the Middle East: Egypt one year on: How the revolution has changed our lives. Nabil continued to write nearly 80 articles while in prison and smuggled them out with friends, who published them on the internet. Nabil said he learned of his pardon from news reports three days before his release. \\"I didn't believe it or trust that it would happen until I was at home with my family and friends,\\" he said. Petr Lom visited Nabil a month after his arrest while filming \\"Back to the Square,\\" although he was unable to film in the prison. \\"It sent shivers down my spine to meet such an extraordinarily courageous young fellow,\\" Lom said. \\"He didn't mind being in prison for standing up for what's right.\\" Lom spent several months filming Nabil's brother Mark as he campaigned to raise awareness and support for his release. Mark Nabil traveled to Rotterdam with Lom for the premiere of the film. He told the The Daily Star, Lebanon: \\"Maikel was against the way the army was taking over the revolution. He knew that nothing would change if the army took over.\\" A month after ending his hunger strike, Nabil said he is fully recovered and has regained the weight he lost.

He was finally released when a very important person named Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi decided to pardon, or forgive, 1,900 prisoners.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999.

The answer is:","output":"To answer the question, let's analyze each step of the process and check how it will be affected by the perturbation hypothesis. Step 1: Coal is burned in a boiler - Assuming there is not much of a heat source, the coal would not burn efficiently or may not burn at all. This would result in a reduced or negligible heat production. Step 2: Steam is produced under pressure - With the reduced or negligible heat production, the water in the boiler would not reach the required temperature to generate steam under pressure. Step 3: Flows into a turbine - Without steam under pressure, there would be no steam flow to propel the turbine. Step 4: The turbine spins - Due to the lack of steam flow, the turbine would not receive the necessary force to make it spin. Step 5: Creates electricity - If the turbine does not spin, it will not generate electricity. Now let's come back to the perturbation hypothesis: \\"suppose there is not much of a heat source happens, how will it affect the turbine will spin more quickly.\\" - Based on the analysis above, a reduced heat source would lead to an inefficient or non-existent steam generation process. As a result, there won't be enough steam flow to power the turbine, and it will not spin more quickly, contrary to the hypothesis. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation does have a direct effect on the process, as it would lead to the failure of steam production in the boiler and interrupt the chain of events necessary to generate electricity. The turbine will not spin more quickly, but rather would lose its driving force due to the lack of steam flow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Or if skirts are your thing, try complementing your short figure with a high-waisted skirt. An outfit that incorporates vertical stripes can flatter a shorter figure. Horizontal stripes, on the other hand, can make a small figure appear wider than it is. Try wearing pants, dresses, or skirts with vertical lines.

In a broader context, this answer could potentially be an entity if the question implied which team or which league they played in.

Article: With fewer than a dozen words Monday, President Barack Obama made his most definitive statement to date in favor of District statehood, delighting both loyal supporters and longtime advocates who have questioned his commitment to D.C. voting rights.      During a town hall-style event at a public school in Northwest Washington, Obama was asked about his opinion on statehood — something that has been the ultimate but elusive goal of voting-rights activists for four decades.      “I’m in D.C., so I’m for it,” Obama said to laughter and applause, according to a White House transcript.      “Folks in D.C. pay taxes like everybody else,” he continued. “They contribute to the overall well-being of the country like everybody else. They should be represented like everybody else. And it’s not as if Washington, D.C., is not big enough compared to other states. There has been a long movement to get D.C. statehood and I’ve been for it for quite some time. The politics of it end up being difficult to get it through Congress, but I think it’s absolutely the right thing to do.”      Obama has previously made gestures in support of the rights of District residents, who do not have a voting representative or senators in Congress. His administration has supported legislative efforts to give the city more budgetary freedom from Congress, and last year his limo sported the city’s “Taxation Without Representation” license plates as he cruised down Pennsylvania Avenue after his second inauguration.

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)      But he has also received criticism that he has done little to go beyond mere gestures and occasionally has worked against the city’s interests — such as in 2011, when he settled a high-stakes budget showdown with congressional Republicans in part by agreeing to reinstate a budget rider preventing the District government from funding abortions.      Previous Obama administration pronouncements on the District have tended to eschew the S word. A 2012 White House statement to The Hill, for instance, said Obama “continues to be an unequivocal supporter of voting rights, home rule and budget autonomy for the District of Columbia.”      Meanwhile, other prominent Democrats have had no qualms about declaring support for statehood. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), to name one: “The District deserves statehood,” he said last year. “And Congress should act to grant it.”      Statehood advocates had no grumbles to share after Obama’s remarks Monday, which were made at the Walker Jones Education Campus, a public school located about a dozen blocks north of the Capitol.      “God bless him,” said Michael D. Brown, one of two “shadow” senators elected by District voters to promote statehood efforts. “I think this is huge, for the president to stand up behind it. . . . I’d call him a hero at this point.”      Obama’s remarks come as statehood bills sit introduced in both houses of Congress and after pledges from key Senate Democrats to hold a hearing on the matter — something that could harness major public attention to the statehood movement for the first time in years. They also come amid attempts by congressional Republicans to impose restrictions on the city’s marijuana and gun laws, interference that would be much more difficult, if not impossible, were the District a state.      Brown, who has commissioned 51-star flags to distribute to members of Congress later this year, said he and fellow “shadow” senator Paul Strauss continue to push for the statehood hearing. D.C. Vote, the city’s most prominent voting-rights advocacy group, also said Monday that Obama’s comments should prompt a hearing.      Anise Jenkins, a longtime statehood activist, said Monday that stalwart Republican opposition to statehood — a measure that could guarantee one additional Democratic representative and two additional Democratic senators for the foreseeable future — remains a daunting obstacle.      But Jenkins said she was still overjoyed by Obama’s remarks and said they have the potential to “energize the movement.”      “We have been critical of him,” Jenkins said of Obama. “We have to be honest about that. But it’s always the right time to do the right thing.” ||||| Thanks, Obama! No really — thanks.      President Barack Obama's fiscal year 2015 budget grants D.C. budget and legislative autonomy, \\"the strongest and most comprehensive call for local D.C. autonomy in a President’s budget ever,\\" according to a release from Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton. Here the narrative* from the budget:      The District of Columbia annually receives direct Federal payments for a number of local programs in recognition of the District's unique status as the seat of the Federal Government. These General and Special Payments are separate from and in addition to the District's local budget, which is funded through local revenues. Consistent with the principle of home rule, it is the Administration's view that the District's local autonomy should be enhanced and increased. The Administration will work with Congress and the Mayor to provide the District local budget and legislative autonomy, as proposed in the Budget.      “This is the best news in a president’s budget for D.C. funding in several years and for D.C. policy ever,” Norton said in a release. “Residents will be cheered to see the President’s statutory language for both budget and legislative autonomy, and parents and students will be particularly gratified by the strong increase in funding for DCTAG. \\"      You may be thinking, \\"Hey! I thought D.C. already had budget autonomy because of that referendum we passed.\\" That's debatable.      While D.C. Vote and Council Chair Phil Mendelson contends the budget autonomy referendum is legal, an opinion by the Government Accountability Office says it has \\"no legal effect.\\" And while the GAO opinion isn't legal binding, it may influence how Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S. DeWitt responds to the referendum as the 2015 budget process begins.      But the D.C. Council is ready to fight for the referendum, as they today passed a resolution to allow city lawyers to defend it in court.      Council votes, without debate, to authorize its lawyers to defend budget autonomy in court if necessary. — Mike DeBonis (@mikedebonis) March 4, 2014      “With the implementation of our new budget law, the District of Columbia is poised to secure a major advancement in our fight for greater self-governance.” DC Vote Executive Director Kimberly Perry said of the resolution in a statement. “Those who seek to undermine the law discount the weight of the injustice we face each day. But, there is still ample time to unify behind the law passed by the people. DC Vote encourages all of our elected and appointed public officials to be part of this historic breakthrough.”      There's also reason to be cynical about Obama's gesture, or rather if Democrats will defend it once Republicans take it out of the budget. Indeed, we've been through this before.      The sad thing about the DC portions of the Prez's budget is the GOP will gut them and the Dems won't defend them. I hope not but history... — Josh Burch (@JBurchDC) March 4, 2014      *This has been corrected. |||||       President Barack Obama speaks about the about My Brother's Keeper initiative at the Walker Jones Education Campus on July 21, 2014 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)      During an appearance at a D.C. school, President Barack Obama openly supported the city's statehood effort for the first time.      \\"I'm in D.C., so I'm for it,\\" Obama said at the Walker Jones education campus, according to a White House pool report. \\"I think I’ve long believed that D.C. pays — folks in D.C. pay taxes like everybody else. They contribute to the overall well-being of the country like everybody else. They should be represented like everybody else. And it’s not as if Washington, D.C. is not big enough compared to other states. There has been a long movement to get D.C. statehood and I’ve been for it for quite some time.\\"      After not using them for his first term, the White House switched the plates on Obama's limousine to ones printed with D.C.'s \\"Taxation Without Representation\\" slogan last year. President Bill Clinton also used the plates, which were removed during President George W. Bush's terms. The Obama administration previously voiced support for D.C.'s home rule and right to budget autonomy and full voting representation in Congress.      While the president's open support for statehood is a positive step, he was also realistic about its chances with the current Congress: \\"The politics of it end up being difficult to get it through Congress, but I think it’s absolutely the right thing to do.\\"      \\"All right, that was an easy one,\\" Obama said before moving on to the next question.      Update: Here's a statement from DC Vote executive director Kimberly Perry: “President Obama’s support for D.C. statehood shows that he understands the injustice we face every day. The President has repeatedly proposed greater autonomy for D.C., only to see those proposals die because of partisan squabbling in Congress. We hope the administration will now request that its Senate allies hold a hearing on the D.C. statehood bill.” ||||| When he ran for the White House, President Barack Obama said he was a fan of voting rights for the District of Columbia in the U.S. House and Senate.      But he hasn’t really urged Congress to pass the legislation -- until today.      While honoring D.C. Emancipation Day, Obama said it’s time.      “Americans from all walks of life are gathering in Washington today to remind members of Congress that although D.C. residents pay federal taxes and serve honorably in our armed services, they do not have a vote in Congress or full autonomy over local issues,” Obama said in a statement.      He added, “And so I urge Congress to finally pass legislation that provides D.C. residents with voting representation and to take steps to improve the Home Rule Charter.”      First ldy Michelle Obama is also an advocate for our statehood rights. Dring a recent one-on-one interview with News 4’s Jim Vance, she seemed to acknowledge the fact that her husband has not embraced the idea.      \\"He is a supporter of the rights of citizens here in D.C. to have the vote,\\" Mrs. Obama said, \\"and I don't think there's much convincing that you have to do there, you just have to get it done.\\"      The statehood debate, which has been batted around Congress for decades, will be back in the news next week.      That’s when the House of Representatives is expected to tackle a bill that would include D.C. voting rights.

One day he attends a minor league hockey game with his friend Pat (Jay Baruchel). Pat taunts the visiting team during a fight and one of their players climbs into the stands. Doug, in defense of his friend, quickly knocks him out, which prompts the rest of the crowd to cheer him on. Soon after, Doug gets a phone call from the coach of his hometown team who offers him a job as an enforcer, a player whose role is to protect his teammates and act as a deterrent by hitting or fighting opposing players who take liberties with his teammates.In the meantime, veteran enforcer and Doug's idol Ross \\"The Boss\\" Rhea (Liev Schreiber) is demoted to the minors after serving a 20 game suspension for slashing an opponent in the head from behind. Three years prior, Rhea hit and concussed the highly skilled prospect Xavier Laflamme (Marc-Andre Grondin) who has had trouble recovering from that incident due to the fear of being hit, being stuck in the minors and falling in with the wrong crowd.

Question with options to choose from: What might happen when the two men are left alone in the cell ? Options are:  * The man will offer Benjamin a drink ..  * None of the above choices ..  * The man will tell Benjamin to relax ..  * The man will yell at Benjamin ..","output":"When the two men are left alone in the cell together, various scenarios may unfold, depending on their respective personalities and the weight of the betrayal. The options provided hint at some potential interactions that could occur between them but, ultimately, the situation's outcome is uncertain. In an attempt to foresee the possibilities, let's examine each of the options: 1. The man will offer Benjamin a drink: This scenario assumes that the betrayed man possesses a forgiving, calm nature and may wish to ease the tension between himself and Benjamin. This act could serve to establish a rapport, offering the two an opportunity to discuss the situation and potentially find common ground. By extending an olive branch in this manner, the betrayed man may be seeking a way to understand Benjamin's motivations and actions better. 2. None of the above choices: Since other options provided focus on the betrayed man's reaction, this option suggests that none of the identified behaviors may accurately encapsulate how he responds. This option leaves room for other possibilities, such as the man remaining silent throughout the ordeal, expressing his distress through visible anxiety or sadness, or seeking an alternative way of communicating with Benjamin—such as writing or body language. 3. The man will tell Benjamin to relax: In this option, the man may acknowledge the tense nature of their shared predicament. By advising Benjamin to relax, he might attempt to establish a non-confrontational atmosphere, allowing both of them to explore their thoughts and feelings. This approach could open the door for dialogue, enabling an environment of mutual understanding despite the betrayal. Moreover, it's possible the man wants to address the issue without immediate judgment or aggression, aiming for a calmer, solution-oriented approach. 4. The man will yell at Benjamin: The last potential outcome illustrates a more aggressive response from the betrayed man toward Benjamin. Fueled by rage and disappointment, he might direct his anger at the individual who betrayed him, blaming him for their shared confinement. This emotional outburst could be driven by sheer frustration at the turn of events and may act as an outlet for the man's pain and hurt. Yelling may not only serve as a means of expressing the man's feelings but could also stand as an attempt to intimidate Benjamin and enforce the perceived consequences of his actions. Given the emotional weight of the circumstances, multiple factors will influence the direction this scene takes. While the list above provides some viable scenarios, the true outcome will be based on a combination of individual character traits, their histories, the nature of the betrayal, and the stakes at hand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The club was founded in 1876 and played their first few matches at Sophia Gardens, but soon relocated to Cardiff Arms Park where they have been based ever since. They built a reputation as one of the great clubs in world rugby largely through a series of wins against international touring sides. With professionalism dawned a new era at Cardiff RFC. It allowed them to sign legendary outside-half Jonathan Davies back from rugby league, and another major change was that there would be a European Cup, sponsored by Heineken, containing teams from France, Ireland, Wales, Italy and Romania (England and Scotland did not join for another year). Cardiff progressed to the knock-out stages in November by drawing with Bordeaux-Begles and beating Ulster. December saw the end of the Alex Evans era, as he departed to return home to Australia. Terry Holmes took charge of the club, and in his first full match the Blue and Blacks beat Leinster away to progress to the first Heineken Cup final. The game was played at Cardiff Arms Park in front of a crowd of 21,800, where despite 18 points from the boot of Adrian Davies, Cardiff were beaten 21-18 by Toulouse after extra time.  Cardiff, despite not losing a league game under Holmes, were runners-up on the domestic front as well, finishing level with Neath on points but coming second on try count. After the end of the 95-96 season Peter Thomas invested money into the club allowing them to sign Rob Howley, Dai Young back from rugby league, Leigh Davies, Gwyn Jones and Justin Thomas for the cost of around PS2million. Internationals Mark Ring, Steven Blackmore and the half-backs that had started the Heineken Cup final, Andy Moore and Adrian Davies all departed.  Despite all the new signings, Cardiff lost their first three games of the season, and the 1996/97 season was in many respects worse than the year before - Cardiff were knocked out in the Heineken Cup semi-finals by eventual champions Brive, and in the Welsh Premier Division they fell to third, behind champions Pontypridd and Llanelli. However, after Alex Evans returned to head up the coaching team, that season did lead to some silverware, as Cardiff beat Llanelli 36-26 in the semi-final and Swansea 33-26 in the final of the SWALEC Cup. Grzegorz Kacala and Tony Rees, both forwards part of the Brive team that knocked Cardiff out of the Heineken Cup and went on to win it, were signed for 1997/98 along with Wales internationals Steve Williams and Spencer John (Gareth Thomas also arrived in December from Bridgend).  Despite Cardiff's difficulties, compounded by those of the national team, Howley and Young were both chosen to go on 1997 Lions tour to South Africa. Howley had to return home early due to injury and neither of the two Cardiff players started a Test match.  In the 1997/98 season, Cardiff were Wales's sole representative in the quarter finals of the Heineken Cup, and were beaten away in rematch of the previous year's quarter-final, by Bath, who would go on to win the tournament. However, their domestic cup campaign ended before the quarter final stage, losing 24-9 to Ebbw Vale, and they finished runners up to Swansea in the League. Following this season, Alex Evans left Cardiff for Australia for the second time and Terry Holmes was put back in charge.

Let's follow the steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. The given equation is: -1270*d - 87*d = -7478 + 693 - We have -1270*d and -87*d on the left side, which we can combine: (-1270 - 87)*d, i.e., -1357*d. - On the right side, we have -7478 and 693, which we can combine by addition: -7478 + 693 = -6785 So, the simplified equation is: -1357*d = -6785 Step 2: Isolate the variable d. To isolate d, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of d, which is -1357. d = -6785 / -1357 Step 3: Calculate the value of d.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: What is causing the anxiety of the subject ?","output":"The anxiety of the subject appears to stem from a combination of factors, based on the evidence provided in the passage.  1. The first factor contributing to the subject's anxiety is a sudden awareness of solitude. The passage states that upon removing whatever covered him, \\"he found that he was alone.\\" The unexpected loneliness could be distressing as it raises questions about the safety and well-being of those who might have been with the subject earlier. It also creates a potentially vulnerable situation in an unknown environment. 2. Another factor causing anxiety is the physical difficulty experienced by the subject. The passage mentions that he \\"managed to sit up\\" implying that sitting up was not an easy task for him at this moment. This difficulty could make him feel weak, uneasy, and concerned about his physical state. 3. The subject's abnormal sleep pattern may also cause anxiety. It is stated that he \\"did n't normally sleep this much.\\" The fact that he slept more than usual could be a sign that something unusual has happened to him, or that his body is reacting to an unknown stressor. This deviation from his routine may create a feeling of unease and concern about his health or external circumstances that led to this unexpected heavy sleep. 4. The subject's behavior of immediately drinking from the waterskin raises concerns about dehydration or general exhaustion. This could be another reason for him feeling weak, disoriented, and uncertain about what has happened to him, further contributing to the overall anxiety. In conclusion, the subject's anxiety can be attributed to the unexpected solitude, difficulty in sitting up, abnormal sleep patterns, and potential dehydration or exhaustion.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzburg. Available choices: i. yes ii. no","output":"ii. no The next sentence, \\"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzburg,\\" does not directly follow the preceding text. While the preceding text provides a description of Antonio Salieri's position in relation to Mozart's music, the subsequent sentence shifts focus to Mozart's birthplace without any clear transitional elements or a connection between both composers. The initial passage introduces Mozart through Salieri's point of view, highlighting the divine aspect of Mozart's music. The biography of Mozart or the context of his birth could be introduced in a more cohesive manner by establishing a connection between the two composers or by offering a more concise introduction to Mozart's early life and its relation to the overarching narrative. To improve the flow, one could consider adding a transitional sentence that relates to Salieri's view of Mozart's talent or establishes a connection between the two composers who shared the same profession. For example, after mentioning that Salieri was a favorite at the imperial court, the saying could be added: \\"Despite Salieri's success, he could not help but recognize the unmatched musical talent of the young composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who was born in Salzburg,\\" or similar wording to bring the focus back on Mozart while maintaining a connection to the initial subject, Salieri."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This is more common among elementary school students than high school students, who typically have a stronger grasp of grammar. 2. Subject Matter: The poem discusses horses, which is a subject that tends to be more appealing to younger children. The writer expresses their admiration for the animals and a desire to protect them. This type of content is often associated with the innocence and idealism of younger students. 3. Writing Style: The poem's structure is not very complex, featuring simple rhyming patterns and phrases. This is typical of younger students who are still developing their writing skills, while high school students usually demonstrate more advanced techniques and structure in their writing. Based on these factors, it is reasonable to predict that the kid who wrote this poem is in elementary school.

The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Fort Eben-Emael is an inactive Belgian fortress located between Liège and Maastricht, on the Belgian-Dutch border, near the Albert Canal. It was designed to defend Belgium from a German attack across the narrow belt of Dutch territory in the region. Constructed in 19311935, it was reputed to be impregnable and at the time, the largest in the world. The fort was neutralized by glider-borne German troops (85 men) on 10 May 1940 during the Second World War. The action cleared the way for German ground forces to enter Belgium, unhindered by fire from Eben-Emael. Still the property of the Belgian Army, the fort has been preserved and may be visited.  - The Battle of Maastricht was one of the first battles that took place during the German Campaign on the Western Front during World War II. Maastricht was a key city in order to capture the Belgian Fort Eben - Emael and split the allied armies in half .  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who begins to demonstrate supernatural powers? John Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Unseen Forces\\" John, a high school science teacher and a single dad, seems just like any other man in the small town of Clermont. He lives a run-of-the-mill life, struggling to maintain a balance between his job and his parenting duties to his precocious 8-year-old, Lily. Things take an astonishing turn when John begins to exhibit supernatural powers. Let’s break this down: Step 1: Introduction and Establishment of Characters In the first act of the movie, the audience is introduced to John, his daughter Lily, and their daily lives. John often bewails the mundanity of his life and dreams of adventure, but is kept grounded by the need to take care of Lily. Lily, on the other hand, reveres her dad and his captivating science lectures about the cosmos and hypothetical phenomenon such as parallel existence and the possibility of hidden potential within our DNA.  Step 2: Trigger Event One fateful day, Lily is in an accident that pins her under a large tree. Unable to lift the tree by normal strength, a sudden surge of mental-force propels from John's body, miraculously lifting the tree from Lily. This rousing event marks the beginning of John’s journey with his supernatural powers, which he soon discovers include telekinesis and manipulation of matter. Step 3: Adventure Kickoff and Exploration John begins to explore these powers—testing his limits, making mistakes, and often succeeding. While initially he uses them for personal gains, he soon realizes that these gifts come with significant drawbacks. The powers sap his energy, and excessive use causes him to fall ill. This triggers an internal conflict in John, who now stands on a precipice of moral challenges and physical consequences.  Step 4: Climax  As word of John's powers gets out, they attract the attention of a shadowy government organisation aiming to utilise John for selfish means. They abduct Lily as leverage, pushing John into the ultimate test of his abilities and his unwavering determination. Using his strategic flair and newfound powers, John manages to rescue Lily and escape from the clutches of the organisation. Step 5: Resolution John and Lily then decide to disappear from the city in order to live a peaceful life away from those who would harness his abilities for nefarious purposes. His supernatural powers remain a secret to the world, a burden and a blessing he shares with his daughter.  In each of these steps, we address the key elements of storytelling — establishing a relatable protagonist, presenting a problem or situation that changes their world, allowing them to grow and learn through the problem, culminating in a dramatic conflict and eventually bringing their story to a resolution."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"\\"A lousy worker\\" would not be a valid answer to describe Riley, given the information provided. Here's the detailed explanation: The question being asked is, \\"How would you describe Riley?\\" and from the information provided, we can construct an accurate and fair characterization of Riley. The main point presented in the context is that Riley had been studying for weeks in her room, and there was a big exam coming up that she had to do well on. Let's break this down further to assess why calling her a \\"lousy worker\\" is not a valid response. 1. Studying for weeks – This shows that Riley is dedicated, focused, and committed to her studies. Studying for an extended period demonstrates good work ethic, time management, and understanding of the importance of preparation. All of these qualities go directly against the definition of \\"a lousy worker.\\" 2. Big exam coming up – The fact that Riley is putting in weeks of study for an important exam showcases a sense of responsibility, determination, and goal-oriented behavior. She recognizes the significance of this exam and knows that it needs her full attention, effort, and hard work. This further contradicts the notion of Riley being \\"a lousy worker.\\" 3. Had to do well on the exam – The fact that Riley knows she has to perform well indicates that she is aware of the consequences and the benefits of doing well on the exam. This awareness is a sign of maturity, self-discipline, and a desire to succeed, which are qualities that do not align with the idea of being \\"a lousy worker.\\" Taking all these factors into account, it is clear that describing Riley as \\"a lousy worker\\" is invalid and unfair. Instead, alternative adjectives such as \\"diligent,\\" \\"committed,\\" \\"responsible,\\" or \\"hardworking\\" would be more appropriate in characterizing Riley based on the given information. Her extended studying, focus on an important exam, and the awareness of the necessity to do well on that exam all point to Riley being a conscientious and dedicated individual who takes her work seriously."},{"instruction":"In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry.

Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave.

Paragraph: The hijackers attacked at 9:28. While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.  Question: \\"What was below average for this particular day?\\" Answer: \\"number of hijackers\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: pick from the following. 1. no. 2. yes.","output":"2. yes. The \\"number of hijackers\\" was below average for this particular day because, on Flight 93, there were only four hijackers instead of the five-man teams that were present on the other three hijacked commercial flights on 9/11.

There are also two children, the sensitive Mary (Robin Ignico), who as soon as she arrives to the house feels it calling her name, and stupid naughty boy Kevin (Oliver Robins), who enjoys scaring his sister, e.g. while they are travelling towards the house, he ties a huge spider to a stick with some sewing thread, scaring the hell out of Mary.Grandmother Bernice (Ruth Gordon) talks defiantly to Kevin when he tells her off because she was going to smoke inside the home. Bernice likes doing whatever she pleases and won't listen to her daughter. Laura says good night to Mary, and then she takes some lab tubes from Kevin, who angrily wants them back. After sending the children to sleep, Laura tells Bernice off in person, as soon as she catches her smoking - which is bad for her health.That night, Mary is woken up by the noises outside her bedroom window. There are stange noises and shadows, and her dolls begin to move or be moved a little bit. Mary screams, and when her parents rescue her, her bedroom is on fire. Mary cannot breath because of her panic. Nobody believes Mary when she says that she heard something under her bed. Bernice appears upstairs, smoking again.Kevin doesn't want his sister to sleep with him for the night, and in spite of his slamming of his bedroom door, that's is said and done.

Given the question: I can use this background: The major effect of transpiration is the reduction of soil pore water pressures which counteracts the loss of strength which occurs through wetting, this is most readily seen as a loss of moisture around trees. However it is not easy to rely on tree and shrub roots to remove water from slopes and consequently help ensure slope stability. The ability to transpire in wet conditions is severely reduced and therefore any increase in soil strength previously gained in evaporation and transpiration will be lost or significantly reduced, consequently the effects of transpiration cannot be taken into account at these times. However it can be assumed that the chance of slope failure following saturation by storm event or periods of extended rainfall will be lessened as a result of transpiration. Moreover, although changes in moisture content will affect the undrained shear strength, the effective shear stress parameters as commonly used in routine slope stability analysis are not directly influenced by changing moisture content, although the water pressures (suctions) used in the analysis will change.[2][3]  Now, I have a new situation: The two teams took different approaches in reinforcing the highway embankment slopes when building segments of the interstate. Team A led by Chuck relied almost entirely on inspiration and good building materials therefore decreasing slope stability, while team B lead by Mike used nature as an ally by planting tens of thousands of trees and shrubs to prevent slope failures and moderate soil transpiration and evaporation.  Answer this question please: Which team contributed to strengthening the soil? The answer is:","output":"Team B, led by Mike, contributed to strengthening the soil.  This conclusion is drawn based on the background information given, which suggests that tree and shrub roots help remove water from slopes, ensure slope stability, and counteract the loss of strength which social wetting causes by transpiring, i.e., reducing soil pore water pressures. Even though this process might be less effective in wet conditions, it helps lessen slope failure following heavy rainfall or storm events through transpiration.  In contrast, Team A, led by Chuck, relied primarily on inspiration and building materials, it does not mention any specific strategies regarding improving soil strength or managing soil water pressures. Therefore, even though building materials can also contribute to slope stability, their strategy does not focus on the vital aspect of soil strengthening mentioned in the background piece—transpiration. That said, this assessment does not fully consider all variables that could influence slope stability, such as the quality and type of building materials used by Team A, or the species and age of plants used by Team B, among others. More details about these variables could lead to a different conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Revolving around the fictional character and family of New Jersey-based Italian American mobster Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), the show portrays the difficulties he faces as he tries to balance the conflicting requirements of his home life and his criminal organization. These are often highlighted during his therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco). The series features Tony's family members, mafia colleagues and rivals, in prominent roles and story arcs, most notably his wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and protégé Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli).  - Edith \\"Edie\\" Falco (born July 5, 1963) is an American television, film, and stage actress, known for her roles as Diane Whittlesey in the HBO series \\"Oz\\" (19972000), Carmela Soprano on the HBO series \\"The Sopranos\\" (19992007), the title character of the Showtime series \\"Nurse Jackie\\" (200915), and Sylvia Wittel on the Louis C.K. web series, \\"Horace and Pete\\" (2016).  - Christopher Moltisanti, played by Michael Imperioli, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series \\"The Sopranos\\".

In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format. Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics, as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term \\"story arc\\" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series \\"Wiseguy\\", and was quickly adapted for other uses.  - New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.

This step is important so that you know what to expect and can properly commit to your role as a volunteer lifeguard. Step 2: Prepare physically and mentally Being a lifeguard requires physical fitness, strong swimming skills, and the ability to work well under pressure. Begin training regularly, focusing on swimming, cardio, and strength workouts to increase endurance and ability to save lives in the water. Moreover, practice mental preparedness by taking stress management courses or engaging in activities such as meditation. This step is important because a lifeguard must be fit and able to remain calm in emergency situations. Step 3: Join a surf life saving club Reach out to surf life saving clubs in or near Bondi, expressing interest in becoming a volunteer lifeguard. Attend their meetings and training sessions, and learn from experienced members. This step is crucial as it provides hands-on experience and direct involvement with the club. Step 4: Obtain necessary certifications Complete all the required certifications, such as a first aid and CPR course, and the Surf Lifesaving Certificate (Bronze Medallion) in Australia. These certifications may vary depending on the location or specific surf life saving club requirements. Acquiring these certifications is important as it ensures that you are capable of providing adequate assistance in emergency situations. Step 5: Complete training and probation period Once certified and accepted into the club, complete any additional training and complete the probation period as required by the surf life saving club. This is important as it allows you to gain practical experience while being supported by more experienced members. Step 6: Serve as a volunteer lifeguard After successfully completing all the requirements, steps, and training, commit yourself to serving as a volunteer lifeguard at Bondi Beach or other nearby beaches. Stay updated with club activities, attend regular meetings, and continue learning and growing in your role. This final step is important in fulfilling your goal of becoming a Bondi lifeguard and serving your community."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In copyright law, infringement does not refer to theft of physical objects that take away the owner's possession, but an instance where a person exercises one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder without authorization. Courts have distinguished between copyright infringement and theft. For instance, the United States Supreme Court held in Dowling v. United States (1985) that bootleg phonorecords did not constitute stolen property. Instead, \\"interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft, conversion, or fraud. The Copyright Act even employs a separate term of art to define one who misappropriates a copyright: '[...] an infringer of the copyright.'\\" The court said that in the case of copyright infringement, the province guaranteed to the copyright holder by copyright law – certain exclusive rights – is invaded, but no control, physical or otherwise, is taken over the copyright, nor is the copyright holder wholly deprived of using the copyrighted work or exercising the exclusive rights held.

The daughter of Prince Andrew was pictured in New York today wearing a vibrant scarf in the style of the Union flag emblazoned with the slogan 'God Save The Queen'. The monarch's granddaughter is being both patriotic and stylish with her choice of accessory as the silk scarf is an Alexander McQueen design which costs 425 (£263). Scroll down for video. Flying the flag: Princess Eugenie wore an Alexander McQueen scarf inspired by the Union Jack with the slogan 'God Save The Queen' on it in bold letters. Her long, colourful scarf stood out against the rest of her all-black outfit while she opted for comfortable footwear by donning pumps as she strolled through the Big Apple with a friend. But she looked ever the professional thanks to a smart statement bag on her shoulder. The 24-year-old moved to New York in September to work at online art auction house, Paddle8. The company launched in 2011 describing themselves as an 'auction house for the 21st-century collector' and have been backed by Damien Hirst, Matthew Mellon and Jay Jopling. Making friends: The royal was out in the Big Apple with a female companion. Settling in: Princess Eugenie moved to New York in September to start a new job. Professional princess: Eugenie teamed her 425 (£263) scarf with a black outfit and smart statement bag. Comfortable: She dressed down her look with flat pumps on her feet. While at work, the history of art graduate is simply known as Eugenie York and she's shunned the leafy, affluent Central Park area to live in the thriving Meatpacking District of Manhattan. The princess was reported to be anxious about her move as she knew few people in the city. Her departure has also meant she has to have a long distance relationship with boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank, who works for the London nightclub Mahiki. 'We spend a lot of time on Skype,' he said recently, according to YOU magazine. The royal certainly didn't seem homesick as she was out today as she was pictured laughing and chatting with her female companion.

His intelligent and original physiognomy deserves to be taken in profile or head-on. The head is strong; the deep forehead is that of a thinker; the mouth large and smiling, the nose regular; the years have whitened the beard and hair ... the gaze fine, a little mocking. His stooped walk, his puritan comportment, give him the look of an Anglican minister or a rabbi – for which he has the abilities. Alkan was not always remote or aloof. Chopin describes, in a letter to friend, visiting the theatre with Alkan in 1847 to see the comedian Arnal: \\"[Arnal] tells the audience how he was desperate to pee in a train, but couldn't get to a toilet before they stopped at Orléans. There wasn't a single vulgar word in what he said, but everyone understood and split their sides laughing.\\" Hugh Macdonald notes that Alkan \\"particularly enjoyed the patronage of Russian aristocratic ladies, 'des dames très parfumées et froufroutantes [highly perfumed and frilled ladies]', as Isidore Philipp described them.\\"Alkan's aversion to socialising and publicity, especially following 1850, appeared to be self-willed. Liszt is reported to have commented to the Danish pianist Frits Hartvigson that \\"Alkan possessed the finest technique he had ever known, but preferred the life of a recluse.\\" Stephanie McCallum has suggested that Alkan may have suffered from Asperger syndrome, schizophrenia or obsessive–compulsive disorder.Alkan's later correspondence contains many despairing comments. In a letter of about 1861 he wrote to Hiller: I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous ... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do ... no one to devote myself to.

I have a habit of making mental errors; some funny, some not. This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the persont that painted Charles IV of Spain and His Family? ?  In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano  became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by Las Meninas. Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink.  Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\". Goya's royal family is presented on a \\"stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim...

First, it's necessary to identify the main idea or statement in this sentence. The main idea here is 'Revolution consists in...replacing it by a new one made up of the armed workers'. 2. Next, 'the proletariat', 'destroying the administrative apparatus and the whole state machine', 'replacing it by a new one made up of the armed workers' are closely related phrases working together. 'the proletariat' is the noun or subject carrying out the action, while 'destroying the administrative apparatus and the whole state machine' and 'replacing it by a new one made up of the armed workers' are the actions or verbs related to 'the proletariat'. Each of these related actions is complex and contains a lot of detail, so I've placed commas after 'proletariat' and 'whole state machine' to break it up and make it easier to understand. 3. Finally, I checked the sentence to ensure the commas didn't separate any integral phrases and that the sentence flows smoothly.

L'importance de cette période de 30 ans réside dans les nombreux changements économiques, politiques et sociaux qui ont eu lieu dans le monde entier. Durant ces trois décennies, la reconstruction après la Seconde Guerre mondiale a contribué à redéfinir les relations internationales et à créer un nouvel ordre économique mondial. De nombreux pays ont également atteint leur indépendance et ont dû créer des institutions nationales pour soutenir leurs économies en développement. Cela a permis à la Banque mondiale de jouer un rôle crucial en aidant ces pays à se développer et à prospérer. La Banque mondiale, fondée en 1944, avait pour objectif initial de financer la reconstruction et le développement économique des pays dévastés par la guerre. Au fil des années, elle a élargi son mandat pour inclure des programmes de réduction de la pauvreté et d'amélioration de la qualité de vie dans les pays en développement. Pendant cette période de 30 ans, la Banque a travaillé en étroite collaboration avec les gouvernements nationaux pour mettre en place des projets d'infrastructure, d'éducation, de santé et de développement rural. Ces initiatives ont contribué à créer des opportunités économiques et à diversifier les sources de revenus pour les populations locales.   Le rôle de la Banque mondiale dans la mise en place de ces projets a souvent été critiqué pour sa tendance à favoriser les intérêts des pays développés et des entreprises multinationales. Cependant, d'autres considèrent que la Banque a été un acteur essentiel dans le financement et la mise en œuvre de projets profitant à des millions de personnes dans les pays en développement. Par exemple, la construction de barrages hydroélectriques, de routes et d'autres infrastructures publiques a amélioré l'accès à l'électricité, aux soins de santé et aux marchés pour de nombreux habitants.   Au cours de ces 30 ans, la Banque mondiale a également adapté ses politiques et ses programmes pour répondre aux défis émergents, tels que la protection de l'environnement, la lutte contre la corruption et la promotion du développement durable. Ces questions sont devenues de plus en plus importantes à mesure que les impacts négatifs du développement économique sur l'environnement et les droits de l'homme devenaient plus apparents.   En résumé, la période de 30 ans allant de 1935 à 1965 représente une ère importante dans l'histoire de la Banque mondiale, car elle a été témoin de la naissance et du développement de cette institution. Durant cette période, la Banque a joué un rôle clé dans le financement et la mise en œuvre de projets de développement important pour les pays en développement et émergents, tout en s'adaptant aux défis et aux besoins changeants du monde.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy. Question: Who's White House career had caused drama in this story? Answer: Answer:","output":"In this story, the person whose White House career had caused drama is President Donald Trump.

William Henry Harrison was the ninth President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1841, until his death on April 4, 1841. He was born on February 9, 1773, in Charles City County, Virginia, and was a prominent political figure during the early years of the United States. Harrison's political and military career began when he joined the United States Army and fought in the Indian Wars under General \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne. He is best known for his role in the Battle of Tippecanoe, in which he and the forces under his command defeated a confederation of Native American tribes led by the Shawnee chief Tecumseh. Later, Harrison entered politics and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Ohio. He also served as the governor of the Indiana Territory, U.S. Senator from Ohio, and U.S. Minister to Colombia. Harrison gained national prominence as a war hero, using the slogan \\"Tippecanoe and Tyler too\\" during his presidential campaign in 1840. Harrison's presidency was, unfortunately, short-lived. After delivering the longest inaugural address in U.S. history on a cold, rainy day, without wearing a hat or coat, he developed pneumonia and died only a month after taking office. His death marked the first time a sitting U.S. President had passed away, leading to some confusion and constitutional questions regarding presidential succession. Eventually, Vice President John Tyler was sworn in as the tenth President of the United States.

Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz.  Please answer this question : Which group would be able to hear lower frequency, group A or group B? A:","output":"To answer this question, let's consider the hint provided and the information about groups A and B. Group A consists of animals that can only hear infrasound, which are sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz (Hz).  Group B consists of animals that can only hear the same frequency range as humans do, meaning they can hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Now, let's compare both groups based on their ability to hear lower frequencies.  Group A can hear sounds with frequencies below 20 Hz. Meanwhile, group B can hear sounds with a minimum frequency of 20 Hz. Since group A can hear sounds with frequencies lower than 20 Hz and group B's lowest frequency is 20 Hz, group A would be able to hear lower frequency sounds compared to group B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Modern man has cleared the forests for farmland and for wood, and has also carelessly burned them. More than that, though, he has also interfered   with the invisible bonds between the living things in the forests. There are many examples of this kind of destruction. The harmfulness of man's interference can be seen in what happened many years ago in the forest of the Kaibab plateau   of northern Arizona. Man tried to improve on the natural web of forest life and destroyed it instead. The Kaibab had a storybook forest of large sized pine, Douglas fir, white fir, blue and _ . In 1882 a visitor noted, \\"We, who ... have wandered through its forests and parks, have come to regard it as the most enchanting region it has ever been our privilege   to visit.\\" This was also the living place of the Rocky Mountain mule deer. Indians hunted there every autumn to gather meat and skins. The forest also had mountain lions, timber wolves and bobcats that kept the deer from multiplying too rapidly. Then, in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt made the Kaibab a national game preserve. Deer hunting was forbidden. Government hunters started killing off the deer's enemies. In 25 years' time, 6,250 mountain lions, wolves and bobcats were killed. Before the program, there were about 4,000 deer in the Kaibab, by 1924, there were about 100,000. The deer ate every leaf and twig they could reach. But there was not nearly enough food. Hunting of deer was permitted again. This caused a slight decrease in the deer herd  ,but a far greater loss resulted from starvation   and disease. Some 60 percent of the deer herd died in two winters. By 1930 the herd had dropped to 20,000 animals. By 1942 it was down to 8,000. Question: Years later, large numbers of deer in the Kaibab died mainly because of . - the cold - the organized kill - the poor management - the shortage of food Answer:","output":"Years later, large numbers of deer in the Kaibab died mainly because of the shortage of food. This was a result of the human interference in the natural balance of the forest ecosystem. When the government hunters killed off the deer's natural predators such as mountain lions, wolves, and bobcats, the deer population increased rapidly, leading to overgrazing and insufficient food sources. Although hunting of deer was later permitted again, which led to a slight decrease in the deer herd, the far greater losses were due to starvation and disease caused by the shortage of food. About 60 percent of the deer herd died in two winters, and by 1942, the total population had dwindled down to 8,000."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Invention Translate to Finnish","output":"Keksintö In the grand scheme of human history, the notion of invention has played an instrumental role in the progression of our societies, cultures, and lived experiences. In Finnish, the term for invention is \\"keksintö.\\" The essence of a keksintö is the creation of a new device, method, or process, which stems from human ingenuity and curiosity. Over time, countless keksintöjä (the plural form) have reshaped the world that we know. From the earliest tools employed by our ancestors to the cutting-edge technologies that continue to drive change in the modern era – each keksintö represents a building block in our collective story. One pivotal keksintö that altered the course of human history was tulen käsittely, or the Control of Fire. This revolutionary mastery enabled early humans to ward off predators, prepare food, and foster social cohesion around a communal source of warmth and light. As societies evolved, additional keksintöjä emerged, such as the wheel (pyörä), written language (kirjoitettu kieli), and agriculture (maatalous), each of which contributed to the development of complex civilizations. During the industrial revolution, keksintöjä proliferated at an unprecedented pace, paving the way for mass production, improved transportation methods, and new forms of communication. Some notable inventions include the steam engine (höyrykone), the telephone (puhelin), and electricity (sähkö). It is difficult to overstate the profound impact these keksintöjä had on the quality and efficiency of human life. In more recent times, the digital age has spawned a host of keksintöjä – from personal computers (henkilökohtaiset tietokoneet) and the Internet (Internet) to smartphones (älypuhelimet) and artificial intelligence (tekoäly). These keksintöjä have transformed the way we work, communicate, and navigate the world, enabling global interconnectedness and real-time information sharing on an unprecedented scale. It is clear that keksintöjä will continue to shape the future of humanity in myriad ways. As we forge partnerships, tackle challenges, and strive toward an optimal balance between sustainability and progress, the power of human ingenuity and the pursuit of keksintöjä will remain central to our endeavors. In conclusion, keksintö (invention) is a testament to the boundless capacity of human creativity and the never-ending drive to discover new solutions in our evolving world. As the Finnish language encapsulates through the word keksintö, this fascinating aspect of human history will no doubt endure, as we continue to innovate, develop, and build upon the successes of our past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? vise grip","output":"To accomplish the goal of using vise grips effectively for a particular task, one should follow these steps: 1. Understand the working of vise grips: Vise grips, also known as locking pliers, are versatile tools that combine the functionality of a wrench and pliers. They're used for gripping, holding, clamping, and twisting various objects, particularly where standard pliers or wrenches can't easily access or where a tight, secure grip is needed. 2. Choose the appropriate vise grip: Vise grips come in various sizes, shapes, and designs to suit a variety of applications. Some common types are:    - Straight Jaw Vise Grips: Good for gripping flat or square surfaces.    - Curved Jaw Vise Grips: Suitable for gripping round or irregular-shaped objects.    - Long Nose Vise Grips: Ideal for reaching narrow and tight spaces.    - C-Clamp Vise Grips: Designed for clamping materials during welding or other work.    - Needle Nose Vise Grips: Suitable for precision work or small objects. Select the vise grip that best matches the job at hand. 3. Prepare the object or workpiece: Before using the vise grips, ensure the object or workpiece is secure and stable. Use a bench vise, clamps, or other support mechanisms if necessary to prevent movement. 4. Adjust the vise grip jaws: Vise grips have an adjustable screw mechanism at the back of one handle, which sets the width between the jaws. Open the vise grips and turn the adjustment screw clockwise to decrease the jaw opening, or counter-clockwise to increase it. Test the fit on your object or workpiece and make adjustments until you reach the desired grip size. 5. Place the vise grips on the object or workpiece: Open the jaws of the vise grip and position them around the object or workpiece, ensuring that both jaws are in full contact with the surface. 6. Lock the vise grips: Once the jaws are in position, close the handles together until the vise grips lock in place. A proper lock will generate a clicking sound, indicating that the handles are secure. The vise grips should now be holding the object firmly without any slippage. 7. Perform the task: With the vise grips securely in place, start performing the intended task. This may include gripping, twisting, turning, or clamping objects. Make sure the pressure applied is gradual and controlled to avoid any damage to the object. 8. Release the vise grips: To release the vise grips, locate the lever on the inside of one handle (usually the bottom handle) and press down on it. This should unlock the pliers and allow you to open the jaws and remove the object. 9. Inspect the work: Carefully inspect the work to ensure the vise grips have not caused any damage such as scratches, dents, or deformation. 10. Maintain the vise grips: Vise grips, like any other tools, require maintenance to ensure they remain effective and safe to use. Clean the pliers thoroughly after each use and apply lubricant to the moving parts, including the adjustment screw and locking mechanism. By following these steps, one can effectively accomplish the goal of using vise grips for various tasks while ensuring the safety and longevity of both the tool and the object being worked on."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the first sentence, \\"I gather from Aunty May that you had a good day at the match,\\" the word \\"gather\\" is primarily being used to express the idea of acquiring or collecting information from a particular source, which in this case would be Aunty May. The speaker is stating that they have heard or understood from Aunty May that the listener had a positive experience at the match. This usage of \\"gather\\" implies that the information has been gained indirectly, rather than the speaker having experienced or witnessed the event themselves. In the second sentence, \\"I gather you have not done your homework,\\" the word \\"gather\\" is being used in a slightly different manner. Here, it is more about the conclusion or inference that the speaker has drawn based on various pieces of information or evidence. The speaker could be making this statement based on the listener's behavior, past experiences, or indirect information. While there is an element of acquiring information, the focus here is more on the speaker's understanding or perception derived from the situation.

This sentence refers to a currently-unknown context about a particular medical procedure or protocol. The use of \\"Darüber hinaus\\" (Furthermore) suggests this statement is expanding upon previous information that has already been shared. The phrase \\"wie alle medizinischen Verfahren\\" (like all medical procedures) underlines the universal nature of this claim – it's not just this procedure, but any medical procedure that carries some inherent risk. This is echoed in the second part of the statement \\"nie frei von Risiken\\" (never without risks), that underlines the impossibility of absolutely risk-free medical procedures.  It's important to emphasize that while all medical interventions carry some degree of risk, these are typically weighed against the potential benefits for the patient. Doctors and medical teams usually aim to minimize these risks as much as possible, employing methods proven to be safe and effective, and prioritizing patient safety and well-being.  Yet, it remains a critical part of informed consent to communicate these risks to patients prior to any treatment or procedure. This allows individuals to make decisions based on a clear understanding of the potential benefits and downsides. In this way, it's not just a matter of disclosing potential risks but also facilitating meaningful dialogue between patients and healthcare providers, ensuring that the former can participate fully in decisions about their health.

The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead.

When we published “10 Creative Social Media Resumes To Learn From” in May, our readers enthusiastically responded by sharing it with friends, commenting on it and sending us links to their own snazzy resumes. We sifted through those links, picked our favorites and placed them in the gallery below. After clicking through the collection of resumes, were you inspired? What works for you in your industry? Do you already use any of the tactics employed in these resumes to promote yourself and your skills? Let us know what you think in the comments below. Meghan Molino's resume pops out for many reasons: Not only does it have a 3D feel but it also reveals the multiple dimensions of her personality. \\"I'm a very visual person, and I wanted a resume that honed in on how I prefer to digest data and that also showcased my own creativity. I'm an out-of-the-box thinker. I didn't want a standard resume that on first glance makes you look like everyone else,\\" said Molino, who is a product launch specialist. Molino had Hagan Blount (whose resume is slide seven in this gallery) redesign her resume to further establish her online identity as a creative professional. \\"I love my current job, so I'm not necessarily on the market for something new.\\" Despite not actively looking for a new employer, Molino has created buzz around her skills. \\"What's been fascinating is to see who has approached me since publicizing this resume. It's a sort of vetting document. Corporate America may not 'get it,' but companies that embrace individuality and want their employees to be impactful, curious and take risks — they've loved it.\\" 2. There's an App for That (Resume) João Dornellas, a designer for YDreams, created this iPad app resume to show off his portfolio. It has been downloaded more than 2,200 times. 3. Make the Most of Facebook In need of a job, Claudio Nader turned his Facebook profile into what he dubs the first \\"FacebookCV,\\" a curriculum vitae on his profile. The FacebookCV landed him a gig as social media assistant and content editor for a web marketing agency in Milan, he said in a blog post. If you'd like to mimic his efforts, check out the FacebookCV tutorial he wrote. 4. Match the Design With Your Style Jonathan Cropper has always felt that the standard text-driven resume needed a refresh. \\"Resume design is a classic branding error. Institutional conformity in a design-driven world is a recipe for failure,\\" said Cropper, a communications and branding expert. Cropper wanted to give his resume a \\"futuristic, militaristic precision tone\\" to match his work style. (Hagan Blount, whose resume is slide seven in this gallery, designed the resume.) \\"The map and SMS and QR codes on that document also communicate that I have a global and digital mindset,\\" he added. This Twitter-inspired resume comes to us from Rouyer Arnaud of France. Although the design of the site resembles Twitter, Arnaud said all of the code was rewritten from scratch. When you click on a tweet, more information pops up on the right panel. Give it a go here. \\"Who said resumes and CVs all have to be boring and official and unfunny? I'm too creative for that! I'll make a resume that looks like a Twitter account,\\" Arnaud wrote in a tweet on his resume website. Saidur Hossain added tags to his resume [PDF link]. It's a subtle, fun addition for a web designer's resume. Hagan Blount's infographic resume is packed with visuals: a map, a chart, QR codes and logos. \\"Jon (from slide four in this gallery) actually inspired me to create the resume,\\" Blount said. \\"I'd seen the 'creative resume' posts from graphic designers but not from people looking for jobs outside that field. \\"Jon showed me some of those resumes and postulated that they would become the de facto standard. I agreed and made one over the course of the next few days, and Jon was my first client. I sent it to a few friends on Facebook, and when I saw the massive amount of hits I had [on] my site the next day, I started pushing it harder and it ended up being published all over the world.\\" In May, we brought you these awesome resumes to help you to stand out from the crowd. 1. Put Your Best (QR) Face Forward At first glance, Victor Petit's resume looks similar to any other text-based CV. But flip the document over and you'll find a full-page image of his face as well as a QR code where his mouth would be. Once a recruiter scans the QR code and places his or her phone on top of it, a video pops up revealing Petit's mouth, ultimately completing the full-page image and allowing the recruiter to hear Petit's voice. QR codes are easy to make and can help you get noticed, especially if you ditch the standard black-and-white QR code and opt to add some pizazz to your design. 2. Sell Yourself ... Literally Shopify, an ecommerce platform, says the best resume it has ever received is this one from Mike Freeman, who wanted to work at Shopify's marketing department. \\"He built an online store using Shopify where you can read about his background, experience, etc. and the ecommerce part is you can 'buy' an interview with him for '0.00,' \\" said Mark Hayes, Shopify's manager of marketing and media. \\"We get an infinite amount of resumes here. Yes, he got the job.\\" Henry O'Loughlin took to Facebook to showcase his \\"Social Resume,\\" including a video in which he describes how to navigate his resume on Facebook. \\"I work with mostly small businesses doing social media, so I am demonstrating through this resume all of the tools out there that can be utilized without an ad budget.\\" Using Facebook's Page feature, O'Loughlin was able to showcase his skills as well as show potential clients what he can offer them. 4. Video Killed the Resume Star? Video resumes can be a clever complement to your existing job-search materials (i.e. print resume, cover letter and website). Graeme Anthony ditched his print resume altogether and created a fun, interactive video where viewers can click on words (see 0:34) linked to an \\"about me\\" section, portfolio, skill page, timeline and contact information. If you decide to make a video, be sure not to just rehash what's on your print resume. Have fun with it and show your personality. Anthony sure did. 5. Gather Online Networks in One Place Alisha Miranda used Flavors.me as an online hub for all of her social media networks. Her profile, which essentially acts as an abridged online resume, caught the eye of her eventual employer. \\"Before approaching Alisha, I monitored her social Flavors.me profile for about three weeks and saw what she was doing on Tumblr, Twitter, etc. to evaluate her marketing effectiveness and if her style matched what I wanted,\\" said Tracy Brisson, CEO of The Opportunities Project. \\"Once I saw that she had all the goods, only then did I contact her to talk. As a career coach and recruiter, I can't emphasize the importance of creating something clients and employers want, which is results and evidence.\\" You can employ sites like Flavors.me or About.me to showcase all of the social media websites you use. Your existing website or blog are also good spots to place your social media icons. 6. Add Personality to Your Print Resume HAMSTER? Hired! It's hard to take your eyes away from Katie Briggs's visually pleasing resume, which pimps her \\"fancy hamster,\\" Belafonte. \\"I wanted the first thing that people notice about my resume to be that it's a little fun, but still pretty much all-business,\\" Briggs said. \\"In any creative field, at least, I think it's important to make your resume a testament to your work ethic. It shouldn't look forced but it should give the impression that the work you put into constructing your resume is an indicator of the kind of dedication and hard work you'll bring to the job.\\" Takeaways: Make sure your resume shows your personality and represents who you really are. Also, don't bore job recruiters. \\"I can say that I haven't been turned down for anything I've applied for with this resume,\\" Briggs added. 7. Think Outside the Box ... or On It In 2D form, Omondi Abudho's resume goes beyond the standard text-driven resume. It even adds extra \\"creative juice\\" with a nutrition label-inspired skills column. However, the resume can be folded into an actual three-dimensional box. It brings a whole new meaning to the phrase, \\"Think Outside the Box.\\" Using a resume design or structure that strays away from the typical printer paper size is a surefire way to get noticed. Beyond Credentials believes that \\"finding talent based solely on a resume is fundamentally flawed.\\" Its service allows users to build \\"personalized pitch pages.\\" For example, Nadia Kouri's pitch page lists everything she would have on a print resume as well as her story, an enlarged quote, accomplishments, personality, a Q&A and writing samples. The page also includes icons linking to her LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter profiles. While Jenn Pedde was revamping her full, multi-page resume, she used this one-page resume \\"teaser\\" on her blog. The resume puts major emphasis on the recommendations people left on her LinkedIn profile. \\"The one page got so many compliments and it was so right to the point and social,\\" Pedde said. It's an effective way to translate your online presence to an offline print form. Pedde's recommendation-focused resume led to her current job at 2tor where she works as community manager for the Master of Social Work program at USC. 10.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who is Natasha? terrorist Answer:","output":"Title: The Shattered Veil Genre: Action, Thriller Plot summary: Natasha, a seemingly insignificant character, plays a central role in upending a global terror network. As deep-cover agents navigate through a dark underworld and treacherous government officials blur the lines between ally and enemy, a strong-willed detective pushes forward to unravel all sides of Natasha's story, unearthing a mysterious past and shocking betrayals along the way. Will the detective succeed in exposing the true face of Natasha or fall prey to a deadly game of cat and mouse played by the world's most dangerous players? Act 1 - The Hidden Depths: An international anti-terrorism task force, led by Detective Max Roland, is targeting a shadow organization known as \\"The Dark Ravagers,\\" responsible for several high-profile attacks. While surveilling a suspected cell in an urban European city, the task force stumbles upon Natasha, a beautiful yet enigmatic woman working as a barista. She catches their eye due to her frequent visits to a suspect under investigation, Ahmed, a known arms dealer. Act 2 - The Mysterious Connection: As Max digs deeper into Natasha's past, he discovers she is an orphan with no paper trail before the age of 18. Meanwhile, as tensions rise between the anti-terrorism force and government officials, Max secretly pursues his investigation into Natasha. He learns that she is trained in martial arts and multiple languages, hinting at a more dangerous background than her current professions suggest. Max finds himself caught in a web of subterfuge involving high-ranking politicians, deceitful contractors, and explosive secrets. Act 3 - The Unraveling Veil: Max discovers that the missing link in their investigation is Natasha as her connection to Ahmed reveals a much larger, deadlier terror plot. Natasha, a deep-cover mole, infiltrated The Dark Ravagers with the intention of bringing them down. Her true identity – a former intelligence operative, now rogue – is uncovered as she feeds vital information to Max, compromising The Dark Ravagers' expansion plans and ultimately fracturing the organization. Act 4 - The Confrontation: Max confronts Natasha, and they form a tense alliance to prevent an imminent attack that would result in mass fatalities. They navigate hostile environments and engage in high-intensity combat against The Dark Ravagers, culminating in a face-off with the mastermind of the entire organization. Just as success seems imminent, Max is betrayed by a trusted member of the anti-terrorism task force, who turns out to be in league with The Dark Ravagers, revealing a deadly game of betrayal and false identities. Act 5 - The Climax: Natasha sacrifices herself to stop the attack, foiling the terror organization's grand plot and avenging those who fell during the investigations. Wracked with guilt, Max confronts the traitor from his team. In an action-packed showdown, Max brings the mole to justice, and with his faith in the system restored, he vows to continue dismantling terror networks around the world. The movie ends with Max discovering a letter from Natasha, unveiling more hidden details about her life and hinting at the existence of other shadow operatives still fighting the battle against terrorism. The Shattered Veil seeks to explore the true cost of loyalty, the duplicity of human nature, and the complexity of global security threats faced in the modern world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Not because the taste stays with you for at least 15 minutes as you lick it off the roof of your mouth. No, I don't even love it because of its special places in American history (George Washington Carver, Jimmy Carter, anyone?)  I love the old PB for one simple reason: It was damned-near my only source of protein for 18 months of my life. Peace Corps taught me that sometimes meat is hard to get, the chickens aren't always laying, and beans aren't always in season. So what was a man to do? Well, after I was tired of chicken feet and beef tripe, I rediscovered peanut butter. It's calorie rich. It travels pretty well. And praise the lord, you don't have to refrigerate it!!!  Pretty soon, I was throwing PB in my rice, and I'll be damned if it wasn't the best ghetto Thai food I've ever tasted. And when I moved to a bigger town, and bought a second-hand fridge, I kept up my peanut butter habit. That habit has stayed with me to this day. While I don't eat rice quite so often anymore, I still like a big glob of PB in my oatmeal.  That being said, PB Loco was to me like an Italian cobbler's shop to a Scottsdale fashionista: so many opportunities for exquisiteness.

Question: What skills does Manray have? Movie title: Bamboozled Movie plot: In a New York City residence, Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) rises to begin his daily routine. Brushing his teeth, he gives us by voice over a definition of satire. He tells us that with the rise of the Internet, video and interactive games, his field as a television writer has seen a drop in popularity. Meanwhile, in a dilapidated building, squatter Womack (Tommy Davidson) wakes up his friend Manray (Savion Glover) for a day of work. This consists of travelling to the CNS (Continental Network System) building where Delacroix works, and Manray tap dancing to entertain the workers. They then collect money from the workers. The men see Delacroix walk by, and ask him for monetary help in the form of work of some kind.Delacroix walks into a staff meeting late and is immediately castigated by his boss, Thomas Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport). Dunwitty informs the staff that CNS has poor ratings. He says he wants them to write funnier material, and ends the meeting. In the privacy of his office, Dunwitty tells Delacroix that the material Delacroix's been writing for him seems like it's about white people with black faces. Dunwitty asserts that Delacroix is an \\"oreo\\" with his Harvard education, because he won't write a \\"n----r show.\\"The next day, Delacroix and his assistant Sloan Hopkins (Jada Pinkett Smith) talk. They've decided that Manray is the solution to his problem. Delacroix plans to write a show that will be so \\"offensive and racist,\\" it will prove his point that the network only wants to see black buffoons on the air. Delacroix simply hopes to be fired, so he can be let go of his contract with CNS. Manray and Womack ask at the receptionist's desk for a \\"Delapoint\\" and the men working there tell them to step outside. However, Sloan steps into the lobby, sees what's happening, and escorts Manray and Womack to Delacroix's office. Delacroix explains to them that he has an idea for a television pilot, and they can make money with it. His main request is that Manray changes his name to Mantan, in an apparent homage... Answer:","output":"Manray, portrayed by Savion Glover, has skills as a tap dancer. In the movie Bamboozled, he tap dances to entertain the workers at the CNS (Continental Network System) building where Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) works.

The partition of India, formalised in 1947, was characterised by religious tension and violence between Hindus and people of which other major religious group?","output":"The partition of India in 1947, which led to the creation of two separate nations – India and Pakistan, was characterized by religious tension and violence between Hindus and Muslims. The other major religious group involved in this conflict and the subsequent mass migration were the Muslims. The British Indian Empire, under the British colonial rule, was a heterogeneous entity, comprising diverse ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups. After World War II and increasing civil unrest, Britain decided to grant independence to the Indian subcontinent, internalizing the necessity of the end of their colonial rule. However, during the lengthy struggle for independence, different political ideologies emerged from regional and communal tensions, leading to the development of distinct religious and nationalistic sentiments. The All India Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, strongly advocated the formation of a separate nation for Muslims, called Pakistan, based on the \\"Two-Nation Theory.\\" This theory held that the Hindus and Muslims were two entirely separate nations and could not exist together amicably in a unified country. The Indian National Congress, a party that fought for India's independence, was opposed to this idea and initially sought a united India. In the face of growing religious tensions and instances of sporadic violence, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India, resorted to a hurriedly drafted and inevitably flawed plan for partition. On August 14, 1947, Pakistan was formally created, and the next day, August 15, India gained its independence. The partition displaced around 10-15 million people across the newly formed borders of India and Pakistan, sparking the largest mass migration phenomenon in human history. As millions of Hindus and Sikhs migrated from the new Pakistan into India, and millions of Muslims moved from India to Pakistan, communal tensions escalated into violence on an immense scale, leading to the deaths of an estimated one to two million people. The religious tensions and violence that accompanied the partition deeply affected India and Pakistan's relations, laying the foundations for a long-lasting enmity between the two nations. This continued hostility has sparked several wars, border skirmishes, and a sustained arms race, significantly impacting the region's stability and development. Furthermore, the unresolved status of areas such as Jammu and Kashmir further fuels the tension and rivalry. To sum it up, the partition of India in 1947 was characterized by religious tension and violence primarily between Hindus and Muslims, with the latter constituting the other major religious group involved in the conflict. The division of the Indian subcontinent and the subsequent mass migration led to the emergence of two separate nation-states – India and Pakistan. Both nations have since faced an enduring legacy of mutual hostility, which significantly shaped and continues to impact their political, social, and economic trajectories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is a Professor of English at the University of Southern California. He explains that there are just a few areas left on Earth that are unknown and briefly describes a few theories that postulate there may be places deep under the surface of the Earth where man can survive.In Asia an archeological dig has discovered something. Dr. Roger Bentley (John Agar) and Prof. Etienne Lafarge (Nestor Paiva) expose a stone tablet. They take it back to their tent to clean and examine it. We are introduced to Dr. Jud Bellamin (Hugh Beaumont) and Dr. Paul Stuart (Phil Chambers) who ask Bentley to translate the find: it may be related to the story of Gilgamesh and Ishtar. An earthquake rattles the area and the tablet is broken. This puts their work a month behind schedule. A small boy discovers something the earthquake brought down a mountain and brings it to Bentley. He cleans it and it is revealed to be an ancient oil lamp. The inscription is translated as a pre-biblical Noah's Ark story. The party of scientists set off for the mountain where the artifact originated before it was dislodged by the earthquake.They set up base camp and plan their final assault on the mountain the next day. A storm hits the base camp that evening. As they set off the next morning an avalanche brings down an arm from a statue. They continue climbing and discover the ruins of an ancient Sumarian civilization on a small plateau. They estimate the ruins are 5,000 years old. While Dr. Stuart walks around the ruins he falls down through an opening. The rest of the party goes down on ropes to save him. Bentley leads the way, followed by Lafarge, who is much older than the rest. Bellamin is third down the opening followed by Nazar (Rodd Redwing).

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.  Paragraph: Two researches studied the Earth's mantle.

But ask him now he feels about that decision, and you get a tepid response. \\"I'm not sure,\\" Poskin said. Like many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China. Those fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as 60 billion worth of Chinese imports. \\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\\" Poskin said. \\"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef — [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\\" The announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly. Trump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology. U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks. \\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday. Some U.S. companies in China cheered the move and suggested that concerns about a trade war were overblown. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, dismissed the \\"hair on fire\\" concern that Trump's proposed moves would hurt the global economy. \\"That the U.S. is willing to risk these disruptions indicates how serious the U.S. administration finds China's forced technology transfer, cybertheft and discriminatory industrial policies,\\" he said in a statement to VOA.

He was a Republican member of the House of Representatives from California's 52nd, 45th and 42nd districts from 1981 to 2009. Hunter was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during the 108th and 109th Congress. Hunter sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States for 2008, but his campaign failed to attract significant voters or delegates in early primary and caucus states, and he dropped out after the Nevada Republican caucuses. On December 8, 2006, Hunter introduced H.R. 6375, which would have required the defense department to post the purpose of all congressional earmarks in annual defense bills, along with the location and a grade according to the utility of the earmark.  Hunter introduced H.R. 552, The Right to Life Act, on February 2, 2005. The purpose of the bill is to \\"implement equal protection... for the right to life of each born and preborn human person.\\" In the 109th Congress, the legislation collected 101 cosponsors. Hunter states that The Right to Life Act \\"would legally define \\"personhood\\" as the moment of conception and, therefore, guarantee all constitutional rights and protections, including life, to the unborn without utilizing a constitutional amendment.\\" Hearings for H.R. 552 were scheduled for December 12, 2006, but were cancelled right before the House adjourned.  On April 28, 2004, Hunter introduced legislation that he said could \\"turn parents into prosecuting attorneys fighting a wave of obscenity.\\" HR 6390 IH, also called the \\"Parents Empowerment Act\\", would allow the parent or guardian of a minor to sue in federal court anyone who knowingly disseminates material \\"that is harmful to minors\\", or specifically, \\"any pornographic communication, picture, image, graphic image file, article, recording, writing, or other pornographic matter of any kind\\", if it is distributed in a way that \\"a reasonable person can expect a substantial number of minors to be exposed to the material and the minor, as a result to exposure to the material, is likely to suffer personal or emotional injury or injury to mental or moral welfare.\\"  In 1994, Hunter legislatively mandated the construction of 14 miles (23 km) of security fencing on the international land border separating San Diego County and Tijuana, Mexico. In 2005, Hunter introduced legislation calling for the construction of a reinforced fence along the entire U.S.-Mexico border, citing crime statistics as measures of San Diego-Tijuana fence's success. After successfully adding an amendment to a House-passed bill that ultimately stalled in House-Senate negotiations, Hunter's amendment was later incorporated into H.R. 6061, the Secure Fence Act, introduced by New York Congressman Peter T. King. He has said that if he becomes President, the 754-mile (1,213 km) double layer border fence will be built in less than 12 months.

According to Cahill's research, approximately 145 police officers commit suicide every single year, many of whom have PTSD and depression due to the stressful nature of their work. Traumatic Experiences in the Line of Duty A police officer's job is inherently stressful, as they must face trauma and life-threatening situations daily. Moreover, they often bear witness to some of society's darkest moments, including violence, crime, and human suffering. While these officers are trained to handle challenging circumstances, the constant exposure to tragedy often takes a heavy emotional toll on them. Cahill believes that the coping mechanisms that enable officers to perform well on the job may actually cause harm in their personal lives. Suppressing feelings, putting on a brave face, and even normalizing traumatic experiences just to make it through the day can build stress and emotional baggage which can quietly eat away at their mental health. The Need for Police Departments to Take Action One of the keys to addressing mental health issues and preventing suicides among police officers, Cahill asserts, is having departments recognize the impact of the trauma their officers face. By implementing training programs to help officers recognize symptoms of PTSD, depression, and other mental health issues, they can begin to take proactive steps towards getting the help they need. Cahill also wants police departments to provide resources and support for their struggling officers. This could include access to mental health professionals who specialize in trauma, peer support programs, and better mental health coverage through insurance benefits. By making mental health care more accessible, departments can help their officers avoid falling into the downward spiral that can ultimately lead to suicide. The Road to Change Although the road to recognizing and addressing the silent epidemic of police suicides is a long and arduous one, the tireless efforts of individuals like Brian Cahill are essential to creating lasting change. Through his work as a suicide prevention trainer, Cahill is bringing awareness to a crucial and often overlooked issue within the law enforcement community. With increased understanding, education, and proper support systems, it is hoped that the rate of police suicides can decrease dramatically. It is essential that departments across the country prioritize the wellbeing of their officers, ensuring that they receive proper care and treatment for any emotional concerns that may arise. In doing so, we can better protect those who have dedicated their lives to protect us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: Martinis, barbecues, cigarettes, adultery--all are now vestigial, but where are the new suburban symbolic hooks? Hypothesis: Barbecues and adultery are not considered vestigial.  Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To answer whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must first understand the concepts being addressed. The premise talks about certain elements (Martinis, barbecues, cigarettes, adultery) that were once considered symbolic of suburban lifestyles and raises a question about where these new symbolic hooks are. Understanding the terms used helps clarify the premise: 1. Vestigial: No longer necessary or useful but retained as a part of the structure or system. 2. Symbolic hooks: These are the elements or iconic representations that characterize or define a particular time or cultural environment. The hypothesis presents a counter-claim that barbecues and adultery are not considered vestigial. Now we can analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis by examining the connection between the two. The premise implies that Martinis, barbecues, cigarettes, and adultery have become vestigial in suburban settings, which suggests that these elements may have lost their social significance within that context. This implication assumes that these elements are no longer present or relevant in contemporary suburban lifestyles. The hypothesis, however, disputes this presumption, stating that two of these elements (barbecues and adultery) are not considered vestigial. In other words, the hypothesis posits that these elements may still be present or relevant in suburban lifestyles or that their significance has not diminished. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to compare the two statements: 1. The premise suggests all the mentioned elements are now vestigial. 2. The hypothesis claims that at least two of the elements (barbecues and adultery) are not vestigial. Given the differences in the assertions made by the premise and the hypothesis, one cannot say that the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise implies that all the listed elements have lost their significance, whereas the hypothesis argues that at least two of them (barbecues and adultery) have not. Consequently, the two statements introduce conflicting perspectives on the status of barbecues and adultery in suburban cultural contexts, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help.

(CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Boat. A:","output":"Title: Night Voyage Step 1: Introducing the characters Justify: Characters need to be introduced to establish relationships and personalities, creating the foundation for the plot. Here we have: - Vampire Queen, Sasha, an ancient being who values loyalty and yearns for companionship - Boat Captain, Sebastian, a cynical and intelligent man in search of a better life - Veronica, a brave and resourceful woman who crosses paths with the Vampire Queen Step 2: Setting the stage Justify: Setting the stage helps build the atmosphere and develops the plot. The story takes place in the late 19th century. Captain Sebastian is transporting passengers and goods on his boat across the Atlantic to the New World. He remains in the dark about the true nature of one of his passengers, Sasha, the Vampire Queen. Step 3: Main conflict Justify: Conflict adds drama and tension, giving the story its central point. During the voyage, Sasha's hunger for blood starts to get the better of her. She's forced to feed on a few passengers discreetly. Veronica, a passenger, grows suspicious of Sasha and starts investigating, while the boat captain, Sebastian, remains blissfully unaware of the queen's true identity. Step 4: Rising action Justify: Rising action develops the conflict and increases tension, leading up to the climax. As the journey continues, mysterious deaths are discovered onboard. Veronica starts piecing the clues together and confronts Sasha. The Vampire Queen admits her vampiric nature and proposes an alliance, promising great power to Veronica if she joins her. Step 5: Climax Justify: The climax is the turning point of the story when the conflict reaches its peak and sets the stage for the resolution. During their confrontation, a storm hits the ship, causing chaos onboard. Amidst the tempest, Sasha and Veronica must decide whether to join forces or remain enemies. Veronica chooses to side with the Vampire Queen to save the remaining passengers from the shipwreck. Step 6: Falling action Justify: Falling action is needed to resolve the story's conflicts and bring the plot to a close. Sasha and Veronica use their combined power to save the ship and its passengers from the storm. Captain Sebastian learns the truth about Sasha and is forced to face his own demons and decide if he can accept her as his queen. Step 7: Resolution Justify: Resolving the remaining conflicts allows the story to reach a satisfying conclusion. The ship arrives safely in the New World, and Sebastian chooses to accept Sasha as his Vampire Queen, allowing her to rule over the vessels that sail the oceans. Veronica becomes Sasha's loyal ally, and together they form an unstoppable force, protecting their newfound kingdom and using their powers for the greater good."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the past, during papal coronations, the proto-deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the papal tiara. However, in 1978 Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony, and his three successors followed that example. As a result, the Cardinal protodeacon's privilege of crowning a new pope has effectively ceased although it could be revived if a future Pope were to restore a coronation ceremony. However, the proto-deacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration. “Acting in the place of the Roman Pontiff, he also confers the pallium upon metropolitan bishops or gives the pallium to their proxies.” The current cardinal proto-deacon is Renato Raffaele Martino.

Article: At the time, Comey was supervising an investigation into whether or not Trump campaign officials colluded with a Russian government effort to help Trump win the election. Trump later publicly acknowledged he had been thinking of the Russia investigation when he fired Comey. That prompted Comey to reveal that he had felt pressured by Trump to end the FBI’s investigation into ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russia, raising the question of whether the president had sought to obstruct justice.      “I think this now makes it pretty clear, if it wasn’t already the case, that Attorney General Sessions must be a subject of the Mueller investigation into possible obstruction of justice,” said Barrett. “He’s not a target, but he’s also not just a witness; it’s someone the government is now looking at for possible criminal activity.”      David Gomez, a senior fellow at George Washington University’s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security and a former FBI agent, echoed that assessment.      “Everything related to the Comey firing, particularly as it relates to Sessions, is now in question,” Gomez said. “If these are official intercepts I’m sure Mueller has already seen them.”      Officials told the Post that Kislyak informed his superiors of two conversations with Sessions in which campaign matters were discussed, the first of which took place in July 2016 on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention and the second of which took place in April at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington ahead of President Trump’s first major foreign policy speech.      The Post previously revealed in March that Sessions had spoken with Kislyak on two separate occasions during the campaign, citing the same July 2016 meeting and another private meeting on September 8. But Sessions has repeatedly claimed that the two never discussed campaign issues, and that he met with the Russian ambassador only “in an official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.” Before that, he claimed at his confirmation hearing in January that he “did not have communications with the Russians.”      In the wake of the The Post’s revelations in March, Sessions opted to recuse himself from the FBI’s Russia investigation—a decision that angered President Trump, a recent New York Times interview revealed. In his testimony before an open Senate hearing in June, Sessions again denied that he had discussed any campaign information with Russian officials. “Let me state this clearly: I have never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election,” he said. “Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.”      For the most part, Sessions declined to fully answer the questions posed to him at the hearing, often saying that he could “not recall” or did not have “any recollection” of an event. “I do not recall any conversations with any Russian official at the Mayflower Hotel,” he told the Senate Intelligence Committee. He later admitted that such a conversation was “conceivable,” though he didn’t remember it happening. ||||| Russia’s ambassador to Washington told his superiors in Moscow that he discussed campaign-related matters, including policy issues important to Moscow, with Jeff Sessions during the 2016 presidential race, contrary to public assertions by the embattled attorney general, according to current and former U.S. officials.      Ambassador Sergey Kislyak’s accounts of two conversations with Sessions — then a top foreign policy adviser to Republican candidate Donald Trump — were intercepted by U.S. spy agencies, which monitor the communications of senior Russian officials in the United States and in Russia. Sessions initially failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said that the meetings were not about the Trump campaign.      One U.S. official said that Sessions — who testified that he had no recollection of an April encounter — has provided “misleading” statements that are “contradicted by other evidence.” A former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had “substantive” discussions on matters including Trump’s positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for U.S.-Russia relations in a Trump administration.      Sessions has said repeatedly that he never discussed campaign-related issues with Russian officials and that it was only in his capacity as a U.S. senator that he met with Kislyak.      “I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign,” Sessions said in March when he announced that he would recuse himself from matters relating to the FBI probe of Russian interference in the election and any connections to the Trump campaign.      [Obama’s secret struggle to punish Russia for Putin’s election assault]      Current and former U.S. officials said that that assertion is at odds with Kislyak’s accounts of conversations in two encounters during the campaign, one in April ahead of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech and another in July on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention.      The apparent discrepancy could pose new problems for Sessions as his position in the administration appears increasingly tenuous.      Trump, in an interview this week, expressed frustration with Sessions’s recusing himself from the Russia probe and indicated regret at making the lawmaker from Alabama the nation’s top law enforcement officer. Trump also faulted Sessions as giving “bad answers” during his confirmation hearing about his Russia contacts during the campaign.      Officials emphasized that the information contradicting Sessions comes from U.S. intelligence on Kislyak’s communications with the Kremlin, and they acknowledged that the Russian ambassador could have mischaracterized or exaggerated the nature of his interactions.      “Obviously I cannot comment on the reliability of what anonymous sources describe in a wholly uncorroborated intelligence intercept that the Washington Post has not seen and that has not been provided to me,” said a Justice Department spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, in a statement. She reasserted that Sessions did not discuss interference in the election.      Russian and other foreign diplomats in Washington and elsewhere have been known, at times, to report false or misleading information to bolster their standing with their superiors or to confuse U.S. intelligence agencies.      But U.S. officials with regular access to Russian intelligence reports say Kislyak — whose tenure as ambassador to the United States ended recently — was known for accurately relaying details about his interactions with officials in Washington.      Sessions removed himself from direct involvement in the Russia investigation after it was revealed in The Washington Post that he had met with Kislyak at least twice in 2016, contacts he failed to disclose during his confirmation hearing in January.      “I did not have communications with the Russians,” Sessions said when asked whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign had communicated with representatives of the Russian government.      He has since maintained that he misunderstood the scope of the question and that his meetings with Kislyak were strictly in his capacity as a U.S. senator. In a March appearance on Fox television, Sessions said, “I don’t recall any discussion of the campaign in any significant way.”      Sessions appeared to narrow that assertion further in extensive testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June, saying that he “never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States.”      But when pressed for details during that hearing, Sessions qualified many of his answers by saying that he could “not recall” or did not have “any recollection.”      A former U.S. official who read the Kislyak reports said that the Russian ambassador reported speaking with Sessions about issues that were central to the campaign, including Trump’s positions on key policy matters of significance to Moscow.      Sessions had a third meeting with Kislyak in his Senate office in September. Officials declined to say whether U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted any Russian communications describing the third encounter.      As a result, the discrepancies center on two earlier Sessions-Kislyak conversations, including one that Sessions has acknowledged took place in July 2016 on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention.      By that point, Russian President Vladimir Putin had decided to embark on a secret campaign to help Trump win the White House by leaking damaging emails about Trump’s rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, according to U.S. intelligence agencies.      Although it remains unclear how involved Kislyak was in the covert Russian campaign to aid Trump, his superiors in Moscow were eager for updates about the candidate’s positions, particularly regarding U.S. sanctions on Russia and long-standing disputes with the Obama administration over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.      Kislyak also reported having a conversation with Sessions in April 2016 at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, where then-candidate Trump delivered his first major foreign policy address, according to the officials familiar with intelligence on Kislyak.      Sessions has said he does not remember any encounter with Kislyak at that event. In his June testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sessions said, “I do not recall any conversations with any Russian official at the Mayflower Hotel.”      Later in that hearing, Sessions said that “it’s conceivable that that occurred. I just don’t remember it.”      Kislyak also was a key figure in the departure of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was forced to leave that job after The Post revealed that he had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Kislyak even while telling others in the Trump administration that he had not done so.      In that case, however, Flynn’s phone conversations with Kislyak were intercepted by U.S. intelligence, providing irrefutable evidence. The intelligence on Sessions, by contrast, is based on Kislyak’s accounts and not corroborated by other sources.      Former FBI director James B. Comey fueled speculation about the possibility of a Sessions-Kislyak meeting at the Mayflower when he told the same Senate committee on June 8 that the FBI had information about Sessions that would have made it “problematic” for him to be involved in overseeing the Russia probe.      Comey would not provide details of what information the FBI had, except to say that he could discuss it only privately with the senators. Current and former officials said he appeared to be alluding to intelligence on Kislyak’s account of an encounter with Sessions at the Mayflower.      Senate Democrats later called on the FBI to investigate the event in April at the Mayflower hotel.      Sessions’s role in removing Comey as FBI director angered many at the bureau and set in motion events that led to the appointment of former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III as a special counsel overseeing the Russia probe.      Trump’s harsh words toward the attorney general fueled speculation this week that Sessions would be fired or would resign. So far, he has resisted resigning, saying that he intends to stay in the job “as long as that is appropriate.”      Matt Zapotosky and Julie Tate contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","output":"Russia’s ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak, discussed campaign-related matters with Jeff Sessions, now attorney general, twice during last year’s US election campaign, according to anonymous current and former U.S. officials cited by The Washington Post. Communications between Kislyak and Moscow, intercepted by U.S. intelligence, allegedly reveal that the two discussed “substantive” issues, including Trump’s standpoint on Russia and the potential for future relations between the two countries.  Sessions announced in March, after admitting contacts with Kislyak, that he would recuse himself on all matters linked to the Trump campaign."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1898 the RCM offered Holst a further year's scholarship, but he felt that he had learned as much as he could there and that it was time, as he put it, to \\"learn by doing\\". Some of his compositions were published and performed; the previous year The Times had praised his song \\"Light Leaves Whisper\\", \\"a moderately elaborate composition in six parts, treated with a good deal of expression and poetic feeling\\".Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst found that \\"man cannot live by composition alone\\"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 he was appointed first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the \\"White Viennese Band\\", conducted by Stanislas Wurm.Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for \\"the Worm\\" or any other light orchestra \\"a wicked and loathsome waste of time\\". Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted that some of the music was \\"trashy\\" but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: \\"To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely to the fact that he has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience.\\"With a modest income secured, Holst was able to marry Isobel; the ceremony was at Fulham Register...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? an element which is soft and reactive metal?","output":"The answer to the question, \\"an element which is soft and reactive metal,\\" could be any one of several alkali metals or alkali earth metals, as many of these share the traits of being soft and highly reactive. However, the most well-known example is likely Sodium (Na). Sodium belongs to the alkali metal group, which is the first group (Group 1) of the periodic table. These metals, in general, are soft and very reactive due to their propensity to lose one electron from their outermost shell in order to achieve a stable electron configuration. This one valence electron makes them highly reactive with other elements. Sodium is a soft, silvery-white metal that can be easily cut with a knife. It has a relatively low melting point at 97.8°C and a boiling point of 882.9°C. Sodium's atomic number is 11, and its atomic weight is 22.98977. When exposed to air, the metal rapidly oxidizes and forms a layer of sodium oxide (Na2O) on its surface, which appears as a dull tarnish. To prevent this oxidation, sodium is typically stored under an oxygen-free environment, such as a protective layer of mineral oil or sealed containers with an inert gas like argon. Due to its high reactivity, sodium forms compounds with a wide variety of other elements, particularly non-metals like halogens (e.g., sodium chloride, sodium bromide), oxygen (e.g., sodium oxide, sodium peroxide), sulfur (e.g., sodium sulfide), and many others. Sodium also forms alloys with other metals. Sodium's reactivity makes it an essential component in numerous industrial applications, such as the production of various chemicals, glass, ceramics, paper, and textiles industries. It is also commonly used in the form of sodium chloride (table salt) for food preservation and as a flavor enhancer, as well as playing an essential role in the human body's electrolyte balance. Aside from sodium, other alkali metals, such as lithium (Li), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and francium (Fr), and some of the alkali earth metals like calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) could also fit the description of a soft and reactive metal, albeit to varying degrees depending on the specific element. However, sodium is undoubtedly the most frequently referenced example of a soft and reactive metal due to its widespread use, availability, and familiarity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Roger Federer brought Flushing Meadows to its feet  by surviving a full frontal assault from mercurial Frenchman Gael Monfils to reach the semi-finals of the US Open. Federer fought off two match points in the fourth set before going on to win 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in three hours and a half hours against the No 20 seed, who could not quite find adequate composure when he had the Swiss master at his mercy. Sometimes swilling Coke at the changeovers, as is his habit, the coach-less Monfils could not convert two match points when he led 6-5 and had his opponent serving at 15-40 in the fourth set. He was reminded of the time-honoured lesson that you do not let Federer wriggle free without paying for it. At full stretch: Federer gets across the court to return to OPTIONS: - Coke - Croatia - Federer - Flushing Meadows - Frenchman - Gael Monfils - Marin Cilic - Monfils - Roger Federer - Swiss - US Open","output":"Roger Federer, the Swiss tennis maestro known for his incredible shot making and unwavering mental strength, demonstrated once again his astounding resilience by making a remarkable comeback against French powerhouse Gael Monfils in the quarterfinals of the US Open at Flushing Meadows. The electrifying match lasted for a grueling three and a half hours, further highlighting Federer's remarkable physical fitness and endurance at the highest level of the sport. The initial two sets saw Monfils displaying his exceptional tennis skills, cruising through with a score of 4-6 and 3-6, putting Federer firmly under pressure. Monfils, the No. 20 seed, known for his mercurial on-court presence and exuberant shot-making, looked set for a monumental win against the Swiss legend. Even as Monfils enjoyed sips of Coke during changeovers, a quirky habit of his, few would have expected the dramatic turn of events that awaited the Flushing Meadows crowd. With backs against the wall, Federer raised his level of play in the third set, clinching it 6-4 and signaling the beginning of a mesmerizing comeback. The fourth set saw Federer facing two match points while trailing 5-6 and serving at 15-40. However, his never-say-die spirit and exceptional shot-making skills saw Federer claw his way back and snatch the set from Monfils, ending it at 7-5. The decisive fifth set showcased Federer's mastery as he capitalized on the momentum he had gained in the previous sets. He overwhelmed Monfils and secured the set with a decisive 6-2 scoreline, securing his spot in the semi-finals. Monfils was left to ponder the missed opportunity of closing out the match and the age-old adage that one cannot afford to let a player of Federer's caliber escape without paying a hefty price. This extraordinary match at Flushing Meadows will forever be etched in the memories of tennis fans, as it showcased not just Federer's legendary talent and resolve, but also Gael Monfils' remarkable abilities. The final outcome revealed the punishing reality of professional tennis, where one must maintain composure and seize the crucial moments to emerge victorious against the very best, a lesson that both players and spectators will remember for years to come. In the end, though, it was Roger Federer who triumphed, moving on to face Marin Cilic of Croatia in the semi-finals of the US Open. This unforgettable battle serves as yet another testament to Federer's extraordinary legacy and the unwavering intensity that has characterized his illustrious career - a career that continues to inspire and captivate tennis enthusiasts across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Forest fires burn forests - The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide - Predators can now find their prey eaiser - Birds will fly away from the area - Waters warm up which hurts the fish swimming in them.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the summers are very dry happens, how will it affect a SMALLER negative effect on animals.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of very dry summers potentially has both direct and indirect effects on the process involving forest fires and their impact on animals. Step 1: Very dry summers increase the likelihood and intensity of forest fires - During very dry summers, the vegetation and trees become drier, making them more susceptible to forest fires. The fires may also be more intense and harder to control due to the lack of moisture.  Step 2: More forest fires lead to a greater loss of habitat - With an increase in forest fires during dry summers, the loss of habitat for animals becomes more significant. This amplifies the negative effect on animals living in the forest. Step 3: Loss of habitat results in fewer places to hide - The animals that rely on forests as their primary habitat will have fewer places to hide as more of the forest is burned. Step 4: Predators find prey more easily - With fewer places to hide, prey animals become more vulnerable, and predators can find them more easily. This further impacts the animal populations in the forest ecosystem. Step 5: Birds may disperse from the area - As habitat becomes scarcer due to forest fires, birds will likely fly away from the area. This can lead to a decline in local bird populations and may affect the overall ecosystem balance. Step 6: Waters are warmed from the fires, affecting fish - Forest fires can heat surrounding water sources, which can negatively affect fish and other aquatic life by creating an inhospitable environment. In conclusion, the perturbation of very dry summers can indirectly lead to a smaller negative effect on animals by increasing the likelihood and intensity of forest fires. This subsequently results in the loss of habitat, which affects the balance and relationships between different species in the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
