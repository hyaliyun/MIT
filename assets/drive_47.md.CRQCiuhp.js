Substitute back into the right-hand side fraction: [ frac{99x - 49^2 - 50^2}{(x-50) cdot (x-49)} ] 8. Equate the simplified forms of the left-hand side and right-hand side fractions: [ frac{99x - 49^2 - 50^2}{50 cdot 49} = frac{99x - 49^2 - 50^2}{(x-50) cdot (x-49)} ] 9. Cross multiply to eliminate fractions: [ (50 cdot 49) cdot (99x - 49^2 - 50^2) = (99x - 49^2 - 50^2) cdot (x-50) cdot (x-49) ] 10.

(1993 Canadian Mathematical Olympiad problem) 1. **Sufficiency:** Suppose 3 distinct terms ( x+i, x+j, x+k ) form an arithmetic progression, where (i < j < k). The condition for these terms to be in arithmetic progression is: [ (x+i)(x+k) = (x+j)^2 ] Expanding both sides, we have: [ x^2 + (i+k)x + i k = x^2 + 2jx + j^2 ] Canceling ( x^2 ) on both sides, we get: [ (i+k)x + i k = 2jx + j^2 ] Rearranging terms to isolate ( x ): [ (i+k-2j)x = j^2 - ik ] Therefore, we can solve for ( x ): [ x = frac{j^2 - ik}{i+k-2j} ] Since ( i+j+k > i+j+j > i+j ), it follows that ( i+k-2j neq 0 ).

Setting ( i = xq - x ) and ( j = xq^2 - x ), we have ( i < j ). Then the sequence ( x, x+i, x+j ) forms the terms of an arithmetic progression since: [ xq - x = x(q-1) ] and [ xq^2 - x = x(q^2-1) ] are distinct integers. Setting: [ x, xq, xq^2 ] forms the desired progression. 2. **Case 2:** If ( x = frac{n}{m} ), where ( n ) and ( m ) are coprime positive integers with ( m neq 1 ), we can show that the terms ( x, x+n, x+(m+2)n ) form an arithmetic progression. Computing explicitly, we express: [ x left(x + (m+2)nright) = frac{n}{m} left( frac{n}{m} + mn + 2n right) ] Simplifying the right-hand side: [ frac{n}{m} left( frac{n}{m} + mn + 2n right) = frac{n^2}{m^2} + n^2 + 2 frac{n^2}{m} = left( frac{n}{m} + n right)^2 ] Therefore: [ x left( x + (m+2)n right) = (x+n)^2 ] This proves our claim, as ( x, x+n, x+(m+2)n ) form an arithmetic progression.

We observe that: - The sum of (1) and (2) is (3), which is divisible by (3). - The sum of (1) and (3) is (4), which is divisible by (2). - The sum of (2) and (3) is (5), which is divisible by (1). In this set of three numbers, each number satisfies the condition that the sum of the other two is divisible by it. **Step 2: Extending the Example** We now add another number which is the sum of the initial three numbers: [ 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 ] Thus, our new set is ({1, 2, 3, 6}). We need to check if this new set of four numbers maintains the divisibility property: - Sum of any three numbers equals the total sum ((12)) minus the excluded number. This sum should be divisible by the excluded number. **Step 3: Generalizing the Process** We continue this process by always adding the sum of the current set. Consider a set of (k) numbers ( {a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k} } ) such that the sum of any (k-1) numbers is divisible by the remaining one. Define the sum of these (k) numbers as ( S_k = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k ). **Step 4: Constructing the Next Number** Extend the set to ({a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k}, S_k}). We verify that this new set satisfies the condition: - The sum of the (k+1) numbers is (S_k + S_k = 2S_k). - The sum of any (k) numbers from this set (excluding one number (a_i)) is (2S_k - a_i). By our initial assumption, (S_k) is divisible by each (a_i), thus (2S_k - a_i) is also divisible by (a_i). **Step 5: Building Up to 2005 Numbers** Starting with ({1, 2, 3}): [ {1, 2, 3} ] Calculate (S_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6): [ {1, 2, 3, 6} ] Next, (S_4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12): [ {1, 2, 3, 6, 12} ] Continue this process: - (S_5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 12 = 24) - (S_6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 48) - And so forth...

According to the problem, the fast horse takes x-3 days to deliver the document, and the slow horse takes x+1 days to deliver it. Given that the speed of the fast horse is twice that of the slow horse, we can set up an equation based on the relationship between speed, time, and distance. The distance to the city is 900 miles, which remains constant regardless of the horse used. The speed of the slow horse can be represented as frac{900}{x+1}, and the speed of the fast horse as frac{900}{x-3}. Since the speed of the fast horse is twice that of the slow horse, we can set up the equation as follows: [ frac{900}{x+1} times 2 = frac{900}{x-3} ] Multiplying both sides of the equation by (x+1)(x-3) to eliminate the denominators, we get: [ 900 times 2 = 900 times frac{(x+1)}{(x-3)} times (x-3) ] Simplifying, we find: [ 900(x+1) = 900(x-3) times 2 ] This equation matches choice B, which states: [ 900(x+1) = 900(x-3) times 2 ] Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{B}."},{"instruction":"The range of the function (y=1 dfrac{1}{{x}^{2}1} ) is ______________.","output":"**Analysis** This question examines the range of a function, paying attention to the domain of the function.

Since e^varepsilon > 1 (because varepsilon > 0), we have two cases to consider based on the sign of sin x and sin y: 1. **When sin x > 0 and sin y > 0:** In this case, since f(x) is increasing, and given that frac{sin x}{e^{x+varepsilon}} = frac{sin y}{e^y} with e^varepsilon > 1, it implies that x < y. Since cos x is decreasing in (0, frac{pi}{4}), we have cos x < cos y. 2. **When sin x < 0 and sin y < 0:** Similarly, since f(x) is increasing, and given the same equation with e^varepsilon > 1, it implies that x < y. Since cos x is increasing in left(-frac{pi}{4}, 0right), we have cos x < cos y. 3. **When sin x = sin y = 0:** This implies that x = y = 0, and therefore, cos x = cos y.

To ensure h(x) has two zeros, hleft(frac{1}{a+1}right) > 0 must hold, leading to: [ 2ln frac{1}{a+1} - (a+1)left(frac{1}{a+1}right)^2 - 2acdot frac{1}{a+1} + 1 > 0 ] Simplifying, we get 2ln(a+1) + frac{a}{a+1} < 0. Let k(x) = 2ln(x+1) + frac{x}{x+1}, with k'(x) > 0 for x > -1, indicating k(x) is increasing. Since k(0) = 0, the solution to the inequality is a in (-1,0). Thus, the range of real numbers for a is boxed{(-1,0)}. Part (3): Given -1 < a < 0, we aim to prove x_1 + x_2 > frac{2}{a+1}. Assuming 0 < x_1 < frac{1}{a+1} < x_2, we need to show x_1 > frac{2}{a+1} - x_2. Since h(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, frac{1}{a+1}), we consider m(x) = h(x) - hleft(frac{2}{a+1} - xright), with m'(x) > 0 for x > frac{1}{a+1}, indicating m(x) is increasing. Therefore, since m(x) > mleft(frac{1}{a+1}right), we conclude x_1 + x_2 > frac{2}{a+1}, thus proving the statement. So, the final conclusion is boxed{x_1 + x_2 > frac{2}{a+1}}."},{"instruction":"f (x+3)(x4)=20, find the sum of the possible values of x.","output":"Expanding the left side of the given equation, we get [ x^2 - 4x + 3x - 12 = 20 Rightarrow x^2 - x - 12 = 20 Rightarrow x^2 - x - 32 = 0 ] Here, the quadratic equation x^2 - x - 32 = 0 has the standard form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 with a = 1, b = -1, and c = -32.

Subtracting equation ② from ① gives 4a_n = a_{n}^{2} - a_{n-1}^{2} + 2a_{n} - 2a_{n-1}. Simplifying, we get a_{n}^{2} - a_{n-1}^{2} - 2(a_{n} + a_{n-1}) = 0, which can be factored as (a_{n} + a_{n-1})(a_{n} - a_{n-1} - 2) = 0. Since a_n + a_{n-1} > 0, we have a_{n} - a_{n-1} = 2 for n geq 2. Thus, the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic progression with the first term as 3 and common difference 2.

Subtracting the original summation from the multiplied one, we get T_{n} = -3 cdot 2^{1} - 2(2^{2} + 2^{3} + ldots + 2^{n}) + (2n+1) cdot 2^{n+1}. Recognizing that 2^{2} + 2^{3} + ldots + 2^{n} is a geometric series, the sum is 2^{2}(1-2^{n-1})/(1-2) = 2(2^{n}-2). Plugging this in, we get T_{n} = (2n+1) cdot 2^{n+1} - 6 - 4(2^{n}-2).

When n is divided by 2, the remainder is 1. This means n is an odd number, so it can be expressed as n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. 2. When n is divided by 7, the remainder is 5. This means n can be expressed as n = 7m + 5 for some integer m. We need to find the smallest n that satisfies both conditions. To do this, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or simply test numbers that satisfy the first condition (odd numbers) to see if they also satisfy the second condition. Starting with the smallest odd number that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 7, which is 5 itself, we can test subsequent odd numbers that are 7 units apart (since we want the remainder to be 5 when divided by 7). So we test 5, 12, 19, 26, 33, 40, etc., until we find one that is also odd (which means it leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2). The first such number is 19 (since 19 % 2 = 1 and 19 % 7 = 5).

Without loss of generality, take the diagonal AC as our diagonal in question. Let α, β, and γ be the angles that AC makes with the edges AB, AD, and AE, respectively. First, we notice that in the right triangle ABC, with AC as the hypotenuse, we have: cos alpha = frac{AB}{AC}. Similarly, in the right triangle ADE: cos beta = frac{AD}{AC}. And in the right triangle AEF: cos gamma = frac{AE}{AC}. Next, we use the fact that AC^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 + AE^2, which comes from the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. Substituting the values of cos alpha, cos beta, and cos gamma we get: AC^2 cos^2 alpha = AB^2, AC^2 cos^2 beta = AD^2, AC^2 cos^2 gamma = AE^2. Adding all these equations up, we get: AC^2 cos^2 alpha + AC^2 cos^2 beta + AC^2 cos^2 gamma = AB^2 + AD^2 + AE^2, which simplifies to: AC^2(cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma) = AC^2.

Thus, EA = EB = AB, making triangle EAB equilateral. 2. **Calculate angle AEB**: In an equilateral triangle, all angles are equal. Therefore, angle AEB = angle EAB = angle EBA = 60^circ. 3. **Analyze Line CD**: Line CD is a straight line passing through both centers A and B, hence it is the common chord of the two circles and also the line of centers. Therefore, angle EBD = 180^circ - angle AEB = 180^circ - 60^circ = 120^circ. 4. **Properties of triangle BED and triangle AEC**: Since BE = BD (radii of the same circle), triangle BED is isosceles. Thus, angle BED = angle BDE = frac{180^circ - angle EBD}{2} = frac{180^circ - 120^circ}{2} = 30^circ. Similarly, triangle AEC is isosceles with AE = AC, so angle AEC = angle ACE = 30^circ. 5. **Calculate angle CED**: angle CED = angle AEC + angle AEB + angle BED = 30^circ + 60^circ + 30^circ = 120^circ.

Here is a step-by-step solution: 1. **Rewrite the given equation**: [ 10x - 2xy - 2y + 1 = 0 ] 2. **Complete the square** to express the equation in standard form: Let's rewrite and rearrange the variables: [ 10x - 2xy - 2y + 1 = 0 ] Add and subtract necessary terms to complete the square: First, consider the quadratic form involving both ( x ) and ( y ): [ x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 6y - 2xy + 9 = x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 4y + 4 ] Upon simplifying, we get: [ x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 4y + 4 - 16 = 0 ] This reduces to the simplified distance form since: [ sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2} = |x - y + 3| ] 3. **Consider the distance ratio** form for the eccentricity of a conic section: For the given conic section, compare to the general conic section: [ frac{sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2}}{|x - y + 3|} = text{Constant} ] 4. **Evaluate the expression given**: Use the given identity for converting to the form of distance ratio: [ frac{sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2}}{frac{|x - y + 3|}{sqrt{2}}} = sqrt{2} ] Simplify to find the distance ratio: [ e = sqrt{2} ] This means the eccentricity ( e ) of the conic section represented by the equation ( 10x - 2xy - 2y + 1 = 0 ) is ( sqrt{2} ). # Conclusion: The eccentricity of the conic section is [boxed{sqrt{2}}]"},{"instruction":"Given that f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}. When x > 0, f(x) = x^2 4x. Represent the solution set of the inequality f(x) > x as an interval.","output":"Since f(x) is an odd function, we have f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. For x > 0, we are given that f(x) = x^2 - 4x. Let us first find the solution to f(x) > x in this domain. f(x) > x x^2 - 4x > x x^2 - 5x > 0 x(x - 5) > 0 The roots of the quadratic are x=0 and x=5. From the inequality, we deduce that the solution set for x > 0 is (5, +infty), since the function is positive when x is outside of the roots and x > 0. Now, considering the values when x < 0, we use the fact that f(x) is an odd function: f(-x) > -x -f(x) > -x (since f(-x) = -f(x) for an odd function) f(x) < x We use the already defined expression of f(x) for positive x, but as f(x) is an odd function, for x < 0, the function reflects symmetrically with respect to the origin. Therefore, the solution for x < 0 must be symmetric to the solution for x > 0 with respect to the y-axis. Hence, the solution set for x < 0 is (-infty, -5). Combining both conditions, the solution set for the inequality f(x) > x represented as an interval is: (-infty, -5) cup (5, +infty) However, considering the domain specified by the original function (f(x) = x^2 - 4x for x > 0) and that f(x) is an odd function, the solution (-infty, -5) must be modified because for -x > 0, we have -f(x) = -(-x)^2 + 4(-x), which does not satisfy the inequality f(x) < x. So, we need to solve the inequality f(x) < x for x < 0 explicitly. Let us reflect the function for x < 0: f(x) = -(x^2 - 4x) = -x^2 + 4x Now we solve for f(x) < x: -x^2 + 4x < x -x^2 + 3x < 0 x(-x + 3) < 0 Analysis of this inequality gives us two roots, x = 0 and x = 3. As we are looking for the negative x values where the function is less than zero, this happens between the roots. Thus, the solution set for x < 0 is (-3, 0). Combining the solutions for x > 0 and x < 0, the complete solution set for the inequality f(x) > x is: boxed{(-3, 0) cup (5, +infty)}"},{"instruction":"A town is trying to clear litter from its streets.

What is the ratio of the number of trash cans added to the back of stores to the number of trash cans added to the streets?","output":"The town has added 14 trash cans to the streets. In total, the town has paid for 42 trash cans. To find out how many trash cans were added to the back of stores, we subtract the number of trash cans on the streets from the total number of trash cans: 42 (total trash cans) - 14 (trash cans on the streets) = 28 (trash cans at the back of stores) Now, to find the ratio of the number of trash cans added to the back of stores to the number of trash cans added to the streets, we compare the two numbers: 28 (trash cans at the back of stores) : 14 (trash cans on the streets) To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 14: 28 ÷ 14 : 14 ÷ 14 This simplifies to: 2 : 1 So, the ratio of the number of trash cans added to the back of stores to the number of trash cans added to the streets is boxed{2:1} ."},{"instruction":"A baseball team played ten games, scoring 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 runs.

A) 55 B) 60 C) 65 D) 67 E) 70","output":"1. **Identify games where the team lost by two runs**: Since they can't score three times as many and still lose by two runs, these are games with even numbers, specifically the lower five evens of their scores. So, they lost by two runs in games where they scored 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 runs. 2. **Determine the opponent's scores in these games**: The opponents must have scored two runs more than the team: - Scored 2, opponent scored 4. - Scored 4, opponent scored 6. - Scored 6, opponent scored 8. - Scored 8, opponent scored 10. - Scored 10, opponent scored 12. 3. **Identify the games where the team scored three times as many runs as their opponents**: The remaining games are those where they scored 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 runs. Hence the opponents' scores would be a third of these: - Scored 12, opponent scored 4 (since 12 = 3 times 4). - Scored 14, opponent scored about 4.67 (approximately since 14 = 3 times 4.67). - Scored 16, opponent scored about 5.33. - Scored 18, opponent scored 6. - Scored 20, opponent scored 6.67. 4. **Calculate the total runs scored by the opponents**: Summing up all the opponent's scores: - From the games lost by two runs: 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = 40 - From games where they scored three times as many: 4 + 4.67 + 5.33 + 6 + 6.67 approx 26.67 Total opponent's score = 40 + 26.67 approx 66.67 Thus, the total runs scored by their opponents is 67.

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. First, we convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s to match the units of the bridge length: Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 90 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 90 * 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 90000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 25 m/s Now, we use the time taken to cross the bridge to calculate the total distance covered: Total distance = Speed * Time Total distance = 25 m/s * 9.679225661947045 s Total distance ≈ 241.9806415486761 m The total distance is the sum of the length of the train (L_train) and the length of the bridge (L_bridge): Total distance = L_train + L_bridge 241.9806415486761 m = L_train + 132 m Now, we can solve for the length of the train: L_train = Total distance - L_bridge L_train = 241.9806415486761 m - 132 m L_train ≈ 109.9806415486761 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{109.98} meters."},{"instruction":"Frank worked 8.0 hours over 4.0 days last week.

The function f(x) will not have any extremum if its derivative f'(x) does not change sign, which means f'(x) geq 0 for all x. To ensure this, the discriminant of the quadratic derivative must be non-positive. Thus we have to ensure that the discriminant Delta associated with f'(x) is leq 0 for the parabola to remain above the x-axis at all times. The discriminant Delta of f'(x) is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac, where a = 3, b = 6a, and c = 3(a+2) for the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. After substituting the coefficients into the discriminant formula, we get Delta = (6a)^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot 3(a+2) = 36a^2 - 36(a+2). For f'(x) geq 0 to hold, the discriminant Delta must be leq 0. Hence, 36a^2 - 36(a+2) leq 0. Simplifying this, we get 36a^2 - 36a - 72 leq 0, a^2 - a - 2 leq 0. Factoring the quadratic, we find (a+1)(a-2) leq 0.

On any segment connecting points of the same color, there are no points of that same color, but there is at least one point of a different color. What is the maximum possible number of all points?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given several points on a plane, each of which is colored either blue, yellow, or green. The condition provided states that on any line segment connecting monochromatic points, there are no points of the same color, but there is at least one point of a different color. We need to find the maximum possible number of such points. 2. **Example of a Valid Configuration**: The solution provides two examples with six points. These examples suggest configurations that meet the given conditions with clusters of points where no monochromatic segment contains points of the same color. 3. **Considering an Additional Point**: Suppose there are at least seven points. We now explore the possibility of finding three points of the same color. According to the problem's conditions, these three points do not lie on a single straight line but rather form a triangle. 4. **Forming a Triangle**: Let's consider a triangle ( triangle ABC ) with its vertices being blue (for instance). Since all three vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are blue, the conditions imply that no blue points exist within the interior of ( triangle ABC ). 5. **Introducing Non-Blue Points on Each Side**: On each side of ( triangle ABC ), there must be at least one non-blue point. Let's denote these points as ( A_1, B_1, ) and ( C_1 ) respectively: - ( A_1 ) lies on ( BC ) - ( B_1 ) lies on ( CA ) - ( C_1 ) lies on ( AB ) 6. **Coloring ( A_1, B_1, ) and ( C_1 )**: If all three points ( A_1, B_1, ) and ( C_1 ) are the same color (let's say yellow), it will lead to another monochromatic triangle with a smaller area as depicted in the conditions, which contradicts our assumption. Hence, they cannot all be yellow. 7. **Assign Colors to ( A_1, B_1, ) and ( C_1 )**: Without loss of generality, let: - ( A_1 ) and ( C_1 ) be yellow - ( B_1 ) be green 8. **Introducing Another Point on ( A_1C_1 )**: On the segment ( A_1C_1 ), there must be a non-yellow point, say ( B_2 ). Since ( B_2 ) cannot be blue (it introduces a possible contradiction), it must be green. 9. **Introducing Another Point on ( B_1B_2 )**: On the segment ( B_1B_2 ), there must be a non-green point, say ( X ). Since ( X ) cannot be blue either, it must be yellow. 10. **Finding a Smaller Monochromatic Triangle**: This leads to the creation of a new smaller triangle ( triangle A_1CX ) (( A_1 ), ( C ), and ( X )) with yellow vertices which violates the initial assumption. 11. **Conclusion**: Therefore, it's proven that no more than six points can exist under the given conditions without leading to a contradiction. Thus, the maximal configuration involves six points. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the sequence { sqrt {a_{n}}n}, it is an arithmetic sequence with a_{1}=9 and a_{2}=36.

According to the problem, if every child were present, each would receive 2 bananas. So we can write the equation: B = 2C (1) However, on that day, 160 children were absent, so the number of children present was C - 160. Because there were fewer children, each child got 2 extra bananas, making it 4 bananas per child. So we can write another equation: B = 4(C - 160) (2) Now we have two equations with two variables.

Since (DS) is a side of the equilateral triangle (BCD), (E) is equidistant from (D) and (S). - Since (DCS) is an isosceles triangle with (DC = DS), (angle CED = 90^circ). 4. **Use similarity and congruence:** - Since (triangle DHE sim triangle DCS), we have that (angle HED = angle CED = 90^circ). - Since (triangle CED) is a right triangle, (H) is the circumcenter of (triangle CED). Therefore, (DH = HC = HE). 5. **Analyze the angles:** - Since (SDA sim SEN), we have that (EN = frac{AD}{2} = DH = HE). - We need to find (angle HEN): [ angle HEN = angle HED + angle DEN = 15^circ + 180^circ - angle NES ] Since (angle NES = angle ADS) and (angle ADS = 90^circ - angle CDS), we have: [ angle HEN = 15^circ + 180^circ - (90^circ - 15^circ) = 15^circ + 180^circ - 75^circ = 120^circ ] 6. **Conclude the angle calculation:** - Thus, (angle NHE = angle HNE = 30^circ). - Therefore, (angle NHC = angle NHE + angle EHC = 30^circ + 30^circ = 60^circ).

We need to prove: [ frac{1}{1+2a} + frac{1}{1+2b} + frac{1}{1+2c} geq 1 ] given that (abc = 1). 1. **Substitution:** Use the substitutions ( a = frac{x}{y} ), ( b = frac{y}{z} ), and ( c = frac{z}{x} ). Note that these substitutions maintain the given condition since: [ left(frac{x}{y}right)left(frac{y}{z}right)left(frac{z}{x}right) = 1. ] Applying these substitutions to the original inequality: [ frac{1}{1+2a} = frac{1}{1+2left(frac{x}{y}right)} = frac{y}{y + 2x} ] [ frac{1}{1+2b} = frac{1}{1+2left(frac{y}{z}right)} = frac{z}{z + 2y} ] [ frac{1}{1+2c} = frac{1}{1+2left(frac{z}{x}right)} = frac{x}{x + 2z} ] Hence, the inequality transforms into: [ frac{y}{2x + y} + frac{z}{2y + z} + frac{x}{2z + x} geq 1 ] 2. **Using Nesbitt's Inequality:** We can employ Nesbitt's Inequality, which states that for any positive real numbers ( x, y, z ): [ frac{x}{y+z} + frac{y}{z+x} + frac{z}{x+y} geq frac{3}{2}. ] However, we need to manipulate our expression to match the form needed for Nesbitt’s Inequality.

Assume that the sum (sum_{n=1}^N left( frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{f(n)} right)) is bounded above by some constant (C) for infinitely many (N). That is, there exists a constant (C) such that: [ sum_{n=1}^N left( frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{f(n)} right) leq C ] for infinitely many (N). 2. We can rewrite the sum as: [ sum_{n=1}^N left( frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{f(n)} right) geq sum_{n=1}^N frac{1}{n} - sum_{n=1}^N frac{1}{f(n)} ] Using the fact that (sum_{n=1}^N frac{1}{n} approx log N) (by the Harmonic series approximation), we get: [ sum_{n=1}^N left( frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{f(n)} right) geq log N - sum_{n=1}^N frac{1}{f(n)} ] 3. Next, we consider the sum (sum_{n=1}^N frac{1}{f(n)}). Since (f) is a bijection, each positive integer appears exactly once as (f(n)). Let (k(N)) be the number of (n leq N) such that (f(n) leq N). Then: [ sum_{n=1}^N frac{1}{f(n)} leq sum_{n leq N, f(n) leq N} frac{1}{f(n)} + sum_{n leq N, f(n) > N} frac{1}{f(n)} ] The second sum is bounded by (sum_{n leq N} frac{1}{N+1} leq 1), since there are at most (N) terms and each term is at most (frac{1}{N+1}). Therefore: [ sum_{n=1}^N frac{1}{f(n)} leq sum_{n leq N, f(n) leq N} frac{1}{f(n)} + 1 ] 4. The sum of reciprocals of (k) distinct integers is at most (sum_{n=1}^k frac{1}{n}). Thus: [ sum_{n leq N, f(n) leq N} frac{1}{f(n)} leq sum_{n=1}^{k(N)} frac{1}{n} leq log k(N) + O(1) ] Combining these results, we get: [ sum_{n=1}^N left( frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{f(n)} right) geq log N - log k(N) - O(1) ] 5. Since the left-hand side is bounded by (C) for infinitely many (N), we conclude that: [ log N - log k(N) - O(1) leq C ] This implies: [ log frac{N}{k(N)} leq C + O(1) ] Therefore, there exists a constant (alpha > 0) such that (k(N) geq alpha N) for infinitely many (N). 6. Now, we use this inequality to prove that (sum frac{1}{n+f(n)}) diverges. Pick a sequence (N_1, N_2, dots) of natural numbers such that (k(N_i) geq alpha N_i) and (N_{i+1} geq frac{2}{alpha} N_i) for all (i). Set (N_0 = 0). 7. We claim that: [ sum_{N_{i-1} < n leq N_i} frac{1}{n+f(n)} geq frac{alpha}{4} ] for all (i > 0). Since (N_{i-1} leq frac{alpha}{2} N_i) and (k(N_i) geq alpha N_i), there are at least (frac{alpha}{2} N_i) numbers (n) in the range ((N_{i-1}, N_i]) for which (f(n) leq N_i). Thus: [ sum_{N_{i-1} < n leq N_i} frac{1}{n+f(n)} geq sum_{N_{i-1} < n leq N_i, f(n) leq N_i} frac{1}{n+f(n)} geq frac{alpha}{2} N_i cdot frac{1}{2N_i} = frac{alpha}{4} ] 8. Since the sum (sum_{N_{i-1} < n leq N_i} frac{1}{n+f(n)}) is bounded below by a positive constant for all (i > 0), the series (sum frac{1}{n+f(n)}) diverges.

We need to find the value of x+y. First, let's use the given magnitude of overrightarrow{a} to set up an equation: [|overrightarrow{a}|=sqrt{2^2+4^2+x^2}=6] Squaring both sides, we get: [4+16+x^2=36] [x^2+20=36] [x^2=16] Thus, we find that x=pm4.

We start with the information that when the band members line up in rows of 26, there are 4 left over. This can be represented by the congruence: [20n equiv 4 pmod{26}.] 2. To simplify this congruence, we divide both sides by 4. However, we must also divide 26 by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 26, which is 2. This simplifies the congruence to: [5n equiv 1 pmod{13}.] 3. We are looking for a multiple of 13 that is one less than a multiple of 5. Observing that 13 times 3 = 39 has a units digit of 9, we find that adding 1 to this product and dividing by 5 gives us 8. Therefore, the inverse of 5 modulo 13 is 8. Multiplying both sides of our congruence by 8 yields: [n equiv 8 pmod{13}.] 4. This means that n can be expressed as n = 8 + 13k for some integer k, under the condition that 20n < 1000. Rewriting this inequality in terms of n gives us: [n < 50.] 5. Substituting n = 8 + 13k into the inequality and solving for k gives: [8 + 13k < 50.] Subtracting 8 from both sides and then dividing by 13, we find: [k < frac{42}{13}.] The maximum integer value for k that satisfies this inequality is k = 3. 6.

In such a scenario, if we isolate a 2 times 2 sub-square containing the black cell, it forms our basis for understanding how row and column flipping affects the parity (evenness or oddness) of black cells. 2. **Parity Analysis**: - Consider flipping a row in the grid. Flipping a row changes the color of each cell in that row from black to white or vice versa. - Similarly, flipping a column changes the color of each cell in that column. This transformation changes the color of the cells within the selected column from black to white or vice versa. 3. **Preservation of Parity in Corners**: - Now look at the four corner cells of the 3 times 3 grid. Initially, one of these corner cells is black, and the rest are white. - Observe the effect of flipping any row or column on these corner cells: - Flipping a row could change the color of the two cells at the ends of that row. - Flipping a column could change the color of the two cells at the ends of that column. Whenever we flip a row or column, it impacts either zero or two corner cells simultaneously. Hence, any move made by flipping rows or columns will leave the number of black cells among the four corners even. 4. **Objective Impossibility**: - Suppose we want to achieve a grid where all cells are white. The intended target configuration would have zero black cells in total. - However, if at the start we have one black cell, flipping any row/column results in either maintaining the parity of the grid corners. - Each move preserves the even or odd nature of the number of black cells within the corners. Since one black cell (odd parity) cannot be transformed into zero black cells (even parity) by any sequence of row/column flips, we cannot reach the state where all cells are white. Therefore, starting from a single black cell (odd parity) in any corner, it is impossible to make the entire grid white through these operations. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{It is impossible to change all cells to white by flipping rows and columns.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Find the number of moles of Ammonium hydroxide formed on combining some moles of Ammonium chloride with 1 mole of Sodium hydroxide, if the reaction produces 1 mole of Ammonium hydroxide.

This polynomial is of degree 3 with integer coefficients and the leading coefficient is 1. We need to show that there are infinitely many such polynomials that satisfy the conditions ( P(p) = 2004 ) and ( P(q) = 0 ) for some prime ( p ) and integer ( q ) coprime to ( p ) and 2004. 2. **Evaluate the Polynomial at Specific Points:** - For ( x = a + 1 ), we have: [ P(a + 1) = ((a + 1 - a)^2 - 2) cdot (a + 1 - a - 1) = (1 - 2) cdot 0 = 0 ] Thus, ( P(a + 1) = 0 ). - For ( x = a + 13 ), we have: [ P(a + 13) = ((a + 13 - a)^2 - 2) cdot (a + 13 - a - 1) = (13^2 - 2) cdot 12 = 167 cdot 12 = 2004 ] Thus, ( P(a + 13) = 2004 ). 3. **Prime Number Conditions:** We need to show that there are infinitely many primes ( p = a + 13 ) such that ( q = p - 12 ) is coprime to 2004. Note that 2004 factors as ( 2004 = 2^2 cdot 3 cdot 167 ). 4. **Infinitely Many Primes of Specific Form:** We need to show that there are infinitely many primes of the form ( 2004k + 1 ). This is a well-known result from Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, which states that there are infinitely many primes in the form ( ak + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime.

Now, solve for the ( a_i )'s in descending order, starting with ( a_{k-1} ) and working downwards. By comparing the ( x^k )-coefficients on both sides of the equation, we clearly have ( a_{k-1} = 1 ). If ( a_{i+1}, cdots, a_{k-1} ) have been determined for some ( i ge 0 ), then ( a_i ) is uniquely determined by examining the ( x^{i+1} )-coefficients on both sides of the equation. Furthermore, we can see that ( a_i ) is integral. (blacksquare) 2.

Note that from the condition of the problem: [ na_n - a_{n-1} = n^k, quad forall n in mathbb{N}. ] From the equation ( xP(x) - P(x-1) = x^k + c ), we have: [ nP(n) - P(n-1) = n^k + c, quad forall n in mathbb{N}. ] Therefore, subtracting the two equations gives: [ nb_n - b_{n-1} = c, quad forall n in mathbb{N}. ] Let ( M = max(|b_0|, |c|) ). We claim now that this implies ( b_i in [-2M, 2M] ) for all ( i in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0} ). For ( i = 0, 1 ), this is immediate from the definition of ( M ). For ( i > 1 ), we can prove it easily by induction on ( i ). Hence, we've shown that the sequence ( {b_i} ) is bounded by ( 2M ) in absolute value. 4. Now, notice that for ( n > 3M ), we have: [ |b_n| = left|frac{b_{n-1} + c}{n}right| le left|frac{b_{n-1}}{n}right| + left|frac{c}{n}right| < frac{2M}{3M} + frac{M}{3M} = 1, ] and hence ( b_n = 0 ). Therefore, ( c = (3M+2)b_{3M+2} - b_{3M+1} = 0 ), as claimed. From here, it easily follows from downwards induction (with base case ( n = 3M+1 )) that ( b_n = 0 ) for all ( n in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0} ). This implies that ( P(n) - a_n = 0 Rightarrow a_n = P(n) ) for all ( n in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0} ). (blacksquare) 5. From the lemma, as ( c = 0 ), we know that: [ xP(x) - P(x-1) = x^k. ] 6.

Now, observe that ( P(x) - R(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)Q(x) ) for some ( Q in mathbb{Z}[x] ). In particular, observe that ( x^2 - x + 1 mid P(x) - R(x) ) and ( x^2 - x + 1 mid P(x-1) - R(x-1) ), since ( (x-1)^2 + (x-1) + 1 = x^2 - x + 1 ). Therefore, viewing the equation in modulo ( x^2 - x + 1 ), we obtain: [ xR(x) - R(x-1) equiv x^k. ] 7. Plugging the formula for ( R ) into the equation yields: [ ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx - a(x-1)^3 - b(x-1)^2 - c(x-1) - d equiv x^k. ] Noting that for ( i in mathbb{Z}_{ge 2} ), we have ( x^i equiv x^{i-1} - x^{i-2} ) and ( (x-1)^i equiv -(x-1)^{i-1} - (x-1)^{i-2} ), we have that: [ (c+d-a)x - (b+c) + (b-c)x + (c-a-d) equiv x^k, ] i.e. [ (b+d-a)x - (a+b+d) equiv x^k. ] 8. Observe that: [ 1 equiv 0 cdot x + 1, ] [ x equiv 1 cdot x + 0, ] [ x^3 equiv -1, ] and [ x^4 equiv (-1) cdot x + 0. ] So since ( b+d-a, a+b+d ) are either both 0 or both nonzero (since ( a, b, d in mathbb{Z} )), we cannot have ( k in {0, 1, 3, 4} ).

For these to be the sides of a triangle, they must satisfy: [ sqrt{a} + sqrt{b} > sqrt{c} ] 3. **Utilize the triangle inequalities**: Start with the known inequality: [ a + b > c ] 4. **Transform the inequality**: Consider the expression: [ (sqrt{a} + sqrt{b})^2 ] Expanding it, we get: [ (sqrt{a} + sqrt{b})^2 = a + b + 2sqrt{ab} ] Given (a + b > c), we thus have: [ a + b + 2sqrt{ab} > a + b > c ] Due to the transitive property of inequalities: [ (sqrt{a} + sqrt{b})^2 > c implies sqrt{a} + sqrt{b} > sqrt{c} ] Therefore, there exist sides (sqrt{a}), (sqrt{b}), and (sqrt{c}) that satisfy the triangle inequality, and hence they form a triangle. 5. **Evaluate the reverse assertion**: The reverse assertion claims that if (sqrt{a}), (sqrt{b}), (sqrt{c}) form a triangle, then (a, b, c) must also form a triangle. 6. **Counterexample**: Consider an isosceles right triangle with legs of length 1 (i.e., ( sqrt{2} ) is the hypotenuse such that (sqrt{a} = sqrt{b} = 1) and (sqrt{c} = sqrt{2})).

Assume (n geq 2) and (p geq 3). Given that ((p-1)^n + 1) is odd, it implies that (n) must be odd. Moreover, (n < 2p). Let (q) be the smallest prime factor of (n). Then (q mid (p-1)^n + 1), which implies that: (p-1)^n equiv -1 pmod{q}. Since ((q, p-1) = 1) and ((n, q-1) = 1), by Bézout's identity, there exist integers (u) and (v) such that: un + v(q-1) = 1. Then, applying Fermat's Little Theorem, we have: p-1 equiv (p-1)^{q-1} pmod{q}, which means that (p-1)^{un} equiv (p-1)^{u(q-1)} equiv (-1)^u pmod{q}. Since (q) is odd, (u) must be odd, and thus: p-1 equiv -1 pmod{q}, leading to: p equiv 0 pmod{q}, implying (p = q). Given that (n < 2p = 2q) and (q) is the smallest prime factor of (n), it follows that: n = p = q. Now, it remains to check whether ((p-1)^p + 1) is divisible by (p^{p-1}). Expanding ((p-1)^p) using the Binomial Theorem, we get: (p-1)^p = p^p - binom{p}{1} p^{p-1} + cdots + (-1)^p. Thus, (p-1)^p + 1 = p^p - binom{p}{1} p^{p-1} + cdots + (-1)^p + 1.

Attempting to color the regions accordingly: - For instance, assigning S_2 as blue and thereby S_3 cannot be red or blue, so S_3 would be yellow. - Proceeding similarly, if S_4 is colored blue (same as S_2), [ S_2 text{ (blue)}, quad S_3 text{ (yellow)}, quad S_4 text{ (blue)}, quad S_5 text{ (yellow)}, quad S_6 text{ (blue)}, quad S_7 text{ (yellow)} ] Then, S_8 will conflict with S_7 and S_1 regardless of chosen color (as red, blue, or yellow is already adjacent).

The total distance covered by each biker must be equal to the total distance they plan to travel, so we have the following equations: For the biker going to Boston: [ 2(0.8x) + 2(0.9x) + 2x = 840 ] [ 1.6x + 1.8x + 2x = 840 ] [ 5.4x = 840 ] [ x = frac{840}{5.4} ] [ x = 155.56 ] For the biker going to Atlanta: [ 0.8x + 0.9x + 4x = 440 ] [ 1.7x + 4x = 440 ] [ 5.7x = 440 ] [ x = frac{440}{5.7} ] [ x = 77.19 ] However, since they want to cover equal distances each day, we need to find the greatest number of miles a day each can bike considering these factors. The biker going to Atlanta has a lower daily mileage due to the shorter total distance and fewer days affected by terrain and weather. Therefore, the greatest number of miles a day each can bike, considering these factors, is determined by the biker going to Atlanta, which is 77.19 miles per day. To ensure they cover equal distances each day, the biker going to Boston should also plan to bike boxed{77.19} miles on their normal days.

Define a \\"fair mother\\" as one who votes for the best play. 2. Given that there are n dishonest mothers and n fair mothers, the problem requires finding the probability that the best play wins under the proposed voting scheme. 3. We need to compute the probability that among the jury of 2m people, consisting of randomly selected mothers from the 2n total, a certain number of them are dishonest. First, we find the probability of having exactly q dishonest mothers and 2m-q fair mothers in the jury of 2m people: [ P(Q = q) = frac{binom{n}{q} cdot binom{n}{2m - q}}{binom{2n}{2m}} ] 4. If this event happens, the outcome depends on the distribution of votes among the dishonest mothers. If t children of dishonest mothers participate in the worst play, then the worst play gets exactly t votes, while the remaining votes 2m - t will go to the best play. Therefore, the best play wins if: [ 2m - t > t implies t < m ] 5. We further compute the probability that the worst play receives exactly t votes given that there are q dishonest mothers: [ P(T = t | Q = q) = frac{binom{q}{t} cdot binom{2n - q}{n - t}}{binom{2n}{n}} ] 6. Combining the above, the probability that the best play wins given q dishonest mothers is the probability that t < m: [ P(text{Best play wins} | Q = q) = sum_{t=0}^{min(q, m-1)} P(T = t | Q = q) ] Thus: [ P(text{Best play wins} | Q = q) = sum_{t=0}^{min(q, m-1)} frac{binom{q}{t} cdot binom{2n - q}{n - t}}{binom{2n}{n}} ] 7. Finally, we sum over all possible values of q, weighted by their probabilities: [ P(text{Best play wins}) = sum_{q=0}^{2m} P(Q = q) cdot P(text{Best play wins} | Q = q) ] Substituting the probabilities derived, we get: [ P(text{Best play wins}) = frac{1}{binom{2n}{2m}} sum_{q=0}^{2m}left(binom{n}{q} cdot binom{n}{2m-q} cdot sum_{t=0}^{min(q, m-1)} frac{binom{q}{t} cdot binom{2n-q}{n-t}}{binom{2n}{n}}right) ] 8.

Let B H be the height of the isosceles trapezoid ABCD, and OP be the perpendicular dropped from the center O of the circle to the chord KL. Recall that K and L are the points where the circle touches the sides AB and CD, respectively. 2. Since the circle is inscribed within the trapezoid, its radius r = 3 is the distance from the center O to any point of tangency on the sides of the trapezoid. 3. By the problem's conditions, the area of trapezoid ABCD is given as 48. We know the formula for the area of a trapezoid is: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left( BC + AD right) h ] where h is the height of the trapezoid. Here, the height ( h = 2r = 2 times 3 = 6 ). 4. Substituting the values into the area formula: [ 48 = frac{1}{2} (BC + AD) times 6 ] Simplifying this equation, we get: [ 48 = 3 (BC + AD) ] [ BC + AD = frac{48}{3} = 16 ] 5. Since the trapezoid ABCD is isosceles and inscribed, it implies that AB + CD = 2AB. Therefore: [ BC + AD = 2AB ] So: [ 16 = 2AB ] [ AB = frac{16}{2} = 8 ] 6. Consider the perpendicular OP dropped from the center O to the chord KL. OP bisects KL, and we need to find the length KL. 7.

Therefore: [ PK = frac{3 times 6}{8} = frac{18}{8} = frac{9}{4} ] 9.

Therefore, the number of blue hats is ( 85 - 38 = 47 ) blue hats. The total cost of the green hats is ( 38 times 7 ) because each green hat costs 7. So, the total cost for the green hats is ( 38 times 7 = 266 ) dollars. The total cost of all the hats is 548, and we've already calculated the cost of the green hats, so the cost of the blue hats is ( 548 - 266 ). So, the total cost of the blue hats is ( 548 - 266 = 282 ) dollars.

This includes the length of the train itself and the length of the station. Total distance to be covered = Length of the train + Length of the station Total distance = 450 meters + 300 meters Total distance = 750 meters Now, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hour to m/second to match the units of distance. Speed in km/hour = 80 km/hour To convert km/hour to m/second, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hour = 1000 meters/3600 seconds Speed in m/second = 80 km/hour * (1000 meters/1 km) * (1 hour/3600 seconds) Speed in m/second = 80 * 1000/3600 Speed in m/second = 80000/3600 Speed in m/second = 22.22 m/second (approximately) Now we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the station using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 750 meters / 22.22 m/second Time ≈ 33.75 seconds So, it will take approximately boxed{33.75} seconds for the train to pass the station."},{"instruction":"A man is 24 years older than his son.

To understand its behavior, we find its derivative: [f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 1.] Analyzing f'(x), we can determine the intervals where f(x) is increasing or decreasing: - For f'(x) < 0, we have 0 < x < 1, indicating f(x) is decreasing in this interval. - For f'(x) > 0, we have x > 1, indicating f(x) is increasing in this interval. Since f(x) is decreasing for 0 < x < 1 and increasing for x > 1, and considering f(1) = 0, it follows that for any x > 0, f(x) leq f(1) = 0. This implies ln x leq x - 1 for all x > 0. Specifically, for x > 0 and x neq 1, we have ln x < x - 1. **Step 2: Compare a and b.** Given a = e^{0.11} and b = 1.1^{1.1}, we apply the inequality proven above: [1.1 ln 1.1 < 1.1 times (1.1 - 1) = 0.11.] Since a = e^{0.11}, and knowing that e^x is a strictly increasing function, we conclude that a > b. **Step 3: Compare b and c.** Define a function g(x) = (1 + x)^{1.1} - (1.1x + 1). We want to analyze g(x) for x = 0.1: [g(0.1) = 1.1[(1 + 0.1)^{0.1} - 1].] Since (1 + x)^{0.1} is monotonically increasing for x > 0, we have: [g(0.1) = 1.1^{1.1} - 1.11 > 0,] which implies b > c. **Conclusion:** Combining the results from Steps 2 and 3, we have established that a > b > c.

Next, using the formula for an arithmetic sequence, we can write a_5 = a_1 + 4d = -11 + 4d. Solving for the common difference d, we obtain d = 2. Now, we can express the n-th term of the sequence as a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d = -11 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 13. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}. Substituting our expressions for a_1 and a_n into this formula, we obtain S_n = frac{n(-11 + 2n - 13)}{2} = n^2 - 12n.

He sold 25 cans of soda at 2 each, so the total revenue from soda is 25 * 2 = 50. The total revenue from all sales is the sum of the revenues from pizzas, potato fries, and soda.

Specifically, the angles angle AXB, angle AXC, and angle BXC must all be equal since AX, BX, and CX divide triangle ABC into three similar triangles. - Therefore, angle AXB = angle AXC = angle BXC = 120^circ because: [ angle AXB > angle ACB ] and the total sum of angles around a point is 360^circ. 3. **Equilateral Triangle Condition**: - Since each of the resulting angles is 120^circ, the point X must be equidistant from vertices A, B, and C. - This implies that the triangle ABC must be equilateral to satisfy the condition: [ AX = BX = CX ] 4. **Dividing into Similar Triangles**: Next, consider dividing the equilateral triangle ABC further: - An equilateral triangle can now be repeatedly divided by lines passing through the vertices. For instance, cut it initially with one line passing through from one vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side, resulting in two smaller similar triangles. - This process can be repeated recursively for creating any required number of similar triangles. **Generalization**: - Let us start by cutting the triangle initially into two similar triangles by a line. Choose one of these triangles and cut it again into two more similar triangles. Since at each step the triangles created are similar to each other, this process can be repeated to create any number of similar triangles. 5. **Conclusion**: By induction or recursive cutting, starting from one equilateral or isosceles triangle and cutting further any number of times while preserving the similarity, we prove that any triangle can be subdivided into any number of similar triangles.

Each student can only go to one community, and each community must have at least one student. A and B cannot be in the same community. 2. **Calculating the Total Arrangements Without Restrictions**: - First, we calculate the total number of arrangements without considering the restriction on A and B. We choose 2 students to go to one community, the next 2 students automatically go to the other two communities. This is essentially choosing 2 students out of 4 and arranging them into 3 communities. - The number of ways to choose 2 students out of 4 is given by combinations: C_4^2. - The number of ways to arrange these students into 3 communities is given by permutations: A_3^3. - So, the total arrangements without restrictions are C_4^2 * A_3^3 = 6 * 6 = 36. 3. **Calculating the Arrangements Where A and B Are in the Same Community**: - If A and B must be in the same community, then we treat them as a single unit. This leaves us with 3 units (A&B, C, D) to be arranged in 3 communities. - The number of arrangements in this case is given by permutations: A_3^3 = 6. 4. **Calculating the Valid Arrangements**: - To find the total number of valid arrangements, we subtract the arrangements where A and B are in the same community from the total arrangements without restrictions. - The number of valid arrangements is 36 - 6 = 30. 5. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the total number of different arrangements where each student goes to one community, with at least one student assigned to each community, and A and B are not in the same community, is boxed{30}."},{"instruction":"Victor bought several boxes of books at a yard sale.

Similarly, consider A B < B C since each point A and B connect to their nearest points. 3. **Continuing the order**: Extending this reasoning, we have: [ A B < B C < C D < ldots < M N < N A ] Hence, we would have A B < N A. 4. **Contradiction**: This contradicts our initial assumption that each point connects to its nearest neighbor, implying A would have connected to B instead of N. Therefore, no closed polygons can be formed under these conditions, meaning our assumption must be wrong.

There are 12 lost and 15 broken, which makes a total of: 12 + 15 = 27 bowls For these 27 bowls, Travis has to pay 4 each, so: 27 * 4 = 108 Now, let's calculate the total amount Travis should be paid after deducting the cost of the lost and broken bowls: 1833 (payment for safely delivered bowls) - 108 (cost for lost and broken bowls) = 1725 However, we know that Travis should be paid 1825 in total. This means the initial fee the home goods store agreed to pay the moving company is the difference between what Travis should be paid and what he gets after delivering the bowls safely and paying for the lost and broken ones: 1825 (total payment) - 1725 (after deduction for lost and broken bowls) = 100 Therefore, the initial fee the home goods store agreed to pay the moving company is boxed{100} ."},{"instruction":"Arthur decided to treat himself to dinner at a nice restaurant to celebrate his recent promotion.

We need to cut out from a 3x3 square a shape that represents the net of a cube (the unfolded surface of a cube), each side of which has an edge length of 1. 1. We start with a square with sides of length 3 units. 2. Let's visualize the large square as a 3x3 grid, containing 9 smaller 1x1 squares. 3. To form a net of a cube: - A cube has 6 faces, each of which is a square. - Each face of the cube must be a part of this net to be connected correctly. 4. A typical net of a cube consists of a cross-like shape, made of 6 smaller squares: \`\`\` Layout Example: □□□ □■□ □□■ \`\`\` - ‘■’ represents positions of the smaller 1x1 squares. - Arrange 4 squares in a line and attach one square each to the second and third squares in that line. 5. This configuration can fit within a 3x3 square grid (since (2sqrt{2} < 3)). 6. We conclude that cutting out the shape in the provided configuration from the 3x3 square will result in a net of a cube. Therefore, the required shape is feasible. # Conclusion boxed{} 2: We need to find the sum of vectors that are derived from a given convex ( n )-gon when projected from an internal point ( O ) and scaled by half the length of their respective sides. 1. Let's analyze the problem geometrically. 2. From point ( O ), perpendiculars are dropped onto each side of the ( n )-gon (or extended sides). - At every perpendicular, construct a vector pointing from ( O ) to the side. - The length of this vector is half the length of the side it is projected onto. 3. Rotate these vectors ( 90^{circ} ) and scale them by 2: - Doing so transforms each vector into one along the direction of the side it is perpendicular to, scaled by the length of the side (this is due to geometry and properties of polygons). 4. The resultant vectors replicate the sides of the polygon, effectively ‘walking’ around the perimeter. 5. Summing the sides of a polygon geometrically always returns to the start, therefore: [ sum text{(Vectors of polygon sides)} = overrightarrow{0} ] 6.

Translating this to our tangent line, where (x_1, y_1) corresponds to (x, f(x)) and m = f'(x), we get: y - f(x) = f'(x)(x - x) Simplifying, we see that the term f'(x)(x - x) equals zero because any number times zero is zero: y - f(x) = 0 Thus, the equation of the tangent line simply becomes: y = f(x) However, the conventional representation of the tangent line's equation at point x would incorporate the derivative, which can be reintroduced like this: y = f(x) + f'(x)(x - x) which simplifies to the aforementioned y = f(x).

Then, the set S = {f^k(n)} must be finite. By assumption, for all m, f^{f(n)}(m) is within N of some element of S, and there are only finitely many such numbers.

Thus, if there were 2N+2 distinct chains, two chains would meet in this set, which would imply they were the same chain, which is a contradiction. Thus, there are at most 2N+1 chains. blacksquare 4. **Lemma 4: There is only one chain, and it only extends infinitely in one direction.** *Proof*: Fix some integer c. I claim that all but finitely many numbers are ahead of c in its chain (are of the form f^k(c) with k geq 1). Call a number *bad* if it is not of this form. Note that as n varies, f^{f(c)}(n) achieves all sufficiently large integers, since there are only finitely many chains. Thus, if A, B are sufficiently large integers, every value in [A, B] is achieved as f^{f(c)}(n). But then f^{f(n)}(c) in [A-N, B+N] for all such n, and these values are all distinct, since f^{f(n)}(c) = f^{f(m)}(c) implies f(n) = f(m) implies n = m. Thus, for all sufficiently large A, B, the interval [A-N, B+N] contains at least B-A+1 numbers of the form f^{f(n)}(c), so there are at most 2N bad numbers in this interval. But if there were infinitely many bad numbers, then for some large A, B, [A-N, B+N] would contain at least 2N+1 such numbers, which is a contradiction. Thus, there are only finitely many bad numbers. Now, if there were at least 2 chains, the chain without c would have infinitely many bad numbers. Similarly, if the chain with c extended infinitely in both directions, then there would also be infinitely many bad numbers (every number of the form f^{-k}(c)). Thus, there is exactly one chain and it only extends infinitely in one direction. blacksquare 5. **Lemma 5: For all M, there exists an integer x with g(x) leq x - M.** *Proof*: Assume not, so g(x) - x is bounded below. But g(x) - x is injective by above (assuming x geq 1), so for any K, there exists B such that g(x) - x geq K for all x geq B. But then {g(B+1), g(B+2), dots} subseteq [B+K, infty), while {g(0), dots, g(B)} only achieves B+1 values. Thus, at least K-1 values are not achieved by g, which is a contradiction. Thus, g(x) - x is not bounded below. blacksquare Now pick B such that g(B) + N leq B. By setting b = B - g(a+1), we get: [ |g(B) - g(g(B+1-g(a+1)) + a)| leq N ] for all a with g(a+1) leq B. Let t = max{g^{-1}(g(B)-N), g^{-1}(g(B)-N+1), dots, g^{-1}(g(B)+N)}. Note that g(t) leq g(B) + N leq B and t geq 1, so setting a = t-1, we have g(a+1) leq B, so we can plug in a to get: [ |g(B) - g(t-1 + g(B+1-g(t)))| leq N ] Thus, t-1 + g(B+1-g(t)) in {g^{-1}(g(B)-N), dots, g^{-1}(g(B)+N)}. But t was the maximum such element, which means g(B+1-g(t)) = 1, or B+1-g(t) = g^{-1}(1). Since |g(t) - g(B)| leq N, we have |(B-g(B)) + 1 - g^{-1}(1)| leq N. Thus, there are only finitely many values for B - g(B). But there are infinitely many B with g(B) + N leq B by Lemma 5, which is a contradiction since g(x) - x is injective. Thus, our original assumption was wrong, so |f^{f(n)}(m) - f^{f(m)}(n)| must be unbounded. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, angle C = 90^circ and AB = 10.

Remember to include a 15% tip for the driver.","output":"First, let's calculate the cost of the distance traveled. The first 1/5 of a mile costs 2.50. Since the ride was 8 miles long, we need to calculate the cost for the remaining distance after the first 1/5 mile. 8 miles = 40/5 miles (since there are 5 fifths in a mile) The cost for the first 1/5 mile is already covered, so we need to calculate the cost for the remaining 39/5 miles. Each additional 1/5 mile costs 0.40, so for 39/5 miles, the cost would be: 39/5 * 0.40 = 7.80 Now, let's add the initial 2.50 for the first 1/5 mile: 7.80 + 2.50 = 10.30 Next, we calculate the waiting time cost: 12 minutes * 0.25/minute = 3.00 Now, let's calculate the cost of traffic delays: 25 minutes * 0.15/minute = 3.75 The toll fee is a flat rate: 3.00 Now, let's sum up all the costs so far: Distance cost: 10.30 Waiting time cost: 3.00 Traffic delay cost: 3.75 Toll fee: 3.00 Total cost before discounts and surge pricing: 10.30 + 3.00 + 3.75 + 3.00 = 20.05 Since the ride took place during non-peak hours and the passenger is a senior citizen, they are eligible for a 10% discount.

Finally, we need to calculate the 15% tip for the driver: 15% of 18.05 = 0.15 * 18.05 = 2.7075 Again, rounding to the nearest cent, the tip would be 2.71.

Two cells are considered \\"adjacent\\" if they share a common edge. We are to find the minimum possible value of (g), the maximum difference between the numbers in any two adjacent cells. 1. Let's denote the cell at row (i) and column (j) by (A(i, j)), and the number in cell (A(i, j)) by (a_{ij}). 2. We first prove that no matter how the numbers are placed, there must exist two adjacent cells with a difference of at least (n). - Suppose that in any two adjacent cells, the difference between the numbers is at most (n-1). - Consider the maximum numbers in each row and column. Let (a_{pq}) be the smallest of these (2n) maximum numbers, and assume (a_{pq}) is the largest number in row (p). 3. For any column (j in {1, 2, ldots, n}), let (a_{ij}) be the maximum number in column (j). Then we have: [ a_{pj} leq a_{pq} leq a_{ij} ] Since the difference between any two adjacent cells' numbers is at most (n-1), in moving from (A(p, j)) to (A(i, j)) vertically along the column, there must be a number within the set: [ S = {a_{pq}, a_{pq} + 1, ldots, a_{pq} + n - 1} ] Since (|S| = n - 1), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one number in (S) that appears in more than one column, implying a contradiction, since each number should appear exactly once in the grid. Thus, our assumption that the difference between any two adjacent cells is at most (n-1) is invalid. Therefore, the smallest value that (g) can take is at least (n). 4. Secondly, we can arrange the numbers in such a way that (g = n): - Set (a_{ij} = n(i-1) + j) for (1 leq i, j leq n).

We are given that after hiring the additional male workers, the total number of employees is 264. Therefore, we can write: E + M = 264 We also know that the number of female workers remained the same before and after hiring the additional male workers, so we can set the two expressions for the number of female workers equal to each other: 0.60E = 0.55(E + M) Now we have a system of two equations: 1) E + M = 264 2) 0.60E = 0.55(E + M) Let's solve the second equation for E: 0.60E = 0.55E + 0.55M 0.60E - 0.55E = 0.55M 0.05E = 0.55M Now, let's divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for E: E = (0.55M) / 0.05 E = 11M Now we can substitute E = 11M into the first equation: 11M + M = 264 12M = 264 Divide both sides by 12 to solve for M: M = 264 / 12 M = 22 So, the company hired boxed{22} additional male workers."},{"instruction":"Given a convex polyhedron F .

It appears that the number of nice colourings is not divisible by 5 . Prove that there is a nice colouring, in which some three consecutive edges from A are coloured the same way. *D. Karpov*","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** - We have a convex polyhedron ( F ) with a vertex ( A ) of degree 5, and all other vertices have degree 3. - A \\"nice\\" coloring of the edges is defined such that for any vertex except ( A ), all three edges incident to it have different colors. - We need to prove that there exists a nice coloring where some three consecutive edges from ( A ) are colored the same way, given that the number of nice colorings is not divisible by 5. 2. **Initial Observations:** - Since ( A ) has degree 5, it is connected to 5 other vertices. - Each of these 5 edges can be colored in one of three colors, say 1, 2, and 3. - For any vertex other than ( A ), the three incident edges must all be different colors. 3. **Roads and Cycles:** - Consider starting from ( A ) and following a sequence of edges, alternating between two colors. For example, starting with an edge colored 1, we can follow a sequence like 1, 2, 1, 2, etc. - This sequence must eventually return to ( A ) because the polyhedron is finite and connected. 4. **Counting Roads:** - From each of the 5 edges incident to ( A ), there are two possible alternating sequences (e.g., 1-2 and 1-3 for an edge colored 1). - Since there are 5 edges, there are a total of 10 such sequences. - Each sequence must appear an even number of times because they must pair up to form closed loops. 5. **Contradiction Argument:** - Suppose no three consecutive edges from ( A ) are colored the same. - Consider the possible colorings of the 5 edges incident to ( A ). There are 5 cases to consider: 1. ( 1, 1, 2, 1, 3 ) 2. ( 1, 2, 1, 3, 1 ) 3. ( 1, 2, 1, 1, 3 ) 4. ( 2, 1, 3, 1, 1 ) 5. ( 2, 1, 1, 3, 1 ) 6. **Switching Colors:** - In any alternating sequence (e.g., 1-3), we can switch the two colors (e.g., 1, 3, 1, 3 becomes 3, 1, 3, 1) and still maintain a nice coloring. - This switching shows that each road uniquely connects two edges unless it results in three consecutive edges being the same color. 7. **Equal Distribution of Cases:** - If we assume that one of the cases appears more frequently than the others, we can use the switching argument to generate all other cases from it. - This implies that all 5 cases must appear the same number of times, leading to the conclusion that the number of nice colorings is divisible by 5. 8. **Contradiction:** - Given that the number of nice colorings is not divisible by 5, our assumption that no three consecutive edges from ( A ) are colored the same must be false. 9. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, there must exist a nice coloring where some three consecutive edges from ( A ) are colored the same way.

The number of ways to choose 3 numbers out of 3n for the first column is binom{3n}{3}. For the second column, we choose 3 numbers out of the remaining 3n-3 numbers, which is binom{3n-3}{3}, and so on. This process continues until we have chosen all n columns. The product of these binomial coefficients is: [ binom{3n}{3} binom{3n-3}{3} cdots binom{3}{3} ] 3. **Arranging Each Column:** Within each column, the 3 numbers must be in ascending order. There is only 1 way to arrange 3 numbers in ascending order. Therefore, for each column, there is only 1 way to arrange the numbers. 4. **Arranging Columns:** The n columns themselves can be arranged in any order. Since the order of the columns matters, we need to divide by n! to account for the different permutations of the columns. 5. **Combining the Factors:** Combining all these factors, we get the total number of tidy 3n-tables as: [ frac{(3n)!}{3!^n cdot n!} ] Here, 3!^n accounts for the fact that within each column, the 3 numbers can be arranged in 3! ways, but only 1 of these ways is valid (ascending order).

The circles are also not distinguishable from one another. 2. **Calculate the number of ways to partition 5 children into two non-empty groups:** - Here, we use the principle known as the Stirling number of the second kind, which counts the number of ways to partition a set of ( n ) objects into ( k ) non-empty subsets. - For 5 children into 2 non-empty groups, we use: [ S(5, 2) = text{Stirling number of the second kind} ] 3. **Compute ( S(5, 2) ):** - Using the recursive formula for Stirling numbers: [ S(n, k) = k cdot S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1) ] - We calculate: [ S(5, 2) = 2 cdot S(4, 2) + S(4, 1) ] - Compute ( S(4, 2) ): [ S(4, 2) = 2 cdot S(3, 2) + S(3, 1) ] - Continue computing these Stirling numbers: [ S(3, 2) = 2 cdot S(2, 2) + S(2, 1) = 2 times 1 + 1 = 3 ] [ S(2, 2) = 1, quad S(2, 1) = 1 ] [ S(4, 1) = 1 ] [ S(3, 1) = 1 ] 4. **Finalize the recursive computations:** [ S(4, 2) = 2 cdot 3 + 1 = 7 ] [ S(5, 2) = 2 cdot 7 + 1 = 15 ] 5. **Count the arrangements within each circle:** - Within each circle, cyclic permutations of the same group are equivalent, so each group of ( k ) children can be arranged in ( (k-1)! ) ways. - We sum the products of ways to divide the children and the distinct arrangements: [ sum_{k=1}^{4} left( binom{5}{k} cdot (k-1)! cdot (5-k-1)! right) ] 6. **Account for the indistinguishability of the circles:** - Each partition is counted twice (since circles can be swapped), so we divide by 2: [ frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{4} left( binom{5}{k} cdot (k-1)! cdot (5-k-1)! right) ] 7. **Calculate the exact number of ways:** [ frac{1}{2} left( binom{5}{1} cdot 0! cdot 3! + binom{5}{2} cdot 1! cdot 2! + binom{5}{3} cdot 2! cdot 1! + binom{5}{4} cdot 3! cdot 0! right) ] - Compute binomial coefficients and the factorial products: [ frac{1}{2} left( 5 cdot 1 cdot 6 + 10 cdot 1 cdot 2 + 10 cdot 2 cdot 1 + 5 cdot 6 cdot 1 right) ] - Simplify: [ frac{1}{2} left( 30 + 20 + 20 + 30 right) = frac{1}{2} cdot 100 = 50 ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{50} ]"},{"instruction":"Two fair 8sided dice are rolled.

Construct a tangent line OB to circle C, touching it at point B (chosen to be in the third quadrant). If the angle between line OB and the x-axis is α, then frac{y}{x}=tan(α)=frac{AB}{BO}. Considering that |AO|=|-2|=2 and AB=1, the triangle AOB is a right-angled triangle, so we can find the length BO=sqrt{AO^2-AB^2}=sqrt{2^2-1^2}=sqrt{3}. Therefore, frac{y}{x}=tan(α)=frac{AB}{BO}=frac{1}{sqrt{3}}=frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. Consequently, the angle α=frac{pi}{6}.

Recognize that quadrilateral ( CHKM ) forms a rectangle, since ( CH ) is perpendicular to ( AB ) and tangent lines to a circle from a given point are perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. 3. **Establishing Equal Lengths**: The height ( CN ) of quadrilateral ( CHKM ) is equal to the diameter of the circle. Thus, it suffices to show that ( CN = OK ) because if this equality holds, ( N ) must bisect ( CH ). 4. **Bisector Confirmation**: Since ( CO ) is the bisector of angle ( C ) in the isosceles triangle ( LCM ) (having ( CL = CM )), we also know that ( CO ) is perpendicular to ( LM ). Additionally, line ( KL ) is perpendicular to ( LM ), reinforcing that (angle CLO = 90^circ ) and (angle KLO = 90^circ ).

For example, the unit digit of powers of 3 cycles through 3, 9, 7, 1, and then repeats. Given that the sum of factorials from 1! to 63! will have a unit digit of 0, the same applies to the sum from 1! to 18! and from 1! to 37!. This means that each term in the expression is being raised to a power with a unit digit of 0. So, we have: - 63^0, which has a unit digit of 1 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) - 18^0, which also has a unit digit of 1 - 37^0, which again has a unit digit of 1 Adding these up, we get 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Notice that ( 2009 = 7 times 287 ). 2. Define ( y_{i} = frac{x_{i}}{7} ) for ( i=1,2, cdots, n ). Then ( y_{i} = pm 1 ). 3. We have the following equations based on the given conditions: [ begin{aligned} y_{1} + y_{2} + cdots + y_{n} & = 0, y_{1} + 2y_{2} + cdots + ny_{n} & = 287. end{aligned} ] 4. From the first equation, ( y_{1} + y_{2} + cdots + y_{n} = 0 ), we know that the number of ( 1 )'s and ( -1 )'s must be equal since each ( y_i ) is either ( 1 ) or ( -1 ). Therefore, ( n ) is even. 5. Assume ( n = 2k ). In this case, there are ( k ) ones and ( k ) minus ones among ( y_1, y_2, ldots, y_n ). 6. Using the second equation ( y_{1} + 2y_{2} + cdots + ny_{n} = 287 ), we can split the sum into two parts: the sum of indices with ( y_i = 1 ) and the sum of indices with ( y_i = -1 ). [ 287 = sum_{i text{ with } y_i = 1} i - sum_{i text{ with } y_i = -1} i ] 7. The maximum possible sum for the indices of ( k ) ones can be written as: [ 2k + (2k-1) + cdots + (k+1) ] 8. The corresponding indices for ( k ) minus ones can be written as: [ k + (k-1) + cdots + 2 + 1 ] 9. Therefore, we get: [ sum_{i text{ with } y_i = 1} i = 2k + (2k-1) + cdots + (k+1) = frac{(2k+(k+1))(k/2)}{2} = k^2 + frac{k}{2} ] 10. And: [ sum_{i text{ with } y_i = -1} i = k + (k-1) + cdots + 1 = frac{k(k+1)}{2} ] 11. Hence, the inequality: [ 287 leq k^2 ] 12. Solving ( k^2 geq 287 ): [ k geq sqrt{287} approx 16.9 ] So the smallest integer ( k ) is 17. 13. Hence, ( n = 2k = 34 ). Conclusion: When ( n = 34 ), we can set ( y_1 = y_2 = cdots = y_{16} = y_{18} = -1 ) and ( y_{17} = y_{19}= y_{20} = cdots = y_{34} = 1 ). This configuration satisfies both the conditions: 1. ( y_{1} + y_{2} + cdots + y_{34} = 0 ). 2. ( y_{1} + 2y_{2} + cdots + 34y_{34} = 287 ).

Hence, for proposition P to be true, the range of values for a must satisfy: 4a^2 - 16 < 0, Solving this inequality, we get: a^2 - 4 < 0, (a - 2)(a + 2) < 0, From which it follows that -2 < a < 2.

This construction works because: - ( A ) contains 1 element, - ( B ) contains ( k ) elements, - ( A + B ) contains ( k + 1 ) elements, - Together, they cover all ( 2k + 1 ) residues modulo ( n ) without overlap. 4. **Doubling ( n ):** If we have a construction for ( n ), we can extend it to ( 2n ) by: - ( widetilde{A} = A cup (A + n) ), - ( widetilde{B} = B cup (B + n) ). This works because: - ( widetilde{A} ) and ( widetilde{B} ) are disjoint, - ( widetilde{A} + widetilde{B} ) covers the remaining residues modulo ( 2n ). 5. **Special Case ( n = 8 ):** For ( n = 8 ), we can take: - ( A = {1, 2} ), - ( B = {3, 6} ), - Then ( A + B = {4, 5, 7, 0} ).

To determine the number of possible values for ( a_1 ) that can represent ( m leq N ), we note that ( a_1 ) must satisfy ( a_1^{n^2} leq N ).

Similarly, the number of possible values for ( a_2 ) is approximately ( N^{frac{1}{(n+1)^2}} ), and so on.

Given that the simple interest (SI) is 600 and the compound interest (CI) is 609, with the rate of interest being 3% (or 0.03 in decimal form). The formula for simple interest is: SI = P * r * n The formula for compound interest is: CI = P * (1 + r)^n - P We know that SI is 600, so we can write: 600 = P * 0.03 * n [Equation 1] We also know that CI is 609, so we can write: 609 = P * (1 + 0.03)^n - P [Equation 2] From Equation 1, we can solve for P * n: P * n = 600 / 0.03 P * n = 20000 [Equation 3] Now, let's use Equation 2 and substitute P * n from Equation 3: 609 = P * (1.03)^n - P 609 = (20000 / n) * (1.03)^n - (20000 / n) We can simplify this by multiplying both sides by n: 609 * n = 20000 * (1.03)^n - 20000 Now, we need to find the value of n that satisfies this equation. Since the difference between the compound interest and the simple interest is small (609 - 600 = 9), we can infer that the time period is likely to be short because compound interest diverges more from simple interest over longer periods. Let's try n = 1: 609 * 1 = 20000 * (1.03)^1 - 20000 609 = 20000 * 1.03 - 20000 609 = 20600 - 20000 609 = 600 This does not satisfy the equation since we are looking for a CI of 609, not 600.

Do we get more 1s than 2s?","output":"Given the problem, we need to determine whether there are more 1s than 2s when reducing each of the first billion natural numbers (1 through 10^9) to a single digit by repeatedly taking their digit sum. Here's the step-by-step solution: 1. **Understanding Digit Sum Reduction**: The process of reducing a number to a single digit by repeatedly taking its digit sum is effectively the same as computing that number's remainder when divided by 9. This is because of a property in number theory where the sum of the digits of a number has the same remainder when divided by 9 as the original number. 2. **Formulating the Problem**: We need to classify each number ( n ) such that ( 1 leq n leq 10^9 ) based on the remainders when divided by 9. These remainders can be 1 through 9 since a single-digit sum is always between 1 and 9. 3. **Analyzing Numbers from 1 to ( 10^9-1 )**: Considering the range from 1 to ( 10^9-1 ) (i.e., 999,999,999 numbers): - Every complete cycle of 9 consecutive numbers (e.g., ( 9k+1, 9k+2, ..., 9k+9 )) contains exactly one number for each possible remainder from 1 to 9. - There are ( 10^9 - 1 = 999,999,999 ) numbers in total. - The count of numbers for each remainder from 1 to 9 in the sequence ( 1, 2, ..., 999,999,999 ) is equal ((99,999,999 text{ numbers each})): leftlfloor frac{999,999,999}{9} rightrfloor = 111,111,111 , text{times for each remainder} 4. **Including the Number ( 10^9 )**: - Now include (10^9), which is the billionth number. - The number (10^9) can be represented as ( 999,999,999 + 1 = 10^9). - Observe the single-digit sum of (10^9), which is (10): [ 10^9 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 ] 5. **Combining the Results and Conclusion**: - Originally, from numbers 1 to ( 999,999,999 ) there were equal counts of each digit from 1 to 9. - Including the number (10^9), which reduces to 1, we add one more to the count of 1s. - Therefore, there is exactly one more '1' than '2' among the first billion natural numbers.

(Answer with a number)","output":"To solve this problem, we first consider the scenario where A and B are assigned to different posts. There are 4 options for A, and after A is assigned, there are 3 remaining options for B. Thus, there are 4 times 3 = 12 ways to assign A and B to different posts. Next, we need to distribute the remaining 3 volunteers to the 4 posts. Since each post must be staffed by at least one volunteer, and A and B are already assigned to two of the posts, we are essentially distributing 3 volunteers into 4 posts with no restrictions. This is a problem of distributing n identical items into r different groups, which can be solved using the formula for combinations with repetition: C(n+r-1, r-1). In this case, n=3 (the three volunteers) and r=4 (the four posts), so we have C(3+4-1, 4-1) = C(6, 3) = frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20 ways. Therefore, the total number of ways for A and B to each independently take charge of one post, while the remaining 3 volunteers are distributed among the 4 posts, is 12 times 20 = 240 ways. However, this calculation includes scenarios where one or more posts might not have any volunteers assigned, which contradicts the condition that each post must be staffed by at least one volunteer. To correct for this, we need to subtract the number of invalid arrangements. If one post is empty, there are 4 choices for the empty post. The remaining 3 volunteers can be distributed among the 3 non-empty posts in 3^3 = 27 ways (each volunteer can choose any of the 3 posts). However, this calculation includes scenarios where all 3 volunteers choose the same post, which would leave another post empty. Since there are 3 choices for the post that could end up with all 3 volunteers, we subtract these scenarios, resulting in 27 - 3 = 24 valid arrangements for each choice of an empty post. Therefore, the total number of invalid arrangements is 4 times 24 = 96. Subtracting the invalid arrangements from the total, we get 240 - 96 = 144 valid ways for A and B to each independently take charge of one post, with the remaining 3 volunteers properly distributed among the 4 posts.

By the triangle rule of vectors, conclusion 1 is correct; by solving the equations of the line and the parabola simultaneously, using Vieta's formulas and the condition for collinearity of vectors, we can deduce that conclusion 2 is correct; by using the coordinate representation of the dot product of vectors and Vieta's formulas, conclusion 3 can be judged as correct; by using the definition of the parabola and the fact that the radius of the circle with diameter AB is equal to the midline of trapezoid ACDB, we can deduce that the circle is tangent to CD, thus conclusion 4 is incorrect. **Solution** Given the problem, conclusion 1 is correct. Let the equation of line AB be x=ty+ frac{p}{2}. Substituting into the parabola equation y^{2}=2px(p > 0), we get y^{2}-2tpy-p^{2}=0. Let A(x_{1},y_{1}), B(x_{2},y_{2}), then C(- frac{p}{2},y_{1}), D(- frac{p}{2},y_{2}), F( frac{p}{2},0), and y_{1}+y_{2}=2tp, y_{1}y_{2}=-p^{2}, Thus x_{1}+x_{2}=2t^{2}p+p, then |AE|=|AF|+|BF|=x_{1}+x_{2}+p=2t^{2}p+2p.

Similarly, since ( C_3 ) is tangent to ( C_1 ), the distance ( O_1O_3 ) is ( 1 + R ). 3. **Perpendicularity:** Since ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) are unit circles tangent to each other and both are inside ( C ), the line segment ( OO_1 ) is perpendicular to ( OO_3 ). This is because the centers of two tangent circles with equal radii form a right angle with the line connecting their centers to the center of the larger circle. 4. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:** In the right triangle ( triangle OO_1O_3 ): [ OO_1^2 + O_1O_3^2 = OO_3^2 ] Substituting the known distances: [ 1^2 + (1 + R)^2 = (2 - R)^2 ] Simplifying: [ 1 + 1 + 2R + R^2 = 4 - 4R + R^2 ] [ 2 + 2R = 4 - 4R ] [ 6R = 2 ] [ R = frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3} ] 5. **Rectangle formation:** Let ( P ) be the point such that ( O_1OO_3P ) forms a rectangle.

The equation to represent the total number of exchanges is thus: [ frac{1}{2}x(x-1) = 72 ] However, the solution provided directly states that the equation is x(x-1) = 72.

So, the total distance that needs to be covered for them to be clear of each other is: Total distance = Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2 Total distance = 111 meters + 165 meters Total distance = 276 meters Now, we need to calculate the relative speed at which they are moving apart. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to get the relative speed. Speed of Train 1 = 40 km/h Speed of Train 2 = 50 km/h Relative speed = Speed of Train 1 + Speed of Train 2 Relative speed = 40 km/h + 50 km/h Relative speed = 90 km/h To convert the relative speed from km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 m / 3600 s Relative speed in m/s = 90 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 90 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in m/s = 90 * (5 / 18) Relative speed in m/s = 25 m/s Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to be completely clear of each other: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 276 meters / 25 m/s Time = 11.04 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{11.04}  seconds for the two trains to be completely clear of each other from the moment they meet."},{"instruction":"a school, 4 osmanthus trees are transplanted.

Substitute the point (-1, 2): 2 = a(-1 - k)^2 + 1 Substitute the point (2, 5): 5 = a(2 - k)^2 + 1 Now we have a system of two equations: begin{align*} a(-1 - k)^2 &= 1quad (1)  a(2 - k)^2 &= 4quad (2) end{align*} To solve the system, consider the following steps, starting from equation (1): a(-1 - k)^2 = 1 implies (-1 - k)^2 = frac{1}{a} From equation (2): a(2 - k)^2 = 4 implies (2 - k)^2 = frac{4}{a} Divide the second modified equation by the first one: frac{(2 - k)^2}{(-1 - k)^2} = frac{4}{1} implies left(frac{2 - k}{-1 - k}right)^2 = 4 Taking the square root of both sides gives two possible cases: frac{2 - k}{-1 - k} = 2 quad text{or} quad frac{2 - k}{-1 - k} = -2 Let's solve for each case: 1.

Since (a_n) is a sequence of integers, (d_n) must also be an integer. We consider the possible values of (d_n), which are (-1, 0, 1). 3. **Transform the inequality:**    Rewrite the given inequality in terms of (d_n):    [    -1 < d_{n-1} - r d_n + d_{n+1} < 1    ]    where (r = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2}). 4. **Analyze the possible values of ((d_{n-1}, d_n, d_{n+1})):**    Given the constraints, we need to find the possible combinations of ((d_{n-1}, d_n, d_{n+1})) that satisfy the inequality.

This structure still implies a periodic pattern because the sequence of (d_n) must repeat after a certain number of steps due to the finite number of possible values and the constraints given. 7. **Conclude periodicity:**    Since the sequence (d_n) is periodic, the original sequence (a_n) must also be periodic.

Let's analyze the problem to find all positive integers ( n ) for which all positive divisors can be arranged into a rectangular table such that each cell contains a distinct divisor and the sums of all rows and all columns are equal. 2. **Start with small cases:**     - **Case ( n = 1 ):** The number 1 has only one divisor, 1. We can arrange it in a ( 1 times 1 ) table, and the sum of the rows and columns is trivially equal (both are 1). Therefore, ( n = 1 ) works. 3. **Assume ( n > 1 ):**     - Suppose the prime factorization of ( n ) is ( n = p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} cdots p_t^{r_t} ).     - Let ( sigma(n) ) denote the sum of all positive divisors of ( n ). 4. **Table arrangement:**     - Suppose the table has ( k ) rows and ( l ) columns with ( k leq l ) and each cell contains a distinct divisor of ( n ).     - The total number of positive divisors of ( n ) is given by ( (r_1 + 1)(r_2 + 1) cdots (r_t + 1) = kl ). 5. **Sum constraints:**     - All row sums are equal and all column sums are equal.     - Consider the column containing the number ( n ). The sum of entries in each column is ( frac{sigma(n)}{l} ). 6. **Inequality on Column Sums:**     - Since ( frac{sigma(n)}{l} geq n ), we must have:       [       frac{sigma(n)}{n} geq l       ]        7. **Analyzing ( sigma(n) ):**     - The divisor sum ( sigma(n) ):       [       sigma(n) = prod_{i=1}^t left(frac{p_i^{r_i+1} - 1}{p_i - 1}right)       ]     - Dividing this by ( n ), we have:       [       frac{sigma(n)}{n} = prod_{i=1}^t left(1 + frac{1}{p_i} + frac{1}{p_i^2} + cdots + frac{1}{p_i^{r_i}}right)       ]        8. **Maximum Bound:**     - We substitute the inequality derived previously in terms of a function:       [       left(prod_{i=1}^t (r_i + 1)right) leq l^2       ]     - Let’s define:       [       f(p, r) = frac{r + 1}{left(1 + frac{1}{p} + frac{1}{p^2} + cdots + frac{1}{p^r}right)^2} = frac{(r + 1)(1 - frac{1}{p})^2}{(1 - frac{1}{p^{r+1}})^2}       ] 9. **Function Analysis for Small Primes:**     - Using some calculations:       [       f(2, 1) = frac{8}{9}, quad f(2, 2) = frac{48}{49}, quad f(3, 1) = frac{9}{8}       ]       - Notice ( f(3, 1) > 1 ), indicating ( k = 1 ) or ( k = 2 ).

The sampling interval for the systematic sampling method is  frac{48}{4} = 12 . To find the number of the first student, we use the numbers given: 6, 30, and 42. These numbers are part of our sample, and they already follow the systematic interval of 12 since 30 - 6 = 24 and 42 - 30 = 12. Since 30 and 42 are multiples of 12 and part of the sample, we can deduce that the students in the sample have numbers that are multiples of 12 plus 6 (the smallest number in the sample). Let x be the number we are looking for. According to the systematic sampling method, it must satisfy the condition that x is a multiple of 12 plus 6 and also comes before 6 in the sequence as it's the smallest number we have. The multiplications of 12 we have below 6 are 0 and -12, -24, etc., but we only consider the positive results as valid student numbers.  Thus, x = 12 times 0 + 6 = 6 is the number we already have, and the only other possible number is for the case before that, which would be at an interval of 12 before 6. That would be 6 - 12 = -6, but since we don't have negative student numbers, we must start over from the end of the list and count backward by 12 from student number 48.  Therefore: 48 - 12 = 36, but since student number 36 is not listed, the next interval would be another 12 backward: 36 - 12 = 24, which is also not given, so we try once more: 24 - 12 = 12, again not on the list.

The length of the rectangle is the diameter of the semicircles, which is 2 units (since the radius is 1 unit), and the width is the radius of the semicircles, which is 1 unit.

In this scenario, there are two elephants, one on each side of the temple.     Since an elephant can only move forward and there are no other temples to protect or destroy, the lone temple remains protected by default.     Therefore, the base case of n=1 holds, as the single temple is inherently intouchable. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    Assume that the statement is true for any number k of temples, where k < n. This means that for any k temples, there is exactly one temple that is intouchable. 3. **Inductive Step:**    Consider the case with n temples.

According to the hypothesis, there exists exactly one temple, say T_i (i leq k), that is intouchable within this segment. 7. **Verification of Intouchability:**    - Since T_i is intouchable within the first k temples, none of the elephants guarding T_1 to T_k can reach T_i.    - Any elephant to the right of T_k would need to pass through the largest elephant (which is on the right of T_k) to reach temple T_i. Given the definition of the largest elephant, this is impossible. 8. **Unicity:**    - The largest elephant (on the right of T_k) can potentially trample any other elephant to the right, maintaining the order and preventing any other temple from being intouchable.    - Thus, the only intouchable temple within the entire set of n temples must be T_i, proving its uniqueness. # Conclusion: By strong induction, we have shown that for any number of temples n, there exists exactly one intouchable temple.

Given this setup, we aim to find the area of the inscribed rectangle. To do this, we first observe that since CD is perpendicular to AB, and WX is the height of the rectangle, we have ND = WX = x. This implies that the remaining part of the altitude, CN, is equal to h - x. Next, we note that the sides of the rectangle are parallel, specifically XY parallel WZ. This parallelism leads to the triangles triangle CXY and triangle CAB being similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) Similarity Criterion.  To find the base of the rectangle, let's denote it as n. The similarity of the triangles gives us a proportion between the sides of these triangles.

Now, we can simplify the expression further using the identity above: cos left(4pi + frac{pi}{6}right) = cos left(frac{pi}{6}right) Since frac{pi}{6} is a special angle, we know its cosine value: cos left(frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} So, the value of cos frac{25pi}{6} is boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}."},{"instruction":"Let  ABC  be a triangle with  angle BAC = 75^o  and  angle ABC = 45^o .

Find the locus of the centers of the incircles of such triangles.","output":"We are asked to find the loci of the centers of the inscribed circles of certain triangles. Let us follow the steps suggested in the solution. 1. **Definitions and Initial Setup**:      Let Omega be the circumcircle of triangle ABC, O be its center, and R be its radius. 2. **Behavior of Symmetric Lines**:      When the lines d_{a}, d_{b}, and d_{c} rotate uniformly around the vertices of the triangle, their symmetric counterparts also rotate at the same angular speed around the corresponding points symmetric to the vertices relative to the opposite sides. Therefore, (i) the angles of triangle XYZ do not depend on the choice of d_{a}, d_{b}, d_{c}, so all such triangles are similar, and (ii) points X, Y, and Z move with the same angular speed along three circles. 3. **Analyzing Special Cases**:      We consider special cases where d_{a} and d_{b} coincide with the line segment AB. Let A' and B' be the points symmetric to A and B about the opposite sides of ABC, respectively. Thus, Z is at the intersection of lines AB' and BA', and points Y and X lie on lines parallel to AB at twice the distance from C. 4. **Properties of Angle Bisectors**:      Note that the angle bisectors of angles ZXY and ZYX are perpendicular to AC and BC, respectively (see the provided figure). 5. **Projections onto AC**:     Consider the projections of O and the center of the inscribed circle of XYZ on the line AC. Point O projects to the midpoint of AC. Since X is obtained as a midpoint symmetric to A with respect to the midpoint of AC, so Y and the incenter of XYZ also project to this point. 6. **Distance from O to Incenter**:     We know the distance from O to the midpoint of side AC is half the radius R of Omega, and since X lies midway symmetric to A, it is clear that the incenter of triangle XYZ lies on a circle whose radius is 2R from O when d_{a} and d_{b} are aligned to AB. The same result holds when considering other sides of ABC. 7. **Final Conclusion**:      Therefore, given that the incenter trace circles whose centers are about the same distance from the vertices of O when rotating d_{a}, d_{b}, d_{c} around any vertex of ABC. Thus, the loci of the incenter correspond to the circle concentric with Omega but with twice the radius.

According to the information given, 33% of the frogs have mutated. This means that 67% of the frogs are normal because 100% - 33% = 67%. We know that Francine caught 5 frogs with extra legs, 2 frogs with 2 heads, and 2 frogs that are bright red. So, the total number of mutated frogs is 5 + 2 + 2 = 9. Since these 9 mutated frogs represent 33% of the total number of frogs, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of frogs (F): 33% of F = 9 0.33 * F = 9 F = 9 / 0.33 F = 27.27 Since Francine can't catch a fraction of a frog, we'll round the total number of frogs to the nearest whole number, which is 27.

We also have the relation for the sides ( b ) and ( c ) and the area ( S ) of the triangle: [ bc = frac{2S}{sin(alpha)}. ] 4.

Simplify the fraction: [ frac{OA^2}{bc} = frac{r^2 /sin^2(alpha / 2)}{2S /sin(alpha)}. ] 6.

Given the known trigonometric identity, ( cot(alpha / 2) = frac{p-a}{r} ), where ( p ) is half the perimeter ( (a+b+c)/2 ), we replace ( cot(alpha / 2) ): [ frac{OA^2}{bc} = frac{r^2 cdot (p - a) / r}{S} = frac{r(p-a)}{S}. ] 9.

Factor ( frac{r}{S} ) out of the sum in the numerator: [ frac{OA^2}{bc} + frac{OB^2}{ac} + frac{OC^2}{ab} = frac{r}{S} left( (p-a) + (p-b) + (p-c) right). ] 12.

We can analyze this transformation better by rewriting it in a different form: 1. **Transformation Rewriting:**    Letting ( m = a - 1 ) and ( n = b - 1 ), we transform ( a - 1 ) and ( b - 1 ) into the form:    [    m + n + mn = (a - 1) + (b - 1) + (a - 1)(b - 1)    ]    Simplifying the right-hand side:    [    m + n + mn = a + b - 2 + ab - a - b + 1 = ab - 1    ] 2. **General Form Analysis:**    Notice that if we start with initial numbers 1 and 2 on the blackboard, rewritten as ( 2 - 1 ) and ( 3 - 1 ) respectively, any number that can eventually appear on the board must be of the form ( a_i b_i - 1 ) where ( a_i, b_i in mathbb{N} ), and we start with 2 and 3 for our initial values of ( a ) and ( b ). 3. **Number Properties:**    The initial conditions of 1 and 2 transformed to ( 2 times 3 - 1 = 5 ), then further transformations always yielding numbers ( ab - 1 ).  4. **Evaluation for 13121:**    To verify if 13121 can be obtained:    [    13121 + 1 = 13122    ]    We need to check if 13122 can be decomposed into a product of two natural numbers ( M times N ):    [    13122 = M times N    ]    Factorization:    [    13122 = 2 times 6561 = 2 times (3^8)    ]    It can be represented as ( 2^1 times 3^8 ), which complies with the required form since we started from ( 2 times 3 = 6 - 1 = 5 ).

Since line PA is tangent to ellipse C,   So Delta_1 = [18(y_0 - kx_0)k]^2 - 4(9k^2 + 4)[9(y_0 - kx_0)^2 - 36] = 0,   After simplification, we get Delta_1 = -144[(x_0^2 - 9)k^2 - 2x_0y_0k + y_0^2 - 4] = 0      (1)   Similarly, from the equation of line PB and ellipse C,   We get Delta_2 = -144[(x_0^2 - 9) frac{1}{k^2} + 2x_0y_0 frac{1}{k} + y_0^2 - 4] cdot (2)   Since point P is any point on circle M: x^2 + y^2 = 13,   So x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 13, i.e., y_0^2 = 13 - x_0^2.   Substituting into (1), we get (x_0^2 - 9)k^2 - 2x_0y_0k + (9 - x_0^2) = 0,   Substituting into (2), we get Delta_2 = - frac{144}{k^2}[(x_0^2 - 9) + 2x_0y_0k + (x_0^2 - 4)k^2] = - frac{144}{k^2}[(x_0^2 - 9) + 2x_0y_0k + (9 - x_0^2)k^2],   = frac{144}{k^2}[(x_0^2 - 9)k^2 - 2x_0y_0k + (9 - x_0^2)] = 0.

We begin by noting the dimensions of the rectangular blocks and the dimensions of the large rectangular box:     - Each block has dimensions (3 times 3 times 1).     - The large rectangular box has dimensions (7 times 9 times 11). 2. First, calculate the volume of one (3 times 3 times 1) block:     [     text{Volume of one block} = 3 times 3 times 1 = 9     ] 3. Since there are 77 such blocks, calculate the total volume occupied by these blocks:     [     text{Total volume of 77 blocks} = 77 times 9 = 693     ] 4. Next, calculate the volume of the large rectangular box:     [     text{Volume of the box} = 7 times 9 times 11 = 693     ] 5. Observe that the total volume of the blocks equals the volume of the large box, which implies that the blocks could theoretically fit in the box in terms of volume. 6. However, for these blocks to fit practically, we must also consider the dimensions of the blocks and the box:     - Each block has a dimension of (3 times 3 times 1).     - Calculate each face area of the large rectangular box:          [         7 times 9 = 63, quad 7 times 11 = 77, quad 9 times 11 = 99         ] 7. Notice that a (3 times 3 times 1) block has faces of area 3 (either 1x3 or 3x1):     - The face areas of the box (63, 77, and 99) are not all divisible by 3.     - Specifically, the face of area 77 is not divisible by 3, which means it is impossible to arrange (3 times 3) faces evenly in the 7 × 11 face of the larger box. 8.

This means we use two colors such that no two adjacent triangles share the same color. This can be done by induction on the number of sides of the polygon.    - Base case: For a triangle (3-gon), we can trivially color it with two colors.    - Inductive step: Assume we can color any (k)-gon. For a ((k+1))-gon, we can remove one triangle, color the remaining (k)-gon, and then color the removed triangle such that it fits the chessboard pattern. 2. **Orienting the Triangles:**    - Once the triangles are colored, we orient each black triangle. Since the sides of the black triangles do not interfere with one another, this can be done without any issues.    - After orienting the black triangles, we complete the orientation of the diagonals so that all triangles (both black and white) are oriented. 3. **Analyzing the Borders:**    - We observe that the sides between (A_{i_1}) and (A_{i_2}) (going in the direction in which the vertices of the polygon are numbered) all have the same color. This is the same as the color of those between (A_{i_3}) and (A_{i_4}), and so on. The other sides have the other color.    - Each triangle is oriented, and each cycle has a border of 0. The border is defined as the number of sides you traverse in the right direction minus the number of sides you traverse in the wrong direction modulo 3. 4. **Cycle Around the Polygon:**    - The cycle going around the sides of the polygon has a border of 0 (like all cycles). However, this cycle also has a border of (2(i_2 - i_1 + i_4 - i_3 + ldots + i_k - i_{k-1}) - n) modulo 3.    - Since the border of the cycle around the polygon is 0, we have:      [      2(i_2 - i_1 + i_4 - i_3 + ldots + i_k - i_{k-1}) - n equiv 0 pmod{3}      ]    - Simplifying, we get:      [      n equiv 2(i_2 - i_1 + i_4 - i_3 + ldots + i_k - i_{k-1}) pmod{3}      ]    - Since (2) is invertible modulo (3), we can multiply both sides by the inverse of (2) modulo (3), which is (2):      [      n equiv i_1 - i_2 + i_3 - i_4 + ldots + i_{k-1} - i_k pmod{3}      ] 5. **Special Case (k = 0):**    - If (k = 0), there are no vertices with an odd number of sides issuing from them.

All mayors, except for one, noticed that their count results are divisible by 2016. Prove that the result of the remaining mayor is also divisible by 2016.","output":"1. Let's designate a particular city A as the capital. Define a city as **even** if the route from A to that city involves an even number of flights; otherwise, define it as **odd**. By this designation, the city A is even.    - **Observation**: The parity (even or odd) of the cities connected by a flight will always differ. This implies that the route between any two directly connected cities changes parity. 2. We need to show that the sum of numbers obtained by the mayors of even cities equals the sum obtained by the mayors of odd cities. Consequently, if all but one mayor's results are divisible by 2016, the same must be true for the remaining mayor.    - Note: Each city exhibits a unique numbering such that on any route starting at that city, the city numbers are in ascending order. Importantly, in any such numeration, the city X will carry the number 1. This setup ensures that any valid numeration fits not more than one city. 3. Consider a numbering suitable for an even city E. Let's say within that numbering, the number 2 is held by city W. Since W and E are connected directly, and they have different parities, this implies W must be odd.    - **Swapping**: If we interchange the numbers 1 and 2 in this numeration:      - City W (originally holding 2, now holds 1).      - City E (originally holding 1, now holds 2). 4. Investigate any route m starting from city W. Such a route results from some route originating from E by:    - **Adding** W at the beginning (if m goes through E, 1 changes place with 2 to keep the new numeration valid).    - **Removing** E if it is initially present.    - This analysis implies that after the swapping of 1 and 2, the sequence of city numbers remains in ascending order. 5. Hence, following this swap, a valid numeration for an even city morphs into a valid one for an odd city, and vice versa. There is an unequivocal one-to-one matching between these numerations:    - This matching means that both even and odd numerations are evenly distributed. 6. Therefore, by this symmetry and given that the sum of results obtained by even city mayors equates to the odd city mayors, and provided that all but one mayor's results are divisible by 2016, it necessitates the remaining mayor’s result to also be divisible by 2016. Conclusion: [ boxed{Each mayor's result, including the remaining one, is divisible by 2016} ]"},{"instruction":"A store offers packages of  12  pens for   10  and packages of  20  pens for   15 .

For example, a rectangle with sides 5 and 6 is an almost-square. We are asked if there exists an almost-square that can be divided into 2010 almost-squares. 2. **Analyze Basic Almost-Square:**    The simplest almost-square is a 2 times 1 rectangle. This is a basic building block for constructing larger almost-squares. 3. **Construction of a Large Almost-Square:**    Let's construct a large almost-square using smaller almost-squares. Consider an almost-square with dimensions 2009 times 2008. This is because the sides differ by just 1. 4. **Adding Strips to Form Full Almost-Square:**    To achieve a total area that can be split into 2010 almost-squares, we add strips composed of our smallest almost-square (dominoes).    4.1 Add a strip of 1004 dominoes to the right side of the 2009 times 2008 almost-square. This strip measures 2 times 1004, contributing an area of 2 times 1004 = 2008.    4.2 Add a strip of 1005 dominoes to the top of the newly formed shape. This strip measures 2 times 1005, contributing an area of 2 times 1005 = 2010. 5. **Detailed Calculation of Total Area:**    Then, we calculate the overall shape formed by:    - Initial almost-square: 2009 times 2008 = 2009    - Adding right strip: 2009 times 2012 (after adding 2 times 1004 right strip)    - Adding top strip: 2002 times 1005 6. **Conclusion:**    By piecing together these almost-squares, Vasya's almost-square (2009 x 2008) with strips we achieve construction that sums up the almost-squares to 2010.

Consider a point P on the bisector of the angle angle ABC. Through this point P, we need to draw a secant line intersecting the sides AB and BC at points A_1 and B_1 respectively.

Let this line intersect AB at A_2 and the other side of the angle that is parallel to BC at C_1. 3. We now have a new triangle Delta C_1PA_2 which is similar to Delta ABC because the lines are parallel, thereby creating corresponding angles that are equal. 4. Using the properties of similar triangles, we can establish the relationships between the sides:    [    frac{PA_2}{AB} = frac{PB_1}{BC}    ]    and    [    frac{PA_1}{AB} = frac{PC_1}{AC}    ] 5.

To simplify, find a common denominator for the fractions frac{1}{4}, frac{2}{5}, frac{7}{10}, and frac{5}{8}. The least common multiple of 4, 5, 10, and 8 is 40. Convert each fraction:    [    frac{1}{4} = frac{10}{40}, quad frac{2}{5} = frac{16}{40}, quad frac{7}{10} = frac{28}{40}, quad frac{5}{8} = frac{25}{40}    ] 4.

Combine the fractions:    [    x = left(frac{10 - 16 + 28 - 25}{40}right) = frac{-3}{40}    ] 6. Therefore, the value of x that satisfies the equation is -frac{3{40}}.

Vertex ( v ) is connected to the other five vertices. By the Pigeonhole Principle, since there are five edges connected to ( v ) and only two colors for the edges (red and blue), at least three of these edges must be of the same color. 4. **Without Loss of Generality**:     - Assume without loss of generality that ( v ) is connected to at least three vertices (say, ( v_1 ), ( v_2 ), and ( v_3 )) with red edges.

If there is a cell filled with 0, then the sum of the numbers in all cells in the same row and column as this cell is at least m. 2. **Sum of Each Row and Column:**    Let’s consider the sum of the numbers in each row and each column. Among these 2m sums, denote the smallest one as p. Suppose p is the sum of the numbers in the first row. 3. **Case Analysis:**    If p geq frac{m}{2}, then the sum of all numbers in the table, S, satisfies:    [    S geq m cdot frac{m}{2} = frac{m^2}{2}    ]    Therefore, the desired result follows. 4. **Suppose p < frac{m}{2}:**    Let k be the number of cells in the first row that contain 0. Then we have k > frac{m}{2} because the sum of the numbers in the first row is less than frac{m}{2}, and given that any cell with 0 in the grid implies the total in its row and column must be at least m. 5. **Estimate the Total Sum:**    The sum of all numbers in the table S can be estimated by considering the contributions from the cells with 0 in the first row. Specifically, in the table:    [    S geq (m - p)k + (m - k)p    ]    Expanding and simplifying this, we get:    [    S = m(k + p) - k cdot p - p cdot k    ]    Rewriting, we find:    [    S = m(k + p) - 2kp    ] 6. **Rewriting with Squares:**    Further, notice that:    [    m(k + p) - 2kp = frac{m^2}{2} + frac{1}{2}(p - k)^2 - frac{1}{2}(m - (p + k))^2    ]    Now, p < frac{m}{2} and k > frac{m}{2} implies:    [    frac{m}{2} + frac{1}{2}(p - k)^2 - frac{1}{2}(m - (k + p))^2 = frac{m^2}{2} + frac{1}{2}(p - k)^2 - frac{1}{2}(m - 2k - p)^2    ] 7. **Final Verification:**    Since p < frac{m}{2} and k > frac{m}{2}, we have:    [    frac{m^2}{2} + frac{1}{2}(p - k)^2 - frac{1}{2}(m - 2k - p)^2 > frac{m^2}{2}    ]    Therefore, the sum of all numbers in the table S satisfies:    [    S > frac{m^2}{2}    ] # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that the total sum of the numbers in the grid is not less than frac{m^2}{2}, which completes our proof.

This helps in achieving the even distribution eventually. 8. **Special Case with m = 3**:        - The algorithm also covers edge cases with the denominations.    - Specifically, it checks for various subsets and suggests the potential exchange, nearly or exactly balancing by using known combinations of odd sums.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Constraints Analysis**:     - Snowballs ranging from 50 kg to 99 kg:       - If we take any two snowballs from this range, their mass does not allow them to be stacked on top of each other as the constraint specifies one must be at least half the other's mass. For example, 50 kg cannot be 1/2 of any mass in 51 to 99 kg. 2. **Concept of the Upper Bound**:     - Since any two snowballs within the range 50 to 99 kg cannot be in the same snowman, there will always be at least two snowballs from the range 1 kg to 49 kg in each valid snowman. 3. **Numerical Calculation**:     - Snowballs in range 50 kg to 99 kg are 50 in total.     - Each snowman must have at least one snowball from the higher mass range (50-99 kg), thus the maximum number of snowmen will be limited by the number of such snowballs.     - Each snowman needs to be paired with exactly 2 snowballs from the lower mass range (1-49 kg). 4. **Determination of Maximum Snowmen**:     - Since the limiting factor is the number of snowballs from the 50 - 99 kg range, there can be at most:       [       text{No. of snowmen} = 49 quad text{snowmen}       ] 5. **Greedy Approach to Validate**:     - We could try constructing a snowman with combinations like (96 kg, 48 kg, 24 kg) and then check for other combinations.     - For example;       [       96 geq 2 times 48 quad text{(valid)}       ]       [       48 geq 2 times 24 quad text{(valid)}       ] 6. **Conclusion**:     - Number of snowballs usable for 24 valid snowmen is supported by the upper bound considerations and combinatorial assembly.      Thus, there are at most boxed{24} snowmen that can be assembled. # Conclusion: Considering the constraints and the snowball masses, the maximum number of snowmen that can be constructed with the given conditions is: [ boxed{24} ]"},{"instruction":"A cube has a surface area of 150 square centimeters.

What largest possible number of them could have been equal to  1 ? For example, if  a = [1, 2, 2] , then we got  3  once,  4  once,  2  twice,  1  once,  1  twice, so the total number of ones here is  2 . *(Proposed by Anton Trygub)*","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We are given ( n ) real numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). We need to find the largest possible number of nonempty subsets of these numbers such that the sum of the elements in each subset is equal to 1. 2. **Analyzing Subsets:**    There are ( 2^n ) subsets of ( n ) elements, including the empty subset. Since we are only interested in nonempty subsets, we have ( 2^n - 1 ) nonempty subsets. 3. **Considering the Sum of Subsets:**    If all elements ( a_i ) are zero, then the sum of any subset is zero. Therefore, no subset can have a sum of 1 in this case. 4. **Introducing a Nonzero Element:**    Suppose at least one element ( x_0 ) is nonzero. We need to consider subsets that include ( x_0 ) and those that do not. 5. **Subsets Including ( x_0 ):**    If a subset ( S ) with sum 1 contains ( x_0 ), then the sum of the subset ( S setminus {x_0} ) (the subset without ( x_0 )) must be ( 1 - x_0 ). 6. **Subsets Excluding ( x_0 ):**    If a subset ( S ) with sum 1 does not contain ( x_0 ), then adding ( x_0 ) to this subset will result in a sum ( ne 1 ). 7. **Counting Subsets:**    The number of subsets with sum 1 is at most half of the total number of nonempty subsets. This is because for each subset with sum 1, there is a corresponding subset (by adding or removing ( x_0 )) that does not sum to 1. 8. **Maximum Number of Subsets with Sum 1:**    Therefore, the maximum number of subsets with sum 1 is ( le frac{2^n - 1}{2} ). Simplifying, we get:    [    frac{2^n - 1}{2} = 2^{n-1} - frac{1}{2}    ]    Since the number of subsets must be an integer, we take the floor function:    [    leftlfloor 2^{n-1} - frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = 2^{n-1}    ] 9. **Achieving the Maximum:**    To achieve this maximum, consider the set ( {1, 0, 0, ldots, 0} ). Here, the number of subsets with sum 1 is exactly ( 2^{n-1} ), as each subset containing the element 1 and any combination of zeros will sum to 1.

Expanding ( (x^2 - frac{x}{2})^2 ): [ (x^2 - frac{x}{2})^2 = x^4 - x^3 + frac{1}{4}x^2 ] We can now rewrite the polynomial by incorporating this square: [ x^4 - x^3 + 3x^2 = (x^2 - frac{x}{2})^2 + left(3x^2 - frac{1}{4}x^2right) ] This simplifies to: [ (x^2 - frac{x}{2})^2 + frac{11}{4}x^2 ] Thus, the polynomial becomes: [ x^4 - x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x + 2 = left(x^2 - frac{x}{2}right)^2 + frac{11}{4}x^2 - 2x + 2 ] 3. **Further Decomposition:** Next, we consider adding and subtracting the right term to facilitate the complete square: [ frac{11}{4}x^2 - 2x + 2 = left(left(sqrt{frac{7}{4}} xright)^2 + (x-1)^2 + 1right) ] So, we express it in a way that combines all the squares: [ x^4 - x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x + 2 = left(x^2 - frac{x}{2}right)^2 + frac{7}{4}x^2 + (x-1)^2 + 1 ] 4. **Verification of Non-negativity:** Now, each of the terms in this expression is a square or a positive constant: [ left(x^2 - frac{x}{2}right)^2 geq 0, quad frac{7}{4}x^2 geq 0, quad (x-1)^2 geq 0, quad 1 geq 0 ] Since the sum of non-negative terms is always non-negative, it follows that: [ left(x^2 - frac{x}{2}right)^2 + frac{7}{4}x^2 + (x-1)^2 + 1 geq 0 ] # Conclusion: Therefore, the polynomial ( x^4 - x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x + 2 ) is always non-negative for all ( x ): [ boxed{x^4 - x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x + 2 geq 0} ]"},{"instruction":"Given fleft( frac{2}{x} + 1 right) = lg x, then f(x) = ______.","output":"Let frac{2}{x} + 1 = t (where t > 1), we can then solve for x to get x= frac{2}{t-1}.

Since he can carry 4 cans at once, we divide 28 cans by 4 cans per trip: 28 cans / 4 cans/trip = 7 trips Now, let's calculate the total time Jerry spends draining the cans. Since it takes him 30 seconds to drain 4 cans, and he needs to do this 7 times, we multiply 30 seconds by 7 trips: 30 seconds/trip * 7 trips = 210 seconds Jerry takes 350 seconds in total to throw all the cans away, and we know that 210 seconds are spent draining the cans. So, the remaining time is spent walking to the sink and recycling bin and then back to his desk: 350 seconds - 210 seconds = 140 seconds This 140 seconds is the total time Jerry spends walking for all 7 trips. To find out how long it takes him to walk each way for one trip, we divide 140 seconds by the number of trips: 140 seconds / 7 trips = 20 seconds/trip Since each trip includes walking to the sink, to the recycling bin, and back to his desk, the time for one way is one-third of the trip time: 20 seconds/trip / 3 = 6.67 seconds Therefore, it takes Jerry approximately boxed{6.67}  seconds to walk each way to the sink and recycling bin and then back to his desk."},{"instruction":"Let ABCD be a quadrilateral; X and Y be the midpoints of AC and BD respectively and lines through X and Y respectively parallel to BD, AC meet in O.

The curve C_2 is defined by the parametric equations: begin{cases} x= - frac{3}{5}t + 2  y= frac{4}{5}t end{cases}.
