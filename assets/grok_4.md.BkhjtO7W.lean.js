Researchers believe peaks and valleys in baby spinach leaves could be a key reason why there have been numerous bacterial outbreaks involving leafy green vegetables      Share this article:      Nichola Kinsinger, a post-doctoral researher at UC Riverside.      RIVERSIDE, Calif. (www.ucr.edu) — Ever wonder what the words triple-washed or pre-washed on a bag of baby spinach mean?      Not much according to engineers at the University of California, Riverside. They discovered that small peaks and valleys in baby spinach leaves could be a key reason why there have been numerous bacterial outbreaks involving leafy green vegetables.      Currently, disinfectant is put into the rinse water, and not specifically applied to the leaf surface. The researchers in the Bourns College of Engineering found that because of the varied topography of the spinach leaf nearly 15 percent of the leaf surface may reach concentrations as low as 1,000 times that of the bleach disinfectant being used to rinse it.      As a result, as the leaves move through the processing facility after being rinsed the bacteria may continue to live, grow, spread, and contaminate other leaves and surfaces within the facility.      Following rinsing under the low bleach condition, upwards of 90 percent of adhered bacteria were observed to remain attached to and survive on the leaf surface.      “In a sense the leaf is protecting the bacteria and allowing it to spread,” said Nichola M. Kinsinger, a post-doctoral researcher working with Sharon Walker, a professor of chemical and environmental engineering. “It was surprising to discover how the leaf surface formed micro-environments that reduce the bleach concentration and in this case the very disinfection processes intended to clean, remove, and prevent contamination was found to be the potential pathway to amplifying foodborne outbreaks.”      Kinsinger will present her research on August 19 at the 250th American Chemical Society National Meeting & Exposition. The talk is called, “Is our salad safe? Efficacy of disinfection techniques to decontaminate spinach leaves and reduce cross-contamination.”      Kinsinger is also writing a paper, co-authored by Walker and Madeline Luth, an undergraduate student, about the findings. It will soon be submitted for publication.      The Center for Disease Control estimates that 1 in 6 Americans become ill and 3,000 die annually from foodborne diseases. Additionally, this causes and an estimated over 75 billion per year loss for the food industry.      Past research has found about 20 percent of single food commodity outbreaks from 2003 to 2008 were attributed to leafy green produce. Contamination of such minimally processed and ready-to-eat produce is of concern since it is frequently consumed uncooked or raw.      One of these outbreaks, involving spinach, occurred in California in 2006. In all, 199 people in 26 states were infected with the outbreak strain of E. coli. Three died.      Currently, the industry standard is to add 50 to 200 parts per million of bleach to the water used to rinse leafy green vegetables. But that is just a recommendation, not a requirement or regulation, Kinsinger said.      For the research, Kinsinger and Walker designed a parallel plate flow chamber system to evaluate in real time the attachment and detachment of pathogens to the spinach in realistic water chemistries and flow conditions.      Their work focused exclusively on baby spinach, however the issue of reduced bleach concentration across the leaf surface and other surfaces within the processing facility translates beyond the specific scenarios tested and demonstrates the limitation of bleach disinfection causing significant concern over public health.      Future research will focus on a broader range of foods, surfaces in processing facilities and pathogen types, Kinsinger said.      Despite their findings, Kinsinger notes that the United States has one of safest food supply system. Still, she says, “I recommend rinsing those leaves.”      Kinsinger is a Riverside native who earned her bachelor’s and Ph.D. from UC Riverside. She has a postdoctoral research fellowship through the USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture under the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative.

(Photo: iStock)      Labels like “thoroughly washed” and “triple washed” make us feel comfortable chowing down on pre-washed baby spinach straight from the container. But researchers from the University of California, Riverside, say we might want to rethink that habit.      They discovered that the small peaks and valleys in baby spinach leaves can harbor bacteria — even during the washing process they often undergo in food-processing plants. This, researchers say, could be an important reason why there have been several outbreaks of E. coli and salmonella in pre-washed baby spinach.      The findings were presented Wednesday at the American Chemical Society National Meeting & Exposition.      Pre-washed baby spinach is typically treated using a bleach disinfectant. But, researchers discovered, the shape of the baby spinach leaf means that 15 percent of the leaf’s surface may only see a very small percentage of the disinfectant. That remaining bacteria, which can include E. coli, salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes, can survive, grow, and spread to the other leaves.      Here’s the freaky part: After researchers rinsed baby spinach leaves under the typical disinfectant, nearly 90 percent of bacteria were still attached to (and alive on) the leaf’s surface.      Related: Why Recent Food Poisoning Outbreaks All Began in This One State      While the news is shocking to most people, “this is not a surprise to many of us in the food safety arena,” Mike Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, tells Yahoo Health.      The danger in this bacteria remaining is that it can cause outbreaks of food-borne illness, which he says are more common than we realize. “There are many outbreaks that go unreported or uninvestigated because the CDC can’t investigate them all,” he says.      The realization that spinach could cause food-borne illness reached national consciousness in 2006, when nearly 200 people from 26 states were infected with a strain of E. coli contracted from fresh spinach. Three people died from that outbreak. Fresh spinach was also involved in an outbreak in 2012 that infected 33 people in five states.      Related: Whole Foods Tops List Of Companies Forced To Recall Food      Unfortunately, washing your pre-washed baby spinach before eating it doesn’t make a difference, says Benjamin Chapman, PhD, an assistant professor and food safety extension specialist at North Carolina State University.      “Rinsing isn’t going to do a whole heck of a lot for food safety,” Chapman tells Yahoo Health — it just may remove dirt or other physical objects that you can see. Cooking the spinach, however, will kill potentially harmful bacteria.      But what about the whole “triple wash” label? Does that make pre-washed spinach safer? Chapman says there’s some confusion about what it means. Companies don’t triple wash spinach to disinfect it, he explains — they do it to reduce the likelihood of cross-contamination from one piece of spinach to another during the washing process.      So, what does this mean for consumers? Experts are mixed. Doyle says he doesn’t eat raw spinach because of the risks, but Chapman eats pre-washed baby spinach out of the bag.      “From a health standpoint, eating fruits and vegetables sometimes outweighs the risk,” Chapman says. However, he says he wouldn’t feed raw spinach to a person who is immunocompromised or elderly, just to be safe.

A genetic registry database uses biometrics to classify those so created as \\"valids\\" while those conceived by traditional means and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as \\"in-valids\\". Genetic discrimination is illegal, but in practice genotype profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs. Vincent Freeman is conceived without the aid of genetic selection; his genetics indicate a high probability of several disorders and an estimated life span of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection to give birth to their next child, Anton. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of \\"chicken\\" by swimming out to sea with the first one returning to shore considered the loser; Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel but is reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and bests him before Anton starts to drown. Vincent saves Anton and then leaves home. Vincent works as an in-valid, cleaning office spaces including that of Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, a space-flight conglomerate. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using hair, skin, blood and urine samples from a donor, Jerome Eugene Morrow, who is a former swimming star paralyzed due to a car accident. With Jerome's genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca, and is assigned to be navigator for an upcoming trip to Saturn's moon Titan. To keep his identity hidden, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material, and pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples. Gattaca becomes embroiled in controversy when one of its administrators is murdered a week before the flight. The police find a fallen eyelash of Vincent's at the scene. An investigation is launched to find the murderer, Vincent being the top suspect. Through this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will prevent her from joining any deep space Gattaca mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is by his own hand; after coming in second place in a swim meet, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet wasn't, and that is the source of his suffering. Vincent repeatedly evades scrutiny from the investigation, and it is revealed that Gattaca's mission director was the killer, as the administrator was threatening to cancel the mission. Vincent learns the identity of the detective who closed the case, his brother Anton, who has become aware of Vincent's presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent that what he is doing is illegal, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to one more game of chicken. As the two swim out in the dead of night, Anton is surprised at Vincent's stamina, and Vincent reveals that his trick to winning was not saving energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him and swims them both back to shore using celestial navigation. On the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return, and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, the person in charge of background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, genetically selected but \\"not all that they promised\\", could break the limits just as Vincent has. He passes Vincent as a valid. As the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and immolates himself in his home's incinerator; Vincent opens the note from Jerome to find only a lock of Jerome's hair attached to it. Vincent muses on this, stating \\"For someone who was never meant for this world, I must confess, I m suddenly having a hard time leaving it.

Iran executed a man in a rare public hanging in Tehran on Wednesday morning, local media reported. The man, identified only as \\"Yaqub,\\" was convicted of stabbing a man to death in broad daylight in October, said the official Islamic Republic News Agency. The public hanging, which was attended by the victims' family and large crowds of onlookers, took place in the main square of the affluent northern Tehran neighborhood of Sa'adat Abad. The October murder sparked outrage amongst Tehran residents after videos of the stabbing surfaced on the Internet and were replayed on Iranian state television. The killing took place in front of two police officers, the news agency said. Although executions are common in Iran, public ones are not. A death sentence can be handed down for crimes from murder to adultery. The latest execution brings the total number this year to 20, according to a CNN count from local media reports.

Gunslinger Sean Lafferty, known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States.  He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell, he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack, the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men. When she witnesses this, Jane Taylor, one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today.

Sentence 2: Vrenna does not cross blades with her opponent.  If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Pick your answer from:  + yes  + it is not possible to tell  + no","output":"Yes, the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Let's break down both sentences for better understanding. Sentence 1 describes a situation in which Thorn's vision is showing Jon an event. The event involves Vrenna dancing and engaging in a form of combat or swordplay. In this specific instance, Vrenna uses a defensive technique where she targets her opponent's wrist instead of directly engaging in full contact with their blades. This indicates that she is avoiding the act of crossing blades with her opponent. Sentence 2 is a more straightforward statement that asserts that Vrenna does not cross blades with her opponent. This is precisely the outcome described in the first sentence, where Vrenna's technique involves parrying at her opponent's wrist, thus preventing the crossing of blades. Based on the information provided, the actions described in Sentence 1 directly align with the assertion made in Sentence 2. Therefore, if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 is also true.

Question: suppose less heat is utilised happens, how will it affect bubbles will appear more quickly.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: less When less heat is utilized in the process of heating water in a pot, it will affect the formation of bubbles and consequently, the speed at which they appear. The bubbles in the water begin to form due to the process of nucleation, which is the initial stage in the formation of a new thermodynamic phase or a new structure through the self-assembly of atoms, molecules, or ions. The bubbles signify the transformation of the water from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase, i.e., from water to water vapor. When water is heated, the temperature of the water rises, and the water molecules start moving faster. As the water temperature reaches its boiling point (100°C or 212°F at sea level), these molecules have enough energy to change their state from liquid to vapor. The bubbles that you observe in the water are filled with this water vapor.  If the heat source is reduced, it will take a longer time for the water to reach its boiling point. This is because the rate of energy transfer to the water is lower, which causes the temperature of the water to increase more slowly. Consequently, the water molecules will take more time to gain enough energy to change their state to vapor, and therefore, the nucleation process will also be slower. As a result, with less heat applied, the formation of bubbles will be slower, and they will appear less quickly compared to when using a higher heat source. In summary, utilizing less heat to warm the water in the pot will cause the bubbles to appear less quickly, which corresponds to option B: Less."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Evidence of Han-era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested Confucian scholars. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information.

The inventions of the artisan-engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's  Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.  Question: \\"Who blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks, and froze 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits belonging to the Afghan central bank?\\" Answer: \\"The President\\" Is this answer correct?

They have released a computerised image, above, of the young suspect, which they said made the incidents ‘even more shocking’. Officers are linking the assaults in the last month near the University of Manchester. The first two took place within 15 minutes of each other on September 21. Greater Manchester Police have released an image of a 12-year-old boy who may be responsible for a string of sex attacks around a university campus. Appeal: Greater Manchester Police have asked for information about the attacks. A 27-year-old was grabbed before she screamed and scared the offender off. Then an Asian boy made lewd comments to a  21-year-old woman as she left a library before attacking her. In the third attack, on October 5, a 32-year-old was approached by two Asian boys and assaulted by one. Detective Constable Pam Collins said the attacker also made violent threats to the women. Detective Constable Pam Collins from Longsight Police Station said: 'After speaking to the women, we have managed to complete an evofit of the offender. As you can see from the image he looks fairly young which makes these assaults even more shocking.

Instead, it looked like we were in the red-light district: women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys. Nepthys didn't need to warn me not to speak to them. He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted, like a saint under G d's light, and handcuffed.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80\\" appears to lean more towards neutral or even positive rather than negative. Sentiment analysis involves determining whether the sentiment of a certain piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. It's often used to interpret and sort large volumes of text, like customer reviews or responses to surveys, so businesses or organizations can better understand customer behaviors and opinions. The sentence at hand doesn't directly indicate any overt positive or negative sentiment. There's no particular complaint nor praise, no distinct expression of a positive emotion such as joy or satisfaction nor a negative one such as anger or dissatisfaction. Thus, taken on its own, the sentence can be seen as fairly neutral. However, it could be implied that the sentiment is somewhat positive because it enforces a healthy practice of self-awareness or self-maintenance. The phrase \\"stay in touch with your own skin\\" could be interpreted as a suggestion to maintain good physical health, a comfortable level of self-acceptance, or consistent self-inspection across different stages in life (from 18 to 80). Promoting such a concept can be considered a positive sentiment as it contributes to positive self-image, self-awareness, or overall health. Thus, if we had to choose between negative and positive, the sentiment appears slightly more positive. Nevertheless, the sentiment could vary based on the context in which the sentence is presented, especially since its metaphorical language leaves room for multiple interpretations. But as a stand-alone sentence, it's safe to conclude that this sentence has a more neutral or potentially positive sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:I read this background article the other day: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.  I am facing a new situation today: Scientists are performing an audio experiment on a volunteer. Chris is sat in a chair, and two different sounds will be played for him as the scientists observe his reactions. Sound X has a high decibel level and sound Y has a lower decibel level.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sound is less likely to make Chris lose hearing? A:","output":"To answer the question correctly, we must follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the relationship between decibel levels and loudness. From the background article, we know that higher decibel levels correspond to greater intensity and loudness of sound. For every 10-decibel increase, the loudness is 10 times greater. Step 2: Identify the sounds and their decibel levels. In the new situation, we have two sounds - Sound X with a high decibel level and Sound Y with a lower decibel level. Step 3: Determine the risk of hearing loss. According to the background article, high-decibel sounds are dangerous and can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Step 4: Compare the sounds and their risks. Since Sound X has a higher decibel level and Sound Y has a lower decibel level, Sound X is more intense and louder than Sound Y. Step 5: Answer the question. Based on the information provided, Sound Y is less likely to make Chris lose hearing because it has a lower decibel level, and therefore, poses less risk to his ears."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What do the amount of X mean on a text message? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"When British people put an \\"X\\" at the end of a text message or email, it stands for a kiss. This practice is established in British culture and is broadly equivalent to adding a friendly, affectionate, or casual touch to the communication. The act isn't always romantic in nature. It can be used among friends, family, partners, and sometimes even in professional environments, although using it in a professional context would be subject to the existing relationship or the nature of the communication.  The \\"X\\" itself was linked to the middle ages when a cross was drawn on documents or letters to mean 'Christ'. This implied faith, honesty, and sincerity. People would then kiss this cross as a sign of affirming the sentiments expressed in the letter. With time, this has transformed into the digital culture of adding an \\"X\\" at the end of messages or emails to mean an expression of friendliness, warmth, or love. As for the number of \\"X\\"s in the text message, the general rule is the the more X's , the stronger the level of friendship or intimacy between the correspondents, or the stronger the emotional message being communicated. However, this rule isn't hard and fast and varies greatly among different individuals. Some might never use an \\"X\\", whereas others may use one, multiple, or even a string of \\"X\\" depending on the person they are communicating with and the nature of the conversation. Therefore, the exact meaning of the number of X’s is very subjective and can differ even among the British population. Lastly, to address your final question, while the two initial questions are related, they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question is asking for the meaning when an “X” is used at the end of messages or emails by British people, whereas the second question is requesting an understanding about what the quantity of \\"X\\"s signifies in a text message. The second question could apply to any culture that uses X's in this way, not just British, thus making these as separate questions each covering different aspects of the meaning and use of \\"X\\" in text messages and emails."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Secondly, although the reviewer comments about the order in which the OVA and Season 2 were watched (displaying a small level of dissatisfaction), they do not expressly clarify it as a negative factor impacting their viewing experience, instead portraying it as a suggestible improvement, which doesn't necessarily drive the review into negative territory.

This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.  Please answer this question : Which country released more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere? A:","output":"Based on the given situation and the hint provided, it is clear that India, which decided to use fossil fuels to produce their electricity, released more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than Nepal, which decided to go renewable and use only hydro power to produce their electricity. The combustion of fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and natural gas, leads to the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. These greenhouse gases contribute to global warming or global climate change, as they trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere, increasing Earth's temperature. In this case, India's choice to rely on fossil fuels for electricity production results in a higher release of CO2 and other greenhouse gases compared to Nepal's decision to utilize hydro power. Hydroelectric power, on the other hand, is a renewable energy source that harnesses the power of flowing water to produce electricity. This method of power generation emits extremely low levels of greenhouse gases compared to fossil fuels. Since Nepal has chosen to rely on hydroelectric power, their greenhouse gas emissions are significantly lower than India's, which is using fossil fuels.

Write a title for this article: It is the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, and I thought the following two pieces might be of interest to this blog’s readers. The first is a column by Charles C.W. Cooke in the National Review (yes, that National Review), “The GOP’s Conspicuous Absence from Selma.” The entire thing is worth reading, but here is the conclusion: If we are to regard the founding generation as being worthy of contemporary political lionization — and we most assuredly should — then we must consider those who marched at Selma to be so, too. If we are to put George Washington upon our plinths, and to eulogize him on our currency, we must agree to elevate Martin Luther King Jr. to the same dizzy heights. They are less famous, perhaps, but by virtue of their brave march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, John Lewis and Hosea Williams immortalized themselves into quintessential American heroes in the mold of Sam Adams and George Mason. To miss an opportunity to solemnize their daring is to blunder, disgracefully. If all men really are created equal, the anniversary of Selma must be treated as a date every bit as important to American history as is the end of the Siege of Yorktown. As it would be unthinkable for the leadership of the Republican party to ignore July Fourth, it should be unthinkable for its luminaries not to celebrate the anniversary of the March to Montgomery either. Where have you gone, Speaker Boehner, a movement turns its lonely eyes to you. The second is an op-ed by Ronald Krotoszynski in the L.A. Times (via Tyler Cowen) which discusses the federal district court order that paved the way for the march to Montgomery: The ruling opened the way for hundreds to march down U.S. 80, culminating with a 25,000-person protest in front of the Alabama State Capitol. Speaking there, King famously asked, “How long?” and answered “Not long. Because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.” Selma still represents the pinnacle of the use of peaceful protests to secure civil rights and reform the government. Today, it would be impossible to obtain a federal court order permitting a five-day protest march on a 52-mile stretch of a major U.S. highway. Under contemporary legal doctrine, the Selma protests would have ended March 8, 1965.

During a visit to Southend Airport to open its new terminal she gave us an insight into her thinking. \\"We've got to make sure there is the level of capacity at our airports that we need, not just in the next 10 to 15 years but the next 20 to 30 years.\\" \\"We are getting to the stage where there is a question mark over whether we've got the capacity to meet the country's needs.\\" \\"In the short term we've always been clear that we need to make the most of the capacity we do have. \\"We need to use what we've got better and more effectively and we're looking at how we do that, but we also need to look ahead.\\" And it's that concern that has prompted the consultation. Ms Greening does not want to prejudice proceedings but says the debate must be based on \\"real facts and figures and details around logistics, operations and airspace - then we'll have some of the information we need to make the right decision\\". She will not be drawn on whether the ultimate conclusion of this consultation will be a call for more runways or a new airport but she does rule out a third runway at Heathrow which is \\"not the right answer\\". Proposals to build a new airport in the Thames are met with a more sanguine response. \\"This is the time for people to bring forward proposals on this issue,\\" she says. The aviation industry has been pushing for some time for the government to tackle this issue. \\"There is a capacity issue in the South East - it's probably a bit late but now is the time to do it,\\" says Carolyn McCall, chief executive of Easyjet. \\"There is a real opportunity to have an aviation policy which is long term and which addresses the need for a hub airport but also looks at needs elsewhere.\\" The transport secretary was opening the new Â£100 million terminal at Southend Airport. Next month Easyjet will launch services to nine European destinations, and other airlines are expected to move in as well. \\"This is a real vote of confidence in Southend,\\" said Ms Greening, who pointed out that this bit of airport expansion has created 500 extra jobs. It's also the first piece of airport expansion in the South East for more than 20 years. Southend hopes to handle two million passengers a year. That will help ease capacity in the South East but it won't solve the problem. That's for Ms Greening to work out.","output":"Transport Secretary Justine Greening will launch a discussion paper addressing the capacity issue at airports in the South East and explore options for better utilization or potential expansion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, let's start with the equation: 38 * u - 28 * u = 10 This is like saying you've got 38 teddy bears all belonging to \\"U\\", but then you gave 28 teddy bears away also from \\"U\\". You'd want to know how many teddy bears each \\"U\\" represents.  So, we subtract 28 from 38 (since you're giving away 28 teddies) which gives us:  38 - 28 = 10 So, the equation after this would be 10 * u = 10.  If we said that 10 teddy bears times some number equals to 10 teddy bears total, the only way it'd really make sense is if \\"U\\", or our unknown number of teddy bears, was just 1, right? So we divide 10 by 10 to get our final value of u: 10 ÷ 10 = 1 So there we have it! \\"U\\" or our number of teddy bears would have to be 1 in order for this problem to make sense!  So u = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: cameron was a police officer so he asked the man a question.  Given the question \\"How would Others feel as a result?\\", is \\"as content\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","output":"Yes, \\"as content\\" can be considered a valid answer to the question \\"How would Others feel as a result?\\" in this context. However, it is important to provide a more detailed explanation to support the answer. When Cameron, a police officer, asks the man a question, his intention is likely to gather information, investigate a situation, or determine if any assistance is needed. In this context, the question \\"How would Others feel as a result?\\" is seeking to understand the emotional response or impact on those involved in or affected by the situation being discussed. The answer \\"as content\\" suggests that the result of the situation or action being considered might be beneficial or bring about a feeling of satisfaction for others. It indicates that others may feel pleased, comfortable, or satisfied with the outcome. However, it may be important to elaborate on this answer and provide examples, reasons, or evidence to illustrate why people would feel content in this particular situation. For instance, if the situation being discussed is a new program implemented by the police department for community engagement, answering \\"as content\\" could mean that the community members and the police officers both feel satisfied and happy with the new arrangement. The answer would be strengthened with more context, such as explaining how the new program is addressing concerns, improving communication, and promoting safety. In summary, \\"as content\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"How would Others feel as a result?\\", but providing more details and context would enhance the validity and usefulness of the answer."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: Where does Nicky have to go on his quest? Movie plot title: Little Nicky Movie plot: In this very unusual comedy, the devil meets an angel at a certain heaven-hell mixer; both drunk, they have a rendez-vois that produces three kids who somehow end up living in hell with the devil. The movie starts with a picture of hell - a guy falls off a tree spying on a woman taking off her clothes in her own house, ends up in hell. The three kids - Adrian, Cassius, and Nicky - are each very different. Cassius and Adrian live up to their rep of being the devil's children, while Nicky isn't 'into evil,' and is shown as a 'papa's boy.' The movie starts with Cassius and Adrian conspiring to take over Earth by leaving hell and messing up the balance between good and evil, thus taking power over everyone in the process. Their departure 'freezes the fire' through which souls enter hell, however, and the devil begins to fall apart, since no new souls can enter. He sets his only son left, Nicky, on a quest to go to Earth, find his brothers, and trap them in a silver flask, since they have to return to hell at the same time. Nicky hesitantly takes his father's orders and, with the help of a talking dog his father asked to help, settles into an apartment with a wannabe actor. He's soon found by two devil-worshiping guys who help him retrieve his flask as it's stolen by a petty thief. The guys befriend him and stand by his side against his brothers. Nicky also meets a girl he gets infatuated with, though he doesn't tell her the truth about him yet. She helps get his flask back from the thief, and they... hit it off. He's able to track down one of his brothers - Cassius - as he possesses the referee at a Globetrotters game. Adrian turns out to be far more witty and doesn't fall for a trap Nicky and all his new friends set up for him at a subway station. Meanwhile, the city of New York becomes unbalanced after the work the two brothers do to destroy it. Adrian summons hundreds of 'followers' who gather to have him lead them on in the end. However, he tells them that at midnight the whole city will turn into hell and... Answer:","output":"Nicky has to go on his quest to Earth to find his brothers, Cassius and Adrian, and trap them in a silver flask.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing...

Question: what is ronnie winslow accused of stealing? Movie title: The Winslow Boy Movie plot: Until I saw this recently on TCM, I'd never heard of it: the youngest of a staid Edwardian England family is expelled from a Royal Navy prep school for stealing; father goes thru extraordinary lengths to clear his son's name. English actor Robert Donat was a heartthrob of the period: he portrays barrister (English version of our litigator or trial lawyer) Sir Robert Morton, an expensive, what-we'd-call corporate attorney; after several false starts, including a debate in the House of Commons (over what in English law was basically a lawsuit against the Crown), Sir Robert accepts the case.The centerpiece here is Sir Robert's interrogation of young Ronnie, the defendant, in the boy's home, in front of his rapidly deteriorating father & antagonistic, suffragette sister. Sir Robert's battery of questions quickly turns into an 18-K cross-examination, the kind he knows the boy can expect in court, over vehement objections from his family. Meanwhile, the case & the Winslow family become objects of public ridicule & derision.Also interesting are the ways family members change: in the beginning, Pop Winslow (played with Cedric Hardwicke's usual aplomb) seems the most value-rigid & proper fish in a sea of rebels (Lindy Hops, cigarets); gradually, it's pop that must convince even feminist daugher Katy to stay the course.

However, inflation continued to erode GDP gains, with an average rate of 12.6% expected at the end of 2011. Although GDP has risen steadily since 2002 at the rate of 7.5% in an official 2006 estimate, the state is still working to overcome a sizable trade deficit. The Economist predicted this trade deficit of 14% of Mongolias GDP would transform into a surplus in 2013. Answer this question based on the article: How many banks were not taken into receivership?","output":"In the article, it says 2 out of the 16 commercial banks were taken into receivership. To find the number of banks not taken into receivership, we need to subtract the 2 taken into receivership from the total number of 16 banks. So, 16 banks minus 2 banks equals 14 banks. Therefore, 14 banks were not taken into receivership."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

However, if you want to know how it is spelled using the Cyrillic script, which is used in the Russian language, it would be written as \\"Сергей Виноградов.\\" Here is some more information about each part of the name: 1. Сергей (Sergei): This is a common given name in Russia and derives from the Latin name \\"Sergius.\\" This name has been used by many notable Russians, including historical figures, scientists, athletes, and artists. In the Cyrillic script, it is spelled as \\"Сергей.\\" 2. Виноградов (Vinogradov): This is a Russian patronymic surname, which means it is derived from the father’s first name or a nickname. In this case, \\"Vinogradov\\" comes from the Russian word \\"виноград\\" (vinograd), meaning \\"grape.\\" It suggests that an ancestor of the person with this surname may have been a grape or wine seller, or perhaps owned vineyards.

Article:The disclosure comes amid reports Portuguese authorities have given permission for sites in Praia da Luz, where the toddler went missing, to be searched. Met Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said he would be unable to provide details of  the activity. But he said he believed it would occur \\"in the coming weeks\\". By Richard BiltonBBC News Seven years since Madeleine McCann disappeared, the spotlight once again falls on the little town Praia da Luz and the search for a lost girl. But the back story is the relationship between two countries, and two police forces. On Tuesday, a Portuguese prosecutor confirmed that a series of requests from British police for investigative work in Portugal have been approved. And later - in an open letter - the Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said activity is to begin soon. But there was more. Mr Rowley urged the media to avoid speculation; to think of the impact it might have on the investigation. That is because the Portuguese police and not the British will carry out any work in Praia da Luz. British officers will simply be observers. Without the co-operation of the Portuguese Policia Judiciaria, the British efforts will not get far. The relationship between the forces has been difficult at times. Officers in both countries have told me of their frustrations. Both have active and separate investigations. Leaks and speculation could fatally undermine their co-operation. It seems an upsurge in police activity is about to start. If it is to be successful, this sometimes uneasy relationship will need to survive. A letter was sent to media editors amid speculation about excavation work. Mr Rowley asked them to \\"think carefully\\" about information they published. Madeleine was three when she went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Algarve, in May 2007. A request to search a number of sites was among a series of requests made to police in Portugal by British detectives working on the case, according to reports. Mr Rowley said he had discussed the case with his opposite number in Portugal and highlighted the \\"high levels of interest\\" the activity would generate in the British media. He said Portuguese police did not provide the media with updates on ongoing investigations. Activity would cease if police in Britain gave out information or news reporters caused any disruption to their work in Portugal, he added. Mr Rowley said the Portuguese authorities had been \\"more bureaucratic and slower\\" at processing requests than his team had wished. But he asked the media to respect their requests as they carried out the work. \\"We do not want to undermine our prospects of providing Mr and Mrs McCann with answers in this tragic case,\\" he said. It comes after the seventh anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance was marked on Saturday. Gerry McCann, Madeleine's father, expressed his family's gratitude that the Metropolitan Police team was now moving on to a \\"very active\\" phase in its investigation. He said at the weekend: \\"They are chipping away and obviously there is new evidence so we are going to continue to hope that we will get a happy outcome.\\" Kate McCann also disclosed last week that she returns to the Portuguese resort where her daughter disappeared to \\"walk those streets\\" and \\"look for answers\\" once or twice each year. She also backed a revamped alert system triggered when missing children are kidnapped or their lives are at risk - known as Child Rescue Alerts. Scotland Yard launched a fresh investigation - codenamed Operation Grange - into Madeleine's disappearance last July, two years into a review of the case, and made renewed appeals for information. In March, British police said they were seeking an intruder who sexually abused five girls in Portugal between 2004 and 2006. Detectives say the attacks happened in holiday villas occupied by UK families in the Algarve.

Given the following context:  It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person who dispatched a force with Odo in tow?

The party says those blocked included film director Ken Loach, journalist Toby Young and Tory MP Tim Loughton. Mr Loach hit back at Labour's claim he had been prevented from taking part in the leadership election. The film director quit the Labour Party some years ago over its \\"drift to the right\\" and is now a member of Left Unity, a left wing group formed last year. He believed he was entitled to a vote in Labour's leadership contest as a union member - but Labour's rules have changed recently so that trade unionists have to register as \\"affiliated supporters\\". Mr Loach said he did this but then decided not vote after reading the \\"small print\\" - voters have to sign up to Labour's aims and values. Mr Loach told BBC News: \\"I do not support the politics of the current leadership in the Labour Party and Left Unity was founded to uphold the interests of working class people, the very values that Labour had abandoned\\". People have until noon on Wednesday to apply to take part as a member or supporter, with the first ballot papers sent out on Friday. Labour says it has a \\"robust system to prevent fraudulent or malicious applications\\" after claims that Conservatives and members of \\"hard left\\" groups were signing up in order to back left wing candidate Jeremy Corbyn. Among the 1,200 were 214 people from the Green Party, 37 from the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, 13 Tories, seven from UKIP and one from the BNP. Also thought to have been blocked from voting were: Labour said verification checks would continue even once votes had been cast.

The party has 48 members of staff working at a call centre in Newcastle, sifting through applications. Acting leader Harriet Harman has also written to local Labour parties and MPs, asking them to check for suspicious names. Mr Loach, whose left wing party fielded 10 candidates at the general election, said: \\"I did not apply to join the party. I make political contributions through my affiliated union and assumed that that gave me the right to vote.\\" A Labour spokesman said: \\"The party has an absolute focus on ensuring that the rules agreed in 2014 for electing the new party leadership are complied with and the integrity of the process is upheld.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"The Labour Party is choosing a new leader and lots of people want to join and vote in this election.

Article: I once did a year of voluntary service in a residential home for people with learning disabilities. was set in an English village deep in the countryside, quite different from my home in Sweden. One of my fellow volunteers, a girl from Tanzania, seemed a little unhappy, so I asked what the problem was. She told me she had a friend back home who had financial difficulties and maybe it was impossible for her to complete her university courses. So this friend of mine had sent all her money to Tanzania to support her friend! This meant that she didn't have much food to eat and no money to go anywhere outside the village. I was so touched and I felt I had to do something. So, during my next trip to one of the nearby towns I walked into a shop. I didn't have much money left myself but I thought I'd buy her an extra box of chocolate we both liked and some rice. I started talking to the woman(also a volunteer)working in the shop and eventually told her about my friend. The woman looked at me, amazed. \\"Does she eat pasta?\\" she asked. \\"Yes,\\" I replied. She immediately started loading a bag with pasta, cookies, and other things until the bag was full. \\"Give her this for me. It's my treat!'' I couldn't believe it but accepted with happiness. As I left the shop to go home with my unexpected bag of food, I asked the woman her name. \\"Just Gloria,\\" she said. Imagine my friend's face when I arranged the gifts on my kitchen table and fetched her from her room to see! I had never seen her so happy! A few weeks later she found Gloria in the shop and thanked her in person. These two extraordinary women really showed me what true kindness and compassion are, and the impression will stay with me for the rest of my life! Question: From the text, we know that    _    .

How to jump 6 to 12 inches higher and run faster  Start the exercises by first warming up your muscles.  Stretch legs and arms, and jog around for a few minutes.  Stand up and sit down.  (I). Slowly bend at the knees keeping your back straight. Crouch down as low as possible arms on your waist and slowly rise back up.. (II). Switch legs, keep your knees square in your center and lean forward. Your muscles are ready, and feel amazing! Lean over 90 degrees back, with your elbows bent.. (III). Just stay balanced for the first couple of times. Lift a leg and turn it side to side.. (IV). Once your muscles are warmed up, stand up quickly and walk yourself up to the top of the stairs. Lower the weights from your arms to the point between your shoulders.. Answer:","output":"(V). Now that your muscles are warmed up and ready for action, it's time to implement exercises that will help increase your jumping height and speed. Incorporate plyometric exercises into your workout routine, such as squat jumps, box jumps, and bounds. These exercises focus on explosive movements and help develop the fast-twitch muscle fibers necessary for increasing your vertical jump and sprinting speed. (VI). Begin with squat jumps by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and performing a regular squat. As you reach the lowest point in your squat, explode upwards by jumping as high as possible. Be sure to land softly on the balls of your feet and immediately transition into the next squat jump. Complete 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions. (VII). For box jumps, find a sturdy box or platform that is at a challenging but manageable height. Stand in front of the box with your feet shoulder-width apart, squat down, and explode upwards to jump on top of the box. Step down carefully, and repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions. (VIII). To perform bounds, find an open area with enough space for you to run and jump. Begin by sprinting at a moderate pace and then forcefully push off the ground, propelling yourself forward while simultaneously jumping as high as possible. Land on your opposite foot and continue bounding forward for approximately 10-12 leaps. Rest for 45-60 seconds and complete 3 sets. (IX). In addition to plyometric exercises, strengthen your leg muscles by incorporating weight training exercises such as squats, lunges, leg presses, and deadlifts. These exercises will help build the necessary muscle to support greater jumping heights and faster running speeds. Aim for 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions for each exercise, and be sure to prioritize proper form for maximum results. (X). Don't forget to prioritize your core muscles, as these are essential for maintaining balance and stability during explosive movements. Incorporate exercises such as planks, Russian twists, and leg raises into your training routine to strengthen your core. (XI). Consistently challenge yourself by gradually increasing the difficulty of your exercises, whether that means adding more weight, jumping on a higher box, or increasing the distance of your bounds. This will help you progressively improve and continue to develop the necessary strength and power for higher jumps and faster running speeds. (XII). Finally, ensure that you are fueling your body with proper nutrition and allowing for adequate rest and recovery time. A balanced diet, with a focus on consuming lean proteins, wholesome carbohydrates, and healthy fats, will support muscle growth and repair. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to give your body the opportunity to rejuvenate and recover from strenuous workouts. By incorporating these strategies and exercises into your training routine, you can increase your jumping height by 6 to 12 inches and improve your overall running speed. Remember to listen to your body and adjust your training accordingly to optimize your results and avoid injury. Dedication, consistent effort, and a focused mindset are key elements on your journey to unlocking your full athletic potential."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the sentence \\"The team did not enter in 1960, and they failed to qualify in 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984, and 2008.\\" answer the question \\"In which five years did England fail to qualify for the UEFA European Championship?\\"","output":"The sentence \\"The team did not enter in 1960, and they failed to qualify in 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984, and 2008\\" does not completely answer the question \\"In which five years did England fail to qualify for the UEFA European Championship?\\" Firstly, the sentence offers more than five years: 1960, 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984, and 2008. However, there is a key distinction in the sentence that we need to take into consideration; the distinction between \\"not entering\\" and \\"failing to qualify.\\" These are two different situations.  The sentence starts by stating that the team did not enter in 1960. Not entering a tournament is different from failing to qualify for it. If a team doesn't enter, it means that for whatever reason, they chose not to participate in that year's championship. Thus, in this case, England didn't even attempt to qualify. Then the sentence lists the years that the team failed to qualify which are 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984, and 2008. Failing to qualify indicates that the team did enter and participate in the qualification rounds of the championship, but was unsuccessful in making it to the final tournament. So, if the question specifically asks for the years England failed to qualify, the sentence's statement about 1960 should not be considered because it refers to a year the team did not enter, not a year they failed to qualify. Therefore, the years that England failed to qualify for the UEFA European Championship, according to the sentence, are 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984, and 2008. These are the years mentioned in the sentence where they tried to qualify but were unsuccessful, fitting the question's criteria. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"In which five years did England fail to qualify for the UEFA European Championship?\\" based on the provided sentence would be: 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984, and 2008."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Washington (CNN) -- Massachusetts Sen.-elect Scott Brown arrived on Capitol Hill on Thursday, two days after pulling off a once-unthinkable victory that has bolstered Republicans nationwide and reformulated the political calculus in Washington. Brown was scheduled to meet with several senior Republican and Democratic senators. During his visit, he took on the aura of a virtual celebrity, surrounded by dozens of reporters, aides, and well-wishers. Brown, a state senator who defeated Democratic state Attorney General Martha Coakley on Tuesday, is the first Massachusetts Republican to win a U.S. Senate race since 1972. His win stripped Democrats of their filibuster-proof 60-seat Senate supermajority and has forced the Obama White House to reconsider its options for passing a health care bill. One of the problems with OPTIONS: - Brown is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - CNN is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - Capitol Hill is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - Democratic is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - Democrats is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - Martha Coakley is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - Massachusetts is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - Obama is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - Republican is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - Republicans is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - Scott Brown is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - Senate is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - U.S. is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - U.S. Senate is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - Washington is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. - White House is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters.","output":"One of the problems with Democrats is that \\"there seems to be no transparency\\" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters.

Update: Family Research Council guard shot by gunman      A security guard at the Family Research Council was shot and wounded Wednesday morning after a scuffle with a man who expressed disagreement with the group’s conservative views in the lobby of the group’s headquarters in downtown Washington, authorities said.      D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier said the shooter walked into the lobby of the building at about 10:45 and was confronted by the security guard as if the guard were asking him where he was going.      The man then took out a gun and opened fire on the guard, Lanier said. The guard and others wrestled the man to the ground, disarmed him and waited for police, she said. The guard was then taken to the hospital and is in stable condition, the chief said. FBI officials said the guard was shot in the arm.            View Photo Gallery: A security guard a was shot and wounded after a scuffle with a man who expressed disagreement with the group’s conservative views.      “The security guard here is a hero, as far as I’m concerned,” Lanier said. ”He did his job. The person never made it past the front.”      The shooter is in FBI custody and has not yet been charged, authorities said. A law enforcement official said at one point in the scuffle, the shooter expressed views that differed from those of the Family Research Council. The official also said the shooter was carrying a bag that had a Chick-Fil-A bag inside. Chick-Fil-A’s chief executive has expressed similar views against same-sex marriage as the Research Council.      Although authorities did not identify the alleged shooter, two law enforcement officials said he was Floyd Lee Corkins II, 28, of Herndon. He has not been charged.      Authorities also did not name the security guard. But Darin Miller, a spokesman for the Family Research Council, said he was Leo Johnson, who works for the council and not for a private security agency.      The Family Research Council is a conservative organization that deals in issues of faith, family and freedom, according to its Web site. The site says the organization is against abortion and euthanasia and considers homosexuality to be a sin.      “The police are investigating this incident,” FRC President Tony Perkins said in a statement. “Our first concern is with our colleague who was shot today. Our concern is for him and his family.”      A spokesman from the FRC declined further comment just before noon Wednesday.      James McJunkin, the head of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, said authorities do not yet know why the person entered the building or why he started shooting.      “We don’t know enough about him or his circumstances to determine what his connection is to this group [the research council] or his mental state, or what he was doing or thinking of doing,” McJunkin said. “So we’re going to try to sort this all out, pull the evidence together, do all the interviews we can.”      McJunkin and Lanier said they did not yet know whether the FBI or the D.C. Police would take the lead on the shooting investigation.      “The possibility is that it could involve circumstances that it could involve a federal crime that would be investigated by the FBI,” McJunkin said.      They are investigating whether the shooting was an act of domestic terrorism, a hate crime or something else.      Law enforcement officials said the shooter parked his car at the East Falls Church Metro station and took the train downtown. At about 3 p.m., investigators were towing two vehicles from the East Falls Church station.      The building is not far from the Verizon Center and the Gallery Place Metro station in one of the busiest places in the city. It is near several museums, restaurants and shops and was teeming with tourists on Wednesday.      Authorities advised drivers to use H and E Streets during the police investigation.

Police and federal agents were investigating what prompted the suspect, identified by the FBI as Floyd Lee Corkins II, to walk into the group's headquarters about 10:45 a.m. and open fire.      Corkins, is from Herndon, a suburb of Washington, the FBI said in a statement about the charge.      The guard helped wrestle the gunman to the ground.

Q:Process:  - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored.  suppose more food is in the body happens, how will it affect the liver turns more glucagon into glucose.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation in this case would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. To better understand this, let's review the process and the role of different components in maintaining blood sugar levels. 1. Blood sugar drops in the body: This occurs when the body has used up or stored the glucose from the food that has been consumed. As a result, the blood glucose level decreases. 2. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon: When the pancreas detects low blood sugar levels, it releases the hormone glucagon. Glucagon signals the liver to release stored glucose to raise blood sugar levels. 3. The liver turns glucagon into glucose: The liver has the ability to convert glucagon into glucose. This process is called glycogenolysis, which involves the breakdown of glycogen stored in the liver into glucose. 4. The liver releases glucose into the blood: Once the glucose is produced through glycogenolysis, the liver releases it into the bloodstream to increase blood sugar levels. 5. Blood sugar levels are restored: As glucose is released into the blood, the blood sugar levels rise, providing the body with the necessary energy. Now, let's examine how the presence of more food in the body would affect this process. When there is more food in the body, the primary effect would be an increase in blood glucose levels. Since the body has an adequate supply of glucose from the consumed food, the pancreas will also release insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose levels by signaling cells to absorb glucose from the bloodstream. This would then cause the blood sugar levels to stabilize or even drop. Due to the increase in blood glucose, the pancreas would not release glucagon, as it only does so when there is low blood sugar. This means the liver does not receive the signal to produce more glucose through glycogenolysis. The presence of more food in the body would indirectly impact step 2 of the process, where cells in the pancreas release glucagon. Since the blood glucose levels are already high due to the additional food, there is no need for glucagon to be released, ultimately affecting the subsequent steps in the process, as the liver would not be signaled to turn glucagon into glucose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package ru.gelin.android.sendtosd.","output":"Title: Extremely Disappointing and Frustrating App Experience Review: I really hate to give 1-star reviews, as I understand that developers put in a lot of hard work to create their applications. However, my experience with the 'ru.gelin.android.sendtosd' app has been nothing short of a massive disappointment, and I honestly felt compelled to share my thoughts and warn others before they waste their time like I did. To start with, the user interface (UI) of the app feels outdated and clunky. It looks as if it was designed years ago and hasn't been updated since. The navigation is far from user-friendly, often making it extremely hard to find the functions and features I needed. For a file management app aimed at providing an efficient way to send files to an SD card, this UI is not conducive to productivity. Performance-wise, the app is very slow and unresponsive. I experienced multiple crashes and freezing during my short time using the app. At times, it took so long for the app to load or respond to my actions that I had to force close it and restart. This became an extremely frustrating cycle that only added to my dissatisfaction with the app. Another major issue I have with the 'ru.gelin.android.sendtosd' app is its overall functionality. For an app that claims to aid in moving files to an SD card, it does an abysmal job of supporting various file types and formats. I discovered that a number of files I attempted to move were not recognized by the app, rendering its primary function essentially useless. Furthermore, the app often failed to recognize my SD card, giving me errors when trying to send files to it. It took multiple restarts and, in some cases, reformatting my SD card to get the app to recognize it. Even then, the success rate of moving files was incredibly low. Lastly, the lack of updates and support from the developers is a huge drawback. Other users have previously reported similar issues, but it appears that no effort has been made to improve or even maintain the quality of the app. It's disheartening to see an app with potential go to waste due to negligence on the part of the developers. In conclusion, the 'ru.gelin.android.sendtosd' app has been a highly frustrating and disappointing experience, and I strongly advise against wasting your time on it. As it stands currently, the app fails to deliver on its promises and is rife with issues that have not been addressed by the developers. There are far more reliable and user-friendly file management apps available that actually live up to their claims, so I encourage you to look elsewhere for your file-moving needs."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an input list A.

But Santa Claus didn't spot the secret camera that was set up to film him as he delivered presents to one young American boy and his family. Seven-year-old Evan readied the small device to capture what happened in his living room once everyone had gone to sleep on Christmas Eve. Christmas miracle: Seven-year-old Evan, right, can't believe what the camera captured after he went to sleep. The next morning, after presents were opened, he and his family gathered around the computer to see whether Santa Claus had visited - with a second camera recording Evan's face as he watched. A clip of both videos - played alongside each other - was posted online by a member of Evan's family. The video starts with Evan's older brother setting up his GoPro camera in the empty living room. The seven-year-old becomes increasingly doubtful when nothing appears as the camera speeds through hours of footage from the room. Hidden camera: Evan's brother (left) sets up the device in the family living room on Christmas Eve. Jingle bells: The boy's face lights up as he hears what sounds like hooves and footsteps on the roof. Magic: Evan's eys are fixed on the screen as a kitchen light switches on and a cloud of smoke appears. One family member suggests that perhaps the camera didn't capture anything, while another says that Santa Claus needs to be sure that everyone is asleep. But then Evan hears the distant jingle of bells and stomp of reindeer hooves. He looks around excitedly and claps his hands - in disbelief that Father Christmas is so close. And just as his family start saying that maybe it was only sound that was captured, the man in the red suit appears in a burst of magical smoke. The man in the red suit: The seven-year-old squeals with delight as Santa Claus steps into the living room. Snack time: He giggles with his family as they watch Father Christmas munch on cookies left out for him. Wish list: With a click of his fingers, Santa makes the presents appear under the tree in a cloud of sparkle. Evan squeals with delight as he watches Santa enjoying the milk and cookies left out for him. Santa then turns towards the Christmas tree and snaps his fingers - making an impressive pile of perfectly-wrapped presents appear in a cloud of sparkle. Just after Evan remarks that Santa Claus hasn't noticed the camera, the man turns to face the camera, snaps his fingers, and the screen goes dark. The seven-year-old can hardly contain his glee - high-fiving his family and talking excitedly about what he just saw. He adds that he hope Santa doesn't put them on the naughty list for filming him. Caught: Santa turns to face the camera and waggles his finger at Evan after spotting the hidden camera. Delighted: After the screen goes black, Evan turns to his family and claps his hands with glee. Mission accomplished: The seven-year-old turns around and high-fives his family, celebrating a job well done. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Evan, a seven-year-old boy, set up a secret camera in his living room on Christmas Eve to see if he could catch Santa Claus delivering presents.

Go and get a good education in the West': Osama Bin Laden’s extraordinary instructions to his young children            Osama Bin Laden told his children to live peacefully in the West where they would get a good education, his brother-in-law has revealed.      Zakaria al-Sadah, whose sister is the fifth wife of the Al-Qaeda leader, said Bin Laden did not want his children and grandchildren following in the same path of terrorism like him.      'He told his own children and grandchildren, go to Europe and America and get a good education,' according to an interview with Sadah in The Sunday Times.            Terror: Osama Bin Laden wanted his children to live in west where they would get a good education      Pakistani officials are refusing to release three of Bin Laden's wives and nine of his children who are being held in a tight security compound in Islamabad.      According to Sadah, who was recently reunited with his sister, his children have been left traumatised by the raid carried out by US Navy Seals on May 2 last year which killed Bin Laden.      The children were discovered hiding in Bin Laden's compound in the Pakistan city of Abbottabad.            Sadah, a 24-year-old journalism student, says the children will not eat and have not seen the sun for nine months.            He said the worst affected was his 12-year-old daughter Safiyah, who held the head of her injured mother during the attack.            Protest: Amal, one of three wives, being held in Islamabad      Amal, a 29-year-old Yememi, and the two other wives, Khairiah and Siham, have gone on hunger strike to protest against their imprisonment, according to Sadah.            Sadah, who fears his sister could be charged with committing crimes against Pakistan, thought he would be given permission to take the children back to Yemin when he was asked to visit last November.      But Pakistani officials believe they could be hiding information and have so far refused to issue them with passports.            He said: 'These children have seen their father killed and they need a caring environment, not a prison - whatever you think of their father and what he has done.'      'They have never had a normal life. They do not know what it is like to see the sun and to run around the garden. It breaks my heart to see them.'            The wives are said to have remained loyal to their husband and were openly hostile to the U.S. officials who interviewed them after the raid.      None have been charged with any crime.

She lived in the Abbottabad compound with the two elder wives Khairiah Sabar, a child psychologist, and Siham Sabar, a teacher of Arabic.      Each wife and her children were allotted their own floor and Bin Laden would spend time with each group.      Khairiah, who was reportedly the 'spiritual mother' of the family, had slipped back into Pakistan to rejoin her husband after she had escaped to Iran and the Saudi Arabia.

This current is then harnessed as direct current (DC) electricity, which can be further converted to alternating current (AC) for use in homes and businesses. While some heat energy is inevitably produced as a byproduct during the process, the main purpose of a solar panel is to generate electricity, and therefore, \\"heat energy\\" is not the right answer."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves - The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them A:","output":"A: The final step in this process is the deposition of the sediment and eroded particles in the ocean. As the waves carry the new particles (sand, small rocks, and other sediments) back out into the ocean, the energy of the waves eventually decreases, causing the particles to settle and be deposited onto the ocean floor or in underwater landforms such as sandbars and deltas. This constant process of erosion, transportation, and deposition contributes to the dynamic and ever-changing nature of beaches and coastal ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One of our presidential candidates is clearly incapable of taking any heat. The other one has endured attack after politically motivated attack without losing her composure. Enough said. Can we infer the following? The other candidate has endured nothing.","output":"Based on the information provided, it seems that one of the presidential candidates has struggled in the face of criticism and challenging situations (\\"incapable of taking any heat\\"), while the other candidate has remained composed and resilient in the face of such obstacles (\\"endured attack after politically motivated attack without losing her composure\\"). It could be inferred from this statement that the first candidate has not withstood the heat of the political kitchen, while the other candidate has managed to handle the challenges and adversities of the political process. To say that the other candidate has \\"endured nothing\\" may not be an accurate assessment. The statement only implies that this candidate has not faced the same level of scrutiny, challenges, or politically motivated attacks as the opponent. However, it does not necessarily mean that they have faced no challenges at all. It is important to remember that running for any office, including the presidency, usually entails facing various forms of adversity, regardless of the degree. Therefore, it cannot be directly inferred that the other candidate has endured nothing - only that they have not demonstrated the same level of resilience or composure under the described circumstances as their opponent. In order to draw a more accurate conclusion about both candidates' ability to perform under pressure, it may be necessary to examine their respective records, responses to controversy, and past experiences in public office. By taking a more comprehensive approach, a clearer picture can emerge of each individual's capacity to handle the responsibilities of a high-stress position, such as the presidency. In summary, while the information provided suggests that one candidate has displayed a notable degree of composure and resilience in the face of adversity, it does not allow us to conclusively determine that the other candidate has \\"endured nothing.\\" Comparing and contrasting their experiences and responses to challenges can offer a more in-depth understanding of their ability to handle the demands of a high-pressure office like the White House."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. “What was your worst makeup disaster?” Do fingernails count? I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. Question: How long have the friends' been seated before the cigarette disaster occurred?

Please briefly summarize this news article: Southwest profits, but may stall growth until 2014 - Updated 12:50 p.m. ET Full flights, higher fares and fuel hedges gains helped Southwest overcome rising fuel costs to post a better-than-expect fourth-quarter profit. Still, despite the earnings new, Bloomberg News writes the jump in fuel prices are enough of a concern that Southwest \\"may delay any expansion to as late as 2014 as 100-a-barrel oil erodes profit growth, Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said.\\" PHOTO GALLERY: Southwest planes 'Evolve' with new upgradesALSO ONLINE: Southwest to add seats in first cabin overhaul since 2001ALSO ONLINE: AirTran must reinstate pilot who reported problemsPHOTOS: Items left behind on Southwest Airlines Kelly tells Bloomberg the airline's flights and seating capacity will stay flat in 2012. He adds to Bloomberg that \\"we haven't made a final decision about 2013 yet. I don't sense we're going to see a significant increase in capacity in 2013, if we have any at all.\\" Capacity, of course, is a key influencer of the industry's ability to dictate fares. Reigning in capacity helps carriers raise fares. Conversely, flooding the market with a raft of extra seats tips the scale more in the favor of price-conscious consumers. \\"Southwest has always been the bad boy for the industry,\\" Maxim Group analyst Ray Neidl says to Bloomberg. \\"Southwest is realizing they have to be a logical player as the other airlines reduce their costs and become more competitive.\\" As for Southwest's fourth-quarter earnings, the airline reported a profit of 152 million, up from 131 million a year earlier. \\"However,\\" The Associated Press writes, \\"the increase … came entirely from gains on fuel-hedging contracts. Without those one-time gains, Southwest would have earned 66 million, or 9 cents per share, down from adjusted income of 115 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.\\" \\"Still, the results beat analysts' prediction of 8 cents per share, according to FactSet,\\" AP adds. And despite the concerns on fuel costs, Reuters notes \\"Southwest forecast strong passenger revenue for the current quarter.\\" \\"Based on current traffic and booking trends, we expect another strong passenger revenue performance in the first quarter of 2012,\\" CEO Kelly is quoted as saying by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

The Financial Times writes \\"he also pointed to fleet modernization as a way to mitigate fuel-price risk, citing a 19 (billion) deal struck last month for 208 new Boeing aircraft, including 150 fuel-efficient versions of the popular 737.

Coroner Joey Vick said an autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death.      Joshua Adam Reese, 21, is being held as a person of interest.      Efforts to reach Dora Police Chief Jared Hall were not immediately successful today.      Reese was arrested in Jefferson County early Tuesday morning on a felony failure to appear violation from Walker County, said Jefferson County Sergeant Jack Self. Self said that Reese was arrested on Jackson Road between Pinson and Morris.      Reese, of Quinton, was charged with attempted murder in Jefferson County in 2013 after he allegedly hit a man over the head with a gun and tried to shoot him, court records show. He was later released on 50,000 bond and the case has yet to go to trial.      In September 2015, Reese was charged with public intoxication and possession of marijuana after an arrest in Jasper, according to court records. In January, Reese pleaded guilty and was fined and ordered to take part in substance abuse treatment.      Hawkins' body was found Tuesday in an area Vick referred to as an \\"illegal dump site.\\"      Walker County Sheriff James Underwood said the body was wrapped up in some sort of covering.      Chief Hall told WVTM 13 that Hawkins called his mother Saturday night and said Reese was trying to kill him.      \\"Nick Hawkins did name Joshua Adam Reese in the phone call to his mom, saying he was trying to kill him,\\" Hall told the station.      Ginger Doss worked with Hawkins at the McDonalds in Dora on Highway 78 and became good friends with the teen. She described Hawkins as a supportive and kind person.      \\"He was my support system and always encouraged me,\\" she said. \\"He was my backbone.\\"      \\"I'm devastated...I can't believe someone would want to do this.\\"      Hawkins worked at the McDonalds until three months ago, said the store manager. She said that Hawkins stopped coming into work and didn't call the restaurant.      \\"He told us he was moving to Winfield to get a better life,\\" Doss said.      Doss also knows Reese, the person of interest in the case.      \\"He's not a good person,\\" she said. He described his past, citing problems with drugs and domestic violence. She said she isn't surprised that he could have connections with the case.

When Time Warner Cable merged with Charter Communications earlier this year and the new public-facing operation rebranded, changing its name to Spectrum, it was likely for good reason. For many Americans, each name had come to be associated with poor customer service.      The long erosion of reputation has the power to destroy businesses. Today, in the internet age, news of a single scandal can spread quickly and seriously cripple a previously respected brand. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed a range of information, including customer survey results from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, employee reviews on Glassdoor, as well as our own annual customer satisfaction survey. We identified 12 companies hated by customers, employees, and the general public.      ALSO READ: America's Poorest Cities      A single bad experience can forever ruin a company’s image in the mind of a customer. While these are bound to happen at any organization, many of the companies on this list have developed a reputation for consistent poor performance. Most of the companies on this list score worse than the average in their industries in the ACSI. This fact is all the more serious given that many of these companies are in industries with generally poor reputations for customer service, including cable and internet service providers, airlines, and subscription television services.      In 24/7 Wall St.’s annual customer satisfaction survey, the majority of these companies had among the highest share of respondents reporting generally negative customer experiences. In the case of Comcast and Sprint, more than half of respondents had a negative customer experience, the only two existing brands out of the more than 100 we surveyed for which this was the case.      At several of the companies on this list, employee satisfaction is also extremely poor. 24/7 Wall St. spoke to Scott Dobroski, community expert at Glassdoor, a site that allows employees to rate their employment experience. Dobroski explained that it is not surprising to see unhappy employees and unsatisfied customers at the same businesses. “The risk when you have employees that are generally dissatisfied is that they are not willing to bring their best selves to work, to produce, to be engaged, and to fulfill responsibilities,\\" Dobroski said. \\"When employees are generally satisfied in their jobs -- we know that there's a direct tie to the customer experience.” Dish Network and Sears each have close to the worst employee satisfaction scores earned by large corporations on Glassdoor.      In the case of Sears, Dobroski suggested that poor employee satisfaction might also be tied to dread of the company failing, as Sears has been in dire financial straits for years. The company has averaged 1.65 billion in net losses over the last five fiscal years and closed hundreds of locations.      Several of the companies to make the list this year, rather than suffering from long-term damage to reputations, have only recently earned the ire of the general public. Pharmaceutical company Mylan has been exposed to severe public outcry after it was revealed the company hiked prices of life-saving allergy treatment EpiPen by more than 500%. Wells Fargo lost the public's trust after news broke the bank had created millions of fake accounts to inflate sales numbers.      To identify the most hated companies in America, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed a variety of metrics on customer service, employee satisfaction, and financial performance. We considered consumer surveys from a number of sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and a Zogby Analytics poll created in partnership with 24/7 Wall St. We also reviewed employee satisfaction based on worker opinion scores on Glassdoor — this is not a Glassdoor commissioned report. Finally, we reviewed management decisions and company policies that hurt a company’s public perception.

Still, Comcast has a significantly worse customer satisfaction score than either industry average.      Story continues ||||| Source: Wikimedia Commons      1. Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA)      The internet service provider and subscription television service industries are not known for superior customer service. In fact, the two industries have the worst average scores in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Still, Comcast has a significantly worse customer satisfaction score than either industry average.      The company’s internet services received the fourth worst score out of some 350 companies. In J.D. Power’s rating of major wireline services, only Time Warner Cable — recently subsumed by Charter — received as poor of an overall satisfaction score. In the same survey, Comcast received the worst scores in cost to consumer, performance, billing, and reliability. In 24/7 Wall St.’s annual customer satisfaction poll conducted in partnership with Zogby, nearly 55% of of respondents reported a negative experience with the company, the second worst of any corporation.      2. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC)      Bank of America has the worst customer satisfaction score of any bank in the ACSI. In a 24/7 Wall St.’s annual customer satisfaction poll, about 44% of those surveyed said they had a negative experience with both BofA’s banking and credit card operations, among the worst of any company surveyed. In addition to unhappy customers, the company has also has dissatisfied employees. The bank agreed to pay to settle a racial discrimination case involving 700 employees in August 2013 as well as a gender discrimination suit the following month.      While nearly a decade has passed since the financial crisis, many Americans still resent Bank of America for its role in the crisis. Although the bank has paid tens of billions of dollars to settle suits related to improper mortgage practices and toxic securities, the recent year seems to have brought more of the same. Only a few months after it was reported that CEO Brian Moynihan received a 23% pay raise in 2015, the bank agreed to pay yet another 415 million to settle a suit. This time the settlement was with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the way Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch handled customer money.      Source: mylan.com      3. Mylan (NASDAQ: MYL)      Several pharmaceutical companies gained national notoriety in 2016 for hiking up prices of certain life-saving drugs. Few received more attention than Mylan, which has come under heavy scrutiny after it raised the price of its emergency allergic reaction treatment EpiPen. Prices of the EpiPen, which can be life saving for those with severe allergies, increased by more than 500% — from 114 for two pens in 2007 to over 600 today.      The company attempted to quell the controversy by introducing a generic alternative of the drug, but the company faces at least one major class-action lawsuits for the perceived price gouging. In October, the company agreed to a 465 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice on the grounds that it had overcharged Medicaid for years by misclassifying the EpiPen. While the EpiPen was most publicized, the company has received criticism for sharply raising the prices of several other drugs as well. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Many American companies have developed a reputation for consistently poor performance, with some in industries such as cable and internet service providers, airlines, and subscription television services having worse scores than the average in their industries in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI).

This article: Against this background, a \\"great assembly\\" was organised by the Manchester Patriotic Union formed by radicals from the Manchester Observer. The newspaper's founder Joseph Johnson was the union's secretary. He wrote to Henry Hunt asking him to chair a meeting in Manchester on 2 August 1819. Johnson wrote: Nothing but ruin and starvation stare one in the face [in the streets of Manchester and the surrounding towns], the state of this district is truly dreadful, and I believe nothing but the greatest exertions can prevent an insurrection. Oh, that you in London were prepared for it. Unknown to Johnson and Hunt, the letter was intercepted by government spies and copied before being sent to its destination. The contents were interpreted to mean that an insurrection was being planned, and the government responded by ordering the 15th Hussars to Manchester.

The rest is just arguing over what age is the threshold for each activity. Does it follow that \\"There are arguements over what age is appropriate for each activity.\\"?  +yes. +it is not possible to tell. +no.","output":"Yes, it does follow that \\"There are arguments over what age is appropriate for each activity.\\" This is because various factors contribute to the complexity of determining the appropriate age threshold for different activities. Some of these factors are cultural, social, and individual differences that can significantly influence the perception of age appropriateness for various activities. Here are some factors that contribute to these arguments and the complexity of determining the age threshold for various activities: 1. Cultural factors: Different cultures have different perspectives on when a child should start engaging in specific activities, like attending school, dating, or taking on certain responsibilities. What might be deemed as appropriate at a certain age in one culture may be entirely unacceptable in another. Thus, cultural differences can lead to arguments over age appropriateness for various activities. 2. Social factors: Societal expectations play a crucial role in determining the age at which individuals should be allowed to engage in specific activities. For instance, in today's world, many people may argue that it is inappropriate for children to have access to smartphones at a young age, while others may argue that it is essential to expose them to technology early on. Social norms undoubtedly impact people's opinions about age suitability for certain activities, contributing to ongoing debates. 3. Legal factors: Laws and regulations have an obvious impact on age appropriateness for certain activities. For instance, the legal driving age varies depending on the jurisdiction, and while some may argue that young teenagers are responsible enough to drive, others might disagree. Legal factors can thus fuel disagreements surrounding appropriate ages for specific activities. 4. Individual differences: People's opinions on the subject will naturally vary based on personal experiences, upbringing, and beliefs. Parents and legal guardians are primary decision-makers for their children and will make determinations on age-appropriate activities based on their observations, values, and personal beliefs. These differences in perspective will inevitably lead to disagreements about the age thresholds for various activities. 5. Developmental factors: Factors such as cognitive, emotional, and physical development also influence arguments about age thresholds for different activities. Some children may be ready to handle more responsibility or engage in certain activities at a younger age than others, given individual differences in developmental rates. While some may argue that a particular age is appropriate for a specific activity, others may contend that it depends on the child's developmental progress and maturity level. 6. Safety and risks: People may disagree about age appropriateness for various activities depending on the perception of safety and the risk of those activities. For instance, some people may argue that a specific age is too young for children to engage in potentially risky activities like skateboarding, while others may believe that the risks are manageable, and children should be allowed to participate in such activities at that age. In conclusion, arguments over what age is appropriate for each activity stem from factors such as cultural, social, and individual differences, as well as legal factors, developmental factors, and safety concerns. As a result, finding a universally accepted age threshold for each and every activity is immensely challenging, leading to an ongoing debate regarding the age appropriateness for various activities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jason Mott says vivid dream about his dead mother inspired him to write \\"The Returned\\" Book focuses on what happens after a loved one returns from the dead.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Jason Mott's Journey: From Vivid Dreams to Bestselling Novel and Adaptation by Brad Pitt's Film Company Lights go off, reality fades, and we drift into the all-too-familiar realm of dreams—where our innermost fears, desires, and memories surface and knit themselves into a surreal yet often coherent tableau. For some, these dream images dissipate upon waking, but for others, like author Jason Mott, they turn into something more. Mott is the author of the New York Times bestseller \\"The Returned,\\" a heartrending and thought-provoking novel built upon the idea that the dead can come back to life. Inspired by a vivid dream about his deceased mother, Mott's work of fiction explores the universal question of what it would be like to be reunited with a lost loved one and the emotional aftermath that ensues. The genesis of \\"The Returned\\" dates back to one fateful night when Mott found himself conversing with his late mother in his dreams. The dream was so real and visceral that Mott was left pondering on the emotional weight of such an extraordinary event. From there, the seed was planted, and a story—a haunting yet beautiful one—began to take form. \\"The Returned\\" follows the residents of a small town as their lives are forever transformed when their deceased family members and friends begin to reappear as though they never left. This miraculous event is littered with its own set of complications, as the return of the deceased challenges the very fabric of life, relationships, and society at large. At its core, Mott's novel underlines the concept of humanity, love, and hope that endures even in the face of the unknown and impossible. The compelling premise of \\"The Returned\\" soon caught the attention of Brad Pitt's film company, Plan B Entertainment, which plans to adapt the novel into a television series for ABC. The adaptation, produced by Aaron Zelman of \\"Criminal Minds\\" fame, will undoubtedly delve deeper into the complex emotions and ethical conundrums that arise when the border between life and death is blurred. One of the reasons the novel has resonated with such a wide audience is that it taps into a shared longing for closure and connection with deceased loved ones. Mott’s work encourages readers to think about how loss shapes our identities and relationships, challenging us to confront our fears and find solace in the enduring bonds we share with those who have left us behind. For many, it is a rare opportunity to get a glimpse into a world where dreams collide with reality, mortality is defied, and life is redefined. The television adaptation offers a promising platform where these themes can be further explored in depth, and the complexity of the human spirit and shared experiences can be visually demonstrated to an even larger audience. From a vivid dream to a bestselling novel and, now, a television series, Jason Mott’s \\"The Returned\\" embodies the power of imagination and storytelling to captivate, inspire, and explore the deepest questions of our existence. Stay tuned for updates on the eagerly awaited adaptation, as Brad Pitt's film company and ABC work together to bring this extraordinary tale to life on the small screen. In conclusion, let the story of \\"The Returned\\" be a reminder that even in our darkest moments, dreams can be a source of illumination, unlocking our minds and sparking creative journeys beyond our wildest imagination."},{"instruction":"Select from the following.  a).

John Gunther and Halldór Laxness, are American? A:","output":"A: No, neither John Gunther nor Halldór Laxness are American. In fact, they both belong to different nationalities.  John Gunther (1901-1970) was an American journalist and author. However, Halldór Laxness (1902-1998) was not American but, rather, an Icelandic writer. Let's explore more about their backgrounds and contributions to the literary world. John Gunther: John Gunther was born on August 30, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois, United States. He worked as a foreign correspondent for various newspapers, including the Chicago Daily News, where he began his career as a journalist in 1924. Gunther gained considerable recognition and respect for traveling across the world and reporting on international affairs. Some of his assignments took him to important world events, such as the League of Nations meetings, and interviews with significant political figures like Benito Mussolini. Alongside journalism, Gunther became an esteemed author, best known for his series of books called \\"Inside\\" that chronicled the political, social, and economic climate of different nations and regions. The first book in the series, \\"Inside Europe,\\" which was published in 1936, received immense praise for offering insightful analysis and commentary. Other notable books in the series include \\"Inside Asia,\\" \\"Inside Africa,\\" \\"Inside Latin America,\\" and \\"Inside Russia.\\" Additionally, Gunther wrote several other books, including a memoir about his son's battle with brain cancer called \\"Death Be Not Proud.\\" Halldór Laxness: Halldór Laxness was born on April 23, 1902, in Reykjavík, Iceland. He is regarded as one of the preeminent Icelandic authors of the 20th century. Inspired by the greats like William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and Charles Dickens, Laxness took up writing in his early years. His works often depicted the Icelandic social and political landscape in-depth. Laxness was a versatile writer and produced literature spanning various genres, such as novels, poetry, plays, and essays. Some of his most renowned novels include \\"Independent People,\\" \\"The Fish Can Sing,\\" and \\"World Light.\\" Laxness was a prolific author: throughout his career, he published more than 60 books. In 1955, while Iceland was still a relatively unknown country globally, Halldór Laxness brought international attention to his homeland when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. The committee lauded his \\"vivid epic power, which has renewed the great narrative art of Iceland.\\" With this accolade, Laxness not only became Iceland's only Nobel laureate but also ushered the Icelandic literary scene onto the world stage. In conclusion, while John Gunther was an American journalist and author, Halldór Laxness was an Icelandic author. Both made substantial contributions to the literary world through their works, but they belonged to different nationalities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A local newspaper editor referred to Romney as 'a mass of putrid pus and rotten goose pimples with the face of a baboon and the character of a louse' Article:","output":"Title: The Story of Mitt Romney's Great-Grandfather and Judith Freeman's Great-Grandfather Once upon a time, there were two men who lived a long, long time ago. One man was named William Flake, and the other one was named Miles Park Romney. They lived in a time when people used to follow some different rules than we do today. This story is about how William Flake helped Miles Park Romney in a tough situation. William Flake was the great-grandfather of a lady named Judith Freeman. She is someone who writes books and tells stories. She found out that her great-grandfather and Mitt Romney's great-grandfather knew each other a very long time ago.  Mitt Romney's great-grandfather, Miles Park Romney, did something that was against the rules at that time. He had more than one wife, which is called polygamy. Because of this, he got in trouble and was put in a little room called a jail. William Flake, who was a good friend, really wanted to help Miles Park Romney. So, he gave the people who were in charge 1,000 to let Romney out of jail. That's a lot of money, especially back then! William Flake hoped that Mitt Romney's great-grandfather would give the money back to him later. But here's where the story becomes a little sad. Instead of giving the money back, Miles Park Romney took his family and went far away to a place called Mexico. He didn't say thank you to William Flake or give the money back. Because of what he did, some people in their town didn't like Miles Park Romney very much. One person, who wrote things in the local newspaper, said some mean things about him. He called him \\"a mass of putrid pus and rotten goose pimples with the face of a baboon and the character of a louse.\\" That's a lot of big and mean words, but it meant that they thought he was not a very good person. So, the story of William Flake and Miles Park Romney is a lesson about being nice and helpful to your friends, but also about how we should always remember to say thank you and give back what we borrowed. It's important to be kind and fair to everyone, even if we made mistakes in the past.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article. Article: When important events are happening around the world, most people turn to traditional media sources, such as CNN and BBC for the news. However, during the war in Iraq in 2003, many people followed the war from the point of view of an unknown Iraqi citizen who called himself \\"Salam Pax\\", which means peace.               Salam Pax wrote a diary about everyday life in Baghdad during the war, and posted it on his website. Pax's online diary was a kind of website known as a \\"blog\\". Blogs are online diaries, usually kept by individuals, but sometimes by companies and other groups of people. They become the fastest growing type of website on the Internet.  A blog differs from a traditional website in several ways. Most importantly, it is updated   much more regularly. Many blogs are updated every day, and some are updated several times a day. Also, most blogs use special software or websites, which can help ordinary people easily set up and start writing their own blogs.               There are many different kinds of blogs. The most popular type is an online diary of links where the blog writer surfs the Internet and then posts links to sites or news articles that they find interesting, with a few comments about each one. Other types are personal diaries, where the writer talks about their life and feelings. Sometimes these blogs can be very personal.               There is another kind of blogging, called \\"moblogging\\", short for \\"mobile blogging\\". Mobloggers use mobile phones with cameras to take photos, which are posted instantly to the Internet. The use of mobile phones in this way made the headlines   in Singapore when a high school student posted a movie he had taken of a teacher shouting at another student on the Internet. Many people were shocked by what the student did, and wanted phones with cameras to be banned from schools.               Many people think that as blogs become common, news reporting will rely less on big media companies, and more on ordinary people posting news to the Internet. They think that then the news will be less like a lecture, and more like a conversation, where any one can join in.   Answer: Blogs are updated much more often.

Please answer the following question: Q: Transparent, translucent, or opaque are properties of matter based on an interaction with what?    Choices:  - air  - electricity  - gravity  - light  A: A:","output":"The properties of matter being transparent, translucent, or opaque are based on an interaction with light. These properties describe how well light can pass through a material and how the material affects the propagation and appearance of light. 1. Transparent materials: These materials allow light to pass through them with minimal absorption and scattering. Clear glass and clear water are examples of transparent materials. When light passes through a transparent material, it maintains its direction, with very little distortion or scattering. This allows us to see objects clearly through these materials. 2. Translucent materials: These materials allow light to pass through them, but with significant absorption and scattering. Frosted glass, wax paper, and some types of plastics are examples of translucent materials. Light that passes through a translucent material is scattered in multiple directions, making it difficult to see objects clearly through these materials. They often create a soft, diffused appearance of light. 3. Opaque materials: These materials do not allow light to pass through them. Instead, they either absorb or reflect light. All the visible light incident on an opaque material is absorbed or reflected, making it impossible to see objects through these materials. Metals, wood, and dense fabrics are examples of opaque materials. The interaction between light and matter in these three cases is due to the atomic and molecular structure of the material and its interaction with the electromagnetic fields associated with light waves. Transparent and translucent materials have structures that allow light waves to interact with the atoms and molecules in such a way that light can pass through them, either with minimal scattering or with considerable scattering. In contrast, opaque materials have structures that prevent the penetration of light waves, resulting in the absorption or reflection of the incident light. In summary, the properties of matter being transparent, translucent, or opaque are based on an interaction with light, which determines how well light can pass through a material and how the material affects the propagation and appearance of light."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"Beaches tend to be smaller, in bays rather than in long stretches of shoreline.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The small beaches still draw crowds of tourists every year.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"beaches tend to be smaller, in bays rather than in long stretches of shoreline\\" is true, it is important to analyze how this information might relate to the hypothesis \\"the small beaches still draw crowds of tourists every year.\\" While the premise provides information about the physical attributes of beaches, it does not directly support or contradict the hypothesis about their popularity with tourists. However, we can discuss the potential implications and connections between the premise and hypothesis. First, let's consider the characteristics of smaller beaches in bays. These beaches, due to their location within bays, might possess several attributes that could be attractive to tourists. Bays generally provide a sheltered and calmer environment compared to open stretches of shoreline, which might result in more gentle and predictable waves, which in turn could make swimming and sunbathing more enjoyable for visitors. Additionally, bays often have warmer waters, a higher concentration of marine life, and more opportunities for water-based recreational activities like snorkeling, kayaking, or paddleboarding. Now, let's examine the potential impact of these attributes on the tourism industry. Tourists, in general, are drawn to aesthetically pleasing, comfortable, and activity-filled environments. Smaller beaches in bays, as discussed above, might offer such conditions, which could indeed attract crowds of tourists. Additionally, small beaches might provide a more intimate, exclusive, and less crowded experience compared to large, open stretches of shoreline, which some tourists might find appealing. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the hypothesis solely focuses on the popularity of small beaches among tourists and does not provide any information on their popularity relative to more extensive beaches. Being popular or drawing crowds does not imply that these beaches are visited on the same scale as larger, more prominent beaches found along open stretches of coastline. Furthermore, the premise does not take into account factors beyond physical attributes that might influence the popularity of beaches among tourists. Factors such as accessibility, availability of accommodation and amenities, promotional activities by local tourism authorities, and word-of-mouth testimonials might significantly impact whether small beaches in bays see high levels of visitation or not. In conclusion, while the premise that \\"beaches tend to be smaller, in bays rather than in long stretches of shoreline\\" provides useful insight into their physical characteristics, it does not directly support or contradict the hypothesis \\"the small beaches still draw crowds of tourists every year.\\" Nevertheless, the attributes of smaller beaches in bays could make them appealing to tourists, potentially resulting in considerable visitation. However, various factors outside the premise's scope might influence the popularity of these beaches, and therefore, a direct correlation between beach size and tourist attraction cannot be established without additional data and information."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question.

Glenn Lee Beck (born February 10, 1964) is an American talk show host, political commentator, and producer. He is the CEO, founder, and owner of Mercury Radio Arts, the parent company of his television and radio network TheBlaze. A conservative, he hosts the Glenn Beck Radio Program, a popular talk-radio show nationally syndicated on Premiere Radio Networks. Beck also hosts the Glenn Beck television program, which ran from January 2006 to October 2008 on HLN, from January 2009 to June 2011 on the Fox News Channel and currently airs on TheBlaze. Glenn Lee Beck was born in Everett, Washington, the son of Mary Clara (nee Janssen) and William Beck, who lived in Mountlake Terrace, Washington, at the time of their son's birth. The family later moved to Mount Vernon, Washington, where they owned and operated City Bakery in the downtown area. He is descended from German immigrants who came to the United States in the 19th century. Beck was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended Immaculate Conception Catholic School in Mount Vernon.  Glenn and his older sister moved with their mother to Sumner, Washington, attending a Jesuit school in Puyallup. On May 15, 1979, while out on a small boat with a male companion, Beck's mother drowned just west of Tacoma, Washington, in Puget Sound. The man who had taken her out in the boat also drowned. A Tacoma police report stated that Mary Beck \\"appeared to be a classic drowning victim\\", but a Coast Guard investigator speculated that she could have intentionally jumped overboard. Beck has described his mother's death as a suicide in interviews during television and radio broadcasts.  After their mother's death, Beck and his older sister moved to their father's home in Bellingham, Washington, where Beck graduated from Sehome High School in June 1982. Beck also regularly vacationed with his maternal grandparents, Ed and Clara Janssen, in Iowa. In the aftermath of his mother's death and subsequent suicide of his stepbrother, Beck has said he used \\"Dr. Jack Daniel's\\" to cope. At 18, following his high school graduation, Beck relocated to Provo, Utah, and worked at radio station KAYK.

I had about 15 minutes to get back to the school which was a good 4- or 5- minute drive away. I considered rushing back, but it being winter, I thought a fall on ice would only make the situation much worse. So I ran into a McDonald's and asked the man at the counter   who happened to be the manager to please call me a taxi. I explained my situation to him, and I could tell by the look in his eyes, that he took pity. He hurried to the back to use the phone while I walked in the restaurant. I had less than 10 minutes to get back to my school at this point. The manager returned only to tell me that the taxi company had put him on hold and then the line got disconnected, and that he was now on hold again, but had not yet been able to ask for the taxi yet.

Process: - The sun gives off radiation - The radiation is aborbed by the Earth - Some of the radiation goes back into space - Some is trapped by the atmosphere - If too much heat is trapped - Global warming occurs.  Question: suppose sun gives off less radiation happens, how will it affect more radiation trapped by the atmosphere.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"Less Effect If the sun gives off less radiation, it would lead to a consequential reduction in the amount of radiation absorbed by the Earth. This reduction in the incoming solar radiation would have a direct impact on the amount of radiation that can be trapped by the Earth's atmosphere, which would ultimately result in a lower amount of trapped radiation within the atmosphere. To understand this relationship further, we can examine the individual processes involved in the interaction between solar radiation and Earth's atmosphere. 1. Solar radiation emission: The sun produces solar radiation through nuclear fusion. This energy is emitted in the form of light and heat, which are received by the Earth in the form of solar radiation. A decrease in the sun's radiation would result in lesser energy being sent out towards the Earth. 2. Absorption of solar radiation by Earth: The amount of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth is affected directly by the incoming radiation from the sun. If the sun emits less radiation, the Earth receives a smaller amount of radiation to absorb. This reduction in incoming solar radiation would lead to less heat being available for absorption by the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and water bodies. 3. Process of re-radiation: Some of the absorbed radiation is re-radiated back into space as long-wave infrared radiation. However, certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane, can absorb long-wave infrared radiation, preventing it from escaping into space. This trapped radiation is responsible for the greenhouse effect, which maintains Earth's temperatures at a level suitable for supporting life. 4. Global warming: When there is an imbalance between the incoming solar radiation and the escaping long-wave infrared radiation, global warming can occur. If too much heat gets trapped in the atmosphere, the Earth's temperature starts to rise, causing changes in the climate on a global scale. Under the assumed scenario of reduced solar radiation emission from the sun, the overall effect of trapping heat in the atmosphere would be less pronounced. This is because less incoming radiation from the sun will be available for absorption and re-radiation by the Earth, leading to a reduced amount of energy that can be trapped within the atmosphere. So, the perturbation of reduced solar radiation emission from the sun would lead to a reduced or \\"less\\" effect on the second stage - the trapping of radiation by the atmosphere. Moreover, it would influence the overall process of global warming to a lesser extent, as there would be less energy available for trapping and causing a temperature increase within the Earth's climate system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If a question is answerable, output should be 'True', otherwise 'False'. You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False. Passage: The Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Liège to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Liège the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \\"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \\"horizontal\\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \\"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \\"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \\"social advantages\\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \\"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \\"public policy, public security or public health\\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \\"employment in the public service\\".

Article: Parents, our first teachers, play a highly significant role in our lives.However, doesn't it seem that many of us come to have conflicts with them when we start high school? We're less likely to listen to them and take their suggestions--we even rebel against them. Why? It may be the so-called \\"generation gap\\".A generation gap appears when we begin to feel our parents are ignoring us, don't understand us, and we feel we can no longer share our feelings with them. The key reason is our desire for independence.In senior high school, we start to want to take responsibility for our own lives and make our own decisions.But parents resist this.They still want to control us and try to force us to do things they think we should do.Debate and discussion often come to nothing.Gradually, we talk with them less, and keep our feelings locked up inside. Zhang Xiaoyun, 16, of Ningbo, Zhejiang, has talked less and less with her mother since she started senior high school.\\"She believes studies should be my priority, not my inner world,\\" Zhang said.\\"Each day, she asks me the same old questions like, 'How was your last exam? or 'Have you made any progress in physics?\\" To Zhang, these questions are annoying and so she always tries to ignore them and answers _ .\\"Sometimes, when I get upset, I quarrel with her.After, she comes to apologize and comfort me.But I know, she doesn't completely understand me,\\" Zhang said.Now, a home that was once full of laughter has fallen into gloom and silence. The generation gap can be harmful.Because of the lack of communication, our parents no longer know what we are thinking about.There are quarrels, even over trivial things.When that happens, we may not be able to concentrate on our studies.Some of us even become afraid to go home after school-- a very serious situation for the whole family.

To find out how much larger it is in percentage form, you need to divide the difference by the household size and then multiply by 100.  0.55 (the difference) / 2.39 (household size) x 100 = About 23% So, the average family size is about 23% larger than the average household size.

A vocabulary, usually developed with age, serves as a useful and fundamental tool for communication and acquiring knowledge. Acquiring an extensive vocabulary is one of the largest challenges in learning a second language.  - Western philosophy is the philosophical thought and work of the Western world. Historically, the term refers to the philosophical thinking of Western culture, beginning with Hellenic (i.e. Greek) philosophy of the Pre-Socratics such as Thales (c. 624  c. 546 BC) and Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC), and eventually covering a large area of the globe. The word \\"philosophy\\" itself originated from the Hellenic: \\"philosophia\\" (), literally, \\"the love of wisdom\\" ( \\"philein\\", \\"to love\\" and  \\"sophia\\", \\"wisdom\\").  - Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ;  in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.  - It is a major competitor of the St college in Tokyo known as Komazawa University. Despite the university's sectarian affiliation, the school accepts Soto students. The school operates two research centers important in Zen academia, i.e. the Institute for Zen Studies and the International Research Institute for Zen Buddhism. Founded in 1872 as a seminary for those interested in the priesthood, the university carries on that tradition while offering an education to those uninterested in becoming a priest. The university's president is Dr. Kosan Abe. Former presidents include Eshin Nishimura.  - Little is known of the language's prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. During the Heian period (7941185), Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese. Late Middle Japanese (11851600) saw changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, as well as the first appearance of European loanwords. The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo (modern Tokyo) region in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th centurymid-19th century). Following the end in 1853 of Japan's self-imposed isolation, the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly. English loanwords in particular have become frequent, and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated.  - , or is a national university in Kyoto, Japan.

Answer:","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"what contains chloroplasts?\\" would be [ii] Trees. This is because chloroplasts are organelles found in the cells of plants and algae, and the teacher specifically mentioned that \\"all plants are of bush type.\\" While it may be true that bushes are a category of plants, it is important to consider other examples of plant life in order to determine the most accurate answer to the question. The list provided includes several categories of plant life such as trees, grass, flowers, and bushes, as well as other living organisms like fungi, insects, humans, and h2o which is water. Out of these choices, trees would be the most accurate representation of a category that typically contains chloroplasts. Trees, being a form of plant life, contain these organelles that are responsible for the process of photosynthesis, which ultimately enables growth, energy generation, and the production of oxygen as a byproduct. Plant cells differ in many ways from those of animals and other organisms, and one key aspect that sets them apart is the presence of chloroplasts. These organelles function as the site of photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose or other organic molecules to be used by the plant as a source of energy. In conclusion, considering the options given in the list and the hints provided by the teacher, it is evident that [ii] Trees would be the best answer to the question \\"what contains chloroplasts?\\" as chloroplasts are organelles found in the cells of plants and algae, and trees are an example of plant life.

It became the first in a series of three Silesian Wars fought between Frederick the Great's Prussia and Maria Theresa's Austria. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The Silesian War was wont of the great wars","output":"The First Silesian War was indeed one of the significant conflicts during the War of the Austrian Succession.

A corrected sentence that would follow the preceding text could be: \\"The First Silesian War was one of the great wars fought during the 18th century, showcasing the intense power struggle that existed between Prussia and Austria.\\" To give further historical context, the War of the Austrian Succession began in 1740, when Maria Theresa ascended the Habsburg throne, and several European countries contested her claim. Frederick the Great, the King of Prussia, took advantage of this situation and invaded Silesia, a wealthy Austrian province with a diverse population, sparking the First Silesian War. Frederick the Great believed that Silesia, with its valuable natural resources, would strengthen his kingdom and give Prussia more power in Central Europe. Meanwhile, Maria Theresa and the Habsburg Empire were determined to hold onto their provinces and retain their influence in the region as well. During the war, key battles took place at Mollwitz (1741), Chotusitz (1742), and Neisse (1741). The First Silesian War ended with the Treaty of Berlin in 1742 when Maria Theresa ceded most of Silesia to Prussia. However, two more Silesian Wars would follow in the subsequent years, as the rivalry between the two major powers continued, further shaping European history and culminating in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have this equation: -85 * z - 263 + 1198 = 0 First, let's add 263 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -263: -85 * z + 1198 + 263 = 0 + 263 -85 * z + 1461 = 263 Now, let's subtract 1198 from both sides: -85 * z = 263 - 1461 -85 * z = -1198 Next, we want to find out what z is, so we'll divide both sides by -85: z = -1198 / -85 When you divide -1198 by -85, you get: z = 14.1 (rounded to one decimal place) So the answer is: z = 14.1"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2005, at the age of 15, she played the female lead in Chand Sa Roshan Chehra which was a commercial failure at the box office. The same year, she made her debut in Telugu cinema with Sri and in Tamil cinema with Kedi in 2006. IndiaGlitz in its review called Tamannaah as the \\"real scene-stealer\\" and stated that she \\"walks away with all honors\\", adding that her characters have shades of the characters played by Vijayashanti in Mannan (1992) and Ramya Krishnan in Padayappa (1999).  Her first release of 2007 was Shakti Chidambaram's Viyabari in which she played the role of a journalist who wants to write an article about a successful entrepreneur played by S. J. Suryah. The film opened to negative reviews and flopped at the box office, but Tamannaah received praise for her performance. She got her breakthrough with Sekhar Kammula's Happy Days and Balaji Sakthivel's Kalloori, both of which featured Tamannaah as a college student. She won critical acclaim for her performances in both films. The commercial success of Happy Days and Kalloori established her career as an actress in both Telugu and Tamil films. Her performance in the latter earned her a nomination at the 56th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Tamil Actress category.  Her first release of 2008 was the Telugu film Kalidasu directed by debutante G. Ravicharan Reddy. She was paired with debutante Sushanth, the grandson of actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao.

Review: Even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6. As a grown up who grew up in an area with wild horses and native americans, it felt this was a combination of PC mixed in with too many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed about. Talk to those who have lived on horse back, most treat their animals like family members, regardless of background. Regardless of background we have dealt with good and bad breakers of wild horses. I had to explain that was a real life issues to us vs the movie makers views to children who were surprised to see how PC showed a world different than what they knew in reality. This dreamworks break from the normal disney or dreamworks fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view. But if you live in an area similar to what is shown, you may end up answering questions. Now, what is this review like? Options: [1]. negative [2]. positive","output":"To analyze the review, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. The reviewer mentions that the film is boring for anyone over six years old. 2. They explain that, as someone who grew up in an area with wild horses and native Americans, the portrayal of the film feels inauthentic. 3. They criticize the film for being politically correct and not accurately depicting the realities of horseback living. 4. They talk about having to explain the difference between the film's portrayal and their personal experiences to children. 5. The reviewer appreciates the break from the typical Disney or Dreamworks style of talking animals. Based on these points, it can be said that the review has both positive and negative aspects. The main criticism lies in the inauthentic and politically correct portrayal of the setting and characters, while the positive aspect is the break from typical animated films. Overall, it leans more towards being negative due to the emphasis on inaccuracy and the reviewer's personal experience.

Answer based on context: Trying to snap a two-game losing skid, the Bills flew to FedExField for a Week 13 interconference duel with an emotionally charged Washington Redskins. Before the kickoff, the stadium held a memorial service for Sean Taylor, as well as all players across the NFL wearing a #21 sticker on the back of their helmets. Due to the recent poor play of QB J. P. Losman, rookie QB Trent Edwards once again got the start. In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Bills continued to trail as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Buffalo got on the board as LB Angelo Crowell sacked Washington QB Jason Campbell in his own endzone for a safety.  The Redskins would end the half with Suisham getting a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills started to reply as kicker Rian Lindell got a 38-yard field goal, yet Washington replied with RB Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard TD run.  Buffalo would close out the period with Lindell kicking a 43-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, followed by a 33-yard field goal.  On the Bills final drive, Lindell managed to set up for a 51-yard field goal.  The first try was good, but Redskins Head Coach Joe Gibbs called time out.  After the first time out, Gibbs tried to call a second time out, which led to them getting called for unsportsmanlike conduct and the Bills moved 15 yards closer to the end zone, which reduced Lindell's field goal to 36 yards.  In the end, Lindell managed to nail the game-winning 36-yard field goal, squeaking a last second win in the dying seconds of the game. With the win, Buffalo snapped a two-game losing streak and improved to 6-6. How many points did Buffalo get on the board with?","output":"To determine the total number of points Buffalo scored in the game, we need to find the points they scored in each quarter and sum them up. In the second quarter, Buffalo got 2 points from the safety.  In the third quarter, they scored a 38-yard field goal (3 points) and a 43-yard field goal (3 points), totaling 6 points. In the fourth quarter, they scored a 24-yard field goal (3 points), a 33-yard field goal (3 points), and a game-winning 36-yard field goal (3 points), totaling 9 points. Adding the points for each quarter: 2 (second quarter) + 6 (third quarter) + 9 (fourth quarter) = 17 points Buffalo got on the board with 17 points."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step by step: 1. Choose a central character: We will have a protagonist named Danny, a journalist in his mid-30s. 2. Set up the background: Danny, who works for a Hong Kong based publication, is looking for a story for their magazine's 25th anniversary edition. He stumbles upon the mystery of a movie that was released on the 10th of January 1997, 25 years ago. 3. Create the inciting incident: During his research, Danny realizes that the movie had caused a series of strange happenings and coincidences connected with the people involved in its production. Intrigued, he decides to investigate further. 4. Introduce supporting characters: As Danny digs deeper, he meets people associated with the movie - a retired actress, a reclusive screenwriter, and the now middle-aged child star. They are reluctant to discuss the movie due to various reasons such as secrecy, fear, and past trauma. 5. Develop obstacles and conflict: Danny encounters difficulties in obtaining information, such as missing records, uncooperative witnesses, and intimidation from unknown sources. These incidents create tension and raise the stakes for Danny in his quest for the truth. 6. Build the central mystery: Through his investigation, Danny unearths that the movie somehow tapped into a supernatural event that occurred on the night of its release. The people involved in the movie's production had their lives changed dramatically under mysterious circumstances. 7. Climax: Danny finally gets his hands on a long-lost copy of the movie and decides to watch it. As he does, he experiences the supernatural event himself, and faces his fears to break the curse of the movie that has haunted its cast and crew for 25 years. 8. Resolution: By breaking the curse, Danny frees the movie's original participants from their sufferings while also uncovering hidden truths and powerful revelations that were buried deep within the movie. Answer: The movie is 25 years old, as it was released in Hong Kong on the 10th of January 1997, and the events in the plot are taking place at the time of the 25th anniversary of the movie's release. The storyline follows Danny, a journalist investigating the mysterious events surrounding the movie and those responsible for its creation, ultimately leading to the breaking of a 25-year-old curse."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 2: - Glasson won Australian championships 19 times. - Glasson won nine national indoor championships. Now, let's compare the information: - Both sentences mention Glasson winning championships. - Sentence 1 mentions national hall championships, while sentence 2 mentions national indoor championships. These may or may not be the same thing. - Sentence 1 mentions Glasson winning nine Australian championships, while sentence 2 says Glasson won Australian championships 19 times.

Given this analysis: These sentences may not be exact paraphrases of each other, as there are some differences in the types of championships mentioned and the way they are presented.

A: Choose your answer from: A). blastocyte B). sporangium C). lymphocyte D). sporophyte A:","output":"The multicellular diploid stage is called sporophyte (Answer D). This term, sporophyte, is used in the life cycle of plants and algae that exhibit alternation of generations. Alternation of generations is a biological process in which the organism goes through two distinct stages: a multicellular diploid stage and a multicellular haploid stage. A diploid cell has two sets of chromosomes, one from the mother and one from the father, while a haploid cell has only a single set of chromosomes. The life cycle consists of two alternating generations: the sporophyte generation and the gametophyte generation. The sporophyte (the multicellular diploid stage) is the phase in which the organism produces spores through the process of meiosis. These spores are haploid and go on to grow and develop into the multicellular haploid phase, known as the gametophyte. The gametophyte generation produces gametes (sperm and eggs) via mitosis, which are also haploid. When gametes fuse during fertilization, they form a diploid zygote, which then grows and develops into a multicellular sporophyte, thus completing the life cycle. Alternation of generations is a fundamental feature of the life cycles of most plants and some groups of algae. It allows for genetic diversity and adaptation to changing environments. Now let's briefly examine the non-applicable answer choices: A) Blastocyte: This term refers to the early stage of a mammalian embryo, typically around 5 to 6 days after fertilization. The blastocyst is a structure formed in the mammalian species during the early development and is not related to the life cycle of plants or algae. B) Sporangium: This is a specialized structure found in plants, fungi, and some algae, where spores are produced. Sporangia are part of the sporophyte generation, but they are not the same thing as the multicellular diploid stage itself. C) Lymphocyte: This term refers to a particular type of white blood cell in the immune system of animals. Lymphocytes play an essential role in the body's defense mechanism against infections. However, they are not associated with the life cycle of plants or algae in any way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The premise only provides information that people are sitting at tables and some are looking at a dog balloon.

However, it doesn't necessarily indicate that people have actually brought their dogs here, or that they are walking them. There could be other reasons why people are gathered and looking at a dog balloon that have nothing to do with walking dogs.  For example, perhaps people are attending a street fair where one of the attractions is a stand that sells unique and special balloons shaped like dogs, and people are looking at the artistry of the balloon rather than walking their dogs.

It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts is that the two parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.The theatre's management was clearly concerned that the public might find the double opera too heavy in undiluted form. Accordingly, a comic intermezzo in Low German dialect (platte-deutsch) was devised by Sauerbrey to precede the performance of Daphne. The critic and essayist Romain Rolland, in his life of Handel, termed this a \\"mutilation\\", carried out \\"for fear that the music may tire the hearers\\". contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the composer without whose presence, according to Anthony Hicks, so unusual a project would not have been attempted?, what is it ?

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a review of movie. Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Q: - Contains miner spoilers - I have seen a number of decent Indie horror films such as The Hamiltons, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; unfortunately I felt Five Across the Eyes does not fall into this category. From start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting resonating from a very poor script, god only knows why the writer(s) thought dialogue such as \\"No don't go out there; don't go out there she'll get you: if she gets you she'll kill you and if she kills you you're dead\\" is of movie quality.This film displays very little character development and to be honest I couldn't care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redeeming qualities'. All they do is cry and whinge throughout the entire movie and if the girls aren't crying their arguing; when they do converse the topics are completely random: about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently cremated (appropriate subjects when you're being chased by a psychotic killer).The soundtrack is also abysmal exhibiting corny techno music during both the start and end credits (although hearing the credit music knowing the end was nearing seemed like heaven).The camera-work is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable. I'm guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which resides in the girls' car almost the entire movie. I think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible: to feel and experience what the girls are going through. But due to a very shaky camera, grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic. It's one thing to make a film subjective but it's another to have action on the screen that an audience can't decipher because of the poor cinematography.I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality. There are no redeeming factors to this film: bad acting, poor scripting, shoddy camera-work and no story. In light off all this I decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed; wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief. Its 94 minutes off stupid college girls crying, arguing, aimlessly running and having random inappropriate conversations. However, how many times do you get to see girls defecating into their hands and throwing the crap onto the windscreen of a chasing car.

Article: Primarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA. Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot. Now answer this question: Why was the Greater London Council established?","output":"The Greater London Council (GLC) was established in 1965 to address the need for a unified governing body that would take into account the growth of the urban area in and around London. Prior to the creation of the GLC, the administration of London was dispersed among numerous smaller local authorities, such as the London County Council (LCC) and the Metropolitan Boroughs. This fragmentation made it difficult to coordinate policies, especially concerning transport, housing, and infrastructure development on a larger scale and to make effective decisions that would benefit the rapidly expanding city. As London continued to grow in the years following World War II, it became clear that the city required a more comprehensive and efficient governance structure to meet the needs of its increasing population. The GLC was created as a higher-tier government organization, encompassing the entirety of Greater London, which was an expanded geographical area including the existing County of London, portions of Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and Surrey. With the establishment of the GLC, regional planning, infrastructure development, traffic control, and public transport across Greater London could be managed in a more coordinated and cohesive manner. This new governing body aimed to create a unified vision for the city, allowing for more effective responses to challenges brought on by urbanization, industrial growth, and social change. In summary, the Greater London Council was established in order to address the growing urbanization and expansion of London, providing a unified governing structure that could coordinate policies and decision-making across the entirety of Greater London. This allowed for a more effective and efficient approach to managing the city's many challenges, including transport, housing, and infrastructure amidst a rapidly changing urban landscape."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana.  - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile.  - Nola is an ancient Campanian town and a modern municipality in the Metropolitan City of Naples in Italy . It lies on the plain between Mount Vesuvius and the Apennines . It is traditionally credited as diocese that introduced bells to Christian worship . Illegal dumping of toxic wastes by the Camorra , however , has turned the surrounding area into a \`\` Triangle of Death '' , with cancer rates far above the European average .  - A boot is a type of footwear and a specific type of shoe. Most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle, while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality  protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking)  and for reasons of style and fashion.  - Mount Vesuvius ( also \\"Vesevus\\" or \\"Vesaevus\\" in some Roman sources) is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about east of Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans.

Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - A secret society is a club or an organization whose activities, events, and inner functioning are concealed from non-members. The society may or may not attempt to conceal its existence. The term usually excludes covert groups, such as intelligence agencies or guerrilla insurgencies, that hide their activities and memberships but maintain a public presence. The exact qualifications for labeling a group a secret society are disputed, but definitions generally rely on the degree to which the organization insists on secrecy, and might involve the retention and transmission of secret knowledge, the denial of membership or knowledge of the group, the creation of personal bonds between members of the organization, and the use of secret rites or rituals which solidify members of the group.  - Naples (Neapolitan: \\"Napule\\" or ;  meaning \\"new city\\") is the capital of the Italian region Campania and the third-largest municipality in Italy, after Rome and Milan. In 2015, around 975,260 people lived within the city's administrative limits. The Metropolitan City of Naples had a population of 3,115,320.

About 4.4 million people live in the Naples metropolitan area, one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea.  - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - San Marino, officially the Republic of San Marino, also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino, is an enclaved microstate surrounded by Italy, situated on the Italian Peninsula on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains. Its size is just over , with a population of 33,562. Its capital is the City of San Marino and its largest city is Dogana. San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe.  - The Naples metropolitan area is a metropolitan area in Campania, Italy, centered on the city of Naples. With a population of around 4 million, it's the third most populous metropolitan area on the European part of Mediterranean coast (after Barcelona and Athens), and one of the biggest metropolises in Europe.  - The Gulf of Naples , also called the Bay of Naples, is a roughly 15-kilometer-wide (9.3 mi) gulf located along the south-western coast of Italy (province of Naples, Campania region). It opens to the west into the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered on the north by the cities of Naples and Pozzuoli, on the east by Mount Vesuvius, and on the south by the Sorrentine Peninsula and the main town of the peninsula, Sorrento. The Peninsula separates the Gulf of Naples from the Gulf of Salerno, which includes the Amalfi coast.  - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Campania is a region in Southern Italy. The region at the end of 2014 had a population of around 5,869,000 people, making it the third-most-populous region of Italy; its total area of makes it the most densely populated region in the country. Located on the Italian Peninsula, with the Mediterranean Sea to the west, it includes the small Phlegraean Islands and Capri for administration as part of the region.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  - The Campanian volcanic arc is a volcanic arc that consists of a number of active, dormant, and extinct volcanoes in the Campania region of Italy. The Campanian volcanic arc centers on the bay of Naples and includes: \\"Campanian volcanic arc\\" is somewhat a term of convenience, since the area is part of the same large area of intense volcanic and seismic activity that includes, further to the south, the active island volcanoes of Stromboli, and Vulcano off the north coast of Sicily and even the largest active volcano in Europe, Mt. Etna, on Sicily itself.  - The Camorra is an Italian Mafia-type crime syndicate, or secret society, which arose in the region of Campania and its capital Naples. It is one of the oldest and largest criminal organizations in Italy, dating back to the 16th century. Unlike the pyramidal structure of the Sicilian Mafia, the Camorra's organizational structure is more horizontal than vertical. Consequently, individual Camorra clans act independently of each other, and are more prone to feuding among themselves.  - The Sicilian Mafia, also known as simply the Mafia or Cosa Nostra (\\"Our thing\\"), is a criminal syndicate in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organisational structure and code of conduct. The basic group is known as a \\"family\\", \\"clan\\", or \\"\\"cosca\\"\\" or \\"cosche\\" in Sicilian. Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood (\\"borgata\\") of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves \\"men of honour\\", although the public often refers to them as \\"mafiosi\\". The mafia's core activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions.  - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland.  - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power.  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as .  - MILAN (\\"milan(e)\\" is French for kite) is a European anti-tank guided missile. Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability.  - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans .

Vehicle insurance, in the United States and elsewhere, is designed to cover risk of financial liability or the loss of a motor vehicle the owner may face if their vehicle is involved in a collision resulting in property or physical damages. Most states require a motor vehicle owner to carry some minimum level of liability insurance. States that do not require the vehicle owner to carry car insurance include Virginia, where an uninsured motor vehicle fee may be paid to the state; New Hampshire, and Mississippi which offers vehicle owners the option to post cash bonds (see below). The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution protects the rights of citizens in each respective state when traveling to another. A motor vehicle owner typically pays insurers a monthly fee, often called an insurance premium. The insurance premium a motor vehicle owner pays is usually determined by a variety of factors including the type of covered vehicle, the age and gender of any covered drivers, their driving history, and the location where the vehicle is primarily driven and stored. Credit scores are also taken into consideration. Most insurance companies offer premium discounts based on these factors. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is it against the law to not have auto insurance? Options: [A]. no. [B]. yes.","output":"[B]. yes. In most states in the United States, it is against the law not to have auto insurance, as vehicle owners are required to carry a minimum level of liability insurance. There are some exceptions, like Virginia and Mississippi, which allow vehicle owners to pay fees or post cash bonds instead. However, overall, it is generally required to have auto insurance to follow the law and protect citizens from potential financial risks associated with collisions and damages. Option [A] is incorrect because the text states that most states require auto insurance, so it is not accurate to say that it is not against the law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Uncle Tom had more strength and stamina. As Uncle Tom was in his early 50's, he was still within a relatively younger age range when compared to Uncle Jerry, who was already 78 years old. Old age, as mentioned, typically begins around the mid-60s and is accompanied by a decline in stamina, strength, reflex time, and sensory abilities. Additionally, the immune system becomes less efficient during old age, increasing the risk of serious illnesses. In contrast, Uncle Tom was not yet in the defined old age range, which indicates that he would likely have better physical and cognitive functioning than Uncle Jerry. Moreover, the description of Uncle Tom as being \\"very active and productive\\" supports the idea that he had more strength and stamina when compared to his older sibling.

Here is a news article: Photo: Paramount Pictures      Marijuana, like anything else that’s been stigmatized and driven underground for a long time, has developed a lot of mythology surrounding it. One pot-related issue that has kick-started many arguments is the question of “contact highs” — namely, how smoky a room/car/whatever has to be before nonsmokers can get high simply from sitting there — and, relatedly, whether this can lead to false-positive drug tests. It’s a question with real-world ramifications — talented, but troubled, Cleveland Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon, for example, has blamed a positive drug test on secondhand marijuana smoke.      To find out whether this particular strain of the “There’s a perfectly logical explanation!” excuse has any scientific weight behind it, a team led by Dr. Evan S. Herrmann of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine ran what they say is “the first study … to examine the influence of room ventilation on secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke, and the first study to examine the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure on behavioral/cognitive performance.” It was published recently in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence.      Related Stories New Research on Smoking Pot and Drinking at the Same Time      This was an unusual experiment: The scientists recruited both regular pot smokers and non-pot-smokers and constructed a special Plexiglas compartment designed to be about the size of a small room. After blood tests were administered both to confirm that the non-pot-smokers hadn’t smoked pot recently and the pot smokers had remained abstinent overnight (for data-collection purposes), and to measure pre- and post-effects of the smoking session, the key part of the experiment began:      After completing baseline assessments, 6 cannabis smokers and 6 nonsmokers entered a specially constructed smoke exposure chamber (approximately 0900 hours). The chamber measured 10 ft. X 13 ft. (3.05 m X 3.96 m) with a 7 ft. (2.13 m) ceiling, was constructed using a combination of Plexiglas and aluminum support beams, and incorporated an adjustable ventilation/exhaust system. Smokers and nonsmokers sat around a table in alternating seats. All participants wore protective clothing over their normal clothes (disposable booties, jumpsuits) during the exposure session, and were provided with swimming goggles to prevent eye irritation from accumulated smoke. … Each smoker was provided with 10 cannabis cigarettes obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Drug Supply Program and a CReSS Pocket smoking topography device (Borgwaldt KC, Richmond, VA, USA). Each cannabis cigarette contained approximately 1 gram of high potency (11.3% THC) cannabis. The door to the chamber was sealed using magnetic strips around the frame of the door at the start of each 60-minute exposure session. Active smokers were instructed to smoke the provided cannabis cigarettes ad libitum through the CReSS device, which measured the number of puffs taken, puff volume, and other parameters of smoking behavior. Participants were instructed to remain seated for the entirety of the session, but were allowed to engage in leisure activities (e.g., talking, reading, using personal electronic devices, etc.). Research staff monitored the exposure session from outside the chamber to ensure nonsmokers did not actively inhale from the cannabis cigarettes and that smokers only consumed cigarettes from their own supply. Pulse oximeters were used to monitor blood oxygen concentration of study participants every 15 minutes to ensure an adequate oxygen supply was maintained in the chamber.      To test how ventilation, or a lack thereof, affected the nonsmokers, the researchers ran two sessions like this, one with the vents open and one with them closed. After their hour in the pot room, the participants had their physiological readings taken, were given tests designed to determine how the pot affected their ability to complete certain tasks, and were asked how they were feeling.      The results:      Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke in an unventilated chamber the size of a small room produced minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate subjective drug effects, and minor, but detectable, levels of performance impairment on some behavioral/cognitive assessments … The [THC] concentration in one specimen was sufficient to trigger a positive urine drug screen at a cut-off of >50 [nanograms per milliliter] (i.e., the cut-off recommended for use by the … mandatory guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs), and multiple positive urine results were observed for four participants using a more stringent cut-off of >20 ng/ml, which is used by some commercial/private workplace drug testing programs, within a day of exposure.      In other words, yes, both “contact highs” and positive drug tests as a result were observed. But the study suggests you’d almost have to intentionally try in order to get snared by a positive drug test without actually smoking or eating pot: Ventilating the pot room, the authors write, “reduced levels of exposure among nonsmokers, evidenced by much lower (in some cases undetectable) levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine and the absence of subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects.”      In fact, the only behavioral effect the researchers noticed among nonsmokers in the ventilated session was an uptick in their responses to a “hungry/have munchies” item. But as the authors point out, there’s a perfectly logical explanation: “Lunch hour was approaching.” ||||| People who are exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke may feel a bit of the \\"high\\" that comes with using the drug, a new study finds. They may also feel unable to think clearly, and they may even have detectable levels of the drug in their urine or blood. But all of this happens only if they are exposed to marijuana smoke under severely unventilated conditions, the study found.      \\"If you're going to breathe in enough passive cannabis smoke to feel high and potentially be slightly impaired, you could fail a drug test,\\" said Evan S. Herrmann, the study's lead author and postdoctoral fellow in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. \\"But this only happens under a very extreme situation.\\"      Cannabis is the world's most commonly used illicit drug. It is often smoked in small, enclosed spaces with poor ventilation, according to the study.      Studies in the 1980s showed that such \\"social exposure\\" to pot smoke could trigger positive drug tests for cannabis' main psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). But such studies had several limitations. They used marijuana that had much lower potency than the pot available today and they failed to account for normal levels of ventilation in rooms. They also did not examine how people may feel or behave after such exposures.      \\"This new study probes a question people have been wondering forever,\\" said Ziva Cooper, an assistant professor of clinical neurobiology at Columbia University, who was not involved in this research. \\"Do people actually get high from these 'hot box' effects? And if so, does it change your capabilities or cause you to fail a drug test?\\"      In the first study of its kind, Herrmann's team recruited about 20 healthy people between the ages of 18 and 45, including some who smoked marijuana and some who didn't use the drug. The researchers tested the participants' blood, saliva, urine and hair samples for cannabis biomarkers, and then asked six smokers and six nonsmokers to relax in a Plexiglas and aluminum smoke chamber about the size of a dorm room. Participants underwent two separate sessions, each an hour long.      The researchers gave each of the six smokers 10 marijuana cigarettes, each containing 1 gram of high-potency weed, and instructed them to smoke at their leisure for the hour while the six non-smokers sat by their side in the chamber.      During one test session, the room's ventilation system was switched on, allowing air to flow in and out at a standard office-building rate. In the other session, the researchers restricted the airflow in the chamber. After the 60 minutes, each participant completed a series of biological, cognitive and subjective surveys and tasks at regular intervals for up to 34 hours after exposure. [11 Odd Facts About Marijuana]      \\"Our results are pretty consistent with what we expected,\\" Herrmann said. The new findings confirm \\"it's really hard to get a positive [drug test result] from passive smoke unless you're in an extreme scenario,\\" he said.      Under the unventilated, \\"hot box\\" condition, the nonsmokers showed slight impairments on cognitive tests, reported feeling high, and had detectable levels of THC in their blood and urine for up to 22 hours post-exposure. Those in the ventilated condition had much lower levels of THC in their blood, did not feel impaired or high, and did not test positive for THC in their urine.      But the unventilated room is not representative of most real-life situations, the researchers said. \\"We modeled the worst-case scenario,\\" Herrmann said. \\"You are in an enclosed room for an hour with 15 grams of cannabis being smoked.\\"      Ideally, the study would have had a placebo group, in which nonsmokers were exposed to smoke without THC. This would have helped the researchers determine whether the feeling of being high was due to the marijuana or simply a placebo effect, from being exposed to smoke.      Still, \\"this study is really important because it adds to our limited knowledge of the direct effects of cannabis smoking and the potential dangers of second-hand smoke,\\" Cooper said.

Summarize this article: Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is seen in her chambers in at the Supreme Court in Washington, on July 31, 2014. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File) Associated Press      Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may have made history a second time with her dissent from last week’s Supreme Court order allowing Texas to implement its voter-identification law in next month’s election.      The seven-page dissent jolted its way into the law books with an official email at 5:05 a.m. Saturday, considerably earlier than any bleary-eyed court correspondent could recall receiving any other opinion or order.      On Wednesday, Justice Ginsburg took the extraordinary step of announcing her dissent had included a factual error—and that she had corrected the opinion on the court’s website.      Previous high court opinions have contained an occasional mistake, of course, and the justices generally corrected them on the website and in the official reports. They just didn’t tell the public they had made post-publication fixes. The court’s practice of silently changing its opinions came under scrutiny from Harvard law professor Richard Lazarus, who earlier this year released a draft article documenting the practice.      “Chief Justice [Roger] Taney in Dred Scott v. Sandford added approximately 18 pages to his majority opinion between the time of his original announcement of the Court’s ruling and the publication of the opinion several months later,” Mr. Lazarus wrote, referencing the infamous 1857 pro-slavery decision. “As recently as Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, striking down as unconstitutional a Texas law criminalizing sodomy, and EPA v. EME Homer City Generation LP, in April 2014 upholding a major agency rule promulgated under the federal Clean Air Act, justices have revised their opinions in significant, including highly substantive, ways prior to their final and official publication.”      Such practices demand “rethinking and reform,” Mr. Lazarus wrote. And the justices “can easily fix them.”      Justice Ginsburg apparently took up the challenge. In an email to reporters (sent at the more decent hour of 12:51 p.m.), the court announced that “page 4 of the dissent contained an error. Photo identification cards issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs, the Texas Secretary of State’s office confirmed, are an acceptable form of photo identification for voting in Texas. Accordingly, the Justice deleted the following sentence from the dissent: ‘Nor will Texas accept photo ID cards issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs.’ There are also small stylistic changes on pages 2 and 4. The opinion has been updated on the Court’s website.”      Asked what prompted the unusual announcement, Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said “the justice realized the error, amended the dissent, and did not want the correction to go without notice.”      One who did take notice was Mr. Lazarus.      “Justice Ginsburg’s decision to provide public notice of this kind of change is an historic shift in the court’s traditional practice and well demonstrates how candor about the need for corrections furthers, rather than undermines, the court’s stature and authority,” he said.      Unlike reporters awoken before dawn on Saturday by Justice Ginsburg’s initial version, Mr. Lazarus said he was delighted with her timing. Since his Harvard Law Review article, “The (Non)Finality of Supreme Court Opinions,” doesn’t go to press until Friday, he said, “I can slip this in.”      ______________________________________________________            Politics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

The dissent attracted widespread attention, in part because Ginsburg and fellow dissenting justices were up all night Friday, into Saturday morning, writing their statement skewering the law. They came down hard on the majority opinion by the Supreme Court to allow Texas to enforce the voter ID law in the upcoming November elections.      In her seven-page dissent, Ginsburg wrote that the law “may prevent more than 600,000 registered Texas voters from voting in person for lack of compliant identification.” Her dissent was widely covered in liberal-leaning media outlets, with one declaring it offered myriad reasons \\"why Texas' new voter ID law is racist.\\"      But it turns out Ginsburg overstated her case in at least one regard.      Aside from “small stylistic changes,” Wednesday’s correction erases a sentence from Ginsburg’s official dissent that refers to photo identification cards issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs not being an acceptable form of ID in Texas -- when they actually are.      “Accordingly, the Justice deleted the following sentence from the dissent: ‘Nor will Texas accept photo ID cards issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs,’” the Supreme Court said Wednesday in a written statement.      As it currently stands, the Texas law allows seven types of approved ID documentation, including handgun licenses. The problem some groups had was that it did not include some types of identification -- like college IDs -- which are accepted in other states. Veterans Affairs ID's, though, are acceptable.      Over the weekend, the majority on the Supreme Court said no to an emergency request by the Justice Department and several civil-rights groups that Texas be barred from requiring voters to present certain kinds of identification cards before being allowed to cast their ballots.      Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor also dissented with Ginsburg, who wrote that a “sharply disproportionate percentage of those voters [who may be prevented from voting for ID reasons] are African-American or Hispanic.”      The dissent has no force of law, and so the correction is more a black eye than anything. While corrections made by U.S. Justices are uncommon, they do happen.      In April, Justice Antonin Scalia made a mistake in his dissent in a decision to uphold the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate coal pollution that blurred across state lines.      In the original dissent, Scalia argued that the majority’s decision was inconsistent with a unanimous 2001 ruling which he mistakenly said shot down EPA efforts to consider the costs of migrating pollution when setting regulation. It did not.      The Supreme Court issued a correction and the line was removed.      Trying to pinpoint who is to blame for the errors is difficult. Each U.S. Supreme Court justice is allowed to hire law clerks to review petitions, cases, research and to help draft opinions. Associate justices are allowed to have four clerks. The chief justice is allowed five. |||||","output":"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a mistake in her statement about a voting law in Texas. She corrected her mistake and told the public about the change. This is not usual, as justices generally fix their mistakes quietly. By telling everyone about the mistake, Justice Ginsburg made a change in the way things are done.

In the given statement, the person is expressing their opinion that television has changed, and they believe there aren't as many good shows as there used to be. The hypothesis \\"There aren't as many good shows as there used to be\\" directly captures the essence of the premise, as it refers to the perceived decline in the quality or number of good shows in comparison to the past. Various factors can contribute to the perception of a decline in the quality or quantity of good television shows. Some of these factors include: 1. Nostalgia: People often tend to look back at past periods of their lives and view things (including television shows) through \\"rose-tinted glasses,\\" which can lead to a belief that shows from the past were better. 2. Over-saturation of content: With the advent of streaming services and the abundance of content available, it can become challenging to find truly high-quality shows. It's easier to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices, which can lead to a perception that there aren't as many quality shows to choose from. 3. Changing viewer preferences: As the cultural landscape changes, so too do viewer preferences. Therefore, what one person considers a good show may not match the views of someone else or the changing tastes of the general population. 4. The rise of reality TV and competition shows: Over the years, there has been a shift towards reality television and competition shows, which tend to be less expensive to produce than scripted dramas or comedies. As a result, viewers who prefer scripted shows might perceive a decline in quality content available on television. 5. Changing production values: Some viewers may feel that modern television shows focus too much on special effects, flashy visuals, or high-profile celebrities at the expense of good storytelling and character development, leading to a perception that there are fewer good shows nowadays. While the premise entails the hypothesis from the given person's perspective, it is essential to remember that this statement is subjective.

Chancellor George Osborne praised Lord Heseltine for having \\"bold ideas\\". Ministers have accepted 81 of the 89 recommendations put forward. Lord Heseltine was asked by David Cameron to look into ways of improving the economies of English cities other than London. His report - No Stone Unturned - was published last November and it advocated using Local Enterprise Partnerships to decide the allocation of central funding to projects. Lord Heseltine, who also served as trade and industry secretary during the early 1980s, said cities were \\"pulsing with energy\\" which was not being used enough to help the UK towards sustained growth. Birmingham is the first city to be given the single funding, with the Greater Birmingham and Solihull areas to benefit. In its formal response, published two days ahead of the Budget, the Treasury said it had accepted 81 of his proposals, rejected five - and will look further at the remaining three during the forthcoming Spending Review. Chancellor George Osborne said: \\"We asked Lord Heseltine to do what he does best: challenge received wisdom and give us bold ideas on how to bring government and industry together.  He did just that, and that is why we are backing his ideas today.\\" Business Secretary Vince Cable added: \\"We have grasped the challenge that Lord Heseltine's report posed to government and accepted the vast majority of his recommendations. \\"The plans will boost the UK's competitiveness nationally and drive local growth through... deals that we will be negotiating with every Local Enterprise Partnership. \\"In line with Lord Heseltine's report, today we have also announced a package of wider support that is a big vote of confidence for our industrial strategy, particularly the aerospace, automotive and agri- technology sectors. \\"This support not only gives businesses certainty, but shows the government is determined to back those sectors where Britain can deliver and compete on a global scale in partnership with industry.\\" The UK economy shrank by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2012, leading to fears of a third recession since the beginning of 2008.

Answer this question: name a country that use a lot of colonies??","output":"The country that is noteworthy for having had the largest number of colonies worldwide is the United Kingdom. This was historically during a period known as the British Empire.  The British Empire was a system of colonies, protectorates, mandates, and other territories which were ruled or administered by the United Kingdom. At its height, it was the largest empire in history, and it covered more than 13,000,000 square miles, which is approximately a quarter of the Earth's total land area. The empire had dominion over vast lands in North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, the South Pacific and Caribbean islands, and significant sections of Southeast Asia and the Middle East. The desire for expansion and colonization was fueled by a combination of economic, social, and political factors. The Industrial Revolution triggered a massive demand for raw materials, new markets to sell goods, and locations for growing population; colonies could fulfill all these needs. Some of its noteworthy colonies were United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, Egypt, and several islands in the Caribbean. Many of these countries are part of the Commonwealth today, a political association of 54 member states, mostly former territories of the British Empire. The colonies were managed by governors appointed by the British monarch and were run according to British law. Many indigenous cultures and societies were fundamentally changed, and aspects of British culture and norms were imposed and ingrained in the societies of these colonies. Though the British Empire is now mostly disbanded, with most colonies gaining independence throughout the 20th century, its influence still lingers in many of these countries through English being a primary language, the prevalence of parliamentary systems of governance, subtleties in etiquette, education system, and other cultural aspects.

USA TODAY Sports      In a file photo from 2008, Jamaica's 4x100 gold medal winning relay team after the race. (l-r) Usain Bolt, Michael Frater, Asafa Powell, and Nesta Carter. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports)      Usain Bolt made history as the first sprinter to sweep three gold medals at three Olympic Games. Now he's losing a piece of his historic hardware.      Bolt will forfeit an Olympic gold won at the 2008 Beijing Games because his Jamaican teammate was caught doping.      Nesta Carter was disqualified from the 4x100 relay that won gold in Beijing after a reanalysis of his sample found the banned substance methylhexaneamine, the IOC announced Wednesday.      The IOC has retested hundreds of samples stored from the 2008 and 2012 Olympics to possibly detect banned substances that were not originally identified at the time of the Games. Testing has improved since London to detect long-term metabolites.      Carter, 31, ran in the prelims and the final in Beijing.      The sanction against Carter wasn't surprising. The Guardian reported last year that Bolt could lose a medal. At the time he said it would be \\"heartbreaking\\" but that it's \\"just one of those things.\\"      RELATED COVERAGE:      \\"Things happen in life, so when it’s confirmed or whatever, if I need to give back my gold medal I’d have to give it back, it’s not a problem for me,\\" Bolt said last June, according to a report in the Guardian.      Carter also won gold as part of the 4x100 relay in London.      In Beijing, Trinidad and Tobago took silver in the 4x100 followed by Japan and Brazil. The American men dropped the baton in the prelims. Bolt ran the third leg of the relay with Asafa Power the anchor as Jamaica set a world record.      The Jamaican National Olympic Committee was told in May of 2016 that Carter's B sample would be tested. In October, Carter's counsel sent a statement to the IOC that said the athlete had been using Cell Tech and Nitro Tech to help with recovery and to build up muscle mass during 2008. Carter said he had given several samples for doping control while he was taking the substances leading up to the 2008 Olympics and had never tested positive.      In its decision, the IOC disciplinary commission said that Carter's claim of \\"unknowing ingestion of a supplement would not and could not prevent the finding of the commission of an anti-doping rule violation.\\"      The commission also said that Carter did not provide any real evidence that the supplements he declared on his Doping Control Form might have been the likely source.      \\"On the contrary, the fact that the Athlete used such supplements regularly and that this did not lead to other problems, supports the likelihood that the source of the prohibited substance was not the supplements mentioned by the Athlete,\\" the decision read.      Carter, who did not compete in Rio last summer, can appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.      Russian Tatyana Lebedeva, an Olympic silver medalist in the women's triple jump and long jump in 2008, was also disqualified and stripped of her medals for doping. Her samples were also reanalyzed, the IOC said.      PHOTOS: TRACK AND FIELD IN RIO ||||| Nesta Carter was told of the adverse finding in May - before the Rio Olympics      Usain Bolt will have to hand back one of his nine Olympic gold medals after Jamaican team-mate Nesta Carter tested positive for a banned substance.      Carter was part of the Jamaican quartet that won the 4x100m in Beijing in 2008.      His was one of 454 selected doping samples retested by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) last year, and has been found to contain the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine.      Bolt, 30, completed an unprecedented 'triple triple' in Rio last summer.      He won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay to add to his successes in the same events in 2008 and 2012.      Carter, 31, was also part of the squad that won the event in London five years ago and helped Jamaica win at the World Championships in 2011, 2013 and 2015.      He ran the first leg for Jamaica's 4x100m relay team in Beijing, which also included Michael Frater, Asafa Powell and Bolt.      The team won in a then-world record of 37.10 seconds, ahead of Trinidad and Tobago and Japan, who could have their medals upgraded. Brazil would then receive bronze.      The head of the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association, Dr Warren Blake, said he did not expect the whole team to be penalised: \\"I didn't rule out he'd be found guilty but my personal opinion is that I'm surprised they'd go that route.\\"      Carter's lawyer has confirmed that the sprinter will lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport.      The test and what happened next?      From left, Powell, Carter, Bolt and Frater celebrate in Beijing      Carter was tested on the evening of the Beijing final in 2008 but that was found at the time to contain no \\"adverse analytical finding\\".      More than 4,500 tests were carried out at those Games, with nine athletes caught cheating.      An anomaly was discovered in Carter's submission following the IOC's decision to retest 454 samples from Beijing using the latest scientific analysis methods.      Carter and the Jamaican National Olympic Committee were told of the adverse finding in May - before the Rio Games - and told his B sample would be tested.      It was reported by Reuters in June that Carter's A sample had been found to contain methylhexanamine, which has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) prohibited list since 2004.      It was reclassified in 2011 as a \\"specified substance\\", meaning one that is more susceptible to a \\"credible, non-doping explanation\\".      Sold as a nasal decongestant in the United States until 1983, methylhexanamine has been used more recently as an ingredient in dietary supplements.      Speaking in June, Bolt said the prospect of having to return the gold was \\"heartbreaking\\".      He told the Jamaica Gleaner: \\"For years you've worked hard to accumulate gold medals and you work hard to be a champion, but it's one of those things.      \\"I'm more concerned about the athlete and I hope he gets through it.\\"      Analysis - 'It takes the shine off Bolt's achievement'      Britain's two-time Olympic silver medallist Roger Black on BBC Radio 5 live      It takes the shine off Bolt's achievement. Eight doesn't have the same ring - 'double treble, plus two'.      It will be really frustrating for him. You can only account for yourself, you cannot account for your team-mates.      We know it has nothing to do with Usain Bolt - it will not damage his reputation - but it will affect it, take shine off it and he won't be a happy man.      When I hear stories like this, a part of me does celebrate. If athletes think they have got away with it, then with retrospective testing they can never sleep peacefully.      It has to be the strongest deterrent the sport now has. Even when athletes retire they can still have their medals taken away.      \\"There you go, I'm the greatest,\\" said Bolt after winning what was his ninth Olympic gold as Jamaica triumphed in the 4x100m relay in Rio      'A massively selfish act'      Marlon Devonish, 40, was part of the British 4x100m relay team which lost the silver medal at the World Championships in 2003 following Dwain Chambers' failed drugs test. He went on to win Olympic relay gold with Britain at Athens 2004.      Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, he said: \\"With relays you work together, you build a relationship, but you never know what goes on behind closed doors and clearly Carter was taking drugs.      \\"Carter has tarnished the team. It's a massively selfish act and I'm sure Bolt and the rest of the team are bitterly disappointed.      \\"The relationship between me and Dwain, we get on, we are cool. He apologised to me I and accepted it. Dwain has to live with it for the rest of his life, it was a sincere apology.      \\"I was devastated when I found out, but you have to move on.\\"      Russian senator stripped of titles      Tatyana Lebedeva is a former vice president of the Russian track federation and a current member of the IAAF's women's committee      Russia's Tatyana Lebedeva has also been stripped of her Beijing long jump and triple jump silver medals after dehydrochlormethyltestosterone was found in one of her samples.      The 40-year-old has told Russian news agency Tass that she plans to appeal against the decision to strip her of her medals, adding that she \\"will always fight to the end\\".      Lebedeva has resigned from the executive committee of the World Olympians Association (WOA), the umbrella organisation that represents 148 national associations of former Olympic athletes.

Does the answer correctly answer the question Choose your answer from:  (A). yes.  (B). no.","output":"A: The next settlement of people on Norfolk Island was indeed descended from a unique mix of Tahitians and the HMS Bounty mutineers, including those of Fletcher Christian. The story of the settlement on Norfolk Island began in 1788 when British settlers arrived there as part of the colonization of Australia and establishing a penal colony. This first settlement was short-lived, and by 1814, the settlers had abandoned the island. However, Norfolk Island was not left uninhabited for long. In 1825, the British once again attempted to establish a penal colony on the island, but it was again abandoned in 1855. A year later, in 1856, a new and distinct group of settlers arrived on the island's shores. These settlers were the descendants of the famous HMS Bounty mutineers and their Tahitian companions. The HMS Bounty mutiny occurred in 1789 when several crew members, led by Fletcher Christian, revolted against their tyrannical captain, William Bligh. The mutineers eventually settled on Pitcairn Island, located in the South Pacific, with the Tahitian men and women they had befriended during their voyage. Over time, the mutineers' and Tahitians' descendants intermarried, creating a blended culture with an English and Polynesian heritage. By the mid-19th century, the population on Pitcairn Island had grown to the point where the small island could no longer support them. As a result, the British government decided to relocate the Pitcairn Islanders – the descendants of the HMS Bounty mutineers and the Tahitians, including those of Fletcher Christian – to the more spacious and fertile Norfolk Island. The Pitcairn Islanders arrived on Norfolk Island in 1856 and began a new life there, bringing their unique history and cultural heritage with them. Today, the descendants of these settlers make up a significant portion of Norfolk Island's population, and their mixed Polynesian and British lineage endures as an important part of the island's cultural identity."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Agenerator converts kinetic energy into electrical energy, and kinetic energy is energy in motion.

Does \\"At her behest, a reference threatening the \\"undermining of native religions and customs\\" was replaced by a passage guaranteeing religious freedom.\\" correctly answer the question of What did Victoria believe that an official proclamation transferring control from the company to the monarchy would do?","output":"While the statement \\"At her behest, a reference threatening the 'undermining of native religions and customs' was replaced by a passage guaranteeing religious freedom\\" does offer insight into Queen Victoria's beliefs and actions, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about what Victoria believed an official proclamation transferring control from the East India Company to the British monarchy would do. To provide a more detailed response to the question, one must consider the broader context of the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British monarchy. This transfer occurred in 1858 after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which was a widespread and violent uprising against British rule in India. Many factors contributed to the rebellion, including cultural, economic, and political grievances. After the rebellion, it was clear that the East India Company could no longer effectively govern British India, and the British government decided to take direct control of India in the form of Crown rule. Queen Victoria believed that an official proclamation transferring control from the company to the monarchy would have several effects: 1. Strengthen British control: Taking direct control of India under the British monarchy would centralize power and provide a more stable form of governance than the East India Company could offer. This would help to prevent the disarray and mismanagement that had contributed to the rebellion. 2. Address grievances of the Indian population: Victoria felt that an official proclamation could also be used as an opportunity to address some of the grievances that the Indian population had with the company's rule. As mentioned in the statement, one of these changes was her insistence on the inclusion of a passage guaranteeing religious freedom, instead of one that threatened the undermining of native religions and customs. This would help to ease tensions in India and build trust between the British and Indian populations. 3. Promote fairness and equality: By transferring power to the British monarchy, the proclamation could help ensure that the government treated the Indian population more fairly and equitably. Victoria believed in the importance of treating all subjects of the British Empire with dignity and respect, regardless of their nationality or religion. The proclamation would embody these values and demonstrate the British government's commitment to fair governance. 4. Bolster the British Empire: The official proclamation transferring control would also serve to strengthen the British Empire as a whole. Establishing a clear and direct relationship between the Indian territories and the monarchy would provide a more coherent structure for governing and administering the empire. This would contribute to the overall stability of the empire and help protect British interests in India as well as other parts of the world. In conclusion, Queen Victoria believed that an official proclamation transferring control from the East India Company to the British monarchy would strengthen British control in India, address the grievances of the Indian population, promote fairness and equality, and bolster the British Empire as a whole. While the specific statement about religious freedom is an important aspect of her beliefs, it is only part of a larger understanding of her perspective on the transfer of power in India."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

When single father Thurman Williams needed help filling out papers in a custody suit recently, he didn't look to his lawyer for help. He walked to a computerized kiosk at the Lamoreaux Justice Center in Orange and started tapping the keys. As part of a legal experiment, litigants without lawyers across California are using computerized video kiosks to prepare common court filings and seek basic legal advice. The kiosk used by Williams is part of a statewide effort to cope with a flood of litigants who cannot afford or refuse to hire lawyers. Court officials statewide fear the number of self-represented litigants has reached crisis levels and threatens to clog court calendars. Like Williams, more than 6,000 Orange County litigants have initiated court actions on I-CAN! kiosks or accessed the programs on the Internet, using home computers. Similar programs are operating in Sacramento, San Diego and Ventura. A recent study of the kiosks' first 18 months of operation concluded it is too soon to tell if the system will relieve pressure on court calendars. But the report, by UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology, said users were overwhelmingly positive about the free legal assistance. \\"It's made life a lot easier for me,\\" Williams said. \\"It's helped keep me from going to the poorhouse.\\" The 29-year-old Orange resident was directed to a kiosk in the Lamoreaux Justice Center by court staff. After putting on headphones and following the directions of a videotaped instructor, Williams filled out a quarter-inch stack of paternity and custody documents. The exercise took 20 minutes; it would have cost him about 800 if he had relied on a lawyer, he said. \\"It was a lot easier than I thought.\\" Whether they can't afford a lawyer or just want to save money, more Californians are going to court without a lawyer. \\"I'm just amazed at the numbers,\\" said Commissioner Salvador Sarmiento, who hears between 40 and 90 child-support cases a day in Lamoreaux Justice Center.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Salvador Sarmiento\\" correctly answer the question \\"Who made this remark: \\"It's helped keep me from going to the poorhouse.\\"\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Salvador Sarmiento\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Who made this remark: 'It's helped keep me from going to the poorhouse.'?\\" The statement was actually made by Thurman Williams, not Commissioner Salvador Sarmiento. Thurman Williams is the single father mentioned in the story who needed help filling out papers in a custody suit.

Context: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event.

How do you do this: how to clean a cast iron skillet","output":"Cleaning a cast iron skillet is essential to maintain its seasoning and prevent rust. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide on how to clean your cast iron skillet properly: 1. Start with a warm skillet:  Begin the cleaning process while the skillet is still warm to the touch. The residual heat helps to dislodge any food particles and makes the cleaning process easier. 2. Remove excess food: Using a non-abrasive spatula or a flat-edged wooden spoon, gently scrape away any large food particles from the skillet. Discard these in the trash or compost. 3. Use a brush, sponge or scraper: Select a gentle cleaning tool that won't damage the skillet's seasoning. Options include a non-abrasive brush, non-metal sponge, or a scraper specifically designed for cast iron cookware. If you opt for a cast iron scraper, select one made of nylon or silicone to avoid scratching the skillet's surface. 4. Clean with warm water: Wet the cleaning tool with warm water and gently scrub the skillet's surface to remove any stuck-on food or grease. Be sure to avoid using soap as it can strip away the skillet's seasoning. Cold water can cause the skillet to crack, so always use warm water. 5. Rinse the skillet: Transfer the skillet to a sink and rinse with warm water until all food residue has been washed away. It's important to rinse the skillet thoroughly so no residues are left behind. 6. Dry the skillet: Using a clean, dry cloth or paper towel, thoroughly dry the skillet immediately after rinsing to prevent rust formation. Make sure to dry the interior, exterior, handle, and any crevices to remove all traces of moisture. 7. Heat the skillet to evaporate remaining moisture: Place the skillet on the stove over low-medium heat for a few minutes. This will evaporate any residual moisture and prevent rusting. Alternatively, you can place the skillet in a warm oven to achieve the same result. 8. Apply a thin layer of oil: To maintain your skillet's seasoning and protect it from rust, apply a thin layer of cooking oil (vegetable oil, canola oil, or flaxseed oil) to its entire surface, including the handle and bottom. Use a clean, lint-free cloth or paper towel to evenly spread the oil. 9. Heat the skillet: Place the oil-coated skillet back on the stove over low-medium heat or in an oven preheated to 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes. This process, known as seasoning, helps polymerize the oil, creating a protective layer on the skillet. 10. Remove and cool the skillet: After heating, carefully remove the skillet from the heat source and let it cool completely. Once it's cool to the touch, you can store it until the next use.

Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter. Answer:","output":"The ecological region that is not on the outermost base of the Table Rocks is the mounded prairie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(AP) — Talk about penny pinching: A Pennsylvania man is accused of stealing about 300,000 pennies from his employer.      Police in Taylor, just outside Scranton, have charged 34-year-old Robert Napolitan with burglary and related offenses. He's accused of taking a steel drum filled with 3,000 worth of pennies from Pyne Freight Lines, where he worked as a mechanic.      A criminal complaint says he loaded the 1,600-pound drum onto a hand truck at the company building Monday and rolled it to his Jeep. Police say the company owner used the drum like an enormous spare change jar for his pennies.      The (Scranton) Times-Tribune reports (http://bit.ly/2cj9Xq5 ) tracks through the dust and a trail of pennies marked his path.      Police searched his Jeep and found pennies underneath the seats and floor mats.      Police say he admitted to taking the drum. No lawyer information is listed in court documents.      Napolitan was jailed in Lackawanna County in lieu of 50,000 bail.      ___      Information from: The Times-Tribune, http://thetimes-tribune.com/ ||||| Summary:","output":"A man from Scott Township, Pennsylvania, identified as Robert E. Napolitan, was charged with burglary after allegedly stealing a steel drum containing 3,000 worth of pennies from his employer, according to a criminal complaint. The drum, weighing more than 1,600 pounds, was moved on a hand truck across the floor of Pyne Freight Lines Inc., where Napolitan worked as a mechanic. The path taken by Napolitan was marked by tracks through the dust and a trail of scattered pennies. Napolitan, who had a key to the building’s back door, informed a company dispatcher that he would be on the premises late at night during the Labor Day weekend, supposedly to remove parts from a broken-down Dodge Durango. However, surveillance camera footage depicted Napolitan's white Jeep Cherokee arriving at 2:30 a.m. without any signs of work conducted on the Dodge. Upon searching his Jeep, police discovered 89 pennies underneath the seats and floor mats. Napolitan admitted to stealing the pennies, leading to his charges of burglary, criminal trespass, theft through unlawful taking, and receiving stolen property, all classified as felonies.  Napolitan is currently detained at the Lackawanna County Prison, pending a 50,000 bail and a preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place on Wednesday. The employer utilized the drum as an enormous spare change jar for collecting pennies.  This case serves as a noteworthy example of crime where an employee stole a significant amount of low-value currency, equivalent to about 300,000 pennies, from his employer. The audacity of the act is further emphasized by the physical requirements of handling such a large and heavy amount of coinage, which left an obvious trail that led to Napolitan's apprehension. The incident showcases a blatant disregard for ethics and law within the workplace, underscoring the importance of thorough staff screening, trust-building, and increased security measures in business environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","output":"Billy began having problems when he made it to high school."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation.  Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.  I am facing a new situation today: Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which cousin experienced more temperature inversion phenomena? The answer is:","output":"Ann, who lived in the mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, experienced more temperature inversion phenomena.  Temperature inversion occurs when the temperature increases with height instead of decreasing as it usually does in the troposphere. This phenomenon is more likely to be observed in mountainous areas, such as the village where Ann lives, due to various factors that contribute to the formation of temperature inversions in those regions.  In mountainous areas, the nighttime cooling of the Earth's surface can cause a layer of cooler air to form near the ground. Meanwhile, warmer air can be trapped above this cool layer, leading to a temperature inversion. Additionally, the complex terrain of mountains can facilitate the pooling of cold air in valleys, further promoting the formation of temperature inversions. Inversions can also happen during daytime when warm air from the valleys rise and go above the cooler air at the mountaintops. On the other hand, Dee, who lived in a coastal town at sea level, is less likely to experience temperature inversion phenomena as frequently, since coastal areas have more moderate temperature fluctuations and the ocean helps regulate the temperatures of the air masses nearby. However, some coastal areas may experience inversions in specific meteorological conditions, but they tend to be less frequent and less pronounced compared to mountainous areas like where Ann lives. Therefore, given the geographical and climatic differences of their locations, Ann experienced more temperature inversion phenomena than Dee."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Morton was son of John Morton , Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury , and the nephew of William Morton , the Archbishop of Canterbury .","output":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia convey similar information, there are subtle differences in their phrasing which might imply slight variations in their meaning. Sentence 1:  Morton was the son of John Morton, a Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury, and the nephew of William Morton, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Sentence 2: Morton was son of John Morton, Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury, and the nephew of William Morton, the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the first sentence, the phrase \\"a Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury\\" is written with the definite article \\"a\\" before \\"Member of Parliament.\\" This suggests that John Morton held the position of being one among other Members of Parliament for Shaftesbury. The definite article \\"the\\" is used in both sentences when referring to William Morton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, which specifies a unique and established position. In contrast, the second sentence omits the definite article \\"a\\" before \\"Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury.\\" This omission might not carry a significant difference in meaning, but it places more emphasis on John Morton's name and position. The deliberate phrasing might highlight his status as a known and prominent political figure at that time. Additionally, the first sentence uses the construction \\"was the son of\\" while the second sentence uses \\"was son of.\\" Though the difference between these forms is negligible, the former emphasizes Morton's familial relationship to John Morton more explicitly, while the latter is less formal and emphasizes their connection with slightly less emphasis. In summary, while these two sentences are very similar in meaning, there are minor differences in their emphasis, specifically with regards to John Morton's status and the focus on the familial relationships. However, the overall message conveyed by both sentences remains largely the same, and readers will understand that Morton is the son of John Morton, a Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury, and the nephew of William Morton, the Archbishop of Canterbury."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scroll down for video. Sony Pictures seems to be taking North Korea's objections to the company's upcoming Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy seriously enough to begin altering the film. The nation would consider showing military decorations blasphemous. The studio is also considering cutting a scene in which Kim Jong Un's face is melted off in slow motion. However a source in touch with The Hollywood Reporter says the face-melting may be cut only because the filmmakers are still trying to decide whether they think it's funny, and not because of pressure from the rogue nation.

Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training?  Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","output":"The Blue group, which did weight training for 3 months, didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training. This is because weight training primarily focuses on increasing the size and strength of skeletal muscles by contracting them against a resisting force. On the other hand, the Brown group, which ran 3 miles a day for three months, engaged in cardiovascular exercises like running.

Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions   began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: \\"Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ... We could at least propose to evict the female element\\".

Microsoft Reveals Windows Phone 8 Microsoft just unveiled the next big step in its mobile software, Windows Phone 8. Codenamed “Apollo,” Windows Phone 8 brings the platform in line with other mobile OSes by adding support for muti-core processors, higher screen resolutions and newer wireless technologies like near field communication (NFC). Importantly, Microsoft has re-coded Windows Phone from the ground up for the new version. Previous versions of Windows Phone were based on Microsoft’s old mobile OS, Windows CE, but now the platform will share the same source code as the company’s coming desktop OS, Windows 8. That has big consequences for developers and consumers. For developers, it will be extremely easy to create a Windows Phone app if they already have a Windows 8 app that runs in the Metro environment (and vice versa). For consumers, it means more apps and better hardware to run them. It also has the effect of rendering every current Windows Phone obsolete, since those phones won’t be able to run the new software. They will, however, get an upgrade to Windows Phone 7.8. Windows Phone 8 adds support for many new hardware features. The most anticipated is support for multi-core devices, which have become common on both Android and iOS platforms. There’s also support for better screen resolutions, including 720p and 1,280 x 768 (WXGA). That’s not quite retina, but it’s better than the 800 x 480 screen of the Nokia Lumia 900, one of the current leading Windows Phones. On top of that, the new Windows Phones include support for external storage in the form of microSD cards as well as NFC. NFC support opens the door for mobile payments, of course, and Microsoft is way ahead of you. The company says it’s created the “most complete” mobile wallet solution, working directly with carrier partners to implement it. In the U.S., that means working with ISIS, a mobile-payments collaboration between Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, though Microsoft says consumers won’t see the fruits of that partnership until next year. Windows Phone 8 puts Nokia Maps front and center, removing the redundancy between that service and Microsoft’s own Bing Maps service. It will support offline viewing of maps. In the biggest cosmetic change, the dynamic “live tiles” on the home screen in Windows Phone 8 have been given an extreme makeover. They’re now much more customizable, giving users many more options for colors and sizes. The idea is you can tailor your home screen in much more detail — for example, if you’re a sports nut, you can decorate it with sports apps that update on the fly with scores and photos. Microsoft also has much more to offer IT departments with Windows Phone 8. The new OS supports encryption, secure boot and device management, and it includes mobile versions of Microsoft’s popular Office apps. What do you think of Windows Phone 8 and its many features?

[2]. winter was very cold. Answer:","output":"2. The winter was very cold. Angel preferred winter to summer because she could see her breath. The winter was very cold, which made the air crisp and invigorating, unlike the oppressive heat of summer. She loved bundling up in her warmest clothes, wearing cozy scarves, gloves, and hats to protect herself from the frosty chill. The sight of her breath hanging in the air in visible puffs was like a form of magic that never failed to amaze her. With winter came the holidays, filled with gatherings of friends and family members. Angel relished in the opportunity to host festive dinner parties, where everyone would come together to share food, stories, and laughter in the warmth and comfort of her home.  She also enjoyed curling up by the fire with a hot cup of cocoa, a thick blanket, and a good book. This gave her a sense of relaxation and contentment she could never quite achieve during the muggy, sweltering months. One of Angel's favorite things about winter was snow, the perfect natural phenomenon that would blanket the world outside her window in a serene coat of white. She found such satisfaction in the act of building snowmen, engaging in playful snowball fights, and going sledding down the tallest hills with her friends. There was something magical about the way the snowflakes would gracefully drift down from the sky, gathering on the ground and the branches of trees, creating a breathtaking winter wonderland in her own backyard. The sound of the ice crackling under her boots as she walked through freshly fallen snow gave her a sense of adventure and purpose, as if she were exploring new, uncharted terrain. Additionally, winter nights provided Angel with the opportunity to gaze at the clear, star-filled sky. With skies less obscured by atmospheric haze, the celestial bodies above would shine even brighter, casting mystical patterns with each constellation. Though Angel understood the appeal of summer—the warm sun, trips to the beach, and endless barbecue parties—she found herself yearning for winter when the days grew long and hot. For her, the simple pleasure of seeing her breath, feeling the chill in the air, and witnessing the frosted beauty of the world outside her window were a joy she couldn't deny. And so, Angel would patiently wait for the arrival of winter each year, eager to embrace all that it had to offer. For her, the cold months not only held a beauty in the natural world but also a sense of kinship and warmth that she could not find during the bustling, hot days of summer."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

August 31, 2010      Flanked by the U.S. and President’s flag, Obama told the nation that “Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.” With these words he brought an end to nearly a decade of war and fulfilled one of his major campaign promises.      With the long and costly operation coming to a close, Obama said the U.S.’s most “urgent task” was to “restore our economy, and put the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs back to work.” At the time, the nation was still suffering from the 2008 financial crisis.      June 15, 2010      Obama’s first Oval Office address concerned what he called “the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced.” On April 20 an explosion ripped a hole in the BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, killing 11 workers and dumping millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, just 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana.      In his speech, Obama praised the ongoing cleanup operation while acknowledging the permanent damage already done to the coastline and wildlife. He issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling and spoke of stricter industry regulations to ensure the mistake did not happen again.      The tragedy on the coast, he said, was “the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Two people who talk on a TV channel called Fox News said some not-nice words about the president of the United States, President Obama.

Neboj - This term is derived from the Czech verb \\"bát se\\", which means to be afraid or fear. \\"Neboj\\" is the imperative form of this verb which translates to \\"don't be afraid\\" or \\"don't fear\\". 2. se - It is a reflexive pronoun that is often used in conjunction with the verb, in this case, \\"Neboj se\\" translates to \\"don't be afraid\\" or \\"don't worry\\". This reflexive pronoun represents oneself, so it refers to the person being told not to worry or be afraid. 3. on - This is a Czech pronoun for \\"he\\" referring to a male person. 4. ji - It is a feminine pronoun in the accusative form, which refers to a female person and corresponds to the English \\"her\\". 5. nezastřelí - This word is derived from the verb \\"zastřelit\\", which means \\"to shoot (someone)\\" or \\"shoot fatally\\". \\"Nezastřelí\\" is the negation of this verb and translates to \\"won't shoot\\" or \\"will not shoot\\".

Title: Intermission Movie plot: John and Deirdre are a recently separated young couple with an extended group of interrelated friends, family and co-workers. Lehiff is a petty criminal always involved in trouble. Lehiff's nemesis, Garda Detective Jerry Lynch presents himself as a saviour who fights the \\"scumbags\\" on Dublin's streets, and enlists the help of Ben Campion, an ambitious film-maker and the bane of his \\"go-softer\\" boss, who considers Lynch too nasty a subject to be shown on a mainstream âdocusoapâ series on Irish television. While shooting a scene about a traffic accident, Ben is told to focus his attention on Sally, Deirdre's sister, who helped the passengers after the double-decker bus they were on crashed. Sally is deeply insecure about her looks. She grows bitter when Deirdre flaunts her new boyfriend, Sam, a middle-aged bank manager who has left his wife of 14 years, Noeleen, leaving her to question her own self-worth as a woman and wife. John is utterly lost without Deirdre and is determined to win her back. He gets involved in an absurd plan along with Mick, the driver of the bus that crashed, and Lehiff. They kidnap Sam and force him to go to his bank to get money for a ransom. Things go awry when Sam, who has the money, is assaulted by an enraged Noeleen on the street and a couple of police officers appear. Mick and John flee the scene without their money.

Definition: In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY, or others, feel what is mentioned in the Tail or not.

The dusky thrush was seen at the Dukes Barn activity centre in Beeley, Derbyshire, on Monday by resident Rachel Jones whose subsequent social media post was spotted by twitchers. Experts believe the bird, which breeds in central Siberia, was blown to Britain by \\"strong easterly winds\\". Hundreds more people are expected to flock to the centre on Tuesday. Updates on this story and more from Derbyshire Colin Higginson, who is the manager of the centre - which is a charity that helps children with disabilities - said he has \\"never seen anything like it\\" and claimed one person had flown from Belgium to see the bird. Birdwatcher Philip Garnett drove to the centre on Tuesday morning from Bolton to catch a glimpse of the bird. He said: \\"I've been to Asia about 20 times and have never seen one. It's so rare.\\" Nick Brown, wildlife enquiries officer at the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, said this is the 12th time the dusky thrush has been seen in Britain - though some twitchers claimed it is the 13th time the bird has been seen on these shores. Mr Brown said: \\"There were a lot of easterly winds in October that blew a lot of birds that should have flown south, westward. \\"Normally migration is in October and finishes in November, so this bird has probably been here for a while. \\"The bird breeds in Siberia and they look like a redwing.

(The procedure is necessary to avoid violating the Neutrality Acts, as the United States is still neutral.) Cocky American pilot Tim Baker (Tyrone Power) decides to fly across the border to Trenton, Ontario, and winds up in trouble with the military authorities, unconvincingly claiming he was looking for Trenton, New Jersey. Baker ferries a Lockheed Hudson bomber to Britain, pocketing 1,000 for his work. In London, he runs into his on-again off-again girlfriend Carol Brown (Betty Grable), who works in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force by day and stars in a nightclub by night. She is none too pleased to see him, calling him a \\"worm\\" for his womanizing ways, lying, and long absence, but he is confident she still harbors strong feelings for him. He decides to enlist in the Royal Air Force (RAF). Meanwhile, Brown attracts the appreciative attention of two RAF officers, Wing Commander John Morley (John Sutton) and Flying Officer Roger Pillby (Reginald Gardiner). Morley persists in seeing Brown, despite being told at the outset that there is another man. Pillby is unable to persuade either Baker or Morley to introduce him. After completing training, Baker is disappointed to be assigned to Morley's bomber squadron, rather than to a fighter. He becomes further disgruntled when his first mission is to \\"bomb\\" Berlin with propaganda leaflets as Morley's co-pilot during the Phoney War. Pillby pilots another bomber in the raid. When Baker is late for their date (sidetracked by meeting an old buddy from America), Brown accepts Morley's invitation to spend a weekend at his country estate. There, Morley asks her to marry him. When she tells Baker about it (without revealing who her suitor is), he offers to marry her himself, but in an insultingly casual way. She tells him that they are through.

Answer a question about this article: Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between medicine and biology. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including instructional design, educational technology, curriculum development, organizational learning, special education and classroom management. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, & Raley, 2006). In universities where are the departments of educational psychology normally held?","output":"In universities, the departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows?  Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band. Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows is Devin. Devin Townsend is known for his eccentric stage presence and persona, which contributed to the energetic live performances of his band, Strapping Young Lad."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are the following two questions the same? How to play NDS files on Ubuntu? How do I rename a C++ file in Linux Ubuntu? Pick from:  A). no;  B). yes; The answer is:","output":"A). no; The two questions mentioned are not the same. They are asking about different tasks related to Ubuntu, a popular Linux distribution. First question: \\"How to play NDS files on Ubuntu?\\" This query seeks information on how to play Nintendo DS (NDS) files on Ubuntu. NDS files are ROM images of games designed for the Nintendo DS gaming console. To use these files on Ubuntu, you would need an appropriate emulator to run them. An emulator is a software application that mimics the functionality of the gaming console, allowing you to run NDS file games. Here's a detailed response on how to play NDS files on Ubuntu: 1. Install a Nintendo DS emulator: One popular NDS emulator for Linux is DeSmuME. You can install it using the following command:    \`sudo apt install desmume\` 2. Download the NDS ROMs: Acquire legal NDS ROMs of the games you own. It's essential to ensure that you possess the legal copy of the game before downloading the NDS file. 3. Load the NDS ROMs with the emulator: After installing the emulator and acquiring the NDS files, open the emulator and use the File -> Open menu option to navigate to the location where the NDS ROMs are stored. Select the ROM file that you want to play, and the emulator will launch the game. 4. Configure the emulator settings and controls: You can customize the settings of the emulator (graphics, audio, controls, etc.) to your preference. DeSmuME allows you to configure the controls, screen resolution, and frame rate, resulting in an improved gaming experience on Ubuntu. Second question: \\"How do I rename a C++ file in Linux Ubuntu?\\" This query is about renaming a C++ file (a source code file with a .cpp extension) on a Linux-based Ubuntu operating system. Here's a detailed response on how to rename a C++ file in Linux Ubuntu: You can use the command-line interface (Terminal) or a graphical user interface (File manager) to rename a C++ file. 1. Using the command line:    The 'mv' command is used to move or rename files in Linux-based systems. To rename a C++ file, open the terminal and type:    \`mv old_filename.cpp new_filename.cpp\`    Replace 'old_filename.cpp' with the name of the file you want to rename and 'new_filename.cpp' with the new name you would like to use. 2. Using the graphical user interface (File manager):    a. Open the file manager and navigate to the folder containing the C++ file.    b. Right-click on the file you would like to rename.    c. From the context menu, select the 'Rename' option.    d. Enter the new name and press Enter or click outside the text box.

FBI Director James Comey says his agency's demand that Apple break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters is \\"about the victims and justice.\\"      \\"Fourteen people were slaughtered and many more had their lives and bodies ruined,\\" Comey wrote in a post on the Lawfare blog late Sunday. \\"We owe them a thorough and professional investigation under law.\\"      His comments are the latest public move in a clash between federal law enforcement and the giant technology company that has fueled a fierce debate about security and privacy.      Apple (AAPL, Tech30) CEO Tim Cook has vigorously opposed the FBI's demand, saying the government is asking the company to \\"hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers.\\"      Comey on Sunday sought to play down the significance of his agency's request, which he described as \\"limited.\\"      \\"We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly,\\" he wrote. \\"That's it. We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land.\\"      Related: See who's taking sides on Apple vs. FBI      But that's exactly what Apple says will happen if it complies with the feds' demand.      \\"Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices,\\" Cook wrote in a letter last week.      In the ongoing legal battle, the Justice Department won a federal judge's order last week to require Apple to help the FBI. Apple says it plans to fight the order.      Some of the victims of the San Bernardino attack are also expected to join the case on the government's side.      Stephen Larson, a lawyer and former judge, said the Los Angeles U.S. Attorney's Office and the San Bernardino district attorney had asked him to represent the interests of victims in the Apple litigation.      He said he was speaking to several family members but declined to say how many victims he represents.      Larson told CNN that the \\"victims may have an interest that may be slightly different from the government's.\\" They have questions they want answered, including, \\"How could this have happened?\\" and \\"Are they still in danger?\\" he said.      Larson said he plans to file his brief in the coming days.      Related: Who do you trust more, Apple or the FBI?      Major technology companies like Google and Facebook have taken Apple's side in the debate, warning that the case could set a dangerous precedent. But some political figures, including Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, have voiced support for the federal court order.      Cook and Comey may have a chance to face off publicly over the case.      The House Energy and Commerce Committee said last week it had asked both men to testify to \\"explain to Congress and the American people the issues at play and how they plan to move forward.\\"      No date has been set yet for the hearing and it isn't clear whether Cook or Comey will attend.      Both men have called Americans to take part a public conversation about the issues at stake.      The FBI has been up in arms about Apple's encryption tactics for a while, arguing that it will impede its investigations. It has been pleading with Congress to pass a law requiring Apple to build backdoors into its system.      Its demands have met stiff resistance, and the Obama administration said it would no longer pursue a legal strategy to combat Apple's encryption. But last week's court order could shift the tide against Apple.      \\"While we believe the FBI's intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products,\\" Cook said last week. \\"And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\\" ||||| The San Bernardino litigation isn't about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message. It is about the victims and justice. Fourteen people were slaughtered and many more had their lives and bodies ruined. We owe them a thorough and professional investigation under law. That's what this is. The American people should expect nothing less from the FBI.      The particular legal issue is actually quite narrow. The relief we seek is limited and its value increasingly obsolete because the technology continues to evolve. We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That's it. We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land. I hope thoughtful people will take the time to understand that. Maybe the phone holds the clue to finding more terrorists. Maybe it doesn’t. But we can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead.      Reflecting the context of this heart-breaking case, I hope folks will take a deep breath and stop saying the world is ending, but instead use that breath to talk to each other. Although this case is about the innocents attacked in San Bernardino, it does highlight that we have awesome new technology that creates a serious tension between two values we all treasure: privacy and safety. That tension should not be resolved by corporations that sell stuff for a living. It also should not be resolved by the FBI, which investigates for a living. It should be resolved by the American people deciding how we want to govern ourselves in a world we have never seen before. We shouldn't drift to a place—or be pushed to a place by the loudest voices—because finding the right place, the right balance, will matter to every American for a very long time.      So I hope folks will remember what terrorists did to innocent Americans at a San Bernardino office gathering and why the FBI simply must do all we can under the law to investigate that. And in that sober spirit, I also hope all Americans will participate in the long conversation we must have about how to both embrace the technology we love and get the safety we need. ||||| \\"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true,\\" Cook wrote. \\"Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.

No reasonable person would find that acceptable.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The dispute between the FBI and Apple continues to escalate, with FBI Director James Comey saying the agency's demand that Apple unlock the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone is \\"about the victims and justice.\\" His comments were posted on the Lawfare blog, and follow Apple CEO Tim Cook's vehement opposition to the FBI's demand.

Which entity is this text about? Robert Montgomery Knight (born October 25, 1940) is a retired American basketball coach. Nicknamed \\"The General\\", Knight won 902 NCAA Division I men's college basketball games, the most all-time at the time of his retirement and currently third all-time, behind his former player and assistant coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke University, and Jim Boeheim of Syracuse University. Knight is best known as the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers from 1971 to 2000. On March 14, 2000 (just before Indiana was to begin play in the NCAA tournament), the CNN Sports Illustrated network ran a piece on Knight in which former player Neil Reed claimed he had been choked by Knight during a 1997 practice. Knight denied the claims in the story. However, less than a month later, the network aired a tape of an Indiana practice from 1997 that appeared to show Knight placing his hand on the neck of Reed.  In response, Indiana University president Myles Brand announced that he had adopted a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy with regard to Knight's behavior. Later in the year, in September 2000, Indiana freshman Kent Harvey reportedly said, \\"Hey, Knight, what's up?\\" to Knight. According to Harvey, Knight then grabbed him by the arm and lectured him for not showing him respect, insisting that Harvey address him as either \\"Mr. Knight\\" or \\"Coach Knight\\" instead of simply \\"Knight.\\" Brand stated that this incident was only one of numerous complaints that occurred after the zero-tolerance policy had been put into place. Brand asked Knight to resign on September 10, and when Knight refused, Brand relieved him of his coaching duties effective immediately. Knight's dismissal was met with outrage from students. That night, thousands of Indiana students marched from Indiana University's Assembly Hall to Brand's home, burning Brand in effigy.  Harvey was supported by some and vilified by many who claim he had intentionally set up Knight. Kent Harvey's stepfather, Mark Shaw, was a former Bloomington-area radio talk show host and Knight critic. On September 13, Knight said goodbye to a crowd of some 6,000 supporters in Dunn Meadow at Indiana University. He asked that they not hold a grudge against Harvey and that they continue to support the basketball team. Knight's firing made national headlines, including the cover of Sports Illustrated and around the clock coverage on ESPN.","output":"This text is about Robert Montgomery Knight, also known as \\"The General\\".

The engineer had to take the pressure off of the box from the ball because the  Choices: (A). box was too heavy.; (B). ball was too heavy.; Answer:","output":"The engineer had to take the pressure off of the box from the ball because the ball was too heavy, causing a risk of compromising the structural integrity of the box, which could lead to potential damages and failures of the overall design if left unresolved. The weight of the ball could also impact the performance and efficiency of the system it was a part of, impeding the ability to achieve the desired outcomes for the project. Furthermore, a heavy ball exerting excessive pressure on the box could create safety concerns, as overburdened structures could deteriorate and collapse under the weight, putting both the engineer and any other personnel working on the project at risk of injury. To address this issue, the engineer needed to devise a solution that would effectively redistribute the load, perhaps through reinforcement of the box itself or by redesigning the way the ball interacts with the box, ensuring that both components could withstand the forces applied to them while maintaining their intended functions and overall efficiency within the system. Additionally, the engineer may have needed to revisit the material choices for both the box and the ball, potentially opting for stronger, more resilient options that could better accommodate the weight and pressure without compromising on safety or functionality. Ultimately, the decision to take the pressure off the box from the heavy ball was essential for the ongoing success of the project, as well as for the safety and well-being of all involved."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write an article based on this \\"The German government says North African countries cannot expect German development aid if they are unwilling to take back failed asylum seekers.\\"","output":"Title: German Development Aid Hinges on the Compliance of North African Nations on Asylum Seekers Issue Introduction In a recent statement, the German government has asserted that North African countries cannot anticipate receiving development aid if they are uncooperative with taking back failed asylum seekers. This candid message reveals the extent to which Germany's patience has been tested in attempting to navigate the multifaceted issue of migration from North Africa. Moreover, it signifies a turning point in Germany's approach to dealing with this humanitarian crisis that has seen millions of people risking their lives to find refuge in Europe. In this article, we will delve into the background leading up to this ultimatum, the implications it may have for both Germany and North African nations, and the subsequent response it is likely to elicit from the affected countries. The Roots of the Issue Over the last few years, Europe has been grappling with a massive influx of refugees and migrants, predominantly from Syria and several North African nations. The situation has strained European capacities, resources, and solidarity. For Germany, specifically, this has meant an overwhelming number of people seeking asylum within its borders. The German government has demonstrated commendable perseverance and empathy, as evidenced by their open-door policy in 2015, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel. However, not every asylum seeker can be granted refuge due to several factors, including false claims, insufficient documentation, and a lack of adherence to international refugee law. Consequently, a significant number of asylum applications are deemed to have failed, and those individuals are required to return to their home countries. The German government has repeatedly attempted to negotiate with North African nations like Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco to expedite the repatriation process for failed asylum seekers. Nevertheless, these countries have demonstrated an unwillingness to comply, further complicating the matter for German authorities. Development Aid as Leverage In light of the mounting frustration and pressure to resolve the refugee crisis, the German government has opted to employ a new tactic: using developmental aid as leverage. By making it unambiguously clear that continued financial assistance from Germany will be contingent upon North African countries accepting failed asylum seekers, the government sends a firm message about the urgent need for cooperation from these nations. This strategic maneuver aims to prompt more decisive action in facilitating the return of these individuals and creating a more equitable distribution of responsibility. Potential Implications The German government's decision to make development aid conditional upon compliance in the asylum seekers' issue could have far-reaching consequences for all parties involved. For Germany, this decision may assist in alleviating some immediate internal pressures associated with failed asylum seekers; however, it may also lead to a decline in diplomatic relations with North African countries. On the other hand, North African nations have much to lose by refusing to cooperate. The withdrawal of German development aid would undoubtedly exacerbate economic, social, and political struggles already faced by these countries. Furthermore, the move could potentially catalyze other European nations to adopt a similar stance, further exacerbating the challenges these countries are facing. Finding a Common Ground In the aftermath of this ultimatum, it will be crucial to observe how North African countries respond. Ultimately, it is in the best interests of these nations to find a common ground with Germany on the matter of failed asylum seekers. The flow of development aid is vital in helping North African governments provide for the welfare of their citizens, and maintaining positive diplomatic relations with Europe is crucial in addressing the root causes of migration. At the same time, Germany must be sensitive to the fragile political and economic conditions in North African countries, understanding that a sudden influx of returning failed asylum seekers could potentially destabilize these nations further. Therefore, cooperation and open dialogue between relevant stakeholders will be paramount in finding a viable solution to the asylum seeker crisis - one that safeguards the interests of all countries involved. Conclusion The German government's decision to hinge development aid on the compliance of North African nations with the asylum seekers issue marks a crucial turning point in the ongoing migration crisis. At the heart of this development lies the need for transnational cooperation and dialogue. It remains to be seen how North African countries will react to this new policy, but one thing is certain: finding a lasting, equitable solution to the challenge of asylum seekers will require concerted efforts from all parties involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website. Among the disturbing sounds heard on the recording was a child identified by ProPublica as a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begging authorities in Spanish to call her aunt to pick her up from the detention center.

Article:","output":"Title: Mary Ellen O'Connell Says U.S. Plans for Syria Should Follow U.N. Law Once upon a time, there was a very wise woman named Mary Ellen O'Connell. She knew a lot about rules and laws that countries have to follow when they work together. This is very important, because just like how your friends need to follow the rules when you play games together, countries also need to make sure they follow the rules when they work together. One day, Mary Ellen O'Connell heard that the United States was planning a response to something that happened in a country called Syria. The U.S. believed that the leaders in Syria used something called \\"chemical weapons,\\" which are very dangerous and harmful to people. Mary Ellen agreed that using chemical weapons is very wrong, but she was worried that the U.S. was going to do something without getting approval from a group called the United Nations (U.N.).  The U.N. is like a big club where countries come together and talk about the problems in the world. They also have rules that countries need to follow when dealing with each other. Mary Ellen O'Connell said that the U.S. needs to follow the U.N.'s rules while deciding on their response to Syria. This is because not following the rules can lead to very sad and dangerous situations, like the Iraq War. During the Iraq War, the United States and some other countries decided to go to war against a country called Iraq. They did this without getting approval from the U.N., which was against the rules. This caused many people to lose their homes and their lives, which was very, very sad.  Mary Ellen O'Connell wanted to help keep everyone safe, so she reminded the President of the United States, Barack Obama, to be careful when planning a response to Syria. She said that President Obama was right to say that using chemical weapons is very bad, but he needed to make sure that the United States followed the rules set by the U.N.  By working together with the U.N., countries can help make the world a safer and better place for everyone to live. It's just like how you and your friends can have more fun when you play games together and follow the rules.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Think deeply about why you want this job. What true statement can you make about why you think this is the right place for you to work, and why the company should hire you? Authenticity is key when it comes to helping your cover letter stand out from everyone else's. There's no need to get too personal or emotional, but a heartfelt line about why you're right for the job is appropriate. Saying something like \\"The chance to join your office would be a tremendous opportunity\\" isn't going to hurt your chances. What information from your cover letter most qualifies you for the job? The final paragraph is your last chance to proclaim how perfect your skills are for the company to which you're applying. Don't just repeat the same information, though. Be a bit more specific about the experience or qualifications that make you right for the role.  You might refer to the mission of the company. This is a good strategy because it demonstrates you understand what the company does and that you want to be a part of the organization. Referencing the company's outstanding reputation does not hurt your changes either. Some people also take a risk and add some flair to their cover letter ending. If you're going to crack a joke or use colorful language, you stand the chance of turning off the potential employer. But on the other hand, being funny might be just the ticket. No matter what, make sure your cover letter's ending matches the overall tone of your cover letter. The conclusion is your opportunity to repeat your excitement about the job and your ability to do the job well. For example, you might write: “I am very excited about the opportunity to make an immediate and valuable contribution to your company.” Remind the employer how your skillset will transfer to the company and be put to use. What will you bring to the company? Focus on how the company will improve by hiring you, rather than how you will benefit. For example, you might write: “My professional skills in marketing, coupled with my passion for your products, will enable me to help grow the business segment.” Your application may require that you send a resume, writing samples, or other materials with your cover letter. Mention that you are enclosing them in the envelope or attaching them to the email you're sending. \\"My resume is enclosed\\" or \\"I am enclosing my resume\\" are both fine ways of putting it. If you are including recommendation letters that will be sent separately by your references, you might write: “Recommendation letters from Dr. Patricia Smith and Dr. Joseph Johnson will arrive under separate cover.” Most applicants don’t explicitly state that they would like an interview for a job. But some experts think that you’re more likely to get an interview if you ask for one. For example, you can write: “Please call me at (your phone number) to schedule an interview at your earliest convenience.” Depending upon the contact information you have for the company, write that you will follow up next week with a phone call or email to ensure your application was received. Tell the employer that you can also answer any preliminary questions at that time. Include this kind of action that you'll be taking in order to demonstrate initiative. This will also help move your application forward.  For example, write: “I will follow up my application with a phone call next week.” It is very important that you follow through on the promise you make in your cover letter. If you say you’re going to follow up on your application, do so. It is also important to note if a company requests no phone call inquiries. If this is the case, email instead. Always thank the reader for her time and consideration. It shows that you are polite and respectful of her time, something of great value in a busy work environment.

Write the answer: \\"From which poem by Keats did F Scott Fitzgerald get the title of his 1934 book \\"\\"Tender is the Night\\"\\"?\\"","output":"John Keats, a prominent 19th-century Romantic poet, is the creator of the poem which inspired F. Scott Fitzgerald to entitle his 1934 book \\"Tender is the Night.\\" The poem from which Fitzgerald took the title is called \\"Ode to a Nightingale.\\" This particular poem is one of Keats' most esteemed and cherished works, leaving a lasting impact on the literary world and inspiring many writers, including Fitzgerald. \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" was penned in the spring of 1819. The poem is an extraordinary example of Keats' imaginative powers coupled with his skillful manipulation of language and verse. It explores themes such as the transcendent power of art, the passing of time, the fleeting nature of happiness, and the oscillation between the worlds of mortal suffering and immortal bliss. Keats composed this verse when he was going through a difficult period of his life, plagued by concerns about his health, his family, and depression. In this ode, the nightingale symbolizes the spirit of art and the timeless world of beauty that the poet longs to join. He is even willing to die, if doing so can unite him with that idealized realm. The poem consists of eight stanzas, each with ten lines, written in iambic pentameter. The title of Fitzgerald's novel is derived from the opening lines of the seventh stanza, which reads:     \\"Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!     No hungry generations tramp thee down;     The voice I hear this passing night was heard     In ancient days by emperor and clown:     Perhaps the self-same song that found a path     Through the sad heart of Ruth, when sick for home,     She stood in tears amid the alien corn;     The same that ofttimes hath     Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam     Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.\\" \\"Tender is the Night\\" is a notable novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald that delves into the decadent world of American and European socialites during the 1920s. In the story, the main characters, Dick and Nicole Diver, confront the collapse of their marriage, the illusions of their glamorous lifestyle, and the competing forces of materialism and love. The usage of Keats' phrase as the novel's title underscores the fragile and fleeting nature of the characters' hedonistic pursuits, as well as their search for meaning amidst ephemeral beauty and personal turmoil. Thus, \\"Tender is the Night\\" not only conveys the atmosphere and themes found throughout Fitzgerald's work but also bridges the connection between Keats' enduring poetry and Fitzgerald's exploration of disillusionment in the modern era. The title evokes the essence of both authors, demonstrating how art and literature transcend time and continue to influence and inspire generations of readers and writers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the photovoltaic cell process is the conversion of the generated electric current into usable power and its transfer to the external circuit for consumption or storage. Once sunlight has knocked the electrons loose in both the negative and positive layers, creating a flow of electrons, the photovoltaic cell will generate a direct current (DC). This DC current needs to be converted into an alternating current (AC) that can be used to power homes, appliances, or other electronic devices. To achieve this, an inverter is installed in the system, which converts the DC to AC, allowing the energy produced to be compatible with the electrical grid and common household appliances. The AC power can now be transmitted through the external circuit and utilized for various purposes, such as powering lights, TV, and other electronics. Moreover, any excess electricity not consumed immediately can be either stored in a battery system for later use, especially during periods of low sunlight or peak demand, or it can be fed back into the grid through a process called net metering. Net metering enables the owner of the photovoltaic system to receive credit or financial compensation for the surplus power generated and fed back into the grid. In conclusion, the last step in the process of a photovoltaic cell is the conversion of the generated electric current into a usable form and the distribution of the converted power through an external circuit to be used for various applications or stored for future usage.

I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.' Sam Winslow and I had grown up together about twenty miles outside Austin in a little town called Coupland. We'd fought a lot as kids, and there were still plenty of differences in our politics and educations. But being on the police and fire rescue squad had brought me closer to him again, and I was glad of it. A private detective needs all the friends he can get. 'What do you make of it?' I asked him. 'Accidental drowning, looks like.' I raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. 'He's got a bump on the head that could have come off a rock. We'll see what the coroner says.' 'Any idea who he is?' Winslow shook his head. He'd gained weight in his face recently and his jowls vibrated with the gesture. Question: What does Dan probably believe about the cause of death? Answer: Answer:","output":"That it wasn't an accidental drowning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Paragraph: Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century  Question: \\"Has Madame White Snake been perceived as both a villainous demon and someone who exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife?\\" Answer: \\"No, just ideal wife\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, this answer is not correct.

Today, we are going on a fantastic journey to discover the beautiful patterns all around us. Patterns are everywhere, and they make the world a more colorful and interesting place. So, grab your magnifying glass and let's start exploring! 1. Blotchy Patterns - The Splotchy Spots Have you ever seen a cow? Cows have spots called blotchy patterns. These patterns look like random shapes and sizes of patches or spots, just like the colors on a cow's coat. Blotchy patterns can also be found on animals like giraffes or even on the peeling bark of some trees. These patterns often help the animals blend in with their surroundings to hide from predators. They also make the world around us more fun and interesting to look at! 2. Wide Stripes - The Marvelous Markings Now, let's imagine a zebra running across the grasslands. What do you see? That's right, wide stripes! These are some of the boldest and coolest patterns in the world. Wide stripes can be found not only on zebras, but also on tigers and some types of fish. Did you know that each zebra's stripes are unique, just like our fingerprints? That's so amazing! You can even find wide stripes on clothes, bedsheets, or art designs. They give a strong and fun style to whatever they are on. 3. Swirling Lines - The Curvy Quest Have you ever looked at the sky when the clouds are all wavy and twisty? Those are swirling lines, and they are another fascinating pattern to explore. Swirling lines can also be found in the natural world when you look at the tops of mountains or even take a peek inside beautiful seashells. Sometimes, artists use swirling lines to create amazing paintings or designs. Just think of the beautiful abstract art or the marvelous marble designs on a fancy cake. Swirling lines add a touch of elegance and wonder to the world around us. 4. Check the Color - The Rainbow Riddle Finally, colors are an essential part of the patterns we can see in the world. Have you ever noticed how different colors can go together to make something even more beautiful, like the colors on a butterfly's wings? When exploring the world of patterns, you should always check the colors that make up the pattern. Are they bright and bold like the colors on a parrot, or soft and calming like a pastel rainbow? Colors can make a big difference and create many different feelings and styles in the patterns we see. So, little explorers, now that you know more about blotchy patterns, wide stripes, swirling lines, and checking the colors, are you ready to go on your own pattern quest? Remember to keep your eyes open, and you never know what amazing patterns you might discover next! Happy exploring!"},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction.

Sprinkle cedar shavings where they live. Use spice sachets in your kitchen cabinets. Use a citrus or lavender spray. Article:","output":"Title: Natural and Chemical Solutions to Combat Household Pests Introduction Household pests such as ants, cockroaches, and silverfish can be a nuisance and pose health risks to your family and loved ones. It's essential to protect your home from these pesky intruders. Both natural and chemical treatments can help combat and prevent infestations. In this article, we will explore the various options available, including diatomaceous earth, boric acid, liquid pyrethrin, cedar shavings, spice sachets, and citrus or lavender sprays. 1. Diatomaceous Earth Diatomaceous earth is a natural, non-toxic powder made from fossilized diatoms - small, hard-shelled algae. Its abrasive texture makes it an effective pest control solution. Step-by-step use: - Sprinkle diatomaceous earth in cabinets and other dark areas where pests are likely to hide or breed. - The powder will cause the exoskeletons of insects to dehydrate, eventually killing them. - Regularly check and reapply the powder to maintain its effectiveness. 2. Boric Acid Boric acid is another natural, effective option for pest control. It acts as a stomach poison for insects, making it a lethal bait that they will ingest and carry back to their colonies. Step-by-step use: - Mix boric acid with sugar or other attractive substances for pests. - Place the mixture in small containers or shallow dishes near the infested areas. - Monitor the bait, replacing it as needed to maintain effectiveness. 3. Liquid Pyrethrin Chemical Spray Liquid pyrethrin is a chemical compound derived from chrysanthemum flowers. It targets the insects' nervous systems, providing a potent, fast-acting solution. Step-by-step use: - Purchase a chemical spray containing liquid pyrethrin at your local store. - Follow the instructions on the label, applying the spray directly to the infested areas. - Take precautions while using this chemical, as it can be harmful to humans and pets if ingested or exposed to skin for an extended period. 4. Cedar Shavings Cedar shavings are natural insect repellents due to their aroma. Many pests, especially moths and silverfish, dislike the smell of cedar. Step-by-step use: - Scatter cedar shavings around the areas where pests live and breed. - Replace the shavings periodically to keep the scent potent and effective. 5. Spice Sachets Spice sachets are small bags containing aromatic herbs and spices with pest-repelling properties. Common ingredients include cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaves. Step-by-step use: - Place spice sachets in your kitchen cabinets, pantry, or other storage areas for a natural, aromatic defense against pests. - Replace the sachets as needed when the aroma begins to fade. 6. Citrus or Lavender Spray Citrus and lavender essential oils have natural pest-repelling properties. Insects such as ants and spiders find these scents repulsive. Step-by-step use: - Mix a few drops of citrus or lavender essential oil with water in a spray bottle. - Lightly spritz surfaces and areas prone to infestations. - Reapply as needed to maintain the potency of the scent. Conclusion A combination of these natural and chemical treatments can help you effectively combat household pests and prevent future infestations. By integrating these solutions into your routine, you can maintain a clean and healthy living environment for your family."},{"instruction":"Instructions: Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

Help as much as you can. Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

Movie plot title: Stalingrad Movie plot: The film opens in Japan in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. As emergency personnel work to reach some victims trapped underground, one rescuer tries to keep the victims calm by telling the story of how he came to have five fathers, all killed during the Great Patriotic War (World War II). The trapped victims are young German students and the rescuers are Russian. In 1942, after the initial attack on Stalingrad, a small group of Russian soldiers take cover in a large five story residential building that happens to provide cover for a Russian crossing point on the Volga river. Five of these soldiers become the five fathers in the story: Polyakov (\\"Angel\\") who had become embittered when his wife and daughter were killed in an air raid; Chvanov, whose hatred of the Germans comes from their cruel treatment and methodical murder of his family; Nikiforov, a talented tenor singer before the war, who had become a cruel and vicious fighter; Sergey, drafted into the war as a spotter; and Captain Gromov, a veteran and hero who leads the group after finding them. The soldiers encounter a young girl named Katya, living alone in the building after her family had been killed. As they spend the next few days together, the soldiers grow fond of her, and she of them. Germans encamped near the crossing are led by Hauptmann Kahn; a highly decorated, but disillusioned soldier who falls in love with a Russian woman named Masha, who resembles his late wife. She at first detests him, but soon begins to reciprocate his love, although they cannot speak each other's language. Oberstleutnant Henze arrives to take command of the Germans. He chides Kahn both for his attraction to Masha, as well as his failure to eradicate the Russian soldiers. Henze decides to set an example by rounding up the Russian civilians living in the bombed out buildings, then burning a woman and her daughter alive. This enrages the Russian soldiers who ambush the Germans, killing several, but losing several of their own men in the process. The Germans... Answer:","output":"In the movie plot of \\"Stalingrad\\", it is primarily the group of five Russian soldiers - Polyakov, Chvanov, Nikiforov, Sergey, and Captain Gromov - who try to save the trapped young German girls. The Russian soldiers find themselves in a large residential building and encounter a young girl named Katya, whose family had been killed. As they spend time together, the soldiers become protective of her and form a bond, considering her as their collective daughter. While the movie does not specifically mention them saving other German girls, their actions throughout the movie manifest their intentions to protect the innocent and fight against the cruelty of the Germans led by Hauptmann Kahn and Oberstleutnant Henze."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Bees gather nectar from flowers - The bees evaporate the nectar by passing it back and forth to each other - The evaporation turns the nectar into sugary honey - The bees chew the honey until it turns into moldable wax - The bees mold the wax into hexagonal (six sided) cylinders - Thousands of these hexagonal cylinders put together form the hive - A:","output":"A: The missing first step is: \\"Worker bees secrete enzymes to process the nectar they collect.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"al-qaida says france must negotiate with bin laden\\" Text:","output":"Title: Al-Qaida's Message to France: Negotiations with Bin Laden? In a recent statement, Al-Qaida's leadership has directed a chilling message to the French government, urging them to engage in negotiations with the notorious figurehead of global terrorism, Osama Bin Laden. These shocking developments come amidst the backdrop of increasing threats against Western nations and heightened tensions in the Middle East. The call for negotiations with the architect of the September 11 attacks has inevitably sent ripples of unease and fear across the international community. For many, it raises questions about the potential implications of initiating dialogue with the man who has been responsible for acts of terror worldwide. Can entertaining the idea of negotiations with such a figure truly lead to any semblance of peace, or would it merely embolden Al-Qaida and its affiliates?  Nevertheless, the French government finds itself in a difficult position. France has faced a series of terrorist attacks in recent years, most notably the November 2015 attacks in Paris that shook the nation to its core. In this context, the prospect of negotiating with Bin Laden might appear as an opportunity to restore a sense of security and stability to the country. However, it may also signify a dangerous precedent for other countries in dealings with terrorist organizations. The message from Al-Qaida comes at a time when the international community's patience is wearing thin. With an increase in acts of terror globally, governments are being forced to take stronger stances on security and military intervention. While it is ultimately up to France to decide how it wishes to proceed, engaging in negotiations with Bin Laden could potentially indicate a willingness to compromise in matters where most have drawn the line. It is crucial to consider the efficacy of these proposed negotiations carefully. Ceding ground to terrorists through dialogue would perhaps generate more instability than stability, as other extremist groups might interpret this as a sign of weakness and a green light for further terrorist activities. To entertain the possibility of extinguishing the fires of terrorism through diplomatic means may be shortsighted and fraught with danger. By contrast, opting for a more aggressive approach, including military intervention and strategic counter-terrorism measures, may yield greater results – though at the cost of collateral damage and civilian casualties. It is a difficult balance to strike. However, the French government must weigh the long-term impact of its negotiating stance on both the national security and the global fight against terrorism. In conclusion, Al-Qaida's message to France to negotiate with Osama Bin Laden presents a complex predicament that demands a thoughtful and measured response. While diplomacy should never be ruled out, engaging with the likes of Bin Laden could prove detrimental to upholding the tenets of justice and security in the global context. In such uncertain times, governments worldwide must reflect on the implications of their actions and strive to maintain a united front against those who seek to threaten the tenuous peace and terrorize innocent lives."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Speed it up please\\" Answer:","output":"★☆☆☆☆"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: As soon as you meet, or even see, a person, you form an impression of him based on his posture, gesture and facial expressions. This is why it is important to make a good first impression on the person who will be interviewing you. Within the first 60 seconds of meeting you, the interviewer will have formed an impression about what type of person you are and what kind of employee you would become, and 55% of this will be based only on your body language. Here are some tips to make you that impression a good one. First of all, relax. Think positive thoughts and you are more likely to come across as a positive, confident person during the interview. Dress smartly, as your appearance is one of the first things an interviewer will notice you. Stand up straight, and walk in with your shoulders back and your head up. Try to avoid slowing down as you walk into the room because this suggests fear and uncertainty. Shake hands with the interviewer firmly. You should have a positive handshake and a warm smile. Open your coat or jacket as you sit down shows that you, too, are open. Posture is important. You should be sitting well back in your seat. Sit up straight and lean forward slightly, but not too much. Sitting at too much of an angel expresses discomfort and distrust. Two of the most common   signals are crossing your arms and legs, so try to avoid them. Another important issue is eye contact. Looking someone in the eye shows confidence in yourself and trust in the other person. However, don't overdo it, as too much eye contact or starring will make the other person uncomfortable. Use more eye contact when listening than when talking, and when you look away, look down. Looking up at the ceiling will make you seem bored and rude.

Write some highlights for the following article: Honduras suspended diplomatic relations with Argentina on Tuesday in retaliation for having its ambassador expelled from Argentina last week. Riot police stand in front of marchers supporting ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on Tuesday. The move stems from tensions between the two countries over a June 28 military-led coup in which Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya was replaced by congressional leader Roberto Micheletti. When Honduran Ambassador Carmen Eleonora Ortez Williams, who had been appointed by Zelaya, did not protest the coup, Argentina took exception. Most countries in the world -- as well as the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the European Union -- have denounced the coup and demanded that Zelaya be restored to power. Those nations still consider Zelaya president and do not recognize any officials from Micheletti's government or any functionaries who support him. Argentina asked Ortez to leave last week \\"for supporting the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti.\\" On Tuesday, Honduras suspended relations with Argentina and asked the South American nation's diplomats to leave within 72 hours. Honduras' relations with Argentina will be \\"channeled\\" though the Argentine embassy in Israel, said a release issued in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. \\"With regards to Argentine personnel stationed in Tegucigalpa and who are finishing their functions in Honduras, they will be granted, based on the principle of strictest reciprocity, the same treatment, time and facilities that was conceded to Honduran functionaries accredited in Argentina,\\" the Honduran release said. The Honduran political crisis stems from Zelaya's desire to hold a referendum that could have led to extending term limits by changing the constitution, despite the country's congress having outlawed the vote and the supreme court having ruled it illegal. Zelaya vowed to hold the vote anyway but was ousted before the voting started. The congress named Micheletti provisional president shortly after Zelaya was detained by the military and sent into exile. Micheletti said Zelaya was not overthrown in a coup, but rather removed from power through constitutional means.","output":"Honduras suspended its diplomatic relations with Argentina on Tuesday following Argentina's expulsion of its ambassador, Carmen Eleonora Ortez Williams, last week.

The small intestine is where the majority of nutrient digestion and absorption takes place. As the broken-down nutrients enter the bloodstream, blood sugar levels rise, particularly after a meal. This increase in blood sugar levels triggers the endocrine function of the pancreas. The endocrine pancreas consists of cell clusters called islets of Langerhans, which contain specialized beta cells. In response to the rising blood sugar levels, these beta cells secrete a hormone called insulin. Insulin plays an essential role in regulating blood sugar by promoting the uptake and storage of glucose, the body's primary source of energy. The final step of the process involves insulin's actions on various target tissues and organs, such as the liver, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissue (fat). In the liver and muscles, insulin stimulates the conversion of glucose into glycogen, a storage form of glucose. The liver can store a considerable amount of glycogen that can be later converted back into glucose when the body needs energy during periods of fasting or exercise. In adipose tissue, insulin is involved in inhibiting the breakdown of stored fat and promoting the storage of glucose as fat.  As insulin acts on these target tissues, blood glucose levels are maintained within a narrow range, ensuring that the body has a steady supply of energy without excessive amounts of glucose in the bloodstream. Over time, when blood glucose levels decrease, the secretion of insulin also decreases, as it is no longer needed to promote glucose uptake. In this way, the final step of the process is initiated by the release of insulin and is characterized by the maintenance of blood glucose levels through the actions of insulin on target tissues, thereby ensuring balanced energy homeostasis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: WASHINGTON (AP) — A string of security lapses resulted in a four-day delay before the U.S. Secret Service realized that a man had fired a high-powered rifle at the White House in 2011, an incident that could have put President Barack Obama's daughters at risk, according to a Washington Post investigation.      At issue is what the Post calls the Secret Service's bungled response to the case of Oscar R. Ortega-Hernandez, an Idaho man who was sentenced to 25 years in prison after firing at least seven bullets at the White House on November 11, 2011. The president and Michelle Obama were away, but their daughters were in Washington — one at home and the other due to return that night.      A White House usher expressed concerns about the safety of Malia Obama, who was to arrive within minutes of the reports of the shots, The Post reported. The usher told the staff to keep Sasha Obama and her grandmother, Marian Robinson, inside.      The reports of shots fired that night were not connected to the White House until four days later when a White House housekeeper noticed broken glass and a chunk of cement on the floor inside. Ortega, who fled the scene, was arrested the day after that.      The Post story alleges that some Secret Service officers knew immediately that shots had been fired into the White House, but that they were \\"largely ignored, and some were afraid to dispute their bosses' conclusions\\" that the shooting was not directed at the White House. The service conducted only a cursory inspection of the White House for evidence or damage, the Post said, and key witnesses were not interviewed until after bullets were found.      The suspect was able to park his car on a public street, take several shots and then speed off without being detected, the Post noted, calling it \\"sheer luck\\" that Ortega was identified as the shooter, mainly because the troubled and jobless 21-year-old wrecked his car seven blocks away and left his gun inside.      The Post based its story on interviews with agents, investigators and other government officials and hundreds of pages of documents, including transcripts of interviews with officers on duty that night and audio recordings of radio transmissions.      In a statement to the Associated Press, the Secret Service said it \\"implemented both personnel and structural enhancements\\" following a review of the incident, \\"and other physical and technical enhancements, including additional surveillance cameras.\\"      A Secret Service official, who requested anonymity for lack of authorization to comment for attribution, said the delay in understanding what happened that night was not the result of misconduct or incompetence, but \\"an uncertain situation\\" that included echoing shots from a quarter mile away and confused initial witness reports.      \\"I'm not saying this was our shining moment, but we never stopped looking for this guy,\\" the official said. ||||| Law enforcement officers photograph a window at the White House in this Nov. 16, 2011, file photo. A bullet shot at the house hit an exterior window of the White House and was stopped by ballistic glass, the Secret Service said at the time. (Haraz N. Ghanbari/AP)      The gunman parked his black Honda directly south of the White House, in the dark of a November night, in a closed lane of Constitution Avenue. He pointed his semiautomatic rifle out of the passenger window, aimed directly at the home of the president of the United States, and pulled the trigger.      A bullet smashed a window on the second floor, just steps from the first family’s formal living room. Another lodged in a window frame, and more pinged off the roof, sending bits of wood and concrete to the ground. At least seven bullets struck the upstairs residence of the White House, flying some 700 yards across the South Lawn.      President Obama and his wife were out of town on that evening of Nov. 11, 2011, but their younger daughter, Sasha, and Michelle Obama’s mother, Marian Robinson, were inside, while older daughter Malia was expected back any moment from an outing with friends.      Secret Service officers initially rushed to respond. One, stationed directly under the second-floor terrace where the bullets struck, drew her .357 handgun and prepared to crack open an emergency gun box. Snipers on the roof, standing just 20 feet from where one bullet struck, scanned the South Lawn through their rifle scopes for signs of an attack. With little camera surveillance on the White House perimeter, it was up to the Secret Service officers on duty to figure out what was going on.      Then came an order that surprised some of the officers. “No shots have been fired. . . . Stand down,” a supervisor called over his radio. He said the noise was the backfire from a nearby construction vehicle.      That command was the first of a string of security lapses, never previously reported, as the Secret Service failed to identify and properly investigate a serious attack on the White House. While the shooting and eventual arrest of the gunman, Oscar R. Ortega-Hernandez, received attention at the time, neither the bungled internal response nor the potential danger to the Obama daughters has been publicly known. This is the first full account of the Secret Service’s confusion and the missed clues in the incident — and the anger the president and first lady expressed as a result.      By the end of that Friday night, the agency had confirmed a shooting had occurred but wrongly insisted the gunfire was never aimed at the White House. Instead, Secret Service supervisors theorized, gang members in separate cars got in a gunfight near the White House’s front lawn — an unlikely scenario in a relatively quiet, touristy part of the nation’s capital.      It took the Secret Service four days to realize that shots had hit the White House residence, a discovery that came about only because a housekeeper noticed broken glass and a chunk of cement on the floor.      This report is based on interviews with agents, investigators and other government officials with knowledge about the shooting. The Washington Post also reviewed hundreds of pages of documents, including transcripts of interviews with officers on duty that night, and listened to audio recordings of in-the-moment law enforcement radio transmissions.      Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan declined to comment. A spokesman for the White House also declined to comment.      The episode exposed problems at multiple levels of the Secret Service, and it demonstrates that an organization long seen by Americans as an elite force of selfless and highly skilled patriots — willing to take a bullet for the good of the country — is not always up to its job.      Just this month, a man carrying a knife was able to jump the White House fence and sprint into the front door. The agency was also embarrassed by a 2012 prostitution scandal in Cartagena, Colombia, that revealed what some called a wheels-up, rings-off culture in which some agents treated presidential trips as an opportunity to party.      1 of 15 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Secret Service took four days before realizing shooting had occurred View Photos On the evening of Nov. 11, 2011, at least seven bullets struck the upstairs residence of the White House.

It would be days before Ortega was connected to the gunshots fired at the White House. U.S. Attorney’s Office for D.C. via Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.      The actions of the Secret Service in the minutes, hours and days that followed the 2011 shooting were particularly problematic. Officers who were on the scene who thought gunfire had probably hit the house that night were largely ignored, and some were afraid to dispute their bosses’ conclusions. Nobody conducted more than a cursory inspection of the White House for evidence or damage. Key witnesses were not interviewed until after bullets were found.      Moreover, the suspect was able to park his car on a public street, take several shots and then speed off without being detected. It was sheer luck that the shooter was identified, the result of Ortega, a troubled and jobless 21-year-old, wrecking his car seven blocks away and leaving his gun inside.      The response infuriated the president and the first lady, according to people with direct knowledge of their reaction. Michelle Obama has spoken publicly about fearing for her family’s safety since her husband became the nation’s first black president.      Her concerns are well founded — President Obama has faced three times as many threats as his predecessors, according to people briefed on the Secret Service’s threat assessment.      “It was obviously very frightening that someone who didn’t really plan it that well was able to shoot and hit the White House and people here did not know it until several days later,” said William Daley, who was White House chief of staff at the time.      Daley said he recalls the late discovery of the bullets shaking up the Obamas and their staffs. The Secret Service could not have prevented the shooting, Daley said, but it should have determined more quickly what happened.      “The handling of this was not good,” he said.      Confusion after shots      By the time Ortega shot at the White House, President Obama and the first lady were in San Diego on their way to Hawaii for the Veterans Day weekend.      With the first couple gone, the Secret Service staff at the White House slipped into what some termed a “casual Friday” mode.      By 8:30 p.m., most of the Secret Service agents and officers on duty were coming to the tail end of a quiet shift.      An undercover agent in charge of monitoring the White House perimeter for suspicious activity, McClellan Plihcik, had left with a more junior officer to fill up his service car at a gas station about a mile away.      On the White House’s southern border, a few construction workers were milling about. D.C. Water trucks, arriving on Constitution Avenue to clean sewer lines, had just parked in the lane closed off by red cones on the White House side of the street.      It was near that spot that Ortega pulled over his black 1998 Honda Accord.      Ortega had left his Idaho home about three weeks earlier, during a time his friends said he had been acting increasingly paranoid. He kept launching into tirades about the U.S. government trying to control its citizens, saying President Obama “had to be stopped.”      He had arrived in Washington on Nov. 9. He had 180 rounds of ammunition and a Romanian-made Cugir semiautomatic rifle, similar to an AK-47, that he had purchased at an Idaho gun shop.      Now, in striking distance of the president’s home, Ortega raised his weapon.      A woman in a taxi stopped at a nearby stoplight immediately took to Twitter to describe the actions of “this crazy guy.”      “Driver in front of my cab, STOPPED and fired 5 gun shots at the White House,” she wrote, adding, “It took the police a while to respond.”      Another witness — a visiting neuroscientist who was riding by in an airport shuttle van — later told investigators he had seen a man shooting out of a car toward the White House.      On the rooftop of the White House, Officers Todd Amman and Jeff Lourinia heard six to eight shots in quick succession, likely semiautomatic fire, they thought. They scurried out of their shedlike booth, readied their rifles and scanned the southern fence line.      Under the Truman Balcony, the second-floor terrace off the residence that overlooks the Washington Monument, Secret Service Officer Carrie Johnson heard shots and what she thought was debris falling overhead. She drew her handgun and took cover, then heard a radio call reporting “possible shots fired” near the south grounds.      Johnson called the Secret ­Service’s joint operations center, at the agency’s headquarters on H Street Northwest, to report she was breaking into the gun box near her post, pulling out a shotgun. She replaced the buckshot inside with a more powerful slug in case she needed to engage an attacker.      The shots were fired about 15 yards away from Officers William Johnson and Milton Olivo, who were sitting in a Chevrolet Suburban on the Ellipse near Constitution Avenue.      They could smell acrid gunpowder as they jumped out of their vehicle, hearts pounding. Johnson took cover behind some flowerpots. Olivo grabbed a shotgun from the Suburban’s back seat and crouched by the vehicle.      William Johnson noticed a curious clue as he crouched in the crisp autumn air — leaves had been blown away in a line-like pattern, perhaps by air from a firearm muzzle. It created a path of exposed grass pointing from Constitution Avenue north toward the White House.      Then another call came over the radio from a supervising sergeant — the one ordering agents to stand down.      The call led to some confusion and surprise, especially for officers who felt sure they had heard shots. Nevertheless, many complied, holstering their guns and turning back to their posts.      But William Johnson knew shots were fired and got on his radio to say so. “Flagship,” he said, using the code name for the command center, “shots fired.”      Ortega, meanwhile, was driving away “like a maniac,” the woman in the cab wrote on Twitter.      He was speeding down Constitution Avenue toward the Potomac River at about 60 mph, according to witnesses.      Ortega narrowly missed striking a couple crossing the street before he swerved and crashed his car.      Three women walking nearby heard the crash, and one called 911 on a cellphone. As they walked closer to the scene, the women saw the Honda spun around, headlights glaring at oncoming traffic, half on the on-ramp to the Roosevelt Bridge carrying Interstate 66 into Virginia. The driver’s-side door was flung open. The radio was blaring. The driver was gone.      At the same time, Park Police and Secret Service patrol cars were beginning to swarm the bridge area. Nestled in the driver console was a semiautomatic assault rifle, with nine shell casings on the floor and seat.      Plihcik, the special agent who had been gassing up his patrol car, was among those arriving on the scene. A homeless man told him he had seen a young white male running from the vehicle after the crash and heading toward the Georgetown area.      Amid conflicting radio chatter, including a Secret Service dispatcher calling into 911 with contradictory descriptions of vehicles and suspects, police began looking for the wrong people: two black men supposedly fleeing down Rock Creek Parkway.      The man who had shot at the White House had disappeared on foot into the Washington night, with the Secret Service still trying to piece together what he had done.      Fear for girls’ safety      Back in the White House, key people in charge of the safety of the president’s family were not initially aware that a shooting had occurred.      Because officers guarding the White House grounds communicate on a different radio frequency from the one used by agents who protect the first family, the agent assigned to Sasha learned of the shooting a few minutes later from an officer posted nearby.      The White House usher on duty, whose job is tending to the first family’s needs, got delayed word as well. She immediately began to worry about Malia, who was supposed to be arriving any minute. The usher told the staff to keep Sasha and her grandmother inside. Malia arrived with her detail at 9:40 p.m., and all doors were locked for the night.      The Secret Service’s watch commander on duty, Capt. David Simmons, had been listening to the confusing radio chatter since the first reports of possible shots.      When word came of the wrecked Honda, Simmons left the command center and drove to the scene at the foot of the Roosevelt Bridge.      It was up to Simmons to decide whether the events of that night appeared to be an attack on the White House. After consulting with investigators and calling his bosses at home to confer, he turned the case over to the U.S. Park Police, the agency with jurisdiction over the grounds near the White House.      In effect, the Secret Service had concluded there was no evidence linking the shooting to the White House.      U.S. Park Police spokesman David Schlosser told reporters at the time that the connection was a big coincidence. “The thing that makes it of interest is simply the location, you know, a bit like real estate,” he said.      At the time of the shooting, President Obama had been sitting courtside on the USS Carl Vinson warship in the California’s Coronado Bay, watching the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University basketball teams play on the flight deck. He was getting ready to be interviewed by ESPN at 9 p.m.      Forty-five minutes later, the president and Michelle Obama climbed aboard Air Force One, bound for a trade summit in Hono­lulu, unaware that a man had taken several shots at their living quarters.      Housekeeper’s discovery      The next day, things seemed to have settled down at the White House.      Officer Carrie Johnson, who had heard debris fall from the Truman Balcony the night before, listened during the roll call before her shift Saturday afternoon as supervisors explained that the gunshots were from people in two cars shooting at each other.      Johnson had told several senior officers Friday night that she thought the house had been hit. But on Saturday she did not challenge her superiors, “for fear of being criticized,” she later told investigators.      Though the Park Police was now in charge of the investigation, Secret Service agents continued to assist, using social media and other sources to locate witnesses, such as the tweeting taxi passenger, and people who knew Ortega.      Investigators did not issue a national lookout to notify law enforcement that Ortega was wanted. If they had, Ortega could have been arrested that Saturday in Arlington County, Va., where police responded to a call about a man behaving oddly in a local park. They questioned Ortega but had no idea he was a suspect in a shooting, and they let him go.      The Park Police did not obtain a warrant for Ortega on weapons charges until that Sunday. A Park Police spokeswoman, reached this Friday, declined to comment, saying the agency needed more time to review the episode.      Meanwhile, Secret Service agents, who had been learning from Ortega’s friends and family that he was obsessed with President Obama, began canvassing the D.C. area to locate him.      The situation at the White House remained quiet until Tuesday morning. President Obama was continuing from Hawaii to Australia. But the first lady had returned to Washington on an overnight flight. She had gone upstairs to take a nap shortly after arriving home early that morning.      Flying back on her plane was Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan. At that time, his agents were learning that Ortega, still at large, appeared to be obsessed with the president. The episode had not yet risen to the level of a confirmed threat that the Secret Service would share with the first couple, according to people familiar with agency practice.      Reginald Dickson, an assistant White House usher, had come to work early to prepare the house for the first lady.      Around noon, a housekeeper asked Dickson to come to the Truman Balcony, where she showed him the broken window and a chunk of white concrete on the floor.      Dickson saw the bullet hole and cracks in the antique glass of a center window, with the intact bulletproof glass on the inside. Dickson spotted a dent in another window sill that turned out to be a bullet lodged in the wood.      Dickson called the Secret Service agent in charge of the complex.      Suddenly, Ortega was no longer just a man who had abandoned a car with a rifle inside. He was now a suspect in an assassination attempt on the president of the United States — and he was about to become the target of a national manhunt.      Daley, the White House chief of staff, was alerted by aides about the discovery on the second floor of the residence.      The first lady was still napping, and Daley and his aides knew it was their job to tell her. They debated whether they should wake her up and give her the news.      They decided, according to people familiar with the discussions, to let her sleep. Instead, they concluded, they would brief the president and let him tell his wife.      But someone else told her first.      First lady furious      Dickson, the usher, went upstairs to the third floor to see how Michelle Obama was doing.      He assumed she knew about the bullets and began describing the discovery.      But she was aghast — and then quickly furious. She wondered why Sullivan had not mentioned anything about it during their long flight back together from Hawaii, according to people familiar with the first lady’s reaction.      That afternoon, Secret Service investigators for the first time began interviewing officers and agents who had been on the grounds the previous Friday night.      Authorities put out an all-points bulletin for Ortega and circulated his picture. Local police officers up and down the Eastern Seaboard were tasked with checking train and bus stations.      A team of FBI agents met early that evening to plan for taking over the investigation and securing the crime scene at the White House.      At 7:45 a.m. the next day, FBI agents arrived at the White House complex.      They interviewed some of the Secret Service officers who were on duty that Friday night and scoured the Truman Balcony and nearby grounds for casings, bullet fragments and other evidence.      The agents that day found 97,000 worth of damage.      At that same time, state troopers were headed to a Hampton Inn in Indiana, Pa. A desk clerk, on alert after Secret Service agents found out Ortega had stayed there and circulated his picture, called police after recognizing the man with a distinctive tattoo on his neck. They arrested Ortega and kept him chained at his feet and hands in a holding cell until FBI agents could arrive to question him.      Back at the White House, Michelle Obama was worried about how the scene of agents on the family balcony might upset her daughters. She relayed a special request that the FBI team finish their work on the balcony by 2:35 p.m., before Sasha and Malia came home from school.      The first lady was still upset when her husband arrived home five days later from Australia. The president was fuming, too, former aides said. Not only had their aides failed to immediately alert the first lady, but the Secret Service had stumbled in its response.      “When the president came back . . . then the s--- really hit the fan,” said one former aide.      Tensions were high when Sullivan was called to the White House for a meeting about the incident. Michelle Obama addressed him in such a sharp and raised voice that she could be heard through a closed door, according to people familiar with the exchange. Among her many questions: How did they miss bullets from an assault rifle lodged in the walls of her home?      Sullivan disputed this account of the meeting but declined to characterize the encounter, saying he does not discuss conversations with the first lady.      Problems exposed      Ortega was eventually charged with attempted assassination. His attorneys insisted he had no idea what he was doing. He pleaded guilty to slightly lesser charges and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.      The next year, the Colombia prostitution scandal rocked the agency’s reputation. Sullivan retired from the agency in 2013 to start a private security firm. President Obama named the first woman to head the service, Julia Pierson, with hopes she could help end Cartagena-like embarrassments.      Yet, on Capitol Hill and among many former Secret Service officials, the 2011 shooting was a sign of far deeper troubles. For them, no duty is more sacred than protecting the life of the president and his family, and on this night a man nearly got away with shooting into his house. In this case, they fear, a more powerful weapon might have pierced the residence, or the Obama daughters could have been on the balcony.      “This is symptomatic of an organization that is not moving in the right direction,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz (Utah), a leading Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said in an interview. The committee, which oversees the Secret Service, has invited the director to testify at a Tuesday hearing on security issues.      A subsequent internal security review found that the incident illustrated serious gaps.      The Secret Service, for instance, could not use any of the dozens of ShotSpotter sensors installed across the city to help police pinpoint and trace gunshots. The closest sensor was more than a mile away, too far to track Ortega’s shots.      Sullivan acknowledged in closed congressional briefings that the agency lacked basic camera surveillance that could have helped agents see the attack and swarm the gunman immediately.      Some of the technology issues have since been addressed, according to officials. The agency added a series of surveillance cameras in 2012, giving authorities a full view of the perimeter.      Alice Crites and Julie Tate contributed to this report. ||||| “The men and women of the Secret Service put their lives on the line for the president of the United States, his family and folks working in the White House every single day, 24 hours a day,” deputy national security advisor Tony Blinken said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “Their task is incredible and the burden that they bear is incredible.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A Washington Post investigation has revealed a four-day delay before the U.S. Secret Service realized that a man had fired a high-powered rifle at the White House in 2011, causing potential danger to President Barack Obama's daughters.

The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Telmatosaurus (meaning \\"marsh lizard\\") is a genus of basal hadrosaurid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It was a relatively small hadrosaur, approximately five meters (16 ft) long, found in what is now Romania.   - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.  - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU.  - The Late Cretaceous (100.566 Ma) is the younger of two epochs into which the Cretaceous period is divided in the geologic timescale. Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous series. The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time.  - The tibia (plural tibiae or tibias), also known as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula), and it connects the knee with the ankle bones. The tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to the fibula, and closer to the median plane or centre-line. The tibia is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of the leg, forming a type of fibrous joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the flute \\"tibia\\". It is the second largest bone in the human body next to the femur. The leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support the rest of the body.  - The femur (pl. \\"femurs\\" or \\"femora\\" ) or thigh bone, is the most proximal (closest to the hip joint) bone of the [leg] in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs. In vertebrates with four legs such as dogs and horses, the femur is found only in the hindlimbs. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee joint. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The femur is also the longest bone in the body.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Orthomerus ( meaning \`\` straight femur '' ) is a genus of duckbill dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of The Netherlands and Belgium . It is today an obscure genus , but in the past was conflated with the much better known Telmatosaurus .  - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.  - A hindlimb is a posterior limb on an animal, especially the quadrupeds. When referring to quadrupeds, the term hind leg is often instead used.  - In humans, the thigh is the area between the pelvis and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - Hadrosaurids (\\"hadrós\\", \\"stout, thick\\"), or duck-billed dinosaurs, are members of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae. This group is also known as the duck-billed dinosaurs, for the flat, duck-bill appearance of their mouths. The family, which includes ornithopods such as \\"Edmontosaurus\\" and \\"Parasaurolophus\\", was a common herbivore in the Upper Cretaceous Period of what is now Asia, Europe, Antarctica, South America and North America. Hadrosaurids are descendants of the Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous iguanodontian dinosaurs and had a similar body layout. Like the rest of the ornithischians, these animals had a predentary bone and a pubic bone which was positioned backwards in the pelvis. Hadrosaurids are divided into two principal subfamilies: the lambeosaurines (\\"Lambeosaurinae\\"), which had hollow cranial crests or tubes, and the saurolophines, identified as hadrosaurines in most pre-2010 works (\\"Saurolophinae\\" or\\" Hadrosaurinae\\"), which lacked hollow cranial crests (solid crests were present in some forms). Saurolophines tended to be bulkier than lambeosaurines. Lambeosaurines are divided into Aralosaurines, Lambeosaurines, Parasaurolophines and Tsintaosaurines, while Saurolophines include Saurolophus, Brachylophosaurines and Kritosaurines.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - The TriassicJurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, , and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. In the seas, a whole class (conodonts) and 34% of marine genera disappeared. On land, all pseudosuchians (non-ornithodiran archosaurs) other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct.  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park.  - The knee joint joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two articulations: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint). It is the largest joint in the human body. The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation. The knee joint is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis.    What is the relationship between 'orthomerus' and 'hadrosaur'? A:","output":"Orthomerus is a genus of duckbill dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous period, which was once conflated with the much better-known genus Telmatosaurus. Hadrosaurids, or duck-billed dinosaurs, are members of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae, which includes various genera of herbivorous dinosaur species. Therefore, the relationship between Orthomerus and hadrosaurs is that Orthomerus is a genus within the Hadrosauridae family, and thus a type of hadrosaur."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: Best Video Ever Product review: What else is there to say, except please re-release this video.

A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm.

Movie title: Friday Night Lights Movie plot: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury. His obsession with fame and recognition also comes at a high price that he is at first not ready to pay. Safety Brian Chavez is harassed...

If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies. Can we infer the following? New employment opportunities can arise out of a problem like pollution.","output":"Yes, we can infer that new employment opportunities can arise out of a problem like pollution. The statement provided emphasizes the potential to create millions of new jobs by taking a leadership role in addressing the issue of pollution and investing in the development of innovative technologies and products. In this particular example, the focus is on the automotive industry, specifically the manufacturing of new, environmentally friendly cars and trucks. As the level of pollution increases significantly, global demand for cleaner, more sustainable transportation solutions is growing. This presents an opportunity for industries to innovate and invest in new technologies to address the environmental challenges associated with their products while contributing to economic growth through the creation of new jobs. For instance, the development and production of electric vehicles (EVs) could lead to a substantial increase in employment opportunities. This could include jobs in research and development, design, engineering, manufacturing, and maintenance of EVs, as well as the development of related infrastructure, such as charging stations and power grids. Furthermore, as the market for sustainable transportation expands, there will be additional job opportunities in sales, marketing, and customer service. Similarly, advancements in renewable energy, pollution control, waste management, recycling, and green building technologies could lead to the creation of numerous new jobs. By addressing problems like pollution, industries can play a role in not only mitigating environmental issues but also stimulating economic growth and employment opportunities. Moreover, taking the leadership role in these new markets can result in a competitive advantage for the companies and countries that pioneer these innovations. By being the first to develop and market sustainable solutions, these companies can establish themselves as industry leaders, potentially setting global standards and enjoying higher profits. In conclusion, it can be inferred that new employment opportunities can indeed arise out of a problem like pollution. By tackling the issue through innovation, industries can simultaneously create jobs and contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable world. Engaging in the development of environmentally friendly technologies and products is not only beneficial for the planet but also serves as a potential driver for economic growth and job creation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The news will dismay Spurs fans, who must trek 50 miles to the land of concrete cows not just for a single campaign but for two seasons — maybe more. The nightmare scenario has been forced on Spurs because their stadium design won’t allow for the project to be built in phases. Tottenham could spend more than two years using MK Dons' home ground as their base. The north London club has to leave White Hart Lane while their stadium is built at the same site. Club officials recently admitted they would have to move out for a season when they receive the go-ahead to start building. However, the prospect of long-term displacement raises concerns Spurs could be forced to play in front of low crowds for a damaging period. Stadium:mk holds a little over 30,000 supporters.

CCTV reported in January that the food Chinese people waste every year is enough to feed 200 million people for a year. It's a tradition that Chinese people offer lots of food when they invite others to dinner. Many even feel that they will lose face if their guests have eaten all their food. Luckily the campaign has got the support of many. In a restaurant in Xinjiang, the owner gives the guests who have eaten up all that they ordered a sticker.

UPDATED:. 09:00 EST, 30 October 2013. Israel today freed 26 Palestinian prisoners as part of US-brokered peace efforts. But it said it was pressing on with plans to build more homes for Jewish settlers, in an apparent move to appease hardliners. The inmates, who were convicted of killing Israelis, basked in a hero's welcome from hundreds of relatives and well-wishers in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Brokered release: Just after midnight, Israel released 26 prisoners - the second of four groups to be set free as part of a US-backed amnesty to resume peace talks. The released prisoners, including Hazem Shobair, centre, were given a hero's welcome after up to 20 years imprisoned in Israeli jails. 'Our heroes are coming home, long live. the prisoners,' crowds chanted outside the office of Palestinian. President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Issa Abed Rabbo, convicted of murdering two Israeli hikers in 1984, was carried through the alleys of the Biblical town of Bethlehem on the shoulders of cheering Palestinians as fireworks went off and patriotic songs blared. 'My feeling is that of a commander returning from battle, carrying a banner of victory and freedom,' Abed Rabbo said, his outstretched fingers forming a triumphant V. The inmates were jailed before or just after the first Israeli-Palestinian interim peace deals were signed 20 years ago. The inmates were released in the West Bank town of Ramallah. They were the second of four groups of prisoners to be set free to enable Israeli-Palestinian peace talks to resume. Reunited: A released Palestinian prisoner kisses his father's head upon his arrival in the West Bank City of Ramallah last night. Peace negotiations between Israel and Palestinians fell apart in 2008. The Palestinians refused to continue talks while Israel pushed ahead with building settlements on its territory. US Secretary of State John Kerry helped the two sides reach an agreement to bring them back to the negotiating table. Their release just after midnight Tuesday was the second of four prisoner releases meant to restart Israeli-Palestinian talks in an effort to reach a final agreement between the two sides. The Palestinians had long refused to resume peace negotiations with Israel unless it ends construction in territories that Palestinians seek for their state. Israel refused, insisting that settlements and other core issues, including security, should be resolved through negotiations. The prisoner release was part of an agreement brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, which brought Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table after a five-year hiatus. The talks had been paralyzed since 2008. Earlier this year, Kerry managed to persuade Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to drop the settlement issue as a condition for restarting negotiations. In exchange, Israel agreed to the prisoner release. The amnesty involved releasing all of the Palestinian prisoners in return for dropping the issue of settlements. Released prisoner Omar Masoud, 40, left, who was arrested in May 1993 for killing an Israeli lawyer, greets his mother Tamam Masoud, 70, right, upon his arrival to his family house in Shati Refugee Camp. In total, Israel has agreed to release 104 Palestinian inmates as part of the amnesty. In all, 104 Palestinian convicts are to be released in four rounds over the coming months. The east Jerusalem construction move angered the Palestinians but it was not immediately clear if it would directly impact the talks, which are taking place behind closed doors and away from the public eye, which both sides had agreed to. Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the move, saying that 'it is destructive to the peace efforts and will only lead to more tensions.' Last night's prisoner release opened fissures in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rightist government. A pro-settler coalition partner, the Jewish Home party, and members of his own Likud, called on the leader to cancel the amnesty. Freed: Hazem Shber arrives at a checkpoint at the entrance of Beit Hanoun between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Israel's Interior Ministry said it would push ahead with plans to build 1,500 homes for settlers on land in the West Bank close to Jerusalem. Last night's prisoners were the second of four groups to be set free as part of the agreement brokered by the US to bring the two sides back to negotiations. Meanwhile, Israel's Interior Ministry announced it would proceed with a plan for 1,500 new housing units in Ramat Shlomo, a settlement in an area of the occupied West Bank that Israel considers part of Jerusalem. Those plans were first announced in 2010, clouding a visit to Israel at the time by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the project, which was subsequently shelved. Israel announced last December it would proceed with the construction but froze the move again ahead of a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama in March this year. The Palestinians, who want to establish a state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war, condemned the move. Israel had put the construction of the settlements on hold for the visit of US president Barack Obama in March this year. Most countries deem Israeli settlements, built on occupied land, as illegal, and Palestinians say the enclave could deny them a viable state. Israel says the area for its settlements, Ramat Shlomo, as part of its Jerusalem municipality will remain in its hands in any future peace deal. 'This policy is destructive for the peace process,' said Nabil Abu Rdeineh, a spokesman for Abbas.

Israel says Ramat Shlomo, as part of its Jerusalem municipality, will remain in its hands in any future peace deal. Outside Israel's Ofer prison in the West Bank, where the inmates boarded buses for home, dozens of Israelis protested against the release. One held a sign with the photographs of some of the Israelis they killed. 'The victims of terror are turning they (sic) graves,' one placard read. Yuval Steinitz, Israel's strategic affairs minister and a Likud member, made clear in a radio interview yesterday that by agreeing to the prisoner releases, the government effectively had quashed a Palestinian demand to halt settlement building. But at the celebrations in Ramallah, Abbas denied any connection between the prisoner release and settlement expansion. 'The settlements are void, void, void,' he told the crowd.","output":"- Israel freed 26 Palestinian prisoners as part of US-brokered peace efforts.  - The prisoners received a hero's welcome from relatives and well-wishers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. - This release marked the second of four groups to be set free to resume peace talks. - Palestinians had previously refused to resume peace negotiations unless Israel ceased settlement construction. - Israel's Interior Ministry announced plans for 1,500 new housing units in Ramat Shlomo, sparking Palestinian condemnation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves the absence of people picking and eating maturing mushrooms and whether this has any direct or indirect effect on the formation of rust. It is important to analyze the individual components involved in the rust formation process and the suggested perturbation to determine if there is any correlation between the two. The rust formation process you described involves the following steps: 1. Water comes into contact with something made of iron. 2. The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid. 3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve. 4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen. 5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together. 6. They form iron oxide, which is rust. Reviewing the steps in rust formation, it appears that this process is purely a chemical one that involves the reaction of iron, water, and air components such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. The absence or presence of individuals picking and eating mushrooms does not seem to have any direct bearing on the rust formation process. Mushrooms, being fungi, consume and break down organic materials in their environment. While some species of fungi are known to have roles in breaking down metals, their role in this context would be quite limited and highly species-specific. Moreover, the fact that people would not be picking and eating mushrooms would not necessarily impact fungi's ability to perform their natural organic decomposition processes. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of no-one around picking and eating maturing mushrooms does not appear to have either a direct or indirect effect on the process of rust formation. The processes involved in rust formation, such as the reaction of iron with elements in water and air, are separate from the life cycle and activities of mushrooms or their consumption by humans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story.

While on assignment, a tribe native to the area takes him captive. Bradley starts in Bangkok, taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a boxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self-defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene. The next day, John begins his trip deep into the rain forest. He rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. John agrees to head back after one more day of traveling. John falls asleep, and when he awakes, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat. Before he has any chance to escape, a native tribe captures him in a net and carries him to their village. The chief, LuhanÃ , is told that the group has captured a large fish-man. At the village, Bradley is hung in the net from a high pole, where a group of young children hit him with bamboo stalks.

Seven students on Easter vacation arrive at a small cabin near Ãksfjord. The cabin is owned by Sara, Vegard's girlfriend. The group begins to drink and party until a mysterious hiker arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppe, led by StandartenfÃ¼hrer Herzog, occupied the area. For three years, the Nazis abused and tortured the local people. Near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, the soldiers looted all the town's valuables. However, the citizens staged an uprising and ambushed them, killing many. The survivors, including Herzog and Michael Schwab, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker then continues on his way. That night, Vegard wakes to a figure placing something beneath the floorboards of the cabin. He calls out, believing it to be Sara, but she ignores him and leaves. Vegard follows, and finds her outside covered in blood. Vegard suddenly jolts awake in his bed, revealing it was a dream. Meanwhile, the hiker has set up camp in the mountains and is eating dinner when he is disturbed by a noise outside. He investigates, and is attacked and killed by a zombie.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Girls' Generation (Hangul: sonyeosidae; RR: Sonyeo Sidae), also known as SNSD, is a South Korean girl group formed by S.M. Entertainment. The group is composed of eight members: Taeyeon, Sunny, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Yuri, Sooyoung, Yoona and Seohyun. Originally a nine-piece group, Jessica later departed from the group in September 2014. Girls' Generation debuted in 2007 with their Korean eponymous debut album. Prior to the group's debut, some of the members were already involved in the entertainment industry. Yoona had gone through about 200 auditions for music videos, dramas, and movies before becoming a singer for Girls' Generation. Sooyoung was exposed to the Japanese music scene as a member of a pop duo named Route th, which disbanded one year after its debut in 2002.  The first member of the group to join S.M. Entertainment's training system was Jessica in 2000, after she and her sister, Krystal Jung, were scouted in a mall in South Korea during a family vacation. That same year, members Sooyoung and Hyoyeon were cast into S.M.'s training system through the 2000 S.M. Open Audition, in which Hyoyeon danced for her audition. Yuri was the next Girls' Generation member to become an S.M. trainee after coming second in the 2001 S.M. Youth Best Dancer competition. Yoona was cast the following year through the 2002 S.M. Saturday Open Casting Audition, where she sang and danced to her favorite singers, BoA and Britney Spears. Seohyun, the group's youngest member, was scouted in the subway by an S.M. scout; she then auditioned in 2003, singing children's songs.  The group's leader, Taeyeon, was cast in 2004 after winning first place in the S.M. Youth Singing Competition. That same year, member Tiffany auditioned at S.M.'s Starlight Casting System in Los Angeles, and joined the company in October 2004. The final member of the group to be added was Sunny, who had become an S.M. trainee in 1998 and trained for five years before moving to another company, Starworld. At Starworld, she trained to debut in a duo named Sugar, which never debuted. In 2007, on the recommendation of Korean-Japanese singer IconiQ, Sunny moved back to S.M. Entertainment and became a member of Girls' Generation.  In July 2007, Girls' Generation had their first stage performance on Mnet's School of Rock, where the group performed their first single, \\"Into the New World\\" (dasi mannan segye; Dasi mannan segye). On August 5, 2007, the group officially made their debut on SBS's Inkigayo, where they performed the same song. Girls' Generation subsequently released their self-titled debut studio album in November 2007, which was preceded by the singles \\"Girls' Generation\\" (sonyeosidae; Sonyeo sidae)--a remake of Lee Seung-cheol's 1989 song, and \\"Kissing You\\". Girls' Generation became the twelfth best-selling album of 2007 in South Korea, selling 56,804 copies. The album has sold over 120,000 copies in the country as of 2009. In March 2008, the album was re-released under the title Baby Baby.

Passage:A vast number of artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex. Glyptic art from the Sumerian Early Dynastic Period frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the missionary position. In Mesopotamian votive plagues from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking beer through a straw. Middle Assyrian lead votive figurines often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar. Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of ritual sex, but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of Inanna, the goddess of sex and prostitution. Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at Assur, which also contained models of male and female sexual organs, including stone phalli, which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate cult statues, and clay models of the female vulva.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the given equation 96 = -64*j + 160*j for j, we have to first combine the terms with the variable j on one side of the equation. Let's follow the steps to find the solution: Step 1: Combine the terms with the variable j. 96 = -64*j + 160*j To combine the terms, we add 64*j and 160*j, as follows: 96 = (-64 + 160)*j Step 2: Simplify the equation. From the previous step, we found that the equation becomes: 96 = 96*j Step 3: Solve the equation for j. To do this, we'll isolate the variable j by dividing both sides of the equation by 96: j = 96/96 Step 4: Simplify the fraction, if possible. The fraction 96/96 simplifies to 1, since 96 is divisible by itself: j = 1 So, the solution to the equation 96 = -64*j + 160*j is j = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Representatives from the main local parties heard how a new deal could include: Philip Blond who is the director of the think tank ResPublica spoke at the meeting in Westminster. Among those present were representatives from Northern Ireland's five main parties, business leaders and the secretary of state. Mr Blond who has complied a report into the idea of a deal said: \\"Those cities like Derry/ Londonderry and indeed Belfast really need their own suite of powers to do their own regeneration, to turn around their own business and to structure their skills provision. He added: \\"At the moment Belfast is way way behind where English cities are and there is no good reason for that.\\" Suzanne Wylie, the Chief Executive of Belfast City Council who hosted the Westminster event, echoed concerns that Belfast could lose out unless a new agreement was put in place. She said: \\"If we don't have a city growth deal and have that real focus on investment, the city wont be competitive. \\"And certainly in the context of post Brexit we need to really have a focus on city growth and city development, so we can become really competitive and not slide back.\\" Gerry Millar from Belfast City Council said new powers could speed up the way development schemes are planned and carried out.

Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099.

These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction.

From the outset select vegetables that can tolerate less water and more heat. Examples include potatoes, sweetcorn and new zealand spinach. Select from the following.  A). Grow vegetables that are, by nature, hardy. These vegetables should not be any bigger than 2.4 inches (5.9 cm).;  B). If growing vegetables that can handle heat, spend some time getting the water you need. Do not propagate one vegetable at a time.;  C). Use compost as a moisture-retaining layer. Add a lot of compost from the start and keep the compost layer well maintained throughout the growing season.;  D). Most vegetables need to be at least 65% nutrient rich (peas, beans, legumes, tomatoes, apples, cucumbers, lettuce). But even vegetables that are cheap and hardy should be picked and kept from garden pests.;","output":"C). Use compost as a moisture-retaining layer. Add a lot of compost from the start and keep the compost layer well maintained throughout the growing season. Not only does compost help with water retention, but it also provides essential nutrients to your plants, improving their overall health and ability to withstand the harsh summer conditions.  To make the compost layer more effective, ensure it's at least 2-4 inches thick around the base of your plants. This layer will act as a barrier that reduces water evaporation and helps to regulate the soil temperature. Moreover, incorporating organic matter into the soil helps improve its structure, facilitating better water retention and drainage.  Throughout the summer, frequently check the compost layer to assess its moisture levels. During particularly hot spells, you might need to water more often to maintain the proper level of moisture in your vegetables' root systems. Monitor the temperatures throughout the day and aim to water during the early mornings or late evenings when evaporation rates are lower. In addition to using compost for moisture retention, it's essential to practice good gardening techniques such as proper plant spacing, mulching to reduce weeds, and applying shade cloth when needed. These practices will further support your vegetables' ability to withstand hot summer conditions. In summary, growing hardy vegetables that can tolerate heat and drought conditions are only the first steps to successfully help vegetables survive a hot summer. Utilizing compost as a moisture-retaining layer, along with proper gardening practices, will give your plants the optimal environment in which to thrive despite the challenging, high-temperature conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Teacher:This task involves annotating the answer type to a given question that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning). Note that the questions require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer. There are 3 possible answer types (i) spans, (ii) numbers and (iii) dates. If the answer can be found in the passage, label it as \\"span\\". If the answer is a number, label as \\"number\\". Similarly, label \\"date\\" if you think the answer to the given question is a date. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Passage: The reported prevalence of TS varies \\"according to the source, age, and sex of the sample; the ascertainment procedures; and diagnostic system\\", with a range reported between .4% and 3.8% for children ages 5 to 18. Robertson (2011) says that 1% of school-age children have Tourettes. According to Lombroso and Scahill (2008), the emerging consensus is that .1 to 1% of children have Tourettes, with several studies supporting a tighter range of .6 to .8%. Bloch and Leckman (2009) and Swain (2007) report a range of prevalence in children of .4 to .6%, Knight et al. (2012) estimate .77% in children, and Du et al. (2010) report that 1 to 3% of Western school-age children have Tourettes. Question: Which report lists the second highest range estimate? Student:","output":"Part #1: Understand the given question and identify its elements. Usage: The question is \\"Which report lists the second highest range estimate?\\". This question requires us to identify the range estimates listed in the passage and figure out the second highest one. The required elements are the reports and their respective range estimates. Part #2: Look for various range estimates in the passage. Usage: By carefully reading the passage, we find the following range estimates and their respective reports: - .4% to 3.8% (main passage statement) - 1% (Robertson, 2011) - .1 to 1% (Lombroso and Scahill, 2008) - .6 to .8% (several studies) - .4 to .6% (Bloch and Leckman, 2009 and Swain, 2007) - .77% (Knight et al., 2012) - 1 to 3% (Du et al., 2010) Part #3: Determine the highest and second highest range estimates. Usage: From the above estimates, we see that the highest range estimate is 1 to 3% (Du et al., 2010) and the second highest range estimate is .4% to 3.8% (main passage statement). Part #4: Label the answer according to the given classification of answer types (spans, numbers, and dates). Usage: The answer is a text found in the passage, which is referred to as a \\"span.\\" So, the answer is \\"span: main passage statement\\". We label it as \\"span\\" because the answer is a text that can be found within the passage, and it is neither a number nor a date."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation: -112*s + 660 = 20*s First, we want to get all the terms with 's' on one side and the numbers on the other. So, let's add 112*s to both sides to cancel it out from the left side: -112*s + 112*s + 660 = 20*s + 112*s This simplifies to: 660 = 132*s Now, we want to find the value of 's' by getting it alone on one side of the equation. To do this, we will divide both sides by 132: 660 / 132 = 132*s / 132 This further simplifies to: 5 = s So, the answer is s = 5!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Can we draw the following conclusion? The Forward Operating Base Iskandariyah (Arabic:إسكندرية), or FOB Iskandariyah moved its base to another location in 2009. OPT: (i). Yes; (ii). It's impossible to say; (iii). No;","output":"(ii). It's impossible to say; While it is true that Forward Operating Base Iskandariyah (FOB Iskandariyah) operated from 2003 to 2009, it is impossible to say with certainty if the base moved to another location in 2009 based on the information provided. FOB Iskandariyah was established during the American-led invasion of Iraq, and it served as a strategic point for the US military. It was involved in various operations, including combat, reconnaissance, and logistical support to the overall mission in the country. The specific location on the grounds of the Musayyib Power Plant and near the Euphrates River also allowed for better access to water and electricity to sustain the base. However, in 2009, the United States started withdrawing forces from Iraq, following a bilateral agreement with the Iraqi government known as the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), which was signed in late 2008. This called for a gradual reduction of American troops and the eventual transfer of control over certain military bases to the Iraqi government. As the control of various FOBs was handed over to the Iraqi forces, it is possible that FOB Iskandariyah (Arabic:إسكندرية) was also transferred to the Iraqi forces and did not necessarily move to another location. Alternatively, it may have been deconstructed or repurposed for other uses. However, without more detailed information on the fate of FOB Iskandariyah after 2009, it is impossible to confirm if the base moved to a new location. So based on the information given, the most accurate answer is option (ii), \\"It's impossible to say.\\" More research or specific details about the base's status after 2009 would be necessary to determine what happened to FOB Iskandariyah with certainty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: generousity in their heart, eager to be in front, shocked The answer to this question is:","output":"eager to be in front. In the given context, Sydney deliberately pushed Taylor aside to get to the front of the line. This act demonstrates a sense of impatience or eagerness on Sydney's part to secure a spot ahead of others. It is unlikely that Sydney would feel generosity in their heart after pushing someone, as the action itself is not generous or thoughtful of others. Similarly, feeling shocked would typically arise in situations where one is surprised or caught off-guard by something unexpected, whereas Sydney's act of pushing Taylor was intentional. Sydney's eagerness to be in front could have been triggered by various factors. For instance, it might be a competitive scenario, and Sydney is determined to secure their place to increase their chances of success. Alternatively, Sydney may be anxious about something related to the line, such as a limited supply of an item or service, feeling late for another appointment, or simply in a hurry. This behavioral choice might reflect different aspects of Sydney's personality, such as assertiveness, competitiveness or impatience. However, it is essential to remember that one single action may not define a person's entire character, and it could be a situational response rather than a typical behavior pattern. In any case, it is clear that Sydney's desire to be in front outweighed any potential feelings of guilt or empathy towards Taylor, as they were willing to push them aside to achieve their objective. This assertive, determined behavior demonstrates that Sydney felt eager to be in front and prioritized their needs over the well-being of others in that specific situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The initial statement provides information on the number of baseball players, the color of their jerseys and pants, and their location on the pitcher's mound. The attribute of being \\"tall\\" is not mentioned in this statement and, therefore, cannot be assumed. In logical reasoning, premises and conclusions must be related in a way that allows the conclusion to be derived from the premises. In this case, the second statement introduces new information that isn't supported by the first statement, meaning that the two statements don't have a direct logical connection. For the second statement to logically follow the first, the initial statement would need to provide the necessary attribute, such as \\"Two tall baseball players in blue jerseys and white pants stand on a pitcher's mound.\\" Alternatively, an additional premise could be provided that establishes the players' height, such as \\"All baseball players in blue jerseys are tall,\\" creating a logical connection between the two statements.

Roberto Mangabeira Unger (; born 24 March 1947) is a philosopher and politician. He has developed his views and positions across many fields, including social, political, and economic theory. In legal theory, he is best known by his work in the 1970s and 80s while at Harvard Law School as part of the Critical Legal Studies movement, which is held to have helped disrupt the methodological consensus in American law schools. His political activity helped the transition to democracy in Brazil in the aftermath of the military regime, and culminated with his appointment as Brazil's Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015. Unger's critique of economics begins with the identification of a key moment in economic history, when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. In Unger's analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government under which people grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and as a means to escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices, marginalist economics arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society we wanted to live in. For Unger, this moment in the history of economics robbed it of any analytical or practical value.  Unger's critique of Marginalism begins with Walras' equilibrium theory, which attempted to achieve a certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market has been shown to be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.  The consequences of the marginalist movement were profound for the study of economics, Unger says. The most immediate problem is that under this generalizing tendency of economics, there is no means by which to incorporate empirical evidence and thus to re-imagine the world and develop new theories and new directions. In this way, the discipline is always self-referential and theoretical. Furthermore, the lack of a normative view of the world curtails the ability to propose anything more than a policy prescription, which by definition always assumes a given context. The discipline can only rationalize the world and support a status quo. Lastly, Unger finds that this turn in economics ended up universalizing debates in macroeconomics and leaving the discipline without any historical perspective. A consequence, for example, was that Keynes' solution to a particular historical crisis was turned into a general theory when it should only be understood as a response to a particular situation. What is the key moment?","output":"The key moment in economic history, according to Roberto Unger, is when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. This shift occurred in the late-nineteenth century with the rise of marginalist economics, which disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments in order to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society people wanted to live in.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Often called trich, trichomoniasis is a type of vaginitis that is caused by a protozoa or parasite. It affects up to five million people in the US each year. This organism is a small parasite with a tail. In men, if trich is untreated, it can lead to chronic prostatitis. The symptoms of trichomoniasis include an itchy, green, and possibly frothy discharge with a fishy odor. This disease is sexually transmitted, so if you think you have it, you should let your sexual partner know so both partners can be tested and treated before resuming intercourse. If one of you is diagnosed then both of you need treatment. Traditionally, the diagnosis for trich is done in a doctor’s office. A wet prep is done by placing vaginal secretions under the microscope with a drop of saline solution. This will cause the parasite under the microscope to swim across the field and be identified.  There can be doctor discrepancy. Because of this, your doctor may also perform more standardized testing, such as a PCR assay to determine exactly what disease you have. You may also be given a pap smear as well. If this is not treated in pregnant women, there can be complications when giving birth such as low birth weight and prematurity due to a premature rupture of membranes (PROM). As with BV, trich can be treated with oral medication such as Flagyl. The usual dose is 2 grams taken once orally. You should avoid alcohol while taking Flagyl. Your partner should also take Flagyl at the same time. While you are taking the medication, intercourse should be avoided until both partners have completed treatment. Some studies recommend the use of Tindamax for trich as well. If prescribed, you will only have to take one 2 mg dose. This medication has a cure rate between 86-100%. Summary:","output":"The article is about Trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease caused by a protozoa, affecting up to five million people in the US annually, detailing its symptoms, diagnosis methods, potential complications especially in pregnant women, and commonly prescribed treatments like Flagyl and Tindamax."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To give a more detailed perspective, let's delve into the histories of both these vehicle models. Honda City was first introduced in November 1981. It is a subcompact car designed to cater to the demand for fuel-efficient vehicles during the oil crisis in the late 1970s. Initially, the City was equipped with a highly fuel-efficient ER-series 1.2-liter inline-four engine that produced 60 horsepower. The Honda City was characterized by its boxy design and large glass area, which made it stand out from other cars of its time. In Japan, it was marketed alongside the Motocompo, a folding 50cc scooter that could fit into the City's trunk. Over the years, Honda City has undergone multiple facelifts and engine changes. The car is currently in its seventh generation, which was introduced in 2019. It is available in various markets with different trims and engine choices, including conventional gasoline engines and hybrid electronic systems. The Honda City is now considered a global product, sold in countries like Japan, Southeast Asia, India, China, and many others. On the other hand, the Honda Today was first introduced in September 1985 as a response to the then-popular market trend of \\"kei cars\\" in Japan. Kei cars, also known as keijidosha, are small vehicles with engine displacements not exceeding 660cc, enabling tax and insurance reductions. The Honda Today featured a 2-door or 4-door hatchback body style and was driven by a 3-cylinder E05A series gasoline engine that produced around 30 horsepower. The Honda Today underwent significant changes throughout its production years. The second generation was launched in 1990 with a more rounded body design while retaining the 3-cylinder engine setup. The third and final generation of Honda Today, released in 1996, was a revamp of the design and renamed as Honda Life. In 1998, the Honda Life replaced the Today moniker altogether, marking the end of the Honda Today model. In conclusion, the Honda City came before the Honda Today, with the City being introduced in 1981 and the Today in 1985. Both cars hold significant positions in Honda's history, representing distinct eras in the automobile industry. The Honda City is still in production today, continuing its legacy, while the Honda Today was discontinued in the late 1990s and was eventually replaced by the Honda Life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It said Jediism did not \\"promote moral or ethical improvement\\" for charity law purposes in England and Wales. In the 2011 census, 177,000 people declared themselves Jedi under the religion section, making it the seventh most popular religion. The following began as a tongue-in-cheek response from some atheists on the UK's 2001 census when a question on religious belief was asked for the first time. But others took the message from the Star Wars films further, aiming to build a belief system and religious code inspired by the franchise. In its ruling the Charity Commission said Jediism \\"lacked the necessary spiritual or non-secular element\\" it was looking for in a religion. It said there was insufficient evidence that \\"moral improvement\\" was central to the beliefs and practices of Jediism and did not have the \\"cogency, cohesion, or seriousness\\" to truly be a belief system. The commission said to be classed as a religion it must also have a positive beneficial impact on society in general and raised concerns that Jediism may, in part, have an \\"inward focus\\" on its members. Read more: How a Star Wars joke turned into a new 'religion' Daniel Jones, leader of the Church of Jediism in the UK, said Jedi would continue to do charity work without any legal status and was convinced \\"Jediism's status will change in the next five years\\". \\"It's not what anyone in the Jediism community wants to hear, when you have churches like Satan and Scientology with charitable religious statuses,\\" he told the BBC. Jediism has more adherents than Rastafarians and Jains, according to the 2011 census. But the number of Jedi fell sharply from 2001, when 390,000 people said they were followers of The Force. Kenneth Dibble, the chief legal adviser at the Charity Commission, said: \\"The law relating to what is and is not a charity evolves continuously and, as in this case, can be influenced by decisions in other areas. Our role is critical in interpreting and explaining the extent of what the law considers charitable.\\" Summary:","output":"The Temple of the Jedi Order wanted to be a charity, but the people who decide about charities said no. They said Jediism, based on Star Wars, did not do enough to make people better and wasn't truly a belief system. Some people were sad about this because they think other strange churches are charities. But Jediism followers will keep doing good things anyway and hope the decision changes in the future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

No mockery, no Hollywood-knows-better, no nonsense. That kind of thing is in shorter supply than the universe's collective desire for McConaughey to return to rom-coms. 2. Mud is a captivating drama with well-rounded characters and fantastic performances from its three leads. 3. Mud combines the poignance of a boy coming to terms with life's realities with the excitement of top-notch suspense. 4. Jeff Nichols' script for Mud is a lot like the Mississippi River that serves as a backdrop for the tale of unrequited love. There are times it is big and powerful and other times when it becomes so serene it's easy to forget the depths that hide below. 5. With Mud, Jeff Nichols demonstrates once again that he's that rare breed of filmmaker who prefers to bury himself in the dirt of rural America rather than carve his initials into the concrete of sprawling urbanity. 6. It's a lovely, coherent piece of storytelling, with a unique sense of place. Nichols has carved out a niche as a distinctive film-maker. 7. It's rare that films manage to capture the actual experience of what it is like to be a child, but 'Mud' seems to nail the ethos. 8. Nichols weaves it all together with consummate skill and a little black pepper. 9. It's a sweet tale that displays plenty of faith in humanity without ever veering into sappiness and always keeping you on the edge of your seat. 10. [Feels] like an adaptation of a classic novel that doesn't actually exist.","output":"So these reviews are talking about a movie called 'Mud'. They all seem to really enjoy it! They mention that the movie is respectful to rural America, with lots of silence and calm moments, like a very big, slow river. But like a river, the movie also has deep and strong parts that remind you it's not all calm. The main characters, including a boy, are very real and interesting, and the story makes you feel a lot of different things. It's a little sad, but also exciting, never too sweet, and feels almost like a very old and good book.

Context: Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories.

Article: From the 17th through 19th centuries, the merging of folk beliefs about group differences with scientific explanations of those differences produced what one scholar has called an \\"ideology of race\\". According to this ideology, races are primordial, natural, enduring and distinct. It was further argued that some groups may be the result of mixture between formerly distinct populations, but that careful study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce admixed groups. Subsequent influential classifications by Georges Buffon, Petrus Camper and Christoph Meiners all classified \\"Negros\\" as inferior to Europeans. In the United States the racial theories of Thomas Jefferson were influential. He saw Africans as inferior to Whites especially in regards to their intellect, and imbued with unnatural sexual appetites, but described Native Americans as equals to whites.

This racial hierarchy was rooted in folk beliefs and scientific explanations of the time, which further reinforced notions of racial differences, viewing races as primordial, natural, enduring, and distinct entities. These ideas placed Africans in an inferior position with respect to their intellectual capacities and alleged unnatural sexual appetites when compared to Europeans and other racial groups, such as Native Americans, who were seen as equals to whites by Thomas Jefferson. It is important to note, however, that these now-discredited theories have been debunked and discredited by contemporary science, which upholds the understanding that all human beings are equal and that there is no inherent superiority or inferiority associated with different racial or ethnic backgrounds."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Director Scott Cooper told The Boston Globe although Miller was “fantastic” alongside Depp and the slew of big names who appear in the film, it “came down to narrative choices.” \\"Black Mass\\" is due to hit cinemas September 18. Click here to subscribe to FOX411’s YouTube channel Miller opened up last year about the lengths she went to in preparation for the role, revealing that she even worked with a dialect coach to make her Boston accent believable. “Up until the day before I flew here, I couldn’t do it and it sounded stupid,” she said. “And I was sort of religiously watching every film ever set in South Boston: 'Good Will Hunting,' 'Gone Baby Gone,' 'The Town.'

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Answer:","output":"Given the paragraph above and the hint provided, the parent with more plaques that could potentially block blood flow is Dan, Bob's dad, as he has very high cholesterol levels. High cholesterol has been associated with the formation of plaques in the arterial walls, which can cause restricted or blocked blood flow, leading to conditions like atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, and heart attacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vescio the mayor?, using the article: The village government is led by a mayor and four trustees, all unpaid officials elected at-large for two-year terms. The current mayor is Steven A. Vescio, elected in 2019. A full-time, appointed village manager handles day-to-day community affairs; the first was Max Vogel in 1967. Briarcliff Manor's government operates from the village hall, which houses the Justice Court and offices of the mayor and village manager. As of February 2014, there are 5,531 registered voters in Briarcliff Manor. As of 2017 the village's government employed 69 people full-time, including their building department, planning board, department of public works, the recreation department, the police department, the architectural review advisory committee, and the conservation advisory council. The village government administered a 2017–18 operating budget of approximately 28 million which predominantly went towards public works, police protection, debt service, and recreational facilities and services.Briarcliff Manor maintains a voting custom that dates to at least around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and has been described as an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.In the Westchester County Board of Legislators, the western portion of Briarcliff Manor (in Ossining) is..., what would be the answer ?

Generate a (i). review for a place","output":"Title: Disappointing Experience at (Place Name) I would like to express my dissatisfaction with my recent visit to (Place Name). As someone who values quality experiences, it is essential for me to share my negative review to inform potential guests what to expect. I genuinely believed that this place would provide a remarkable experience. Unfortunately, what I experienced fell short of my expectations. Firstly, the organization was chaotic from the moment we arrived. It took us nearly 30 minutes to find parking, which seemed unreasonably long for an establishment of this size. Once we parked and entered (Place Name), there were long lines and minimal guidance from staff on where to go or what to do next. The lack of directional signs further worsened the situation. The next issue I encountered was the customer service, or lack thereof. I encountered a few staff members during my visit, and none of them appeared to be enthusiastic or eager to help us. On the contrary, they seemed impatient and rather unresponsive to our inquiries. One particular staff member was borderline rude, giving us the impression that we were an inconvenience to them. When it came to the facilities themselves, they left much to be desired. (Place Name) was promoted as being well-maintained, clean, and modern. However, I found the area dirty, with litter scattered around, and some amenities in need of maintenance. The restrooms were especially unkempt – with unflushed toilets, inadequate supplies, and floors that were a slip hazard due to wetness. It was evident that the management had neglected their duty to keep the place clean and safe for guests. In terms of the attractions or activities available, they were also underwhelming. A couple of the main attractions were closed for maintenance, which seemed peculiar considering this was peak season. Moreover, the few operational rides and activities had incredibly long waiting times. I spent more time standing in lines than actually enjoying what (Place Name) had to offer. It was evident that they hadn't anticipated the turnout on that day, which led to overcrowding and insufficient management measures. Lastly, the food and beverage options were deplorable. The kiosks and restaurants were not only overpriced but also served poor-quality food. We ordered a meal for our family, and the food arrived cold, bland, and unsatisfying. I expected better from a place that charged such premium prices for a day out. In conclusion, my experience at (Place Name) was disappointing on several levels, mainly due to poor organization, subpar customer service, lack of cleanliness, inadequate facilities, and unpalatable food options. I regret spending my time and money on this visit and would not recommend (Place Name) to anyone seeking an enjoyable day out. I hope the management takes note of this constructive feedback and implements the necessary changes to enhance the overall guest experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago. Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns, trap cages and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013). It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the green iguana, the gold tegu, the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys, southern tamanduas, Brazilian porcupines, yellow-footed tortoises, Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training. There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded, and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting occurring both in and out of season, and even in wildlife sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management. Now answer this question: What is hunting pressure from?","output":"Hunting pressure primarily comes from legal hunters who have obtained hunting licenses, as well as illegal poaching activities that serve a thriving black market for wild game. The high number of hunters and poachers in Trinidad and Tobago, combined with the long open hunting season, lack of bag limits, and limited enforcement of wildlife management laws, all contribute to the significant hunting pressure on the local wildlife populations."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person whose performance in Poetic Justice is described as \\"beguiling\\" and \\"believably eccentric\\"?, using the article: Jackson's fifth studio album Janet, was released in May 1993. The record opened at number one on the Billboard 200, making Jackson the first female artist in the Nielsen SoundScan era to do so. Certified sixfold platinum by the RIAA, it sold over 14 million copies worldwide.Janet spawned five singles and four promotional singles, receiving various certifications worldwide. The lead single \\"That's the Way Love Goes\\" won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Song and topped the Billboard Hot 100 for eight consecutive weeks. \\"Again\\" reached number one for two weeks, while \\"If\\" and \\"Any Time, Any Place\\" peaked in the top four. \\"Because of Love\\" and \\"You Want This\\" charted within the top ten.The album experimented with a diverse number of genres, including contemporary R&B, deep house, swing jazz, hip hop, rock, and pop, with Billboard describing each as being \\"delivered with consummate skill and passion.\\" Jackson took a larger role in songwriting and production than she did on her previous albums, explaining she found it necessary \\"to write all the lyrics and half of the melodies\\" while also speaking candidly about incorporating her sexuality into the album's content. Rolling Stone wrote \\"[a]s princess of America's black royal family, everything Janet Jackson does is important. Whether proclaiming herself in charge of her life, as she did on Control (1986), or commander in chief of a rhythm army dancing to fight society's problems (Rhythm Nation 1814, from 1989), she's influential. And when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, Janet., it's a cultural moment.\\"In July 1993, Jackson made her film debut in Poetic Justice. While the film received mixed reviews, her performance was described as \\"beguiling\\" and \\"believably eccentric.\\" Jackson's ballad \\"Again\\", which was written for the film, received Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for \\"Best Original Song.\\"In September 1993, Jackson appeared topless on the cover of Rolling Stone, with her breasts covered by her then-husband, René Elizondo,..., what would be the answer ?

Exclusive Jurisdiction is a concept whereby only one Grand Lodge will be recognised in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both). When can Exclusive Jurisdiction be waived?","output":"Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two overlapping Grand Lodges are themselves in amity, meaning they have a friendly and harmonious relationship, and they agree to share jurisdiction over the same geographical area.

Write some highlights for the following article: \\"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning\\" hopes to be the next big, addictive role-playing video game, and its creators are putting an emphasis on \\"big\\" with a wide-ranging environment and a deep story line. But did they take on more than they were prepared to do? Big Huge Games studio general manager Sean Dunn was working in Los Angeles and content with his lifestyle there when he got a call about working on \\"Reckoning.\\" After seeing what the project and the people were all about, he decided to head east to Baltimore and join the team there. \\"This is a passionate and competitive group who want to take on Beth Soft (Bethesda Softworks),\\" Dunn said. \\"This team stayed together despite being bought and sold by Microsoft and THQ before being bought by 38 Studios. These people believe in what they are doing.\\" Dunn said the new \\"Reckoning\\" game contains more than 10 novels' worth of back story from best-selling fantasy author R.A. Salvatore, 45,000 to 50,000 lines of dialogue, the artistic vision of Todd McFarlane and the gaming vision of Ken Rolston. But his team of 110 people was tasked with bringing all that creative energy to life. Lead combat designer Joe Quadara, who worked on games for Crystal Dynamics and Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), said he was skeptical at first about whether the Big Huge Games team could make a game as big as it envisioned. \\"It started hitting its stride about the sixth month, in where it was 'We are making a huge game, and it's going to be great,' \\" Quadara told CNN. \\"Once we all convinced ourselves that we were actually doing it, we stopped looking at if we could do things or not and just started building everything.\\" The goal, Quadara said, was to make a fantastic role-playing game (RPG) that had a great action game built inside. He explained there were constant battles internally on balancing those two types of gaming while still presenting a cohesive story. \\"There's this weird conglomerate of taking the best minds of the RPG group and taking the best minds of the action group and seeing how we could put those together,\\" he said. \\"The engine itself is a full-on action game, fighting game engine, but it's also a full-on RPG game engine and puts all those hooks into each other.\\" If trying to design hundreds of weapons with different hit effects and back stories for combat was a challenge, trying to express 10,000 years of history in the game seemed nearly overwhelming for art director Tim Coman. He likened it to riding a bike down a hill. \\"You stop worrying about pedaling and just keep moving,\\" Coman said. \\"You just take each individual step as it's coming and focus on 'We're going to get this done, going to get this done.' \\" \\"There's a depth there that you know walking in, you're going to be building lots and lots of stuff,\\" he added. \\"Ken Whitman is our lead effects artist, and he's fantastic. He and I would have conversations daily. How do we push this, yet try to find something that is familiar enough to people so they get it?\\" Coman's artistic team had debates about what was going to be represented, how it would appear visually and whether it was even needed. Eventually, the decisions came down to creating a huge, open world to appeal to gamers' sense of exploration. \\"R.A. (Salvatore) came up with a line that we've repeated around here: 'If you want people to save the world, you have to give them a world worth saving.' For us, we wanted to put all that in there so that the players that really are RPG fanatics can see this is a real-deal RPG. And [for] the people that are action-game players, it is a real-deal action game.\\" Both Coman and Quadara admit they don't know how deep the rabbit hole goes when talking about the depth of \\"Reckoning.\\" \\"Take the blue pill,\\" Coman said while laughing. \\"Don't even get me started on the quests, because there is so much lore, over 10 novels' worth of writing, just in the game itself,\\" Quadara added. \\"The dialogue is so huge. Each person has so much that they've contributed to this game that there is no way one person could fit it all in their head.\\" However, they were able to fit it all on one disk. \\"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning\\" is available for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC.

Ten years ago that number was seven, 20 years ago it was nine. By comparison, 10 former Spain internationals are managing in the top two leagues in their homeland, while seven former Italy players are doing so in Serie A and B. In Germany and France, the equivalent figures are three and two respectively. At a time when Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, who both gained more than 100 England caps, have just retired, and Ashley Cole, another centurion, is reaching the end of his playing career, the Football Association wants to show there are ways of staying in the game other than the media - and not all of them involve managing. It rejects as an \\"urban myth\\" the notion it is now offering a fast track into management for former England players. Instead, it creates bespoke programmes that help candidates understand what becoming a coach means - and work out whether it will be something they enjoy. The FA has also got rid of the ad-hoc method of selecting candidates to study for a Pro Licence, without which you cannot manage at senior level. Now, in addition to an application form, those hopeful of being selected must submit a video of their coaching philosophy, then attend a two-day assessment centre for psychometric and profiling tests across nine areas deemed to be leadership attributes, including working under pressure. Those who fail can reapply after 12 months but only if they show tangible proof of development. \\"Word is getting out across the game that we have upped the ante,\\" says FA head of education Chris Earle. But the FA's programmes are not just focused on players going into management. It says there are between 400 and 500 first-team coaching positions and 1,800 in the academy system in the professional game. Former England captain Gerrard, for example, is taking his first steps towards an intended management career by working as an academy coach at Liverpool. \\"We are not saying 'forget those 80 caps', or however many it is,\\" said Earle. \\"What we are trying to find out is how well they communicate, how well would they manage in that complicated environment when you are surrounded by noise from the doctors, the physios and the talent ID people. How do you process all the information and still make good decisions?\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Trevor Sinclair, who won 12 caps and played at the 2002 World Cup, is going through the same Uefa A Licence course as former England team-mate Paul Scholes. He is also a regular pundit on Match of the Day. Sinclair, who spent a year as assistant coach at non-league Lancaster City, said: \\"Going into a studio and talking about the game might seem easy but there is a certain amount of skill involved to say what you feel about the game. \\"Mainly though, it is about opportunity. It seems to be a lot easier to go into TV than it is to get into a football club. I think there is a bit of a fear factor about introducing former players, who have a good name in the game and good experiences, because people who are already settled at those football clubs might start feeling threatened about their own position if the ex-player does comes in and starts making a bit of a name for himself. \\"International players have told me they have offered their services for free and it has fallen on deaf ears. There is something not right and I do feel a trick is being missed because it is such a gain for any club or federation to get ex-players involved.\\" Former Liverpool forward Robbie Fowler, meanwhile, says he prefers to take the long route to management so no-one can question his right to a job. Fowler, who won 26 caps, hopes to complete his coaching badges this summer - it has taken him longer to go through the process than the average five years. The 41-year-old  was on the verge of completing his B Licence, the first step towards a Pro Licence, when he joined Australian side North Queensland Fury in 2009. As he did not return to England for two years, he had to start the whole process again. He said: \\"I want to do it on my own merit. If you cut corners, questions will be asked.\\" Fowler is realistic about where he is likely to enter management, saying: \\"I don't think anyone in the Premier League or Championship would touch me.\\" And he is acutely aware of the fact only 11 of the 92 managers in the Premier League and EFL have been in their jobs for longer than four years. But he added: \\"There are only so many games of golf you can play. \\"I've worked hard for a number of years to get where I am now. Hopefully people will see I am really serious.\\" For all the strengthening it is doing across its coaching programmes, the FA knows judgement will come through what happens at the top end of the game. In November, Gareth Southgate was appointed England boss on a full-time basis having previously led the under-21 team. Before becoming part of the international set-up, his only managerial experience was his three-year spell at Middlesbrough, who were relegated under him in 2009. Earle said: \\"The number one aim is to have more English managers, or managers who have gone through this process, in the Premier League. \\"The second is around succession planning for England managers. Can we add anything - foreign language, finance - that would be of benefit to the people we speak to when Gareth Southgate eventually decides to stand down.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article discusses the efforts of the Football Association (FA) in improving the chances of former England international players transitioning to management and coaching positions after their playing careers. The FA is creating bespoke programmes for these players to help them understand the role of a coach and assess if it is a suitable career path for them. The FA has also added more strict selection procedures for candidates pursuing a Pro Licence, which is necessary to manage at senior levels. The ultimate goals are to have more English managers in the Premier League and to improve succession planning for future England national team managers."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM  Question 1.

And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet. Question: Why did the narrator warned the reader? Options:  A. not enough information  B. The narrator is unsure about facts of the story and will portray what he knows is true and invent what he believes is true  C. He saw shapes moving up and down the river  D. Fog was rolling up the river Answer:","output":"B.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  Now, I have a new situation: Scientists studied water stratification in two saltwater lakes. they were trying to find out why the fish population decreased in Long lake, and was very healthy and abundant in Shoal lake. They found out the phenomenon occurred more often in Long lake, leading to very many unpleasant chain effects.  Answer this question please: Which lake had more denser layers of water?

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that hired John McClain? is inside the article: Control is the third studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A&M Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R&B. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music. The album is also notable for being what originated the style and genre that came to be known as new jack swing.Containing autobiographical themes, a majority of the album's lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A&M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women. Following its release, Control became Jackson's first album to top the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and five of its commercial singles—\\"What Have You Done for Me Lately\\", \\"Nasty\\", \\"Control\\", \\"When I Think of You\\", and \\"Let's Wait Awhile\\"—peaked within the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Music videos created to promote the singles showcased her dancing ability and became a catalyst for MTV's evolving demographics.

The work raised the band's profile and landed them a major-label American record deal with Elektra Records. Their first album under Elektra, Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements (August 1993), was an underground success in both the US and the UK. Mark Jenkins commented in Washington Post that with the album, Stereolab \\"continues the glorious drones of [their] indie work, giving celestial sweep to [their] garage-rock organ pumping and rhythm-guitar strumming\\". In the UK, the album was released on Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, which is responsible for domestic releases of Stereolab's major albums.In January 1994, Stereolab achieved their first chart entry when the 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline, entered at number 75 on the UK Singles Chart. (Over the next three years, four more releases by the band would appear on this chart, ending with the EP Miss Modular in 1997.) Their third album, Mars Audiac Quintet, was released in August 1994. The album contains the single \\"Ping Pong\\", which gained press coverage for its allegedly explicit Marxist lyrics. The band focused more on pop and less on rock, resulting in what AllMusic described as \\"what may be the group's most accessible, tightly-written album\\". It was the last album to feature O'Hagan as a full-time member. He would continue to make guest appearances on later releases. The group issued an EP titled Music for the Amorphous Body Study Center in April 1995. The EP was their musical contribution to an interactive art exhibit put on in collaboration with New York City artist Charles Long.

Question: \\"What did Mehmed get from the Orthodox church?\\"  Context: \\"The son of Murad II, Mehmed the Conqueror, reorganized the state and the military, and conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453. Mehmed allowed the Orthodox Church to maintain its autonomy and land in exchange for accepting Ottoman authority. Because of bad relations between the states of western Europe and the later Byzantine Empire, the majority of the Orthodox population accepted Ottoman rule as preferable to Venetian rule. Albanian resistance was a major obstacle to Ottoman expansion on the Italian peninsula.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Mehmed the Conqueror, after conquering Constantinople in 1453, gained the allegiance and cooperation of the Orthodox Church by allowing them to maintain their autonomy and retain their land. In exchange for this autonomy, the Orthodox Church accepted Ottoman authority over their territories. This arrangement benefitted Mehmed as he managed to consolidate control over the newly conquered territories and gained the support of the local population, who preferred Ottoman rule to that of rival Western European powers like Venice. In summary, Mehmed got the Orthodox Church's acceptance of Ottoman rule as well as their support in stabilizing the newly conquered regions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They are called \\"Cyclorrhapha\\" ('circular-seamed flies') with reference to the circular aperture through which the adult escapes the puparium. This is a circumscriptional name that has significant historical familiarity, but in the present classification, this name is synonymous with the more recent \\"Muscomorpha\\"; details and reasoning are presented .  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - The Empidoidea are a large monophyletic superfamily of true flies , the sister taxon to the Muscomorpha ( = \`\` Cyclorrhapha '' ) . These two groups are sometimes united in the unranked taxon Eremoneura . There are some 10,000 known species in the Empidoidea . The majority of these insects are predatory , often with large compound eyes ( sometimes covering almost the entire surface of the head ) , and tend to be associated with moist , temperate habitats . Many have a well - developed anal lobe in the wings , and / or a small but distinct anal cell .  - The Brachycera are a suborder of the order Diptera. It is a major suborder consisting of around 120 families. Their most distinguishing characteristic is reduced antenna segmentation. A summary of the main physiological characteristics is:  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.  - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.  - The Brachyceran infraorder Muscomorpha is a large and diverse group of flies, containing the bulk of the Brachycera, and, most of the known flies. It includes a number of the most familiar flies, such as the housefly, the fruit fly, and the blow fly. The antennae are short, usually three-segmented, with a dorsal arista. Their bodies are often highly setose, and the pattern of setae is often taxonomically important.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - The housefly (also house fly, house-fly or common housefly), Musca domestica, is a fly of the suborder Cyclorrhapha. It is believed to have evolved in the Cenozoic era, possibly in the Middle East, and has spread all over the world. It is the most common fly species found in habitations. Adult insects are grey to black with four dark longitudinal lines on the thorax, slightly hairy bodies and a single pair of membranous wings. They have red eyes, and the slightly larger female has these set further apart than the male.    What is the relationship between 'empidoidea' and 'diptera'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between Empidoidea and Diptera is that Empidoidea is a large monophyletic superfamily of true flies within the order Diptera. Diptera is the order of insects that includes all true flies, and Empidoidea is one of the superfamilies within this order."},{"instruction":"Instructions: The provided files include famous book titles and sentences in the English language, and we ask you to translate those to the Spanish Language.

Background: Lehrer was born in 1928 to a Jewish family and grew up in Manhattan's Upper East Side. Although he was raised Jewish, Lehrer became an agnostic. He began studying classical piano at the age of seven, but was more interested in the popular music of the age. Eventually, his mother also sent him to a popular-music piano teacher. Context: Lehrer earned his Bachelor of Arts in mathematics (magna cum laude) from Harvard University in 1946. He received his MA degree the next year, and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. He taught classes at MIT, Harvard, Wellesley, and the University of California, Santa Cruz.  He remained in Harvard's doctoral program for several years, taking time out for his musical career and to work as a researcher at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. He was drafted into the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957, working at the National Security Agency(NSA). (Lehrer has stated that he invented the Jell-O Shot during this time, as a means of circumventing liquor restrictions.) These experiences became fodder for songs, e.g., \\"The Wild West Is Where I Want to Be\\" and \\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier\\". Interestingly, it was many years before Lehrer publicly revealed having been assigned to the NSA, since the mere 'fact-of' its existence was classified at the time: this left him in the interesting position of implicitly using nuclear weapons work as as cover story for something more sensitive.  Despite holding a master's degree in an era when American conscripts often lacked a high school diploma, Lehrer served as an enlisted soldier, achieving the rank of Specialist Third Class (later retitled \\"Specialist-4\\" and currently \\"Specialist\\"), which he described as being a \\"corporal without portfolio.\\" In 1960, Lehrer returned to full-time studies at Harvard, but in 1965 gave up on his mathematical dissertation about the subject of modes in statistics, after working on it intermittently for 15 years.  From 1962, he taught in the political science department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1972, he joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz, teaching an introductory course entitled \\"The Nature of Mathematics\\" to liberal arts majors--\\"Math for Tenors\\", according to Lehrer. He also taught a class in musical theater. He occasionally performed songs in his lectures, primarily those relating to the topic.  In 2001, Lehrer taught his last mathematics class (on the topic of infinity) and retired from academia. He has remained in the area, and in 2003 said he still \\"hangs out\\" around the University of California, Santa Cruz. Question: What did he study at Harvard?

Please write a short summary for the following article: City Living Increases Men's Death Risk City Living Likened To Smoking Risk The excess mortality risk among men residing in cities rivals that of cigarette smoking, social isolation, low income and other major psychosocial risk factors for mortality, says study lead author James S. House. House is director of the survey center at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research in Ann Arbor. What researchers did to reveal this alarming finding was follow 3,617 adults who lived throughout the country and were more than 25 years old. They interviewed them between 1986 and 1994. Earlier research had looked at death among populations living in certain cities, such as the 1990 study that found a black man living in Harlem, N.Y., had a higher likelihood of dying than a man in Bangladesh. Another 1995 study examined death among the elderly and showed that rural residents aged 55 to 74 had a lower mortality than their urban counterparts. Study: Nationwide and Prospective These findings, the investigators say, represent the first prospective study examining the impact of residence on mortality across all ages and across the country. Twenty-four percent of the sample lived in cities, 47 percent in suburbs, and 29 percent in small towns or rural areas. The advantage of a study that goes forward in time rather than backward, experts say, is that data is available from the onset. Going back in time and finding old health information, for example, can be problematic. The Michigan researchers collected information about age, sex, race and marital and socioeconomic status and self-reported measures of health, including smoking, drinking and physical exercise. By 1994, 542 people had died, the investigators found. After performing a statistical analysis, they teased out the likelihood of death for men and women, independent of socioeconomic status, smoking and other health issues. White Men At More Risk Living in a city, they found, carried an excess hazard of mortality only for men under the age of 65, and particularly for white men. Black men had an equal likelihood of dying living in the city or a suburb. While researchers saw the increased risk of death in all types and sizes of cities, they found that urban men were more likely to have died from infections and tumors. Elevated levels of tumor deaths suggest the influence of physical, chemical and biological exposures in urban areas,  House says, adding that the stresses of urban life may exacerbate immune suppression in men. Stress, Pollution Possible Factors Living in cities also involves potentially stressful levels of noise, sensory stimulation and overload, interpersonal relations and conflict, and vigilance against hazards ranging from crime to accidents, House says. Women dont seem to have the same risk, House says, because they might have some social, psychological or biological resources that buffer or protect them from the hazard of city life. The majority of blacks who live in the suburbs are not better or worse off socio-economically than those who live in nearby cities, says House, and their death risk was equal in both places. Critics: Urban Types At Risk Elsewhere Some experts criticized the study, questioning whether the city is risky in itself or if certain types of people choose to live in the city because they are predisposed to risky behavior. If they moved out of the city, they might still be more likely to die. The central city, as contrasted with the suburbs and rural areas, attracts to itself people, who are in high risk categories because of health behaviors such as smoking, drinking and nutrition, says Charles Longino, professor of sociology at Wake Forest University, in Winston-Salem, N.C., commenting on the study. They contain higher proportions of people with high stress levels, frustrated ambitions and fewer personal resources, he adds. How many of these factors would change if they moved to rural areas? It may not be location but the people in those locations that is key to understand these findings. More Research Necessary House says that alcohol and smoking contribute 10 percent to 15 percent of the 125 percent increased likelihood of premature death, but risky behavior cannot explain the other 105 percent to 110 percent. Historically, cities were unsafe places to live because of poor sanitation and close living quarters and infection, says House. But that has changed. More study needs to be done to understand what are the factors that are contributing to this higher risk.","output":"A study led by James S. House, director of the survey center at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, found that city living increases the risk of death for men under the age of 65, particularly for white men. The study followed 3,617 adults, interviewed them between 1986 and 1994, and found that urban men were more likely to die from infections and tumors. The researchers suggested that the stresses of urban life may exacerbate immune suppression in men. While some critics questioned whether city living itself is risky or whether certain individuals are predisposed to risky behavior, House argued that more research needs to be done to understand the contributing factors to this higher risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The given sentence \\"Sabemos todo.\\" in Galician translates to \\"Sappiamo tutto.\\" in Italian. In this translation, \\"Sabemos\\" is the first person plural of the verb \\"saber\\" in Galician, meaning \\"we know\\" in English. It translates to \\"Sappiamo\\" in Italian, which also means \\"we know\\" in English. \\"Todo\\" means \\"all or everything\\" in both Galician and Italian. Therefore, \\"todo\\" translates to \\"tutto\\" in Italian. Together, the translated sentence \\"Sappiamo tutto.\\" in Italian means \\"We know everything\\" in English.

To do this, subtract 15*u from both sides of the equation. 15*u - 15*u = 16*u - 15*u - 1 0 = u - 1 Step 3: Now there's only one term with the variable u, and it's on the right side of the equation. To further isolate u, add 1 to both sides of the equation. 0 + 1 = u - 1 + 1 1 = u Step 4: Now, the variable u is isolated, and we have the solution. u = 1 So, the solution to the equation 15*u = 16*u - 1 is u = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: How do I download FB videos onto my Mac? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"The process of downloading videos from Xvideos on your iPhone and downloading Facebook videos on your Mac is different. Let me explain these processes separately. Question 1: Downloading videos from Xvideos on an iPhone (for users in India) Downloading videos from Xvideos (or any adult content website) may not be legal and can lead to potential copyright violations. Additionally, as of February 2021, the Indian government has banned access to adult websites, including Xvideos. However, if you still wish to download videos from other streaming platforms, you may use a downloader app designed for Apple devices or use an online video downloader service. Here are some general steps: 1. Download a video downloader app: Find an appropriate app on the App Store that is specifically designed for downloading videos on iPhones (Documents by Readle, for instance). Please make sure to read user reviews and check the app's permissions to ensure it's reliable and trusted. 2. Copy the video URL: Navigate to the video you want to download and copy its URL. 3. Paste the URL in the app or online tool: Open the video downloader app or online tool, paste the URL into the corresponding field, and tap \\"Download\\" or a similar button. 4. Save the video: After the video has been downloaded, save it to your iPhone's camera roll or a specific folder in the app you are using. 5. Watch the downloaded video: Now, you can view the video offline whenever needed. Question 2: Downloading Facebook videos on a Mac To download Facebook videos on a Mac, you can use a browser extension or an online video downloader. Here are the steps for using an online downloader: 1. Copy the video URL: Find the Facebook video you want to download and copy its URL by right-clicking and selecting \\"Copy video URL.\\" 2. Choose an online video downloader: Visit an online video downloader website that supports Facebook downloads such as fbdown.net, getfvid.com, or keepvid.to. 3. Paste the video URL: Paste the copied URL into the corresponding field in the online video downloader and click \\"Download\\" or \\"Start.\\" 4. Choose the video quality: Some websites allow you to choose your preferred video resolution. Choose the desired quality and click \\"Download.\\" 5.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: You know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of \\"Jeopardy!\\". The saddest thing about White Men Can't Jump is that it had tremendous potential. For several years, I lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film; racial tensions were high, and basketball meant everything to everyone. A film about the members of this \\"basketball culture\\" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre acting and poor script in White Men Can't Job left something to be desired. The movie's sequence of events is cyclical. First, Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball. He then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories build up to a climax of some kind, but the \\"climax\\" I saw was just another sequence in this repetition (this case being \\"Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball\\"). In order for a plot to develop, some dilemma must be resolved; and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well. Apparently the writers of White Men Can't Jump forgot this rule, as the plot can be summarized as \\"Billy needs to pay the bills.\\" I appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies, but -- I'm sorry -- this was just plain awful. I could have cared less if Billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment. Despite all this, White Men Can't Jump is a successful film. Apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them. Others, I'm sure, were lured by the big names playing the leading roles. This leaves me to wonder, if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors, and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse, would anyone have bothered watching this movie? I really don't think so. I'll give this movie two stars out of ten; the extra star is for the \\"Jeopardy!\\" scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek. Select from the following.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. One way to ‘get rid’ of an immature reputation is simply to not let it bother you. Unless the specific content of what people think about you has serious consequences for your ability to make friends, get a job, and so on, your reputation matters only to the extent that you think it does.  Also, caring too much about your reputation can, in fact, be a sign of immaturity. So, if you are overly worried, shrug it off a little bit.  Ask yourself why your reputation matters for you. What are the consequences of others seeing you as immature? If they are minor and do not impede you in any important goals, consider shrugging your reputation off and focusing on other aspects of your life that are more important to you. Keep in mind that reputations are an approximate estimation of others’ incomplete knowledge of what makes you, you. People (not necessarily knowingly) may spread information about you that is inaccurate or entirely untrue.  Be honest with yourself. Ask yourself whether you believe you may be immature and if so, whether it might be worth changing your ways. Remember not to be too bothered by information that is not an accurate reflection of yourself, unless this information is actually damaging in a real, concrete way (i.e., it impedes with a goal that you value, such as having more friends). Take heart in the idea that just as your behaviors that contribute to an immature reputation can change, so too can your reputation.

In any industry, especially in fields like marketing, advertising, and product manufacturing, professionals often need to evaluate and analyze various aspects to make informed decisions and improve the overall performance of a company. One such aspect is the comparison of different strategies, products, or performance metrics. To effectively communicate the outcomes of these comparisons, it's essential to not only make the comparisons but also share the results with your team members, co-workers, and supervisors. When working on projects related to marketing strategies, professionals often have to evaluate the effectiveness of different marketing campaigns, channels, and techniques. This process may entail considering factors such as audience reach, engagement, conversion rates, and costs. By comparing these elements, marketers can identify the most successful tactics, optimize their marketing mix, and allocate resources more efficiently. Similarly, advertising professionals need to compare different advertising campaigns, creative materials, and platforms to ascertain which combinations yield the best performance. Factors such as impressions, click-through rates, cost per acquisition, and return on ad spend play crucial roles in evaluating advertising campaigns. Comparing these metrics helps in forming data-driven strategies for future advertising endeavors and assessing the effectiveness of advertising investments. In product manufacturing, comparing various aspects of products, processes, and manufacturing techniques can provide vital insights into ways to improve product quality, reduce costs, and streamline production. Professionals in this field may compare aspects like production costs, material quality, manufacturing time, and customer feedback to determine areas to focus on for improvement and innovation. Once a comparison analysis is complete, it's essential to present the results to the relevant stakeholders in your organization. Doing so allows for better communication, informed decision-making, and effective teamwork. To share your comparison results with co-workers and supervisors, consider the following steps: 1. Organize the data: Compile all the relevant data obtained during the analysis phase. Ensure that it is clearly presented and easy to comprehend. 2. Visual representation: Use charts, graphs, and tables to visually depict the comparative data, making it easier for others to grasp the findings. 3. Highlight key points: Emphasize crucial findings, patterns, and trends that emerged from the comparative analysis, drawing attention to aspects that may warrant further discussion or action. 4. Provide context: Explain the reasons behind the comparisons, the methodology used, and any limitations that may apply to the results. 5. Offer recommendations: Based on the analysis, suggest actionable steps that could be taken to address the specific needs highlighted in the comparison results. 6. Engage in discussion: Be open to questions, feedback, and suggestions from your colleagues and supervisors. Encourage an open and collaborative environment where everyone can learn from the comparative insights. By carefully comparing various aspects of your marketing, advertising, or product manufacturing efforts and showcasing the results, you contribute to a more efficient, informed, and collaborative work environment, ultimately benefiting your organization as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. The period known as the Crusades, a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the Levant back into Christian rule, began. Several Crusader states were founded in the eastern Mediterranean. These were all short-lived. The Crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of Europe. Their Sack of Constantinople in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the Byzantine Empire. Though it would later be re-established, it would never recover its former glory. The Crusaders would establish trade routes that would develop into the Silk Road and open the way for the merchant republics of Genoa and Venice to become major economic powers. The Reconquista, a related movement, worked to reconquer Iberia for Christendom. What empire was destroyed by the Sack of Constantinople?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Both electrolysis and laser removal have the potential to be permanent solutions after enough treatments. They are far more expensive than the other methods of hair removal, but they can save you a lot of time in the long run if you’re constantly waxing or bleaching your mustache. During laser-hair removal, a laser is used to zap many hair follicles at once and kill hair at the root. Because the lasers are best at targeting dark hairs that stand out against light skin, it’s not ideal for dark-skinned or light-haired people. Skin and hair color are less important for electrolysis, when a tiny needle is inserted into the hair follicle and creates a current that kills the root of the hair. Some places have better machines, more qualified specialists (always make sure they’re licensed), and happier customer reviews than others. Look online for reviews, but never choose a location based on the testimonials on their company website. Call your top two or three choices for clinics and ask them questions about their services, equipment, and training. Some things to ask include how long they’ve been in business, how old their equipment is, whether their equipment is FDA approved, and whether their practitioners are licensed. Also ask about the total price, whether they’ll let you do a patch test, what the possible side effects will be.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Problem:find without repetition the service_type_code of Services table for which service_details equals Denesik and Sons Party Solution:","output":"Part #1: Selecting distinct service_type_code Usage: SELECT DISTINCT service_type_code Explanation: This part of the query selects unique service_type_code values from the table. Part #2: Specifying table Usage: FROM Services Explanation: This part of the query defines the table from which we will be retrieving information, i.e., the 'Services' table. Part #3: Adding condition for service_details Usage: WHERE service_details = 'Denesik and Sons Party' Explanation: This part of the query adds a condition that only rows with service_details equal to 'Denesik and Sons Party' should be used in the final result.

Answer:","output":"Edward \\"Ed\\" Barry was born on October 2, 1882, in Madison, Wisconsin. He started as a left-handed pitcher in the world of baseball and eventually secured his place with the Boston Americans' team. Talented both with his left-hand throws and his right-handed batting abilities, Barry was admired for his well-rounded aptitude as a baseball player. Barry debuted with the Boston Americans as a major league baseball pitcher on August 27, 1905. Under his stint with the team, he established a reputation as a formidable adversary on the field. As a pitcher, he demonstrated an impressive display of stability and control with a win-loss record of 1-6, an earned run average (ERA) of 3.53, and a total of 34 strikeouts throughout his career.  During his time with the Boston Americans, Barry finished his final season in 1907, leaving a lasting impression on the field of baseball through his passion, dedication, and relentless drive for success. He played his last game with the Boston Americans on October 7, 1907, before eventually retiring from the sport.  Although Barry's active years in baseball had come to a close, his contributions to the sport were remembered fondly by both his peers and the fans who had watched him evolve as an athlete. Despite being faced with the ephemerality often prevalent in such physically demanding careers, Barry's final innings marked an end to his journey as a pitcher and right-handed batter, leaving an indelible mark on the fans who had followed his journey. Tragically, Ed Barry's life was cut short when he passed away at the age of 37 in Montague, Massachusetts, on June 19, 1920. His death marks the end of an era for this beloved baseball figure, whose memoir endures as a testament to his lasting impact on the sport.

Input: MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Siberia to locate the body of 003 and recover a microchip originating from the Soviet Union. Upon his return Q analyses the microchip, establishing it to be a copy of one designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse and made by government contractor Zorin Industries.Bond visits Ascot Racecourse to observe the company's owner, Max Zorin. Zorin's horse wins a race but proves hard to control. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, believes Zorin's horse was drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day, who subsequently escapes, despite being chased by Bond.Bond and Tibbett travel to Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Bond is puzzled by a woman who rebuffs him and finds out that Zorin has written her a cheque for 5Â million. At night, Bond and Tibbett break into Zorin's laboratory learning that he is implanting adrenaline-releasing devices in his horses. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and attempts to have Bond killed too.General Gogol of the KGB confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission revealing that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB, but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley which will give himâand the potential investorsâa monopoly over microchip manufacture.Bond goes to San Francisco where he learns from CIA agent Chuck Lee that Zorin could be the product of medical experimentation with steroids performed by a Nazi scientist, now Zorin's physician Dr. Carl Mortner. He then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording conversations and her partner placing explosives on the rig. Ivanova's partner is caught and killed, but Ivanova and Bond escape. Later Ivanova takes the recording, but finds that Bond had switched tapes, leaving her with a recording of Japanese music. Bond tracks down the woman Zorin attempted to pay off, State Geologist Stacey Sutton, and discovers that Zorin is trying to buy her family oil business.The two travel to San Francisco City Hall to check Zorin's submitted plans. However, Zorin is alerted to their presence and arrives, killing the Chief Geologist with Bond's pistol and setting fire to the building to both frame Bond for the murder and kill him at the same time. Bond and Sutton escape from the fire, but when the police try to arrest Bond, he and Sutton escape in a fire engine.Bond and Sutton infiltrate Zorin's mine, discovering his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the Hayward and San Andreas faults, which will cause them to flood, causing Silicon Valley and everything within to be submerged underwater forever. A larger bomb is also in the mine to destroy a \\"geological lock\\" that prevents the two faults from moving at the same time. Once in place, Zorin and his security chief Scarpine flood the mines and kill the mine workers. Sutton escapes while Bond fights May Day; when she realises Zorin abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb, putting the device onto a handcar and pushing it out of the mine, where it explodes, killing her.Zorin, who had escaped in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, abducts Sutton as Bond grabs hold of the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock Bond off the rope, but he manages to moor the airship to the framework of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sutton attacks Zorin and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Sutton flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin follows them out with an axe.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Process:  - Oil is gathered through mining operations - The oil is transported to stores - Oil is purchased by homeowners - Oil is placed into a stove in the house - The oil is lit on fire, and burns for a long time - The warm air off of the oil travels through the house -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the water becomes more cold happens, how will it affect oil is transferred to stove.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've suggested supposes that water becomes colder. This wouldn't directly impact the process of oil being transferred to a stove. Oil transfers occur irrespective of the temperature of water, unless they're occurring underwater or in extremely cold conditions where freezing could be a concern (which is typically not the situation when talking about oil being transferred to a stove in a house).  However, this hypothesis could have an indirect effect in a specific scenario. If the oil was being transported by ship and the waters were to freeze, it could potentially disrupt the shipping routes and delay the oil reaching the stores. This could indirectly delay the process of oil being transferred to the stove in a house if the oil supply was delayed or interrupted.  Similarly, if you're talking about a water/oil heat exchange system in the stove (though this is very uncommon for household stoves), colder water could potentially alter the efficiency or operation of the stove, even if it doesn't directly impact the transfer of oil to the stove. Nevertheless, in most standard applications, the temperature of water does not play a significant role in the process of transferring oil to a stove in a house. Therefore, we can say that your proposed perturbation would generally have no effect, unless in specific situations that heavily involve the interaction between water and the oil, as mentioned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

Should I validate this answer?","output":"According to the question asked: \\"what types of trees, flowers, or plants are commonly found in Canada\\", the user wants to find specific examples of plants, flowers, and trees that are common in Canada.  The suggested answer talks about why many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals. It is more about the general evolution and adaptation of flowers to improve their pollination rather than about specific flora of Canada.  Here are the steps I took: 1. I reflected on the question that was asked, which was about specific types of flora in Canada. 2. I compared this to the response given by the automatic system. It doesn't meet the requirements of the question. 3. The answer offered is not specific to Canada, and rather a generalistic explanation about the principles of plant evolution specific to pollination. So, judging based on these reflections, you should not validate this answer as it doesn't address the specifics of the question.

Article: Sharks are among the oldest animals on Earth. There are hundreds of kinds of sharks. Most are about two meters long. The dogfish shark, however, is less than twenty centimeters in length. A shark has an extremely good sense of smell. It can find small amounts of matters in water, such as blood, body liquids and chemicals produced by animals. These powerful senses help sharks find their food. Sharks eat fish, other sharks, and plants that live in the ocean. Sharks grow slowly. About forty percent of all sharks lay eggs. The others give birth to live young. Some sharks carry their young inside their bodies as humans do. Some sharks are not able to reproduce until they are twenty years old. Most reproduce only every two years. And they give birth to fewer than ten young sharks. For this reason, over-fishing of sharks is of special danger to the future of the animal. Sharks are important for the world's oceans. They eat injured and diseased fish. Their hunting activities mean that the numbers of other fish in ocean waters do not become too large. This protects the plants and other forms of life that exist in the oceans. People hunt sharks for sport, food, medicine and their skin. Experts say the international market for some kinds of sharks has increased because many parts of a shark are valuable.Collectors pay thousands of dollars for the jaws of a shark. Shark liver oil is a popular source of Vitamin A. The skin of a shark can be used like leather. In Asia, people enjoy a kind of soup made from shark fins. Experts say a fisherman can earn a lot of money for even one kilogram of shark fins. Sharks are among the oldest animals on Earth, but some sharks are in danger of disappearing from Earth. If too many sharks in one area are killed, that group of sharks may never return to normal population levels.

The Powhatan People (sometimes Powhatans) (also spelled Powatan) are an Indigenous group traditionally from Virginia. In some instances, The Powhatan, may refer to one of the leaders of the people. This is most commonly the case in historical writings by the English. The Powhatans have also been known as Virginia Algonquians, as the Powhatan language is an eastern-Algonquian language also known as Virginia Algonquian. The capital village of \\"Powhatan\\" was believed to be in the present-day Powhatan Hill section of the eastern part of Richmond, Virginia, or perhaps nearby in a location which became part of Tree Hill Farm.  Another major center of the confederacy about 75 miles (121 km) to the east was called Werowocomoco. It was located near the north bank of the York River in present-day Gloucester County.  Werowocomoco was described by the English colonists as only 15 miles (24 km) as the crow flies from Jamestown, but also described as 25 miles (40 km) downstream from present-day West Point, measurements which conflict with each other. In 2003 archaeologists initiated excavations at a site in Gloucester County that have revealed an extensive indigenous settlement from about 1200 (the late Woodland period) through the early Contact period. Work since then has added to their belief that this is the location of Werowocomoco. The site is on a farm bordering on Purtain Bay of the York River, about 12 nautical miles (22 km) from Jamestown. The more than 50 acres (200,000 m2) residential settlement extends up to 1,000 feet (300 m) back from the river. In 2004, researchers excavated two curving ditches of 200 feet (60 m) at the far edge, which were constructed about 1400 CE. In addition to extensive artifacts from hundreds of years of indigenous settlement, researchers have found a variety of trade goods related to the brief interaction of Native Americans and English in the early years of Jamestown.  Around 1609, Wahunsunacock shifted his capital from Werowocomoco to Orapakes, located in a swamp at the head of the Chickahominy River, near the modern-day interchange of Interstate 64 and Interstate 295. Sometime between 1611 and 1614, he moved further north to Matchut, in present-day King William County on the north bank of the Pamunkey River, not far from where his brother Opechancanough ruled one of the member tribes at Youghtanund.
