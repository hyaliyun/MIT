There are frac{15!}{6!3!3!2!1!} ways if the arrangement was linear. Since the arrangement is circular and indistinguishable due to rotations, we must divide by 15 (the total number of plates): Total number of circular arrangements = frac{15!}{6!3!3!2!1!15}. We calculate separately for the green plates considered as one entity. Thus, there are now 13 entities: Total green-adjacent cases = frac{13!}{6!3!2!2!1!13}. Similarly, calculate for orange plates considered as one entity: Total orange-adjacent cases = frac{14!}{6!3!3!1!1!14}. For cases where both green plates and orange plates are adjacent, we meld both groups into one entity, hence 12 entities: Green and orange both adjacent cases = frac{12!}{6!3!2!12}. Since the above counts cases where both pairs are adjacent twice, we apply the inclusion-exclusion principle: - Total undesired (either green or orange adjacent) = Green adjacent + Orange adjacent - Both adjacent. - = frac{13!}{6!3!2!2!1!13} + frac{14!}{6!3!3!1!1!14} - frac{12!}{6!3!2!12}.

Since the circle is tangent to the line (y = 2x), the distance from the center to this line equals the radius. The distance (d) from a point ((x_0, y_0)) to the line (Ax + By + C = 0) is given by [ d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. ] For the line (y = 2x), substitute (A = -2), (B = 1), and (C = 0). Thus, the distance is [ d = frac{|-2*0 + 1*k + 0|}{sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2}} = frac{k}{sqrt{5}}. ] Setting this equal to the radius (r), we have [ r = frac{k}{sqrt{5}}. ] Similarly, the circle is tangent to (y = -2x), but since the center is on the y-axis, the distance is the same, confirming (r = frac{k}{sqrt{5}}). Finally, the circle is tangent to (y = 3), and thus, [ r = |k - 3|. ] Equating the two expressions for (r), we have [ frac{k}{sqrt{5}} = |k - 3|. ] Solving for (k > 3), we discard the negative solution and solve [ frac{k}{sqrt{5}} = k - 3. ] Solving for (k), [ k(frac{1}{sqrt{5}} - 1) = -3, quad k = frac{3}{1 - frac{1}{sqrt{5}}} = 3(sqrt{5} + 1). ] Substituting back for (r), [ r = frac{3(sqrt{5} + 1)}{sqrt{5}} = 3sqrt{5} + 3. ] Thus, the radius of the circle is (boxed{3sqrt{5} + 3})."},{"instruction":"Given: x > 0, y > 0, x > y and zne 0, w ne 0.

Since the electric pole is essentially a point compared to the length of the train, the train only needs to cover its own length to completely pass the pole. The length of the train is 50 meters, and the speed is 100 m/s.

Moving on to proposition 乙 (B), A parallelepiped with a rectangular base possesses rectangles as its base and top face. However, the lateral faces of a parallelepiped do not necessarily have to be rectangles; they can be any parallelograms.

Since both ( r ) and ( t ) represent sums of some numbers among ( 1, 2, cdots, 2^{n-1} ), which are themselves parts of the binary forms of smaller integers, we can express ( r ) and ( t ) as: [ r = b_0 + b_1 cdot 2 + b_2 cdot 2^2 + cdots + b_{n-1} cdot 2^{n-1} ] and [ t = c_0 + c_1 cdot 2 + c_2 cdot 2^2 + cdots + c_{n-1} cdot 2^{n-1} ] where ( b_i, c_i in {0, 1} ). 7. Therefore, ( k ) can be represented in the form: [ k = (2^n - 1) t_1 + cdots + (2^n - 1) t_u + r_1 + cdots + r_v ] where ( (2^n - 1)t_j ) divides ( m ) since ( (2^n - 1)t_j ) are multiples of proper divisors of ( m ). 8. This implies that ( k ) can be expressed as a sum of distinct proper divisors of ( m ). # Conclusion: Hence, any integer ( k ) such that ( 1 leqslant k leqslant m ) can be expressed as a sum of distinct proper divisors of ( m ).

A's investment-time product is x * t (since A was in the business for the entire year, t is the total time of the year). B's investment-time product is 27000 * 2 (since B was in the business for 2 time units). According to the profit-sharing ratio, we have: 2 * (27000 * 2) = x * t 54000 * 2 = x * t 108000 = x * t Now, we need to find the value of t. Since B joined at a certain time and the profits are calculated at the end of the year, t must be the entire year.

Simplify the expression: 2 + 2y^2 - x^2 - 1 = 1 + 2y^2 - x^2. 5. Since xy = 1, we can rewrite y^2 and x^2 as frac{1}{x^2} and frac{1}{y^2} respectively, but in this case, we realize that the simplification directly from the original solution is more straightforward. So, let's correct the approach to match the original solution: (x+frac{1}{y})(2y-frac{1}{x}) = 2xy - 1 + 2 - frac{1}{xy}. 6. Substitute xy = 1 into this corrected expression: 2xy - 1 + 2 - frac{1}{xy} = 2(1) - 1 + 2 - frac{1}{1}. 7. Simplify the expression: 2 - 1 + 2 - 1 = 2. Therefore, the value of the expression (x+frac{1}{y})(2y-frac{1}{x}) is boxed{2}, which corresponds to choice boxed{B}."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=x^{3}ax^{2}+10. (I) If a=1, find the intervals where the function y=f(x) is monotonically increasing. (II) There exists at least one real number x in the interval [1,2] such that f(x) < 0 holds. Determine the range of the real number a.","output":"(I): When a=1, f'(x)=3x^{2}-2x. From f'(x) > 0, we get x < 0 or x > frac{2}{3}. Therefore, the monotonically increasing intervals for the function y=f(x) are (-infty,0) and (frac{2}{3},+infty). (II) Approach 1: f'(x)=3x^{2}-2ax=3x(x- frac{2}{3}a). When frac{2}{3}a leq 1, that is aleq frac{3}{2}, f'(x)geq 0 holds for all x in [1,2], implying that f(x) is increasing in [1,2]. In this case, the minimum value of f(x) is f_{min}=f(1)=11-a. Thus, to satisfy 11-a < 0, we have ageq 11, which contradicts the condition aleq frac{3}{2}. When frac{3}{2} < a < 3, or equivalently 1 < frac{2}{3}a < 2, we have: - For 1leq x < frac{2}{3}a, f'(x) < 0. - For frac{2}{3}a < xleq 2, f'(x) > 0. Thus, f(x) reaches its minimum value when x= frac{2}{3}a. We require f(frac{2}{3}a) < 0, which gives frac{8}{27}a^{3}- frac{4}{9}a^{3}+10 = -frac{4}{27}a^{3}+10 < 0. This results in a > frac{5}{2}, but it conflicts with frac{3}{2} < a < 3. When frac{2}{3}ageq 2 or ageq 3, f'(x) < 0 holds for all x in [1,2], which means f(x) is decreasing in [1,2]. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) in this interval is f_{min}=f(2)=18-4a. For 18-4a < 0, we solve to get a > frac{9}{2}, which satisfies the condition ageq 3. Thus, the range for the real number a is boxed{(frac{9}{2},+infty)}. Approach 2: Since there exists at least one real number x in the interval [1,2] for which f(x) < 0, we must have a > frac{x^{3}+10}{x^{2}}=x+frac{10}{x^2}. Define g(x) = x + frac{10}{x^{2}}, g'(x) = 1 - frac{20}{x^{3}}. As 1leq x leq 2, g'(x) < 0, indicating that g(x) is a decreasing function on [1,2]. Consequently, the minimum value of g(x) is g_{min}=g(2)=frac{9}{2}.

Remaining sum required = 30 - 8 = 22. 5. The next digit after 8, which is 7, gives a remainder of 22 - 7 = 15. 6. To add up to 15 with two distinct remaining digits, the next highest possible values after 7 are 6 (since 9, 8, and 7 are taken) and 9 isn't available, followed by 4 (since 5 plus 6, 7, 8, or 9 would exceed 15 or conflict with distinctiveness).

Find the probability that abc = 180.","output":"To solve the problem of finding the probability that the product of the numbers obtained when three standard dice are tossed, abc, equals 180, we proceed as follows: 1. **Factorization of 180:** We note that 180 can be factored into three positive integers that are all possible outcomes of a dice roll (i.e., from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}). Given that 180 > 5^3 = 125, it's clear that at least one of the factors must be 6 because the product of three numbers each less than or equal to 5 cannot reach 180. 2. **Determining the necessity for two 6's:** Further, since 180 > 5^2 cdot 6 = 150, we conclude that at least two of the factors must be 6. This is because even with one 6, the maximum product achievable with the remaining two numbers being 5 is only 150, which is less than 180. 3. **Identifying the exact factorization:** Given the constraints above, the only way to factor 180 into three integers from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}, such that the product equals 180, is 180 = 5 cdot 6 cdot 6. This leads to the realization that the only possible combinations for (a,b,c) are permutations of (5,6,6), specifically (5,6,6), (6,5,6), and (6,6,5). 4. **Calculating the probability for each combination:** Each of these combinations occurs with a probability of left(frac{1}{6}right)^3 = frac{1}{216}, because the probability of rolling a specific number on a standard die is frac{1}{6}, and we have three independent events (the rolls). 5. **Summing up the probabilities:** Since there are three such combinations that satisfy abc = 180, the total probability is 3 times frac{1}{216} = frac{3}{216}. 6. **Simplifying the probability:** Simplifying frac{3}{216} gives us frac{1}{72}.

Therefore, g(0)<0, which implies 2b<0 and thus b<0. (ii) When a is a constant: Calculate the first derivative with respect to x: f'(x)=e^{x}(x-a)[x^{2}+(3-a+b)x+2b-ab-a] Let g(x)=x^{2}+(3-a+b)x+2b-ab-a. Then triangle=(3-a+b)^{2}-4(2b-ab-a)=(a+b-1)^{2}+8>0. Assume x_{1} and x_{2} are the two real roots of g(x)=0, with x_{1} < x_{2}. By (i), we know that there must exist x_{1} < a < x_{2}, and x_{1}, a, and x_{2} are the three extreme points of f(x). So, x_{1}= frac {(a-b-3)- sqrt {(a+b-1)^{2}+8}}{2}, quad x_{2}= frac {(a-b-3)+ sqrt {(a+b-1)^{2}+8}}{2} Assume that there exists b and x_{4} satisfying the given condition. bullet When x_{1}, a, and x_{2} are in arithmetic progression, i.e., x_{2}-a=a-x_{1}, we have x_{4}=2x_{2}-a or x_{4}=2x_{1}-a. This implies 2a=x_{1}+x_{2}=a-b-3, i.e., b=-a-3. For this case, boxed{b=-a-3}, we have two possible values for x_{4}: x_{4}=2x_{2}-a=a-b-3+ sqrt {(a+b-1)^{2}+8}-a=boxed{a+2 sqrt {6}} x_{4}=2x_{1}-a=a-b-3- sqrt {(a+b-1)^{2}+8}-a=boxed{a-2 sqrt {6}} bullet When x_{2}-aneq a-x_{1}, we have x_{2}-a=2(a-x_{1}) or (a-x_{1})=2(x_{2}-a). If x_{2}-a=2(a-x_{1}), then x4= dfrac {a+x_{2}}{2}. This implies 3a=2x1+x2= frac {3(a-b-3)- sqrt {(a+b-1)^{2}+8}}{2} which leads to sqrt {(a+b-1)^{2}+8}=-3(a+b+3) Squaring both sides gives (a+b-1)^{2}+9(a+b-1)+17=0 Since a+b+3 < 0, we have a+b-1= dfrac {-9- sqrt {13}}{2}, and thus boxed{b=-a- dfrac {7+ sqrt {13}}{2}}. For this case, boxed{b=-a- dfrac {7+ sqrt {13}}{2}}, we have x4= dfrac {a+x_{2}}{2}= dfrac {2a+(a-b-3)-3(a+b+3)}{4}=boxed{-b-3=a+ dfrac {1+ sqrt {13}}{2}} If (a-x_{1})=2(x_{2}-a), then x4= dfrac {a+x_{1}}{2}. This implies 3a=2x2+x1= frac {3(a-b-3)+ sqrt {(a+b-1)^{2}+8}}{2} which leads to sqrt {(a+b-1)^{2}+8}=3(a+b+3) Squaring both sides gives (a+b-1)^{2}+9(a+b-1)+17=0 Since a+b+3 > 0, we have a+b-1= dfrac {-9+ sqrt {13}}{2}, and thus boxed{b=-a- dfrac {7- sqrt {13}}{2}}. For this case, boxed{b=-a- dfrac {7- sqrt {13}}{2}}, we have x_{4}= dfrac {a+x_{1}}{2} = frac {2a+(a-b-3)-3(a+b+3)}{4}=boxed{-b-3=a+ dfrac {1- sqrt {13}}{2}} In conclusion, there exists b satisfying the given condition: boxed{b=-a-3, quad x_{4}=apm 2 sqrt {6}} boxed{b=-a- dfrac {7+ sqrt {13}}{2}, quad x_{4}=a+ dfrac {1+ sqrt {13}}{2}} boxed{b=-a- dfrac {7- sqrt {13}}{2}, quad x_{4}=a+ dfrac {1- sqrt {13}}{2}}"},{"instruction":"The p% percentile of a set of numbers (pin 0,100) refers to a value that satisfies the following conditions: at least p% of the data is not greater than this value, and at least left(100pright)% of the data is not less than this value.

Each of the 10 teams plays with every other team exactly once. 2. Each team alternates playing on the \\"bad\\" and \\"good\\" sides of the field. To solve this, we need to set up a schedule such that these conditions are met. Let's denote the teams as ( T_1, T_2, ldots, T_{10} ). 1. **Total Games Calculation**: - There are (binom{10}{2} = frac{10 times 9}{2} = 45) games to be played, since each pair of teams will play exactly one game. 2. **Alternating Sides**: - Each team must alternate between playing on the good and bad sides of the field. Thus, this ensures that over the course of an even number of games, each team will play half their games on the \\"good\\" side and half on the \\"bad\\" side. Possible schedule configuration: - One possible way to achieve this is to fix one team and rotate the others around it. For example, fix ( T_1 ), and vary the other teams around it in a round-robin fashion. \`\`\` T_1 plays as follows: - Against T_2 on the good side - Against T_3 on the bad side - Against T_4 on the good side - Against T_5 on the bad side - And so on... \`\`\` Following this pattern: - The schedule ensures that each team plays against every other team exactly once. - By rotating the teams and alternating sides each round, all conditions are preserved. Thus, it **is** possible to organize a tournament where each team meets every other exactly once while alternating between good and bad sides of the field. Part (b) We need to determine if it is possible for each team to play exactly one game per day given the same constraints as in part (a). Let's explore this step by step: 1. **Game Per Day Requirement**: - Each of the 10 teams needs to play exactly one game per day, leading to 5 games per day since there are 45 games in total. 2. **Field Side Alternation**: - Each team must alternate between good and bad sides each game. Consider any two teams, say ( T_i ) and ( T_j ). If ( T_i ) plays on the \\"bad\\" side on the first day: - On the second day, ( T_i ) will be on the \\"good\\" side. - On the third day, ( T_i ) will be back on the \\"bad\\" side, and so on. Repeating this for 10 teams: - If ( T_i ) plays on the bad side on the first day, it can't play with any other team that also played on the bad side on the first day, same applies for those who played on the \\"good\\" side. Given the constraint of alternating sides and limiting each team to one game per day, coordination becomes infeasible without collisions where a team either replays with another or violates the side-alternation constraint. Thus, it **isn't** possible for each team to play exactly one game per day while maintaining the alternating field side rule.

Since the vertices lie on the edges of the cube, the vertex A could lie at a point on the edge (1, 0, 0) from the origin (0, 0, 0) to (4, 0, 0). 3. **Calculating the edge lengths of the octahedron**: - Since we need to determine the edge lengths of the inscribed octahedron, consider two adjacent vertices of the octahedron. - Let's assume vertex A lies at (1, 0, 0) and the adjacent vertex B lies at (3, 0, 0). - This pattern continues for vertices of the octahedron. 4. **Length calculations considering cube divisions**: - Every combination of vertices on the cube will form diagonals for the octahedron. - In this case, the edge length between any two adjacent vertices will be calculated based on the Pythagoras theorem with respect to the cubes. 5. **Using the Pythagorean theorem**: - The division into parts along each axis means that: - Edge length between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) or similar, giving us the value for edge lengths: [ Length = sqrt{(1 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2 } = sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}= sqrt{2} ] - Consider another arrangement along different axis possibilities: [ Length = sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2}= sqrt{3^2 + 1^2}= sqrt{10} ] 6. **Detailed steps of volume ratio**: - Using this current idea correctly places vertices and breaks it into separable components. - If the relative diagonal equalities match under these axis constraints. 7. **Verifying with other assumptions and conditions**: - With our findings from relative proportion, each incrementally maintains consistency. 8. **Conclusion**: Finally, you can inscribe an octahedron within a cube with its vertices lying on the edges.

We have: [ a_{i+1} leq (j+1) cdot 9^{2005} ] Since (j < k), it follows that: [ (j+1) cdot 9^{2005} < (k+1) cdot 9^{2005} < 10^k ] Therefore, (a_{i+1}) has fewer than (k+1) digits, since (a_{i+1} < 10^k). 6. **Proving the Second Statement:** We need to show (a_i > a_i+1) if (j geq k): [ a_i geq 10^j ] and [ a_{i+1} leq (j+1) cdot 9^{2005} ] Given (j geq k): [ 10^j > (j+1) cdot 9^{2005} ] This implies: [ a_i geq 10^j > (j+1) cdot 9^{2005} geq a_{i+1} ] 7. **Conclusion for Sequence Behavior:** If (a_0) initially has (k+1) or more digits, the sequence initially decreases: [ a_0 > a_1 > a_2 > cdots ] until some (a_N) has fewer than (k+1) digits. 8. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:** From (N) onward, (a_n) has at most (k) digits.

However, since we are looking for a 9-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0 (as that would make it an 8-digit number). Therefore, for the first position of the missing digits, there are only 9 possibilities (1-9). Let's calculate the possibilities for each case: 1.

Specifically, one of the pairs of opposite parts would increase in area while the other decreases, leading to a contradiction as they must remain equal. - Hence, it is evident that the lines must intersect at the center of the octagon to maintain equal areas in the sections. 3. **Assumption of Non-perpendicular Lines**: - Now, assume the two lines intersecting at the center are not perpendicular. - Rotate one of the lines such that it becomes perpendicular to the other. 4. **Equal Area Requirement**: - Importantly, because the lines cut through the center and have now been made perpendicular, it's clear and straightforward that they create four sections of exactly equal area through symmetric division. 5. **Conclusion from Contradiction**: - If the lines were not initially perpendicular, then an appropriate rotation to achieve perpendicularity reveals the balance in area. Thus, there would be contradictions if the lines were not perpendicular. Therefore, by proving that non-perpendicular and non-central intersection conditions lead to logical contradictions, we conclude that the lines dividing the octagon into four equal sections must be mutually perpendicular. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Let f(x) = begin{cases} x^{2} & (xleq 0) cos x 1 & (x>0) end{cases}, try to calculate int_{ 1 }^{ frac {pi}{2} } f(x) , dx.","output":"Given f(x) = begin{cases} x^{2} & (xleq 0) cos x - 1 & (x>0) end{cases}, int_{ -1 }^{ frac {pi}{2} } f(x) , dx = int_{ 0 }^{ frac {pi}{2} } (cos x - 1) , dx + int_{ -1 }^{ 0 } x^{2} , dx = (sin x - x) bigg|_{ 0 }^{ frac {pi}{2} } + frac {1}{3}x^{3} bigg|_{ -1 }^{ 0} = 1 - frac {pi}{2} + frac {1}{3} = frac {4}{3} - frac {pi}{2}.

The task is to determine whether exactly half of the resulting 2000 triangles, formed by drawing some non-intersecting diagonals, can have all their sides as diagonals. 1. **Understanding the structure:** A convex 2002-gon has 2002 vertices and 2002 edges. When we draw the non-intersecting diagonals inside a convex polygon, these diagonals divide the polygon into smaller regions, specifically triangles in this case. 2. **Counting the triangles:** It is known that a convex n-gon can be divided into n-2 triangles using n-3 diagonals when they do not intersect inside the polygon.

For the first digit, it cannot be 0 (since it's a six-digit number), leaving 5 choices. For the remaining four digits, they can be any of the remaining 4 digits in any order, which gives us 4! = 24 possibilities. Therefore, the total number of such numbers is 3 times 5 times 24 = 360. However, this includes numbers that start with 0, which are not six-digit numbers. To correct for this, we calculate the number of five-digit numbers formed by the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repeating any digit, with the last digit being even. If the last digit is 0, there are no restrictions on the other digits, giving 4! = 24 possibilities. If the last digit is 2 or 4, the first digit cannot be 0, leaving 4 choices for the first digit and 3! = 6 for the remaining three digits, giving 2 times 4 times 6 = 48 possibilities. Therefore, the total number of invalid five-digit numbers is 24 + 48 = 72. Subtracting this from the initial total gives 360 - 72 = 288. However, this solution contains a mistake in the calculation. The correct approach is as follows: For the last digit being even, there are 3 choices (0, 2, 4). If the last digit is 0, then for the first digit (which cannot be 0), there are 4 choices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 excluding 0), and for the remaining four positions, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the remaining digits, giving a total of 4 times 24 = 96 possibilities. If the last digit is 2 or 4, then for the first digit, there are 5 choices (since 0 can now be used), and for the remaining four positions, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the remaining digits. This gives 2 times 5 times 24 = 240 possibilities. Adding these together gives 96 + 240 = 336 possible numbers.

If Player A is about to roll and is currently 15 spaces behind Player B, what is the probability that Player B will be frozen after Player A rolls?","output":"To freeze Player B, Player A must roll a sum that is exactly 15, as this is the number of spaces Player A is behind Player B. Each die has 12 sides, so the possible outcomes for each die are the numbers 1 through 12. When rolling two dice, the smallest sum that can be rolled is 2 (if both dice show a 1), and the largest sum is 24 (if both dice show a 12). To find the probability of rolling a sum of 15, we need to determine all the possible combinations of rolls that add up to 15. These combinations are: - 3 and 12 - 4 and 11 - 5 and 10 - 6 and 9 - 7 and 8 - 8 and 7 - 9 and 6 - 10 and 5 - 11 and 4 - 12 and 3 There are 10 combinations that result in a sum of 15. However, since the dice are distinct, we must consider that rolling a 3 on the first die and a 12 on the second die is a different outcome from rolling a 12 on the first die and a 3 on the second die. Therefore, each combination actually represents 2 distinct outcomes, so we have a total of 10 * 2 = 20 favorable outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes when rolling two 12-sided dice is 12 * 12 = 144, since there are 12 possible outcomes for each die and the rolls are independent. The probability of rolling a sum of 15 is then the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes Probability = 20 / 144 Probability = 5 / 36 So, the probability that Player B will be frozen after Player A rolls is boxed{5/36} ."},{"instruction":"An arbitrary square ( S ) of size ( n times n ) on the coordinate plane covers ( (n+1)^{2} ) integer points (points where both coordinates ( x ) and ( y ) are integers) if one of its corners is at an integer point and its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.

We will proceed step-by-step with a geometric intuition and a proof that involves Pick's theorem. 1. **Intuitive Rubber Band Model**: - Imagine the boundary of S is made of a stretchy rubber band. - Every integer point within S (on the grid) is secured by a tack. - When the rubber band shrinks, it encloses all the tacks within S, forming a polygon H called the \\"convex hull\\" of these points. 2. **Area Analysis**: - The area of the convex hull H must be less than or equal to the area of the square S since H is contained within S. - Thus, the area of H is: [ text{Area}(H) leq n^2 ] 3. **Applying Pick's Theorem**: - Pick's Theorem gives the area of a simple polygon with vertices at integer points: [ text{Area}(Y) = q + frac{p}{2} - 1 ] where q is the number of integer grid points strictly inside the polygon, and p is the number of integer grid points on the boundary of the polygon. 4. **Convex Hull Area**: - Applying Pick's Theorem to polygon H, we get: [ text{Area}(H) = q + frac{p}{2} - 1 leq n^2 ] - Rearranging terms, we obtain: [ q + frac{p}{2} leq n^2 + 1 ] 5. **Perimeter Consideration**: - The perimeter of H is at most the perimeter of the square S, which is 4n. This implies: [ p leq 4n ] - Thus, [ frac{p}{2} leq 2n ] 6. **Combining Results**: - Substituting frac{p}{2} leq 2n into the inequality: [ q + 2n leq n^2 + 1 ] - Consequently, summing q and p gives: [ q + p leq n^2 + 1 + 2n ] 7. **Final Result**: - Using our inequality, the total number of integer points, including those on the boundary and inside: [ q + p leq (n+1)^2 ] Hence, we have demonstrated that any arrangement of an n times n grid-aligned square S covers no more than (n+1)^2 integer points.

Label the teams: Let's label the six teams as ( A, B, C, D, E, ) and ( F ). 2. Select teams for initial consideration: We start by considering team ( A ), which must play 3 of the remaining 5 teams. The number of ways to choose 3 teams out of 5 is given by the combination formula (binom{n}{r}): [ binom{5}{3} = frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = frac{5 times 4 times 3!}{3! times 2!} = frac{20}{2} = 10 ] So, there are 10 ways to select 3 teams (out of ( B, C, D, E, F )) for ( A ) to play against. 3. Case 1: None of ( B, C, ) and ( D ) (the teams chosen for ( A )) play each other: In this scenario, if ( A ) plays against ( B, C, ) and ( D ), each of these teams must play their remaining two games against ( E ) and ( F ) since they cannot play each other. Graphically: - ( A ) plays against ( B, C, ) and ( D ) - ( B, C, ) and ( D ) each play against ( E ) and ( F ) This yields one unique configuration for each choice of 3 teams, providing ( 10 ) possible schedules. 4. Case 2: Some of the teams ( B, C, ) and ( D ) play each other: We now consider the case where there are games among ( B, C, ) and ( D ). There are 3 possible pairs among ( B, C, ) and ( D ). For each of the 10 combinations we have: [ 10 text{ (ways to choose 3 teams from 5)} times 3 text{ (ways to choose pairs among the 3 teams)} ] Thus, we get: [ 10 times 3 = 30 ] Each of these configurations still needs 2 additional games to be correctly scheduled: - Let’s assume ( A, B, C, ) have each played 2 games and ( D ) has played 1. Thus, ( B ) and ( C ) need to play their remaining games with ( E ) and ( F ) but not with ( D ) again. There are 2 ways this can happen: - ( B ) plays ( E ) and ( C ) plays ( F ) - ( B ) plays ( F ) and ( C ) plays ( E ) Thus, the total additional configurations in this case is: [ 30 times 2 = 60 ] Finally, we need to connect ( D, E, ) and ( F ): [ D text{ plays } E text{, } D text{ plays } F text{, and } E text{ plays } F ] This completes the configuration. 5.

We aim to partition these numbers into two groups such that the sums of the numbers in each group are equal. 3. Let's start by assigning (a_n) to one group and (a_{n-1}) to the other group. 4. Subsequently, we will assign each number from (a_{n-2}, a_{n-3}, ldots, a_1) to the group with the smaller sum. If the sums are equal, we can assign to any group. 5. Let (Delta_k geq 0) be the difference between the sums of the numbers in the groups after assigning (a_k). 6.

We will paint its faces in blue and red such that no two adjacent faces (i.e., faces sharing a common edge) are painted in blue (with each face painted in exactly one color). Prove that if, in such a coloring, more than half of all the faces are painted in blue, then such a polyhedron cannot be inscribed within a sphere. (Note that it appears possible to provide a counterexample to this assertion. For example, inscribe a sphere in a cube and then truncate all 8 triangular corners of the cube perpendicular to the diagonals of the cube and touching the inscribed sphere. We obtained a fourteen-sided figure, eight triangular faces of which are not adjacent to each other and can be painted blue. However, 8 is more than half of 14. How to explain this contradiction?) 1. Let’s denote the polyhedron by P and assume that it has n faces. 2. Suppose P can be inscribed within a sphere. According to the properties of polyhedra inscribed in spheres, there is a single point of tangency on each face of the polyhedron where the sphere touches the face. 3. Connect each vertex of the faces with this point of tangency, resulting in m flat angles with the vertex at the tangency point. We will call these 'central angles.' 4. Since the sum of the 'central angles' at each tangency point is equal to 2pi, the sum over all n faces equals 2pi n. [ text{Sum of central angles over the polyhedron} = 2pi n ] 5. Assume now that a portion of the faces (specifically more than half) are painted blue, and no two adjacent faces are painted blue. This means that for each edge of the polyhedron, either none or only one of the adjacent faces is painted blue. 6. Each edge of the polyhedron lies in the plane of symmetry of two tangency points of adjacent faces. 7. Hence, for every painted 'central triangle,' there exists a corresponding symmetric unpainted 'central triangle.' [ n' = text{Number of blue faces}, quad n'' = text{Number of non-blue faces} ] 8. By our assumption, ( n' > frac{1}{2} n ). This implies that more faces are painted blue than not blue, i.e., ( n' > n'' ). Consequently, the sum of the central angles corresponding to blue faces is ( 2 pi n' ). [ text{Sum of central angles for blue faces} = 2pi n' ] 9. However, according to the inscribed sphere property, the sum of the central angles over the blue faces should be at least (or exactly) the same as the sum over non-blue faces. This leads to: [ 2 pi n' leq 2 pi n'' ] [ n' leq n'' ] 10. But this contradicts our earlier assumption that ( n' > frac{1}{2} n ) which implies ( n' > n'' ). Thus, if more than half the faces are painted blue, the polyhedron cannot have all these painted faces without violating the inscribed sphere condition. 11. To explain the counterexample proposed with the cube, observe that after truncating the corners of the cube, the resulting 14-faced polyhedron cannot maintain the 'no adjacent blue' faces condition due to the spatial representations essentially violating necessary symmetry and touching criteria deeply embedded in the geometric properties of inscribed polyhedrons. # Conclusion: Therefore, a convex polyhedron cannot have more than half of its faces painted blue without losing its inscribability within a sphere.

If ( x = 9 ) and ( y = 7 ), the gambler lost ( 9 times 20 + 7 times 100 = 180 + 700 = 880 ). 2. If ( x = 7 ) and ( y = 9 ), the gambler lost ( 7 times 20 + 9 times 100 = 140 + 900 = 1040 ). The gambler wants to minimize the amount of money lost, so the first possibility is better because the gambler loses less money. Now, let's calculate the largest amount of money the gambler could have received back. The gambler started with 3000 and lost 880 in the first possibility.

Since (15^k) is a power of 15, we need to factorize 759,325 into its prime factors to see if it is divisible by 15 and to what extent. The prime factorization of 15 is (3 times 5), so we need to find out how many times 3 and 5 are factors of 759,325. Let's start by factorizing 759,325: 759,325 can be divided by 5, because the last digit is 5. Dividing 759,325 by 5 gives us: 759,325 ÷ 5 = 151,865 Now, let's check if 151,865 is divisible by 5: 151,865 is not divisible by 5 because the last digit is not 0 or 5. So, we can't divide it further by 5. This means that the highest power of 5 in the factorization of 759,325 is 5^1. Next, we need to check the divisibility by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Let's add the digits of 151,865: 1 + 5 + 1 + 8 + 6 + 5 = 26 Since 26 is not divisible by 3, 151,865 is not divisible by 3. This means that the highest power of 3 in the factorization of 759,325 is 3^0. Therefore, the highest power of 15 that divides 759,325 is (15^0), because (15^1) would require both a 3 and a 5, and we only have one 5 in the factorization. This means that (k = 0).

On the first day, the vendor sells x% of P, which is (x/100) * P pears. The remaining pears after this sale are P - (x/100) * P = P(1 - x/100). The vendor then throws away 50% of the remaining pears, so the number of pears thrown away on the first day is 0.5 * P(1 - x/100). On the second day, the vendor sells 80% of the remaining pears, which is 0.8 * (0.5 * P(1 - x/100)) = 0.4 * P(1 - x/100). The remaining pears after the second day's sale, which are thrown away, are 0.2 * (0.5 * P(1 - x/100)) = 0.1 * P(1 - x/100). The total percentage of pears thrown away is the sum of the percentages thrown away on the first and second days, which is: 0.5 * (1 - x/100) + 0.1 * (1 - x/100) = 0.6 * (1 - x/100). We know that the total percentage of pears thrown away is 11.999999999999996%, which we can round to 12% for simplicity. So we have: 0.6 * (1 - x/100) = 0.12. Now, let's solve for x: 1 - x/100 = 0.12 / 0.6, 1 - x/100 = 0.2, x/100 = 1 - 0.2, x/100 = 0.8, x = 0.8 * 100, x = 80.

We assume for contradiction that the decimal expansions of ( sqrt{p} ) and ( sqrt{n} ) are identical. 2. **Representation with Decimal Expansion**: Given our assumption, we can represent the relationship between ( sqrt{p} ) and ( sqrt{n} ) as: [ sqrt{p} - sqrt{n} = k, ] where ( k ) is some integer (since we assume that the decimal expansions are identical). 3. **Rewriting and Rearranging**: Rearrange the equation: [ sqrt{p} = sqrt{n} + k. ] Now, squaring both sides to remove the square root gives: [ p = (sqrt{n} + k)^2. ] 4. **Expanding the Right-Hand Side**: Expand the right-hand side: [ p = n + k^2 + 2ksqrt{n}. ] 5. **Separating Terms**: Since ( p ) and ( n ) are rational numbers, we need to check if this equation can hold: - If ( n ) is not a perfect square, then ( sqrt{n} ) is irrational. - The term ( 2ksqrt{n} ) is consequently irrational unless ( k = 0 ). 6. **Contradiction**: - If ( k neq 0 ), then ( 2ksqrt{n} ) is an irrational term. - Therefore, ( p ) would have to be an irrational number because it includes the irrational term ( 2ksqrt{n} ). - But ( p ) is defined to be rational, leading us to a contradiction. 7. **Conclusion**: - Thus, our assumption that ( sqrt{p} ) and ( sqrt{n} ) could have the same decimal expansion must be false. Hence, we have proved that the decimal expansions of the square roots of two different positive rational numbers that are not perfect squares cannot be identical.

Substituting the point (sqrt{2}, sqrt{3}) into the hyperbola's equation, we have: frac{(sqrt{2})^2}{4 - b^2} - frac{(sqrt{3})^2}{b^2} = 1. After simplification, we obtain b^2 = 3. Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is: boxed{x^2 - frac{y^2}{3} = 1}. (2) When PF is perpendicular to the x-axis, let's consider the point P(2, 3). The distance |AF| equals 1 + 2 = 3.

Applying double angle identity for tan(2text{∠PAF}), we get: tan(2text{∠PAF}) = frac{2k_{PA}}{1 - k_{PA}^2} = frac{2(x_0 + 2)y_0}{(x_0 + 2)^2 - y_0^2}. From x_0^2 - frac{1}{3}y_0^2 = 1, we get y_0^2 = 3(x_0^2 - 1).

For option A, consider the function (y = c^{x}). Since (0 < c < 1), the function is monotonically decreasing for all real (x). Therefore, since (a > b), it should hold that (c^{a} < c^{b}), negating option A. For option B, calculate the difference: [ frac{a}{a-c} - frac{b}{b-c} = frac{ab-bc - ab + ac}{(a-c)(b-c)} = frac{c(a - b)}{(a-c)(b-c)} ] Given that (a > b) and (0 < c), we can see that (c(a - b) < 0). Since the denominators ((a-c)) and ((b-c)) are positive because (a, b > 1 > c), the overall fraction is negative, indicating (frac{a}{a-c} < frac{b}{b-c}) which makes option B incorrect. For option C, notice that both (ba^{c}) and (ab^{c}) are positive. We can take the ratio of (ba^{c}) to (ab^{c}) to compare: [ frac{ba^{c}}{ab^{c}} = left(frac{a}{b}right)^{c-1} ] Since both (a > b > 1) and (0 < c < 1), we have (frac{a}{b} > 1) and therefore (left(frac{a}{b}right)^{c-1} < 1), leading to (ba^{c} < ab^{c}), so option C is incorrect.

We refer to the branches emerging from the higher end of a branch as its children, and these branches are also referred to as each other's siblings. Every branch in the skyhigh tree has at least two children, and if it doesn't have exactly two children, then it has a sibling with exactly two children. Siblings always have different numbers of children. If a branch has more than two children, then it has a sibling with exactly one fewer child than itself. How many branches emerge from the nodes that are n feet high?","output":"1. **Define the Problem:** We start by noting that each branch of the tree stems from some node, and this node has children. Let ( X ) be a branch (or the trunk), which has ( x ) children. Define ( y ) as the maximum number of children of ( X )’s children. Define ( z ) as the largest positive integer less than ( y ) that does not appear as the number of children of ( X )’s children. Since 1 cannot appear on any branches, ( z ) must exist. 2. **Examining ( z ):** Since ( z+1 ) appears on one of ( X )’s children branches, if ( z > 1 ), then ( z+1 > 2 ) implies ( z ) must also appear on one of ( X )’s children branches. This creates a contradiction, so we conclude ( z = 1 ), implying all numbers ( 2, 3, ldots, y ) appear on ( X )’s children branches. 3. **Counting the Children:** Since each branch must have different numbers of children, ( X )’s children must have ( 2, 3, ldots, x+1 ). Thus, the number of children ( y = x + 1 ). Therefore, the numbers assigned to ( X )’s children branches are ( 2, 3, ldots, x+1 ). 4. **Graph Representation:** Represent the branches using directed edges: a vertical edge from a branch with ( x ) children to its child with ( x+1 ), and a horizontal edge from a branch with ( x ) children to its sibling with ( x-1 ) children, if ( x > 2 ). Each branch can be uniquely reached from the trunk as one can only follow these edges uniquely from the start. 5. **Connecting this to Heights:** The number of branches starting at height ( n ) is equivalent to the number of branches at height ( n+1 ) that have exactly 2 children, since every branch has one child with exactly 2 children. Each path from the trunk can be represented as a balanced sequence of ( n+1 ) '+’ and ( n+1 ) '-’ such that at every point, the number of '+' is at least the number of '-'. 6. **Count the Paths:** We count the well-formed sequences of ( n+1 ) '+' and ( n+1 ) '-' symbols where any prefix contains at least as many '+' as '-'. The total number of unrestricted sequences is ( binom{2n+2}{n+1} ), and the number of sequences that are not well-formed is equivalent to sequences with ( n ) '+' and ( n+2 ) '-'. By symmetry and reflection, the number of such malformed sequences is ( binom{2n+2}{n} ). 7. **Find the Difference:** The difference between the total sequences and the malformed sequences gives us the number of valid sequences. Therefore, the number of good sequences is: [ binom{2n+2}{n+1} - binom{2n+2}{n} ] This expression is known to be the ((n+1))-th Catalan number.

The next step takes ( b ) and ( r ) as the new pair of numbers, and this process continues until one of the numbers becomes zero. 2. **Reduction process**: In each step, the smaller number ( r ) is strictly less than the larger number ( b ) by at least 1 (since ( r < b )). This means, each step reduces one of the two numbers. 3. **Claim**: We now show that if during the ( k )-th operation, the smaller number is (leq 7-k) for ( 1 leq k leq 6 ), the number of operations will not exceed six. 4. **Sequence of Operations**: For the first operation, suppose one of the numbers is at most ( 7-1 = 6 ).

After six steps involving divisions where each time, ( b ) is getting reduced strictly, we must have: [ q leq frac{1988}{7!} ] where ( 7! ) (i.e., factorial of 7) calculates as: [ 7! = 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 5040. ] 7. **Inequality**: Substitute this in the inequality: [ q leq frac{1988}{5040} < 1. ] Since ( q ) (the quotient) must be an integer, it can only be zero.

To find out how many fractions of a mile were traveled, we divide the additional charge for distance by the charge per fraction of a mile: Additional charge for distance / Charge per fraction of a mile = Number of fractions of a mile 1.35 / 0.15 = 9 This means that the additional charge was applied to 9 fractions of a mile.

Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Assumption and Initial Conditions**: Assume s, d, p, and q form an arithmetic sequence: [ a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 ] where the common difference is D. Specifically, we examine the positions of s and d in the sequence and derive necessary conditions. 2. **Case 1: s and d Have One Term Between Them**: Suppose s and d have exactly one term between them, meaning they are a_{i} and a_{i+2} for some i. If p is the middle term: [ v = u ] Since p = u cdot v and v = u, [ p = u^2 ] Similarly, for q = u/v: [ u^2 = u Rightarrow u(v - 1) = 0 ] Leading to either: - ( u = 0 ) - ( v = 1 ) If ( u = 0 ): [ p = 0, quad q = 0 ] Consequently, s = d implies the equation: [ u + v = u - v Rightarrow v = 0, ] which is contradictory for q without meaning. If ( v = 1 ), we would also deduce that s=d, again leading to inconsistencies. 3. **Case 2: q is the Middle Term**: When q is between s and d, [ u / v = u ] This leads to similar contradictions as in Case 1. 4. **Conditions for Extremes or Middle Terms**: Analyzing cases where s and d either each are extreme terms or both are middle terms, giving: [ p + q = s + d. ] By evaluating this: [ u cdot v + frac{u}{v} = u + v + u - v = 2u ] Substituting gives: [ u(v + v^{-1}) = 2u ] Evaluating either leads to impossible equality unless trivialities like u = 0 or invalid results. 5. **Forming an Arithmetic Sequence with Fixed (u, v)**: We solve parameterically: [ begin{cases} p = u v = u + 3 v, q = frac{u}{v} = u + 5 v. end{cases} ] Solving these parameterically: [ u = frac{3v}{v-1} = frac{5v}{frac{1}{v}-1} = -frac{B v^2}{v-1} ] With resultant parameter values leading to: [ p, q, s, d. ] 6. **Final Values and Numerical Solutions**: After solving resulting conditions stepwise for consistent (u) and (v): [ u = frac{25}{8}, v = -frac{5}{3}, implies boxed{text{Other solutions provided in a similar manner}} ] 7. **Verification**: Checking the consistent terms for each derived solution. bullet First solution verification: [ left( frac{25}{8}, -frac{5}{3} right) implies check p = check q ] Hence, consistent verified solutions are boxed as alternatives."},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, a, b, c are the sides opposite to angles A, B, C respectively, and frac{cos B}{cos C} = frac{b}{2a + c}. 1.

Since in triangle ABC, sin A = sin(B + C), we have 2cos B sin A + sin A = 0, or sin A (2cos B + 1) = 0. Given that in triangle ABC, sin A > 0, we have 2cos B + 1 = 0, which leads to cos B = -frac{1}{2}. Since B in (0, pi), we have B = frac{2}{3}pi. 2. Given that b = 3, we have cos B = cos frac{2}{3}pi = -frac{1}{2}. By the cosine law, b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2accos B, which simplifies to 9 = a^2 + c^2 + ac geq 3ac, or ac leq 3.

H + P + F = 500 (Thabo owns a total of 500 books) Using the first equation, we can express P in terms of H: P = H + 30 Using the second equation, we can express F in terms of P: F = 3P Now, let's substitute P with (H + 30) in the equation for F: F = 3(H + 30) F = 3H + 90 Now we have expressions for P and F in terms of H. Let's substitute these into the third equation: H + (H + 30) + (3H + 90) = 500 Combine like terms: H + H + 3H + 30 + 90 = 500 5H + 120 = 500 Subtract 120 from both sides: 5H = 500 - 120 5H = 380 Divide both sides by 5: H = 380 / 5 H = 76 Thabo owns boxed{76} hardcover nonfiction books."},{"instruction":"There are some people on the Green Bay High track team.

When the expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero, (x^{2}-5x+6) < x^{2}-4. 2. When the expression inside the absolute value is negative, -(x^{2}-5x+6) < x^{2}-4. First, we acknowledge that x^{2}-4 is always positive except at x = -2 and x = 2, where it equals zero. This suggests we need to solve the inequality for x > 2 or x < -2. **For the first case:** begin{align*} x^{2}-5x+6 &< x^{2}-4 -5x+6 &< -4 -5x &< -10 x &> 2 end{align*} Since we need to satisfy x > 2 from the original condition, this case is valid, and the solution so far is x > 2. **For the second case:** begin{align*} -(x^{2}-5x+6) &< x^{2}-4 - x^{2} + 5x - 6 &< x^{2} - 4 - x^{2} + 5x - 6 - x^{2} + 4 &< 0 -2x^{2} + 5x - 2 &< 0 end{align*} This is a quadratic inequality.

Therefore, frac{(frac{3}{lambda} x_1 + frac{lambda - 1}{lambda} x_2)^2}{4} + frac{(frac{3}{lambda} y_1 + frac{lambda - 1}{lambda} y_2)^2}{3} = 1, Which simplifies to frac{9}{lambda^2}(frac{x_1^2}{4} + frac{y_1^2}{3}) + (frac{lambda - 1}{lambda})^2(frac{x_2^2}{4} + frac{y_2^2}{3}) - frac{6(lambda - 1)}{lambda^2}(frac{x_1x_2}{4} + frac{y_1y_2}{3}) = 1, Since A, B are on ellipse C, Then frac{x_1^2}{4} + frac{y_1^2}{3} = 1, frac{x_2^2}{4} + frac{y_2^2}{3} = 1. Since the product of the slopes of lines OA, OB is - frac{3}{4}, Then frac{y_1}{x_1} cdot frac{y_2}{x_2} = - frac{3}{4}, which implies frac{x_1x_2}{4} + frac{y_1y_2}{3} = 0. Therefore, frac{9}{lambda^2} + (frac{lambda - 1}{lambda})^2 = 1, solving this gives lambda = 5. Therefore, frac{|BP|}{|BQ|} = |lambda| = 5.

The equation representing this situation is: [ H + 17 = 70 ] To find the relationship between ( H ) and the number of cows We the People has, we need to solve for ( H ): [ H = 70 - 17 ] [ H = 53 ] So, Happy Good Healthy Family has 53 cows.

This symmetry ensures that: - The intersections of (AD), (BE), and (CF) must be a central common point due to their pairs of vertices' symmetry about the center. 6. **Concluding the Proof:** Given that (AD) and (BE) intersect at the center, the third diagonal (CF) must also pass through this same intersection point considering the hexagonal and circular symmetries. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The diagonals } AD, BE, text{ and } CF text{ intersect at a single point.}} ]"},{"instruction":"During this winter vacation, 5 students made donations to show their love.

Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.","output":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the properties of an equilateral triangle and how they relate to the question. 1. **Drawing an Altitude**: When we draw an altitude in an equilateral triangle, it divides the triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles. This is because the equilateral triangle has all angles equal to 60 degrees, and by drawing an altitude, we create a right angle with the base, thus splitting the 60-degree angle into two 30-degree angles. 2. **Determining the Altitude's Length**: In a 30-60-90 triangle, the lengths of the sides are in the ratio 1:sqrt{3}:2. The hypotenuse (which is a side of the equilateral triangle) is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg (the altitude in our case) is sqrt{3} times the length of the shorter leg. Therefore, the altitude's length is sqrt{3}/2 times the length of the hypotenuse (side of the equilateral triangle). For our triangle with side length 8 units, the altitude's length is 8(sqrt{3}/2) = 4sqrt{3} units. 3. **Calculating the Area**: The area of a triangle is given by the formula frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. Here, the base is the side of the equilateral triangle (8 units), and the height is the altitude we found (4sqrt{3} units). Thus, the area is frac{1}{2} times 8 times 4sqrt{3} = 16sqrt{3} square units. 4. **Calculating the Perimeter**: The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is simply three times the length of one side. For a side length of 8 units, the perimeter is 3 times 8 = 24 units. 5. **Finding the Ratio of Area to Perimeter**: Finally, we find the ratio of the area to the perimeter by dividing the area by the perimeter. This gives us frac{16sqrt{3}}{24}. Simplifying this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 8, we get frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}. Therefore, the ratio of the area to the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is boxed{frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}}."},{"instruction":"Given ( x, y, z geqslant 0 ) and ( x + y + z = 1 ), prove that ( 0 leqslant xy + yz + xz 2xyz leqslant frac{7}{27} ).","output":"# Problem: 设 (x, y, z geqslant 0)，且 (x + y + z = 1)，求证： [0 leqslant xy + yz + xz - 2xyz leqslant frac{7}{27}.] 证法一 (Proof One): 1.

This means that 282 can be expressed as: 282 = kx + 3 (for some integer k) 282 = 9m + 3 (for some integer m) Since 282 leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 9, we can find m by subtracting 3 from 282 and then dividing by 9: 282 - 3 = 279 279 / 9 = 31 So, m = 31 and the number that is divisible by 9 is 279. Now, we need to find the value of x that satisfies the equation 282 = kx + 3. Since we know that 279 is divisible by 9, we can start by checking if 279 is also divisible by x. If it is, then x would be a factor of 279. The factors of 279 are 1, 3, 9, 31, 93, and 279.

We can also eliminate 9 because we already know that 9 is a divisor that leaves a remainder of 3. This leaves us with the factors 31, 93, and 279. Since we are looking for the least number that satisfies the condition, we should check the smallest factor first, which is 31. Let's check if 282 is divisible by 31 with a remainder of 3: 282 - 3 = 279 279 / 31 = 9 (which is an integer) Therefore, the first divisor x is boxed{31} ."},{"instruction":"Evaluate lfloor{sqrt{20}}rfloor^2.","output":"1.

The time it takes Jill to run up the hill is the distance divided by her speed going up, which is ( frac{900}{v} ) seconds. The time it takes Jill to run down the hill is the distance divided by her speed going down, which is ( frac{900}{12} ) seconds. The total time for both up and down the hill is given as 175 seconds.

Let A be the point where the disks are tangent, C be the center of the smaller disk, and E be the center of the larger disk. While the larger disk remains fixed, the smaller disk is allowed to roll along the outside of the larger disk until the smaller disk has turned through an angle of 360^circ. That is, if the center of the smaller disk has moved to the point D, and the point on the smaller disk that began at A has now moved to point B, then overline{AC} is parallel to overline{BD}. Then sin^2(angle BEA)=tfrac{m}{n}, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m+n.","output":"1. **Identify the Geometry and Setup**: We have two disks, one with radius 1 (smaller) and the other with radius 5 (larger), tangent at point A. The centers of the smaller and larger disks are C and E, respectively. The smaller disk rolls around the larger disk until it completes a full rotation, and we denote the new position of the center of the smaller disk as D. 2. **Understanding the Movement**: As the smaller disk rolls without slipping, the point A on the smaller disk moves to a new point B on the smaller disk such that overline{AC} is parallel to overline{BD}. The smaller disk rolls along the circumference of the larger disk. 3. **Arc Length Calculation**: The smaller disk rolls through an angle of 360^circ, which corresponds to a full rotation. The arc length covered by the center C of the smaller disk on the larger disk is the circumference of the larger disk, which is 2pi times 5 = 10pi. 4. **Angle Calculation**: The angle alpha subtended by the arc at the center E of the larger disk that corresponds to the movement of the smaller disk is given by the arc length divided by the radius of the larger disk, i.e., alpha = frac{10pi}{5} = 2pi. This confirms that the smaller disk rolls exactly once around the larger disk. 5. **Position of B and D**: Since the smaller disk has rolled a full 360^circ, the point B is directly opposite A on the smaller disk, and D is directly opposite C on the path traced by C. 6. **Calculating sin^2(angle BEA)**: - The triangle triangle BEA is formed by the radius of the larger disk (BE = 5) and the distance from E to A (which is also the radius of the larger disk, EA = 5). - Since overline{AC} parallel overline{BD} and AC = BD = 1, the distance from B to the line through E and A is 1. Thus, B is 1 unit away from A along the tangent to the larger circle at A. - The angle angle BEA is then calculated using the right triangle formed by BE, EA, and the perpendicular from B to EA. Since B is 1 unit away from A and both BE and EA are 5, the angle angle BEA is sin^{-1}left(frac{1}{5}right). 7. **Final Calculation**: - sin^2(angle BEA) = left(sinleft(sin^{-1}left(frac{1}{5}right)right)right)^2 = left(frac{1}{5}right)^2 = frac{1}{25}. - Therefore, m = 1 and n = 25, and m+n = 1 + 25 = boxed{26}."},{"instruction":"f the equation 8x k = 2(x + 1) and the equation 2(2x 3) = 1 3x have the same solution, find the value of k.","output":"Solve the first equation to get: x = frac{k + 2}{6} quad (1) Solve the second equation to get: x = 1 quad (2) Combining (1) and (2), we get: k = 4 Therefore, the value of k is boxed{4}."},{"instruction":"Prove that lim_{n rightarrow infty} a_n = a where a_n = frac{23 4n}{2 n} and a = 4.","output":"We begin by considering the sequence (a_n): [a_n = frac{23-4n}{2-n}] and the claim that [lim_{n to infty} a_n = 4.] According to the definition of the limit of a sequence, [ forall varepsilon > 0, exists N(varepsilon) in mathbb{N} text{ such that } forall n ge N(varepsilon), left|a_n - 4right| < varepsilon. ] Thus, the given claim can be translated into the inequality [ left|frac{23-4n}{2-n} - 4right| < varepsilon. ] We now proceed by simplifying and solving this inequality. 1. **Simplify the Absolute Difference**: [ left|frac{23-4n}{2-n} - 4right| < varepsilon ] Let's combine the fractions inside the absolute value: [ left|frac{23-4n - 4(2-n)}{2-n}right| < varepsilon ] Distribute and simplify inside the numerator: [ left|frac{23 - 4n - 8 + 4n}{2-n}right| < varepsilon ] Combine like terms: [ left|frac{15}{2-n}right| < varepsilon ] 2. **Invert and Adjust the Position of the Absolute Value**: Since (n) is large (approaching infinity), we consider the term (left|frac{15}{2-n}right|) which inversely depends on (n). For large (n), (n-2) is positive, so we can drop the absolute value for this specific transformation: [ left|frac{15}{n-2}right| < varepsilon ] which simplifies to: [ frac{15}{n-2} < varepsilon ] 3. **Solve for (n)**: Multiply both sides by ((n - 2)): [ 15 < varepsilon (n-2) ] Rearrange to solve for (n): [ n - 2 > frac{15}{varepsilon} ] Add 2 to both sides: [ n > frac{15}{varepsilon} + 2 ] From this inequality, we can see that for any (varepsilon > 0), if (n) is greater than (frac{15}{varepsilon} + 2), the absolute difference (left|frac{23-4n}{2-n} - 4right|) will be less than (varepsilon). 4. **Define (N(varepsilon))**: To ensure (n) is a natural number, we choose: [ N(varepsilon) = leftlceil frac{15}{varepsilon} + 2 rightrceil = leftlfloor frac{15}{varepsilon} rightrfloor + 3 ] # Conclusion: Thus, [ lim_{n to infty} a_n = 4 ] and the function (N(varepsilon)) can be given by [ N(varepsilon) = leftlfloor frac{15}{varepsilon} rightrfloor + 3. ] Hence, we conclude: [boxed{lim_{n to infty} a_n = 4}.]"},{"instruction":"Amy has some balloons. 29 of them are red, 17 are green, and the rest are blue.

This is because the differences ( n+2 - n = 2 ), ( n+3 - n = 3 ), ( n+5 - n = 5 ), and ( n+7 - n = 7 ) are all prime numbers. 3. **Considering n+1:** If ( n+1 notin S ), then the numbers ( n+1, n+2, n+3, n+5, n+7 ) are not in S. However, it is possible to include ( n+4 ) or ( n+6 ) in ( S ), but not both, since ( n+6 - n+4 = 2 ) is prime. Therefore, within a block of 8 consecutive numbers ( {n, n+1, ..., n+7} ), S can contain at most 2 elements. If ( n+1 in S ), then neither ( n+4 ) nor ( n+6 ) can be in ( S ), since ( n+1 )'s position affects the feasibility similar to before: [ n+1 + 3 = n+4 quad text{and} quad n+1 + 5 = n+6 ] Hence, within the 8-number block, there will again be at most 2 elements from ( S ): ( n ) and ( n+1 ). 4. **Dividing into Groups:** We divide the set ( {1, 2, ..., 200} ) into 25 groups of 8 consecutive numbers each: [ {1,...,8}, {9,...,16}, ldots, {193,...,200} ] In each group, we established that there can be no more than 2 elements from ( S ). Thus, the maximum number of elements in S, when considering all 25 groups, is: [ 2 times 25 = 50 ] 5. **Constructing a Joli Set of 50 Elements:** Next, we show that it is possible to construct a joli set of 50 elements. We choose pairs in each block of 8 consecutive numbers. A suitable strategy is to take pairs like ( (n, n+4) ): [ {1, 5}, {9, 13}, ldots, {193, 197} ] This ensures that we pick 2 elements per block, and within a block the differences ( | (4k+1) - (4l+1) | = 4(k-l) ) are multiples of 4, hence non-prime differences. 6. **Verification:** Let us consider the form (4k + 1) for ( 0 leq k leq 49 ). The maximum value would be: [ 4 times 49 + 1 = 197 ] Since the difference between any two values, (4(k-l)), is divisible by 4 and thus not prime, S remains joli. Thus, we conclude that the maximum number of elements in a joli set S within ( {1, 2, ..., 200} ), ensured by the above strategy is: boxed{50}."},{"instruction":"The speed of a boat in still water is unknown and the rate of current is 3 km/hr.

We are given that the boat travels 33 km downstream in 44 minutes. To work with consistent units, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours.

We now have a permutation on the set ({1, 2, ldots, 102}). 2. **Cycle decomposition**: The permutation decomposes into disjoint cycles. In such a cycle, the position (k) must be a divisor of (a_k), and the smallest number must be in a position larger than itself. 3. **Divisors of 102**: Among the numbers (2, 3, ldots, 102), identify the divisors of 102: ({1, 2, 3, 6, 17, 34, 51, 102}). 4. **Forming cycles**: The problem condition implies that the smallest number in a non-trivial cycle (a cycle containing more than one number) can only be 1.

We need to show that the equation: [ U^2 - (4sn+6)UV + V^2 + 4n = 0 quad (clubsuit) ] has no solutions in (mathbb{N}). 5. **Proof by Contradiction:** - Assume ((U_1, V_1)) is the minimal positive integer solution to ((clubsuit)). - By Vieta's relations, the second root (U_2) satisfies: [ U_1 + U_2 = V_1(4sn+6) ] [ U_1U_2 = V_1^2 + 4n ] - Since (U_1, U_2 geq V_1), we have: [ U_1 + U_2 geq 2V_1 + 4n ] - Also, (U_1U_2 > V_1(U_1 + U_2 - V_1)). 6. **Bounding and Contradiction:** - By Lemma 2 and Lemma 3: [ V_1^2 + 4n = U_1U_2 > V_1(U_1 + U_2 - V_1) geq V_1(V_1 + 4n) = V_1^2 + 4n ] - This is a contradiction, hence no such ((x, y)) exists.

First, we need to determine the total number of people Nelly is buying pizza for, including herself and her 14 friends. This gives us a total of 1 + 14 = 15 people. 2. Since each pizza can feed 3 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can feed to find out how many pizzas Nelly needs to buy. This calculation is as follows: [ frac{15 text{ people}}{3 text{ people per pizza}} = 5 text{ pizzas} ] 3. Next, we calculate the total cost of the pizzas. Each pizza costs 12, so for 5 pizzas, the total cost is: [ 5 text{ pizzas} times 12 text{ per pizza} = 60 ] 4. Finally, we need to find out how many nights Nelly has to babysit to afford the 60 worth of pizza.

The distance from the center to a focus is given by c, and these quantities satisfy the equation c^2 = |a^2 - b^2|. Given the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{k} = 1 and the focus (0, sqrt{2}), we can see that: - The major axis is parallel to the y-axis, which implies that b^2 = k. - The center of the ellipse is at the origin (0,0) since the equation is in standard form. - Since the focus is on the y-axis, we have a^2 < b^2, and hence c^2 = b^2 - a^2. Given that one focus is (0, sqrt{2}), the distance from the center to this focus is sqrt{2}. Therefore, we have c = sqrt{2}. Now, we write the relationship between a^2, b^2, and c^2 as: c^2 = b^2 - a^2 Substituting c = sqrt{2} and b^2 = k, we get: (sqrt{2})^2 = k - a^2 Solving this equation for k: 2 = k - a^2 k = a^2 + 2 Since the ellipse has a focus at (0, sqrt{2}), and it lies on the ellipse, substituting x = 0 and y = sqrt{2} into the original ellipse equation gives: frac{0^2}{a^2} + frac{(sqrt{2})^2}{k} = 1 frac{2}{k} = 1 From this, we find: boxed{k = 2}"},{"instruction":"What is the average of the first some multiples of 8 if the average is 88?","output":"Let's denote the number of multiples of 8 as n.

How many knights were among these 15 people, given that all the residents are of different heights?","output":"1. **Understanding the problem and given conditions**: - We have a line of 15 people on the \\"Island of Truth and Lies\\". - There are two types of people: knights (who always tell the truth) and liars (who always lie). - The tallest person stands in position 1, and the shortest in position 15. - Each person makes one of two statements: - \\"There is a liar below me.\\" - \\"There is a knight above me.\\" - Positions 4 to 8 say, \\"There is a liar below me.\\" - All others say, \\"There is a knight above me.\\" 2. **Analyzing the statements**: - A knight saying, \\"There is a knight above me\\" must be true, so there is at least one knight above. - A knight saying, \\"There is a liar below me\\" must be true, so there is at least one liar below. - A liar saying, \\"There is a knight above me\\" must be false, so there are no knights above. - A liar saying, \\"There is a liar below me\\" must be false, so there are no liars below. 3. **Considering the highest possible positions for specific roles**: - The tallest person (position 1) can either be a knight or a liar. To check for contradictions, start by considering that the tallest person is a liar. 4. **Assumption 1: The tallest person (position 1) is a liar**: - If the tallest is a liar, then the statement \\"There is a knight above me\\" would be false, which is not possible since he is in the highest position. - Hence, the tallest person must be a knight. - Similarly, the statements for positions 2 and 3 must be the same; they must all be liars. If not, a contradiction would arise. 5. **Continuing from this deduction: Position is Liar from places 1 to 3**: - The highest \\"knight\\" would be in positions 4 to 8, according to the player statements. 6. **Analyzing specific intervals**: - The people speaking from positions 4 to 8 say, \\"There is a liar below me.\\" If a knight says this, it must be truthful. - All people in positions 4 to 8 must have at least one liar below them. Further places follow. - Thus continuing the positions 4 to 8 as knights fulfilling the current statement. - Similarly considering the role above lines positions places from 9 to 15 must be all knights without contradictions. 7. **Summarizing the total count of knights**: - Total knights arise positions 1 from starting place, and further 9 to the final 15th position fulfilling existing detailed alignment. - Remaining liars are considered fulfilling the places covering 3 lowest ranks as inferred earlier or completing further placement. # Conclusion: The final distribution of knights: - Positions 1: Knight - Positions 4 to 8: Knights. - Positions 9 to 15: Knights Total sum ensuring 11 knights representing contained order correctly without contradictions.

For instance, if I cut along the edges shown by the bold lines in the diagram and along the invisible edge indicated by a dashed line, I will get unfolding A. By cutting the box differently, one can obtain unfolding B or C. It is easy to see that unfolding D is simply a flipped version of unfolding C, so we consider these two unfoldings to be identical. How many distinct unfoldings can be obtained in this way?","output":"We are given a closed cardboard box in the shape of a cube. By cutting along 7 out of its 12 edges, we can unfold the box into a net (the flat layout of the surfaces of the cube). Let's determine the number of distinct possible unfoldings or nets. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** Cutting 7 edges of a cube allows us to unfold it into a planar figure. Each unfoldable net must include exactly 7 cuts and should correspond to the unfolding of 6 square faces of the cube into one connected piece. 2. **Visualizing the Nets:** Some of the nets are demonstrated in the image provided in the problem. Considering the symmetry and different ways we can unfold a cube while ensuring that different nets that are rotations or reflections of each other are considered identical. 3. **Counting all Unfoldings:** There are known results in combinatorial geometry related to cube unfolding. Specifically, the number of distinct unfoldings of a cube is a well-documented result in geometric dissection problems. Based on the combinatorial counting and avoiding symmetrical duplications (rotations and reflections of nets), we have: [ text{Number of distinct nets} = 11 ] 4. **Considering Orientation (if required):** If orientation matters, for instance, if the box's outer and inner faces have different colors or textures and we need to distinguish the result based on the face orientation, the number of distinct unfoldings increases. For consistency of the problem, we would consider the situation where the outer side of the box is different (say colored), and we must place the nets with the colored side up. This effectively doubles the number of distinguishable unfoldings. Thus, if orientation of inside and outside faces matters, we would have: [ text{Number of distinct oriented nets} = 20 ] # Conclusion: There are a total of 11 different possible ways to unfold the cardboard cube if we don't distinguish between mirror images of the nets. If we consider distinguishing based on orientation, there would be 20 distinct nets.

A variable line (g) through the vertex (A) intersects the rays (BC) and (DC) at the points (X) and (Y), respectively. Let (K) and (L) be the (A)-excenters of the triangles (ABX) and (ADY), respectively. We need to show that the angle (measuredangle KCL) is independent of the line (g). 2. **Identify the external angle bisectors:** Let (ell_b) and (ell_d) denote the external bisectors of (measuredangle ABC) and (measuredangle ADC), respectively. These bisectors are important because the excenters (K) and (L) lie on these lines. 3. **Consider the pencil of lines through (A):** Consider the pencil of lines (ell) through (A). As the line (g) varies, the points (X) and (Y) move along the rays (BC) and (DC), respectively. Consequently, the excenters (K) and (L) move along the lines (ell_b) and (ell_d), respectively. 4. **Angle between excenters:** The angle (measuredangle KAL) is given by (frac{1}{2} measuredangle DAB). This is because the excenters (K) and (L) are defined by the external angle bisectors, and the angle between these bisectors is half the angle of the original angle at (A). 5. **Define the transformations:** Let (Gamma: ell_b mapsto ell_d) be the composition of a rotation about (A) with angle (frac{1}{2} measuredangle DAB) followed by a projection through (A). Similarly, let (Phi: ell_b mapsto ell_d) be the composition of a rotation about (C) with angle (180^circ - frac{1}{2} measuredangle DAB) followed by a projection through (C). 6. **Projective maps:** Both (Gamma) and (Phi) provide a one-to-one projective map from (ell_b) to (ell_d). To show that (Gamma = Phi), it suffices to check this for three specific lines through (A). 7. **Check specific lines:** Consider the cases when the line (ell) coincides with (overline{AB}), (overline{AC}), and (overline{AD}). In each of these cases, the transformations (Gamma) and (Phi) map the points on (ell_b) to the corresponding points on (ell_d) in the same manner. 8. **Conclusion:** Since (Gamma) and (Phi) agree on these three specific lines, they must be the same transformation. Therefore, the angle (measuredangle KCL) is independent of the line (g).

Initially, the ferry company provides flight paths between some pairs of islands such that the city cannot be split into two parts with no connections between them. Let's select two islands connected directly by a flight path, call them ( A ) and ( B ). Define two sets, ( mathscr{A} ) and ( mathscr{B} ), such that island ( A in mathscr{A} ) and island ( B in mathscr{B} ). 2. **Breaking the Connection:** Suppose there is another island ( C ) that has a flight path either to ( A ) or ( B ). Without loss of generality, assume island ( C ) is connected to ( A ). Include ( C ) into ( mathscr{B} ). 3. **Network Configuration:** Every island in set ( mathscr{A} ) has a direct flight path to every island in set ( mathscr{B} ). This means the sets ( mathscr{A} ) and ( mathscr{B} ) form a \\"network\\" or a complete bipartite graph ( K_{|mathscr{A}|, |mathscr{B}|} ). 4. **Expanding the Networks through Years:** If islands ( A ) and ( B ) have their connection removed, the ferry company establishes a new flight path to maintain the service such that both the connections to ( A ) and ( B ) are preserved. Define the new sets after disconnection as follows: [ mathscr{A}' = { A, B } mathscr{B}' = (mathscr{B} cup mathscr{B}) - { A, B } ] This implies that every island in ( mathscr{B}' ) maintains connections not only with ( mathscr{A}' ) but with any possible disconnections from ( mathscr{B} ). 5. **Ensuring All Islands are Connected:** For any arbitrary island ( C in mathscr{A} - {A} ), it must be connected to an island ( B in mathscr{A}' ). If the direct connection between ( C ) and ( A ) was not established before, it will be so after the disconnection between ( A ) and ( B ). Thus, every island in ( mathscr{A} ) and ( B ) are inter-connected, and similarly for islands in ( mathscr{B} ). 6. **Incrementing Elements in Sets:** With the defined expansions of ( mathscr{A} ) and ( mathscr{B} ), the connection status between islands is maintained such that the number of elements including all islands will eventually include all ( n ) islands. Therefore, the sets ( mathscr{A} cup mathscr{B} ) will respectively expand to cover every island. 7. **Final Network Condition:** At a certain point, if a flight path between ( A in mathscr{C} ) and ( B in mathscr{B} ) is closed, all islands must continuously be re-configured to maintain direct paths ensuring every island ( B ) remains connected.

This scenario is a classic combinatorial problem where we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of 4 items.

Step 1: Show that the triangle alpha beta gamma is similar to the pedal triangle of (ABC). 1. Consider the cyclic quadrilateral formed by points (A, B_1, B, C). Since it is cyclic, the opposite angles are supplementary: angle C_1CB_1 = 180^circ - angle A quad text{and} quad angle CB_1B = 180^circ - angle A 2. Consequently, angle alpha CB_1 = angle A quad text{and} quad angle alpha B_1C = angle A 3. Therefore, we have: angle Calpha B_1 = 180^circ - 2angle A 4. Similarly, we can analyze triangles involving the other vertices to find: angle C_1 beta A = 180^circ - 2angle B quad text{and} quad angle A_1 gamma B = 180^circ - 2angle C 5. Since these are the same as the angles of the pedal triangle of (ABC), the triangle alpha beta gamma is similar to the pedal triangle of (ABC). Step 2: Prove that (O) is the circumcenter of alpha beta gamma. 6. We need to show that the perpendiculars from (O) to the sides of alpha beta gamma are equal. 7. Considering that lines overline{AA_1}, overline{BB_1}, overline{CC_1} are equal chords of the circle with center (O), 8. Perpendicular distances from (O) to these chords are the same, implying (O) is the circumcenter: Oalpha' = Obeta' = Ogamma' Step 3: Find the conditions under which alpha beta gamma is maximal. 9. The inscribed circle of the triangle alpha beta gamma will be maximal when it matches the circle with center (O). 10. This leads to the condition where the inscribed circle’s radius equals the radius of the original circle centered at (O). 11. Therefore, this implies that alpha beta gamma sides are tangential to the circle centered at (O. 12. For this to occur, points (A) and (A_1, B) and (B_1, C) and (C_1) must coincide. Thus, alpha beta gamma is maximal when (ABC) and (A_1B_1C_1) coincide. Step 4: Proof that triangle alpha_1 beta_1 gamma_1 is similar to ABC. 13.

Inserting the coefficients from our problem: [ a = k, ; b = 16, ; c = k ] we get: [ Delta = 16^2 - 4(k)(k) = 256 - 4k^2 ] For Delta to be a perfect square (and hence the solutions to be rational), 256 - 4k^2 should be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by m^2. Thus, [ 256 - 4k^2 = m^2 ] This can be rearranged to: [ 4k^2 + m^2 = 256 ] [ k^2 + frac{m^2}{4} = 64 ] This equation tells us k^2 must be such that frac{m^2}{4} is also a perfect square, and when added to k^2, the result is 64.

Here, the side CK (distance we are trying to find) is opposite the 30^circ angle, and the hypotenuse is AC = 37. Using the properties of this special triangle: [ CK = frac{1}{2}AC ] 4. **Substitute the Known Length:** [ CK = frac{1}{2} times 37 = 18.5 ] Thus, the distance from vertex C to the line AB is [ boxed{18.5} ]"},{"instruction":"Determine all values of k for which the absolute value of the sum of the solutions of the quadratic equation [3x^2 + 5x + k = 0] equals the sum of the squares of these solutions.","output":"Let r and s be the roots of (3x^2 + 5x + k = 0).

We need to find integers ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) such that the equation ( a x + b y = c ) has the unique solution ( x = m ) and ( y = n ). 2. **Select ( a ) and ( b )**: Choose ( a ) and ( b ) to be distinct prime numbers larger than ( m + n ). This ensures that ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime, i.e., ( gcd(a, b) = 1 ). 3. **Define ( c )**: Set ( c = a m + b n ). This ensures that ( (x, y) = (m, n) ) is a solution to the equation ( a x + b y = c ). 4. **Uniqueness Proof**: To show that this solution is unique, assume that there exists another pair of positive integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( a x + b y = c ). Then, [ a x + b y = a m + b n ] Rearranging, we get: [ a(x - m) = b(n - y) ] 5. **Divisibility and Bound Analysis**: Since ( a ) and ( b ) are primes and ( gcd(a, b) = 1 ), ( a ) must divide ( n - y ), i.e., ( a mid (n - y) ). However, since ( a > n ), it follows that ( n - y < a ). Therefore, the only integer value ( n - y ) can take is ( 0 ) (since ( a ) cannot divide a number larger than or equal to itself if it's smaller than ( a )). Hence, ( n - y = 0 ), which implies: [ y = n ] 6. **Final Verification**: Substitute ( y = n ) back into the original equation: [ a x + b n = a m + b n ] Simplifying, we obtain: [ a x = a m implies x = m ] Therefore, the only solution is ( x = m ) and ( y = n ).

Consequently, we can assume the second player has an additional advantage: they can interchange any rows or columns as they wish. 3. **Second Player's Strategy**: - After the first move by the first player, the second player rearranges the rows and columns such that the first checker's position is in the middle vertical column but not necessarily in the middle of the board. This rearrangement does not change the essential properties of the game. 4. **Maintaining Symmetry**: - The second player then proceeds to make moves symmetrically relative to the center of the board considering only middle vertical alignment. - Specifically, if the first checker on the middle column is at (r,c), the second player ensures their first checker mirrors this placement symmetrically considering (65-r+1, c). This way, both checkers occupy the same vertical layout but different horizontal lines. - The logic is that each subsequent move by the first player can be mirrored in the opposite half of the board symmetrically. For each non-middle horizontal placement by the first player, make sure these alignments respect the restriction of a maximum of two checkers per column and row. 5. **Central Position and Movement**: - It's crucial to make sure the central position of each horizontal segment does not overshadow the strategic movement to leverage symmetry. If the first player places a checker in a row, the second player mirrors this placement but in a different column. This ensures no violation of the symmetry ensures two checkers per column is maintained. 6. **Verification of Symmetric Moves**: - Any move the first player makes, symmetry ensures the second player always has a valid placement in their mirrored counterpart without invalid moves. - The strategy is consistent for all moves till either the entire horizontal or vertical cannot be mirrored which means the first player will run out of space before the second player provided they did not make optimal moves based on described mirrored playing. **Conclusion**: - If both players play optimally, the second player always ensures the symmetry maintains to exhaust the first player's meaningful moves first. Hence, the second player can always guarantee a win based on the outlined strategic placement game on a 65 times 65 board configuration. boxed{text{Second Player Wins}}"},{"instruction":"Given a triangle ABC with internal angles A, B, C and opposite sides a, b, c respectively, it's known that (a+b)(sin Asin B)=(cbsin A)sin C.

After rearrangement, we obtain: a^2 = b^2sin^2 A + c^2sin^2 C. Since A + B + C = pi, we can substitute sin^2 C with 1 - sin^2 A - sin^2 B. Therefore, the equation becomes: a^2 = b^2sin^2 A + c^2(1 - sin^2 A - sin^2 B). Simplifying, we get: a^2=b^2+c^2-bcsin A. We also know the Law of Cosines: a^2=b^2+c^2-2bccos A.

The height also divides the angle opposite the base into a ratio of (2:1).  Let's break down the process step by step. 1. **Setting Up the Problem:**    We have a triangle (ABC) with height (AD = 2 , text{cm}) dividing the base (BC). The point (D) on (BC) divides (BC) into segments (BD) and (DC) such that (BD = 1 , text{cm}) and (DC) is unknown. The height (AD) splits the angle (angle BAC) in a (2:1) ratio. 2. **Using the Angle Bisector Proportion:**    Let (BD = 1 , text{cm}) and (DC = x , text{cm}). The height splits (angle BAC) into two equal segments, each being (angle BAD) and (angle CAD). Let's denote (B) and (C) with coordinates based on a Cartesian system where the orthocenter (A) has coordinates ((0,2)), and base points (B) and (C) lie on the (x)-axis.    According to the Angle Bisector Theorem:    [    frac{BC}{BD} = frac{BD + x}{BD}    ]    Since (AD) splits the angle (angle BAC) into the ratio (2:1), we know:    [    angle ABD: angle DBC = 2:1    ] 3. **Relating the lengths using the theorem:**    Let (BD = 1 , text{cm}), and we have:    [    AD = DK = 1 , text{cm}    ]    According to the triangle proportion given:    [    frac{AD}{DK} = frac{BD}{DC}    ]    And:    [    frac{1}{x} = frac{2}{sqrt{BD^2 + DC^2}}    ] 4. **Solving for (x):**    We know (DK = AD = 1) and (BC = x + 1):    [    2x = sqrt{4 + (x + 1)^2}    ]    Simplify the equation:    [    (2x)^2 = 4 + (x + 1)^2    ]    [    4x^2 = 4 + x^2 + 2x + 1    ]    [    4x^2 - x^2 - 2x - 5 = 0    ]    [    3x^2 - 2x - 5 = 0    ]    Solving the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula (x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}), where (a = 3), (b = -2), and (c = -5):    [    x = frac{-(-2) pm sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot (-5)}}{2 cdot 3}    ]    [    x = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 + 60}}{6}    ]    [    x = frac{2 pm sqrt{64}}{6}    ]    [    x = frac{2 pm 8}{6}    ]    Taking the positive root:    [    x = frac{10}{6} = frac{5}{3}    ] 5. **Finding the Area (S_{ABC}):**    The total base (BC) now becomes:    [    BC = BD + DC = 1 + frac{5}{3} = frac{8}{3} , text{cm}    ]    Using the area formula of the triangle:    [    S_{ABC} = frac{1}{2} cdot text{base} cdot text{height}    ]    [    S_{ABC} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{8}{3} cdot 2 = frac{8}{3} , text{cm}^2    ] Hence, the area of the triangle is: [ boxed{frac{8}{3}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the line  AB , let  M  be a point on it.

Losing positions are those where the number of matches left modulo 4 is exact. The sequence of positions will be like 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ... etc. Let’s outline the steps for the second player: 1. **First turn:**     - If the first player takes 1 match (24 left), the second player should take 3 (21 left).    - If the first player takes 2 matches (23 left), the second player should take 2 (21 left).    - If the first player takes 3 matches (22 left), the second player should take 1 (21 left). By ensuring the total number of matches taken in each round sums to 4, the second player always zones in on 4k + 1 positions.

An example of a single figure with checkerboard squares could be an L-shaped tetromino or any irregular polyomino lacking an axis of symmetry. 5. Now, let’s arrange these three identical figures.

Therefore, the change in y can be represented as -10(x - 8), leading to the equation: [ y = 200 - 10(x - 8) = -10x + 280 ] Thus, the functional relationship between y and x is: [ y = -10x + 280 quad text{for} quad 6 leqslant x leqslant 12 ]  Part 2: Selling Price for Daily Sales Profit of 720 Yuan To achieve a daily sales profit of 720 yuan, we use the profit formula w = (x - 6)y.

Show that for each integer ( r ), there exist (not necessarily distinct) numbers ( a, b, c, d in A ) such that [  ab  cd equiv r pmod{p}  ]","output":"Let ( p > 7 ) be a prime number, and let ( A ) be a subset of ( {0, 1, ldots, p-1} ) consisting of at least (frac{p-1}{2}) elements. We need to show that for each integer ( r ), there exist (not necessarily distinct) numbers ( a, b, c, d in A ) such that [ a cdot b - c cdot d equiv r pmod{p}. ] 1. **Defining the Set of Residues**:    Define ( P ) as the set of residues modulo ( p ) of possible products ( a cdot b ) for ( a, b in A ). Clearly, the set ( P ) consists of (|P| geq frac{p-1}{2}) distinct elements, since we get (|A|) different products by fixing an arbitrary non-zero ( a in A ) and iterating ( b ) through ( A ). 2. **Considering Size of ( P )**:    If ( |P| geq frac{p+1}{2} ), then the set ( r+P ) (where each element of ( P ) is incremented by ( r )) will also have (|r+P| geq frac{p+1}{2}) elements. Consequently, we would have:    [    |P| + |r+P| geq frac{p+1}{2} + frac{p+1}{2} = p + 1 > p.    ]    By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one common element in ( P ) and ( r+P ). Thus, there exist ( p_1 in P ) and ( p_2 in P ) such that ( p_1 equiv r + p_2 pmod{p} ), leading to ( p_1 - p_2 equiv r pmod{p} ). Hence, this provides a solution in the desired form. 3. **Considering ( |P| = frac{p-1}{2} )**:    Assume ( |P| = frac{p-1}{2} ). Without loss of generality, assume ( 1 in A ) by multiplying all elements of ( A ) by the same constant and reducing modulo ( p ). Since ( A subseteq P ), we then have ( A = P ). 4. **Analyzing Non-Zero Elements as a Group**:    Let ( A^{star} = A setminus {0} ). For a fixed ( 0 neq a in A ), all products ( ab ) (where ( b in A^{star} )) are distinct modulo ( p ), indicating that the non-zero elements of ( A ) form a group under multiplication modulo ( p ). 5. **Group Formation**:    As ( |A^{star}| = frac{p-1}{2} ), we consider the product of all elements in ( A^{star} ):    [    prod_{b in A^{star}} b equiv prod_{b in A^{star}} (ab) = a^{|A^{star}|} cdot prod_{b in A^{star}} b pmod{p}.    ]    This simplifies to ( a^{|A^{star}|} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). Given ( |A^{star}| = frac{p-1}{2} ), it follows ( a^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ), supporting ( a^{2} equiv 1 pmod{p} ) which implies ( a equiv pm 1 pmod{p} ). 6. **Identifying Quadratic Residues**:    Using the well-known fact that for every prime ( p ), there exists a primitive root ( q ) such that the residues modulo ( p ) of the powers ( q^1, q^2, ldots, q^{p-1} ) are precisely ( 1, 2, ldots, p-1 ), we deduce that ( A ) must be the set of quadratic residues modulo ( p ). 7. **Solving for Specific ( r )**:    Suppose ( r ) is odd; replace ( r ) by ( r + p ) if necessary. Set ( b = d = 1 in A ), and define:    [    a equiv left( frac{r + 1}{2} right)^2 pmod{p} quad text{and} quad c equiv left( frac{r - 1}{2} right)^2 pmod{p}.    ]    Since ( a, c in A ), we obtain:    [    a cdot d - b cdot c equiv a - c equiv left( frac{r+1}{2} right)^2 - left( frac{r-1}{2} right)^2 equiv r pmod{p}.    ] # Conclusion: Thus, for each integer ( r ), there exist numbers ( a, b, c, d in A ) such that ( a cdot b - c cdot d equiv r pmod{p} ).

To find out how much of the 80 kg is zinc, we need to find the total parts that make up Alloy A. Total parts in Alloy A = 3 (copper) + 5 (zinc) = 8 parts Now, we find out how much 1 part weighs: 1 part in Alloy A = 80 kg / 8 parts = 10 kg Since the zinc is 5 parts, the amount of zinc in Alloy A is: Zinc in Alloy A = 5 parts * 10 kg/part = 50 kg For Alloy B: The proportion of copper to zinc is 4:9, which means for every 4 parts of copper, there are 9 parts of zinc.

We are given a steel plate with dimensions (55 times 40) which is traced onto paper to form the rectangle (ABCD). We aim to locate the center of this rectangle. Here's the step-by-step process: 1. **Create Squares (ABEF) and (CDMK):**     - Use the steel plate to draw two squares. Assume square (ABEF) is drawn from point (A) such that (AE = AB = 55) and (BE = BF = 40).     - Similarly, create a square (CDMK) towards the direction of (D), ensuring each side aligns with the measures provided, forming sides of length 55 and 40 respectively. 2. **Form Rectangle (MKEF):**      - By extending the constructions, a new rectangle (MKEF) will be formed by connecting appropriately the points (M) and (K) from previously formed squares with sides aligned properly. 3. **Draw Diagonals for Rectangle (MKEF):**     - Within the newly formed rectangle (MKEF), use the plate again to draw diagonals (ME) and (KF). 4. **Intersection Point (O):**     - The point (O), where these diagonals intersect, will be the center of the rectangle (MKEF). Since (MKEF) has the same dimensions as (ABCD) and their diagonals bisect each other at the center, point (O) is not only the center for (MKEF) but also for the original rectangle (ABCD).  # Conclusion: The intersection of the diagonals of the rectangle (MKEF) identified previously as point (O) is also the center of the original rectangle (ABCD).

We need to prove that the given map is a fake. 2. **Analyzing the Cities and Roads**:    Let's denote the cities as (A, B, C, D, E, ) and (F). According to the given note, the number of visits to each city is as follows:    - (A): 50 times    - (B): 30 times    - (C): 20 times    - (D): 70 times    - (E): 60 times    - (F): 40 times 3. **Identifying the Triangular and Arch Cities**:    We need to verify that the spy's path is consistent with the triangular and arch city notation.

A group of 42 tourists visited the city, and each tourist took at most one photo of each of the three monuments. It was found that any two tourists together had photos of all three monuments. We need to find the minimum total number of photos taken by all the tourists. 2. **Notation and Setup:** Let's number the three monuments as (A), (B), and (C). Denote the number of photos taken of monument (A), (B), and (C) respectively by (f_A), (f_B), and (f_C). 3. **Analysis of Conditions:**    - If a tourist did not take a photo of monument (A), then they must have taken photos of monuments (B) and (C).    - Similarly, if a tourist did not take a photo of monument (B), they must have taken photos of monuments (A) and (C).    - And if a tourist did not take a photo of monument (C), they must have taken photos of monuments (A) and (B). 4. **Derivation of Minimum Photos:**    - Consider a monument, say (A). If any more than one tourist did not take a photo of (A), then the combined photos of this group would lack photos of monument (A). Hence, at most one tourist can skip taking a photo of (A).     - Therefore, if at most one tourist did not take a photo of each monument, then for each monument, there are at least (42 - 1 = 41) photos taken. Hence, (f_A, f_B, f_C geq 41). 5. **Total Minimum Photos Computation:**    - Summing up the minimum photos for all three monuments, we have:      [      f_A + f_B + f_C geq 41 + 41 + 41 = 123      ] 6. **Verification of the Minimum Count:**    - A scenario that achieves this minimum is as follows: Suppose 1 tourist took no photos at all, and the remaining 41 tourists each took a single photo of each of the three monuments. In this case, the total number of photos is:      [      3 times 41 = 123      ]    - In this scenario, every pair of tourists would still have photos covering all three monuments, satisfying the problem's condition.

Let ( P_1 ) be one of the vertices of the dodecagon, with the remaining vertices ( P_i ) placed sequentially in a counterclockwise manner. 2. **Exterior Circle and Calculation of Angle:**    Since the regular dodecagon has an external circumscribing circle, the angles formed by connecting the vertices with lines that intersect at certain points hold special properties.        Here, we need to confirm that the lines ( P_1 P_9 ), ( P_2 P_{11} ), and ( P_4 P_{12} ) intersect at a common point.  3. **Symmetry and Reference to a Square within the Dodecagon:**    The regular dodecagon has rotational symmetry and can be broken down into smaller components such as squares, due to the equal spacing of its vertices. 4. **Square within the Dodecagon (45° Angles):**    Given the regular dodecagon, consider the square formed by ( P_1 ), a point ( A ), another point ( B ), and ( P_{12} ) on the circumscribing circle where ( A ) and ( B ) are specific vertices to form the square based on symmetry.    Since the dodecagon can be divided into 8 regular triangles (each with central angles measuring 30° and side angles of 15° at the vertices), the internal angles formed from diagonals will be multiples of these smaller interior angles.

According to the problem, this new total number of sections is 16, so we have: S + 3 = 16 Solving for S, we get: S = 16 - 3 S = 13 So, originally there were 13 sections. Now, with the new students, the total number of students is: 24S + 24 = 24 * 13 + 24 = 312 + 24 = 336 Since there are now 16 sections, we divide the total number of students by the number of sections to find the number of students in each section: 336 students / 16 sections = 21 students per section Therefore, there are now boxed{21}  students in each section."},{"instruction":"The toll t, in dollars, for a truck using a certain bridge is given by the formula t = 1.50 + 1.50 (x  2), where x is the number of axles on the truck. What is the toll for an 18wheel truck that has 2 wheels on its front axle and 4 wheels on each of its other axles?","output":"First, we need to determine the number of axles on the 18-wheel truck. Since the truck has 2 wheels on its front axle and 4 wheels on each of its other axles, we can calculate the number of axles by dividing the total number of wheels by the number of wheels per axle. The truck has 18 wheels in total. We know that the front axle has 2 wheels, so we subtract those from the total to find out how many wheels are left for the other axles: 18 wheels - 2 wheels (front axle) = 16 wheels Now we have 16 wheels left, and since each of the other axles has 4 wheels, we divide the remaining wheels by 4 to find the number of these axles: 16 wheels / 4 wheels per axle = 4 axles So, we have 4 axles with 4 wheels each, plus the front axle with 2 wheels, which gives us a total of: 4 axles + 1 front axle = 5 axles Now we can use the formula t = 1.50 + 1.50 (x - 2) to calculate the toll for the truck, where x is the number of axles: t = 1.50 + 1.50 (5 - 2) t = 1.50 + 1.50 (3) t = 1.50 + 4.50 t = 6.00 The toll for the 18-wheel truck with 5 axles is boxed{6.00} ."},{"instruction":"A student's scores in 8 character tests are as follows: 72, 76, 78, 82, 86, 88, 92, 98.

By the end of his trip, John had exactly 600 less in his original currency than the total amount he spent on the trip, considering all expenses in USD. How much money does John still have in USD?","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. John starts with 1600. 2. He spends an unknown amount on the first day (let's call this amount X). 3. On the second day, he exchanges some of his remaining money to EUR at a rate of 1 USD = 0.85 EUR. 4. He spends 100 EUR on a guided tour and 50 EUR on souvenirs, which is a total of 150 EUR. 5. By the end of his trip, John has 600 less in USD than the total amount he spent on the trip. First, we need to convert the 150 EUR he spent on the second day back to USD to add it to his total expenses. Since 1 USD = 0.85 EUR, we can find out how much he spent in USD by dividing the EUR amount by the exchange rate: 150 EUR / 0.85 EUR/USD = 176.47 USD (rounded to two decimal places) Now, let's add this amount to the unknown amount he spent on the first day (X): Total spent in USD = X + 176.47 According to the problem, by the end of his trip, John has 600 less in USD than the total amount he spent on the trip. This means that the money he has left (let's call this Y) is equal to the total amount he spent minus 600: Y = (X + 176.47) - 600 We also know that John started with 1600, so the money he has left (Y) is also equal to the initial amount minus the total amount spent: Y = 1600 - (X + 176.47) Now we have two expressions for Y, which we can set equal to each other: (1600 - X - 176.47) = (X + 176.47) - 600 Solving for X: 1600 - X - 176.47 = X + 176.47 - 600 1600 - 176.47 + 600 = X + X + 176.47 2023.53 = 2X + 176.47 2023.53 - 176.47 = 2X 1847.06 = 2X X = 1847.06 / 2 X = 923.53 So, John spent 923.53 on the first day.

Since A is an angle in a triangle, its value lies within (0, pi). Therefore, we can find sin A using the Pythagorean identity:  sin A = sqrt{1 - cos^2 A} = frac {sqrt {3}}{3}  Now, since B=2A, we can find cos B using the double angle formula for cosine:  cos B = cos 2A = 2cos^2 A - 1 = frac {1}{3}  Again, since B is an angle in a triangle, its value lies within (0, pi).

This gives us 999 = 686 + (999 - 686) = 686 + 313. - For the next part, 313, the highest power of 7 is 7^2 = 49. The largest multiple of 49 that fits into 313 is 6 cdot 49 = 294, so we have 313 = 294 + (313 - 294) = 294 + 19. - Finally, 19 is best expressed in terms of 7^1 = 7. The largest multiple of 7 that fits into 19 is 2 cdot 7 = 14, giving the remainder 19 - 14 = 5.

Now, we can rewrite x+2y using the angle sum identity for sine, sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B: x + 2y =  sqrt{5} sin(alpha + theta). The maximum value of sin(alpha + theta) is 1 since the range of the sine function is [-1,1]. Therefore, the maximum value of x + 2y occurs when sin(alpha + theta) = 1. Thus, the maximum value of x + 2y is sqrt{5}. Hence, the final answer for the maximum value of x + 2y is boxed{sqrt{5}}."},{"instruction":"Given the number of ndigit positive integers in decimal such that any two adjacent digits (from left to right) do not contain the sequence 12, denoted by a_{n}: (1) Determine a_{n}.

In this scenario, the last digit can be any digit except 2, which gives us 9 choices.

Since the balls are arranged in a circle, ( pr-1 ) acts as a wrap-around difference. 3. **Analyzing Condition (2):**    - This condition implies a specific pattern in the numbering of the balls.

The symmetry implies that for any x, the sum of h(x) and f(x') equals 2 times frac{3a}{2}, where x' is the x-coordinate symmetric to x with respect to log_{2}3. Thus, x + x' = 2log_{2}3. 2. Therefore, h(x) + f(2log_{2}3 - x) = 3a. 3. Substituting f(x) = 2^{x}, we get h(x) = 3a - 2^{2log_{2}3 - x} = 3a - frac{9}{2^{x}}.

Since y = 2^{x} is an increasing function, we can use Vieta's formulas: {2}^{x_{1}} + {2}^{x_{2}} = 3a and {2}^{x_{1}} cdot {2}^{x_{2}} = 9. 4. Given |x_{1}-x_{2}|=2, and assuming x_{1} > x_{2}, we have x_{1} = x_{2} + 2. This implies {2}^{x_{1}-x_{2}} = 4, so {2}^{x_{1}} = 4 cdot {2}^{x_{2}}. 5. Substituting into the equation for the product of roots, we get {2}^{2+2x_{2}} = 9, solving for x_{2} yields x_{2} = log_{2}3 - 1. 6.

(Thus the bulldozer always moves parallel to the axes.) Prove that it is impossible for the bulldozer to hit both sides of every wall.","output":"Given: 1. A bulldozer starts at an arbitrary point and initially moves in the +x direction. 2. On hitting a wall, it turns at a right angle away from the wall and continues moving parallel to the axes. Key Definitions: - A wall v is **above** another wall w if some point on v is directly above a point on w. This relation is anti-symmetric since walls are disjoint. We aim to show that it is impossible for the bulldozer to hit both sides of every wall.  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Critical Claim:** There exists a **lowest** wall, i.e., a wall not above any other walls.     - **Proof by Contradiction:**       Assume the contrary, that there is no lowest wall. This implies every wall is above some other wall, potentially forming a directed cycle.              - Construct a series of points P_i and Q_i for i = 1, ldots, n (with indices taken modulo n) such that:          - Point Q_i is directly above P_{i+1} for each i.          - The segment overline{Q_i P_{i+1}} does not intersect any wall in its interior.          - Each segment overline{P_i Q_i} lies within a wall.                     This results in a broken line on 2n vertices which is not self-intersecting. 2. **Intersections and Contradiction:**          Consider the vertical segments overline{Q_i P_{i+1}} and overline{Q_j P_{j+1}}:         - Assume overline{Q_i P_{i+1}} is the leftmost vertical segment and overline{Q_j P_{j+1}} is the rightmost vertical segment.          - The broken line creates a path from P_{i+1} to Q_j and another path from P_{j+1} to Q_i.          - These paths must intersect since the broken line is constructed in the plane geometrically.     Since walls are disjoint and we assumed their segments do not intersect, the conclusion that these paths intersect is a **contradiction**. 3. **Implication of the Lowest Wall:**        - Since a lowest wall must exist (by the lack of a contradiction in step 1), the bulldozer:      - If it moves upwards indefinitely, will eventually hit event points on walls and miss the bottom side of the lowest wall.      - If it moves downwards indefinitely, will eventually miss all top sides of the walls it leaves behind. # Conclusion: Given the claim and consequent contradiction, it is impossible for the bulldozer to hit both sides of every wall. This shows the bulldozer’s trajectory ensures it can only hit sides of a subset of walls, never both sides of every wall.  [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"have five apples and ten oranges.

Then, the probability that Queen Guinevere receives at least 20 pearls is:    [    1 - mathrm{P}_3 = 1 - (p^3 + 2p^2(1-p)) = 1 - (p^2(2-p))    ] 3. **Sending four messengers with 10 pearls each:**    The probability that all four messengers are robbed is:    [    mathrm{P}_4 = p^4    ]    Plus the probability of one success among the first three messengers:    [    4p^3(1-p)    ]    Therefore, the probability that Queen Guinevere receives less than 20 pearls is:    [    mathrm{P}_4 = p^4 + 4p^3(1-p) = p^3(4-3p)    ]    So, the probability that at least one messenger with 10 pearls will succeed is:    [    1 - mathrm{P}_4 = 1 - (p^3(4-3p)) = 1 - p^3(4-3p)    ] Next, let's compare the probabilities of success in each scenario: 1. For two messengers, we divide the equation by ( p^2 ) and get:    [    f_2 = 1    ] 2. For three messengers:    [    f_3 = 2 - p    ] 3. For four messengers:    [    f_4 = 4 - 3p    ] Comparing ( f_2 = 1 ) and ( f_3 = 2 - p ): [ f_3 > f_2 quad text{for} quad 0 < p < 1 ] Therefore, ( f_2 < f_3 ) which means the three-messenger option is always better than the two-messenger option. Now compare ( f_2 = 1 ) and ( f_4 = 4p - 3p^2 ): [ f_4 > f_2 quad text{for} quad frac{1}{3} < p < 1 ] [ 3p^2 - 4p + 1 < 0 quad text{for} quad 0 < p < frac{1}{3} ] **Conclusion:** - For ( 0 < p < frac{1}{3} ), it is better to send four messengers with 10 pearls each. - For ( frac{1}{3} leq p < 1 ), it is better to send two messengers with 20 pearls each.

To analyze the behavior of f(x) on this interval, we transform the independent variable x in the sine function: [2x-frac{pi}{6}inleft[frac{2pi}{3}-frac{pi}{6}, pi-frac{pi}{6}right] = left[frac{pi}{2}, frac{5pi}{6}right].] Since the sine function, y=sin x, is monotonically decreasing on the interval [frac{pi}{2}, frac{5pi}{6}], it means that f(x) is also a decreasing function on [frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{2}].

Specifically, we need:     [     x + y > 11     ]     Since we are given (x leq y leq z) and (z = 11), this can be rewritten as:     [     x + y geq 12     ]     Furthermore, since (z = 11):     [     x leq y leq 11     ] 2. **Step 2:** Implementing the constraints into a coordinate system:     We can visualize this problem in a 2D coordinate system with (x) and (y) as coordinates. 3. **Step 3:** Determine the boundaries:     - The line (x + y = 12) is one boundary.     - The line (y = x) is another boundary due to the given condition (x leq y).     - The line (y = 11) forms the upper constraint for (y). 4. **Step 4:** Calculate the lattice points:     The area of interest is the region bounded by these three lines. We want to find the number of integer (lattice) points within this region, including the boundaries. 5. **Step 5:** Counting the number of possible pairs ((x, y)):     - Consider (x) from 1 to 11. For each value of (x), we need (y) to satisfy the inequalities (x leq y leq 11) and (x + y geq 12).     Let's count the number of pairs ((x, y)) for each (x):     - When (x = 1), we need (y geq 11) which gives (y=11).     - When (x = 2), we need (y geq 10), which gives (y = 10, 11).     - When (x = 3), we need (y geq 9), which gives (y = 9, 10, 11).     - Continue this pattern up to the case when (x = 10), we need (y geq 2), which gives (y = 2, 3, 4, ..., 11) (i.e., 10 values of (y)).     - When (x = 11), (y = 1 leq y leq 11) (no additional constraint).     Summarizing counts:     [     begin{aligned}     &x = 1, & text{valid } y = 1 &Rightarrow 1 text{ pairs}      &x = 2, & text{valid } y = 2 &Rightarrow 2 text{ pairs}      &x = 3, & text{valid } y = 3 &Rightarrow 3 text{ pairs}      &vdots      &x = 10, & text{valid } y = 10 &Rightarrow 10 text{ pairs}      &x = 11, & text{valid } y = 11 &Rightarrow 11 text{ pairs}      end{aligned}     ]     Summing these, we get:     [     1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 10 + 11 = frac{11 times 12}{2} = 66 text{ pairs}.     ] Therefore, the number of triangles with integer side lengths such that the maximum side length is 11 is: ( boxed{36} )"},{"instruction":"Given the vector overrightarrow{a}=(1,2,2), find the coordinates of the unit vector that is collinear with overrightarrow{a}.","output":"First, compute the magnitude of the vector overrightarrow{a}: |overrightarrow{a}| = sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + (-2)^2} = 3.

Therefore:     angle ABQ = angle QBC = frac{beta}{2}.  3. **Calculate angle BQM:**    As D is on AD, and AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC, it creates two equal angles:     angle BAD = angle CAD = frac{alpha}{2}.         Hence,     angle BQM = angle ABQ + angle BAQ = frac{alpha}{2} + frac{beta}{2}.  4. **Confirm angle QBM Calculation:**    BD is extended to touch the circumcircle at M.

Notice that since ( BD ) is the diameter of the circumcircle and angle ( angle BAD ) is an inscribed angle, according to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, ( angle BAD ) is a right angle because it subtends a semicircle. 2.

This setup demonstrates that having 7 equal-length diagonals is indeed possible. 2. **Proving 7 is the Maximum Number:**    - Suppose there are at least 8 equal-length diagonals in a certain convex hexagon ( ABCDEF ). There must be a combination of these diagonals such that, even if we exclude any one diagonal, the remaining 8 still have equal lengths.    - **Case I:** The diagonal is one of ( AC, BD, CE, DF, EA, FB ):      - Without loss of generality, assume the diagonal is ( AC ).      - Consequently, we have the equal length relations ( EC = EB = FB = FC ).      - Since ( ABCDEF ) is convex, both points ( B ) and ( C ) must lie on the perpendicular bisector of ( EF ). However, with the convexity condition, both ( B ) and ( C ) must be on the same side of line ( EF ). This would result in one of the points ( B ) or ( C ) being inside triangle ( CEF ), leading to a contradiction.    - **Case II:** The diagonal is one of ( AD, BE, CF ):      - Without loss of generality, assume the diagonal is ( AD ).      - Again, we have the equal length relations ( EC = EB = FB = FC ).      - Following the above reasoning, this leads to a contradiction under the convexity condition of the hexagon. 3. **Conclusion:**    - From the case analyses, we observe that having 8 or more equal-length diagonals results in contradictions due to geometric and convexity constraints. Thus, the maximum capacity is limited to 7 diagonals of equal lengths.

First, we express 6^{2023} in a form that makes it easier to understand its behavior modulo 7 (since there are 7 days in a week, and we are interested in the remainder when dividing by 7 to find the day of the week). We can rewrite 6 as 7 - 1, so: [6^{2023} = (7 - 1)^{2023}] Expanding this expression using the binomial theorem, we get: [(7 - 1)^{2023} = sum_{k=0}^{2023} binom{2023}{k} cdot 7^{2023-k} cdot (-1)^k] This expansion is a sum of terms, each of which is a product of a binomial coefficient, a power of 7, and a power of -1. The last term of this expansion is -1^{2023}, which simplifies to -1 because 2023 is odd.  Every term in this sum, except for the last one, is divisible by 7 because it includes a factor of 7^{2023-k} for k < 2023. The last term, -1, is not divisible by 7, so when we sum all the terms, the result modulo 7 is equivalent to -1 modulo 7.  However, since we are interested in the number of days past Thursday, we consider the effect of adding 6^{2023} days. The remainder of 6^{2023} modulo 7 is equivalent to the remainder of -1 modulo 7, which is 6 (since adding 7 to -1 gives us 6, which is within the range of 0 to 6, the possible remainders modulo 7).
