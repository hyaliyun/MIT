We start with the hypothesis: phi : S to S is a linear map such that if f, g in S and f(x) = g(x) on an open interval (a, b), then phi(f) = phi(g) on (a, b). 2. Consider the case where f = 0 on an open interval (a, b). By the properties of phi, we infer that phi(f) = 0 on (a, b) as well. Hence, phi(0) = 0, showing that phi maps the zero function to the zero function. 3. Our goal is to show that phi respects pointwise zeroes more strongly, i.e., if f(x_0) = 0 for some x_0 in mathbb{R}, then phi(f)(x_0) = 0. 4. Take any f in S and any point x_0 such that f(x_0) = 0.

Notice that f = L + R for all x in mathbb{R}. 6. We analyze phi(L). On the interval (x_0, infty), L(x) = 0. By the properties of phi, phi(L) must also be zero on this interval. Since phi(L) is continuous, phi(L)(x_0) = 0 as it takes the zero value on (x_0, infty). 7. Similarly, phi(R) is zero on the interval (-infty, x_0). By continuity, phi(R)(x_0) = 0. 8. From the linearity of phi, we have phi(f) = phi(L + R) = phi(L) + phi(R). Thus, at x_0: [ phi(f)(x_0) = phi(L)(x_0) + phi(R)(x_0) = 0 + 0 = 0 ] 9. Having established that phi(f)(x_0) = 0 whenever f(x_0) = 0, we proceed by considering the function u(x) equiv 1 (constant function with value 1 for all x). 10. Let’s denote (h = phi(u)). Notice that h is in S and is continuous because phi maps continuous functions to continuous functions. 11. For any f in S and any point x_0 in mathbb{R}, consider the function g(x) = f(x) - f(x_0)u(x). Note that g(x_0) = f(x_0) - f(x_0) cdot 1 = 0. 12. By the previous steps, since g(x_0) = 0, it follows that: [ phi(g)(x_0) = 0 ] 13. Using linearity and the definition of g: [ phi(g) = phi(f - f(x_0)u) = phi(f) - f(x_0)phi(u) = phi(f) - f(x_0)h ] 14.

This means that the function f(x) repeats its values every 6 units along the x-axis. Thus, the smallest positive period of f(x) is 6. 2. **Even Function Property**: Since y=f(x+3) is an even function, we have f(-x+3)=f(x+3). By substituting x with -x in the periodicity property, we get f(-x)=f(x+6). This allows us to relate values of f(x) at symmetric points around x=3. 3. **Specific Values**: - For f(-4.5), using f(-x)=f(x+6), we get f(-4.5)=f(1.5) because -4.5+6=1.5. - For f(12.5), applying the periodicity f(x+6)=f(x), we find f(12.5)=f(0.5) since 12.5-12=0.5. - For f(3.5), considering the symmetry and periodicity, we have f(3.5)=f(-2.5)=f(2.5) because -2.5+6=3.5. 4. **Monotonicity on (0,3)**: Given that f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval (0,3), and noting the positions of 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 within this interval, we can compare their function values: - Since 0.5 < 1.5 < 2.5, and f(x) is decreasing, it follows that f(0.5) > f(1.5) > f(2.5). 5. **Conclusion**: Combining the specific values with the monotonicity, we have: - f(12.5) > f(-4.5) > f(3.5), which corresponds to f(0.5) > f(1.5) > f(2.5).

For a polynomial of degree less than ( n ), the ( n )-th finite difference ( Delta^n p(x) ) is zero. This is because the ( n )-th finite difference of any polynomial of degree less than ( n ) is zero. 3. **Using Binomial Coefficients for Finite Differences**: By the properties of finite differences, specifically using the binomial coefficient representation: [ Delta^n p(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^i binom{n}{i} p(x+i) ] Setting ( x = 0 ), we have: [ Delta^n p(0) = sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^i binom{n}{i} p(i) ] 4. **Application of Given Condition**: From the problem statement, it is given that: [ sum_{i=0}^{n} p(i) cdot (-1)^{i} cdot binom{n}{i} = 0 ] This is exactly the expression for ( Delta^n p(0) ). Therefore: [ Delta^n p(0) = 0 ] 5. **Conclusion**: Hence, we have shown that the condition provided in the problem aligns with ( Delta^n p(0) = 0 ), which occurs for any polynomial ( p(x) ) of degree less than ( n ). Therefore, all polynomials ( p(x) ) of degree less than ( n ) satisfy the condition. Thus, the set of polynomials ( p(x) ) of degree less than ( n ) satisfies the given summation condition.

Probability Analysis for Single Element:** - For any ( s in S ) and ( i in {1,2, ldots, n} ), the probability ( P(s in A_i) = frac{1}{2} ). - ( A_1 cup A_2 cup cdots cup A_n = S ) implies each ( s in S ) belongs to at least one ( A_i ). - ( A_1 cap A_2 cap cdots cap A_n = emptyset ) implies each ( s in S ) does not belong to all ( A_i ). The probability that each ( s in S ) satisfies both conditions: - Probability that ( s ) does not appear in any ( A_i ) is ( 2^{-n} ). - Probability that ( s ) appears in all ( A_i ) is also ( 2^{-n} ). Thus, the probability that ( s ) appears in at least one ( A_i ) but not all is: [ 1 - 2^{-n} - 2^{-n} = 1 - 2 cdot 2^{-n} = 1 - 2^{1-n} ] **2. Entire Set Probability Calculation:** Since ( S ) contains ( 2^n ) elements and each element follows the same probability: [ P_n = left(1 - 2^{1-n} right)^{2^n} ] **3. Evaluating the Limit:** To find ( lim_{n rightarrow infty} P_n ): [ lim_{n rightarrow infty} left(1 - 2^{1-n} right)^{2^n} ] We make use of the known limit: [ e^x = lim_{k rightarrow infty} left(1 + frac{x}{k} right)^k ] Writing our limit in this form: [ left(1 - 2^{1-n} right)^{2^n} = left(1 + frac{-2}{2^n} right)^{2^n} ] As ( 2^n to infty ) as ( n to infty ), we deduce: [ lim_{n rightarrow infty} left(1 + frac{-2}{2^n} right)^{2^n} = e^{-2} ] Thus: [ lim_{n rightarrow infty} P_n = frac{1}{e^2} ] To verify without directly using the known exponential limit, we can use logarithms and L'Hôpital's Rule. **4. Using Logarithms:** Taking natural logarithms: [ log P_n = 2^n log left( 1 - 2^{1-n} right) = frac{log left(1 - 2^{1-n}right)}{2^{-n}} ] Applying L'Hôpital's Rule: [ lim_{n rightarrow infty} log P_n = lim_{n rightarrow infty} frac{log left(1-2^{1-n}right)}{2^{-n}} ] Differentiate numerator and denominator: [ begin{aligned} lim_{n rightarrow infty} log P_n &= lim_{n rightarrow infty} frac{left[ log left(1-2^{1-n}right) right]'}{left(2^{-n}right)'} &= lim_{n rightarrow infty} frac{left(log 2right) 2^{1-n} / left(1-2^{1-n}right)}{-(log 2) 2^{-n}} &= lim_{n rightarrow infty} frac{-2}{1 - 2^{1-n}} = -2 end{aligned} ] Since ( lim_{n rightarrow infty} log P_n = -2 ): [ lim_{n rightarrow infty} P_n = e^{-2} = frac{1}{e^2} ] Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{e^2}} ]"},{"instruction":"An integer ( N ) is selected at random in the range ( 1 leq N leq 1000 ).

Since ( 2^{2} equiv 0 pmod{4} ), we have ( 2^{16} equiv (2^2)^8 equiv 0^8 equiv 0 pmod{4} ). - If ( N equiv 3 pmod{4} ), then ( N^{16} equiv 3^{16} ). Since ( 3 equiv -1 pmod{4} ), we have ( 3^{16} equiv (-1)^{16} equiv 1 pmod{4} ). 2. **Counting Favorable Outcomes:** - The remainder is ( 1 pmod{4} ) in the cases where ( N equiv 1, 3 pmod{4} ). This covers ( 2 ) out of the ( 4 ) possible residue classes modulo ( 4 ). 3. **Total Number of Outcomes:** - Since ( N ) is chosen randomly from ( 1 ) to ( 1000 ), and ( 1000 equiv 0 pmod{4} ), each residue class modulo ( 4 ) has an equal number of representatives among these numbers. Specifically, there are ( frac{1000}{4} = 250 ) numbers in each residue class. 4. **Calculating the Probability:** - The probability that ( N^{16} equiv 1 pmod{4} ) is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. Since ( 2 ) out of ( 4 ) residue classes yield a remainder of ( 1 ), the probability is (frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2}).

To complete the square, we focus on the quadratic and linear terms: [ y = (x^{2} + 2x) + 4. ] Adding and subtracting (1)^{2} (since 2x = 2 cdot x cdot 1 and we use the formula a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2), we get: [ y = (x^{2} + 2x + 1) + 4 - 1. ] Simplifying, we find: [ y = (x + 1)^{2} + 3. ] 2. **Identifying the Vertex:** From the completed square form (x + 1)^{2} + 3, we can directly identify the vertex of the parabola as (-1, 3). This is because the vertex form of a parabola is given by y = a(x - h)^{2} + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. Here, h = -1 and k = 3. 3. **Analyzing the Range of b:** Since the coefficient of the quadratic term (x + 1)^{2} is positive, the parabola opens upwards. This means that the minimum value of y (or b in this context) occurs at the vertex (-1, 3). Therefore, the minimum value of b is 3. For -2 leqslant a < 3, the maximum value of b occurs at the right end of this interval, which is when a = 3 - 1 = 2. Substituting a = 2 into the original equation gives: [ b = (2)^{2} + 2(2) + 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. ] However, the correct calculation for the maximum value of b when a = 3 (not included in the interval but to find the limit) should be: [ b = (3)^{2} + 2(3) + 4 = 9 + 6 + 4 = 19. ] Therefore, the range of b is 3 leqslant b < 19.

This insight will aid in solving the problem. 3. **Weighing with Ternary Weights:** Convert any weight ( n ) to its ternary (base-3) representation. Each digit in this representation can be 0, 1, or 2. We can interpret digit 2 as ( -1 ) on the other side of the balance. For example, for ( n = 5 ): [ 5_{10} = 12_{3} ] which can be interpreted as: [ 5 = 3 + 2 implies 5 = 3 + (2_3 - 3_3) implies 5 = 3 + 3 - 3 ] Here, 3-3 is achieved by placing weights on the opposite sides of the balance. 4. **Selecting the Weights:** The weights that we use should enable us to represent every number in this range without needing a larger non-power-of-3 increment. The weights selected are powers of 3: [ 1, 3, 9, 27, 81 ] These weights cover all necessary ranges up to ( 3^k - 1 ) where ( k ) is the number of weights used. 5. **Justification for the Weights:** The sum of weights from ( 3^0 ) to ( 3^4 ) minus one gives us: [ 3^5 - 1 = 243 - 1 = 242 ] But we only need up to 100, [ sum_{i=0}^{4} 3^i = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 ] We can place weights: [ -3^0, -3^1, -3^2, -3^3, -3^4 ] On either side of the balance depending on the weight to fine-tune between 1 and 100. 6. **Proof of Sufficiency:** We verify that 4 weights are insufficient by showing they sum to: [ 3^4 - 1 = 80 ] which does not reach 100. Therefore, 5 weights are required: The sequence must cover weights from 1 to 100 and the aforementioned method suffices ( 121 ) exactly when interpreted in binary to ternary placement conditions. # Conclusion: We need a minimum of five weights: ( 1, 3, 9, 27, ) and ( 81 ) grams to measure any integer weight from 1 to 100 grams using a balance scale where weights can be placed on both sides.

Rearranging to isolate the square root term, we get: [ 2d^2 - a^2 - b^2 - 2 sqrt{(d^2 - a^2)(d^2 - b^2)} = 0 ] [ 2d^2 - 2 sqrt{(d^2 - a^2)(d^2 - b^2)} = a^2 + b^2 ] [ sqrt{(d^2 - a^2)(d^2 - b^2)} = d^2 - frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} ] 7. Squaring both sides, we obtain: [ (d^2 - a^2)(d^2 - b^2) = left(d^2 - frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}right)^2 ] 8. Expanding both sides, we get: [ d^4 - (a^2 + b^2)d^2 + a^2b^2 = d^4 - (a^2 + b^2)d^2 + frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4} ] [ a^2b^2 = frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4} ] 9. Multiplying through by 4, we get: [ 4a^2b^2 = (a^2 + b^2)^2 ] 10.

Let's denote these less connected vertices in ( B ) as a subset ( B' subseteq B ) where ( |B'| geq b - d ). 3. **Selecting Subset ( D ) from ( B )**: We choose ( D subseteq B ) such that ( |D| = d ) and each vertex in ( D ) has at most ( frac{a-c}{d} ) neighbors in ( A ). This is possible because we have at least ( b - d ) candidates in ( B' ) with this property. 4. **Connection Bound within ( D ) to ( A )**: Each vertex in ( D ) has at most ( frac{a-c}{d} ) neighbors in ( A ), so the total number of connections between ( D ) and ( A ) is bounded by: [ text{Total connections} leq d cdot frac{a-c}{d} = a - c. ] 5. **Selecting Subset ( C ) from ( A )**: - The set ( D ) is connecting to at most ( a - c ) vertices in ( A ). - Therefore, there are at least ( c ) vertices in ( A ) that are not connected to any vertex in ( D ).

What was the percentage of sugar by weight in the second solution?","output":"Let's denote the total weight of the original solution as W. Since one fourth of the solution was replaced, the amount of the original solution that was removed is W/4. The amount of sugar in the original solution before any was removed is 10% of W, which is 0.10W. When W/4 of the original solution is removed, the amount of sugar removed is 10% of W/4, which is 0.10(W/4) = 0.025W. The amount of sugar remaining in the solution after W/4 has been removed is 0.10W - 0.025W = 0.075W. Now, let's denote the percentage of sugar in the second solution as S (in decimal form). When W/4 of the second solution is added, the amount of sugar added from the second solution is S(W/4). The total amount of sugar in the final solution is the sugar remaining from the original solution plus the sugar from the second solution, which is 0.075W + S(W/4). The final solution is 16% sugar by weight, so the total amount of sugar in the final solution is 0.16W. Setting the two expressions for the total amount of sugar in the final solution equal to each other, we get: 0.075W + S(W/4) = 0.16W Now, we can solve for S: S(W/4) = 0.16W - 0.075W S(W/4) = 0.085W Divide both sides by (W/4) to solve for S: S = (0.085W) / (W/4) S = 0.085 * 4 S = 0.34 So the percentage of sugar by weight in the second solution is boxed{34%} ."},{"instruction":"For each color copy, print shop X charges a certain amount and print shop Y charges 1.70.

Let's denote R_{3}(n) as the minimal number of vertices required to ensure at least one monochrome triangle with ( n ) colors. - For n = 2, it is known that R_{3}(2) = 6. In other words, R_{3}(2) = 3 times 2!. This is the known result from Ramsey theory for two colors where any complete graph on six vertices will contain a monochrome triangle when edges are colored using two colors. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume ( R_{3}(n) ) follows from induction and calculate ( R_{3}(n+1) ): - We seek a relationship between ( R_{3}(n) ) and ( R_{3}(n+1) ). - Consider a vertex ( A ) and its connections to other vertices. 3. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:** - By the pigeonhole principle, if we have ((n+1)(R_{3}(n)-1) + 1) vertices, then there will be at least ( R_{3}(n) ) edges sharing the same color from vertex ( A ). - Let these edges be colored in blue. - Denote the other endpoints of these blue edges as ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_m ) where ( m = R_{3}(n) ). 4. **Forming Monochrome Triangle:** - If any edge ( [B_i B_j] ) is also blue, then triangle ( triangle A B_i B_j ) is monochrome in blue. - If none of the edges between ( B_i ) vertices are blue, then they must be colored with the remaining ( n ) colors. - From ( R_{3}(n) ), within these vertices, there must be a monochrome triangle since ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_m ) would result in at least one monochrome triangle. 5. **Formulating the Recurrence Relation:** - Therefore, we deduce: [ R_{3}(n+1) leq (n+1)R_{3}(n) - n + 1 ] 6. **Factoring in the Initial Condition:** - Given the base case of ( R_{3}(2) = 6 = 3 times 2! ), we use induction to show ( R_{3}(n) = 3n! ). - For the inductive step: [ R_{3}(n+1) leq (n+1)R_{3}(n) ] Since by induction ( R_{3}(n) = 3n! ): [ R_{3}(n+1) leq (n+1) times 3n! ] Simplifying, this leads to: [ R_{3}(n+1) leq 3(n+1)! ] 7. **Improving Refinement:** - Although initially, we considered using a constant ( 3 ), by considering the corrections as stated (neglecting ( -(n-1) )), we can fine-tune our estimates. 8. **Conclusion:** Based on the recurrence relation and induction: [ R_{3}(n) leq 3n! ] Thus, a thorough analysis, including potential improvements and refinements of constants, leads us to the final result.

Prove that you can select 4 numbers from these 48 such that their product is a perfect square.","output":"1. Let's first consider the given condition that the product of 48 natural numbers has exactly 10 distinct prime factors. 2. We need to demonstrate that we can select 4 numbers from these 48 such that their product is a perfect square. 3. We'll first examine the structure of the problem. Suppose (a, b) are two of these 48 numbers: [ a = 2^{7} cdot 3^{8} cdot 5^{9} cdot 11, quad b = 2^{5} cdot 3^{7} cdot 5^{9} cdot 11 cdot 13 ] 4. The product of (a) and (b) is given by: [ a times b = (2^{7} cdot 3^{8} cdot 5^{9} cdot 11) times (2^{5} cdot 3^{7} cdot 5^{9} cdot 11 cdot 13) = 2^{12} cdot 3^{15} cdot 5^{18} cdot 11^{2} cdot 13 ] 5. Now, express (a times b) as: [ a times b = left(2^{6} cdot 3^{7} cdot 5^{9} cdot 11right)^{2} times 3 times 13 ] 6. Since (left(2^{6} cdot 3^{7} cdot 5^{9} cdot 11right)^{2}) is already a perfect square, we only need to consider the primes 3 and 13 left over. 7. Assume ((a, b)) are any pair of numbers among the 48 numbers. We can decompose their product into a perfect square and products of some primes: [ a times b = m^{2} times 3 times 13 ] where (m) is composed of the other prime factors in pairs. 8. Note that there are (binom{48}{2} = 1128) possible pairs of numbers from the 48 numbers. 9. Considering the 10 distinct prime factors, there are (2^{10} = 1024) possible subsets of primes from these 10 primes. 10. Since (1128 > 1024), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two pairs ((a, b)) and ((c, d)) such that they share the same subset of primes used to form their products: [ a times b = m^{2} times p_1 times p_2 times cdots times p_k, quad c times d = n^{2} times p_1 times p_2 times cdots times p_k ] 11. Their combined product is: [ a times b times c times d = (m times n times p_1 times p_2 times cdots times p_k)^{2} ] which is a perfect square. 12. If we consider two pairs ((a, b)) and ((c, d)), and if they have a common element, say (b = d), then (a times c) must be a perfect square. 13. Thus observe the remaining 46 numbers: [ a neq c, quad text{so the pair } (a, c) text{ involves 46 numbers left.} ] 14. Given that the product of these 46 numbers still has no more than 10 distinct prime factors, and then the number of pairs (binom{46}{2} = 1035 > 1024 = 2^{10}). 15. Reapplying the analysis on these 46 numbers guarantees at least another set of two pairs. That way, selecting another disjoint set of pairs guarantees a perfect square: [ a, b, c, d ] 16. Therefore, this process ensures that we can always select four numbers ((u, v, x, y)) from the 48 numbers such that their product is a perfect square.

We need to show that the volume of the set of points located within a distance d from this circle is not greater than 2pi d(r+d)^2. **Proof of Lemma 1**: - Consider point P such that the distance from P to the circle omega is at most d. - The distance from P to the plane containing the circle omega must be less than or equal to d, placing P in a band of width 2d in the direction perpendicular to the plane. - Additionally, the distance from the projection of P onto the plane to omega cannot exceed d. Hence, P lies within a cylinder of radius r+d and height 2d centered around omega. - Therefore, the volume of the set of points within this d-distance from omega can be derived from the volume of the cylinder, yielding the maximum volume as 2pi d(r+d)^2. Thus, Lemma 1 is proven. 2. **Finding the Sphere and Its Distance**: - **Lemma 2**: We need to demonstrate that for any given number n of planes in space, for any radius R, we can find a point in space such that this point is at a distance greater than R from each of these planes. **Proof of Lemma 2**: - Denote B_r(A) as a sphere of radius r centered at point A in space. - Fix a point O. Assume that at a sufficiently large radius M, there exists a point in the sphere B_M(O) that satisfies the condition. - For each plane alpha_i, intersect it with sphere B_{M+R}(O), forming circles omega_i. - If a point P in B_M(O) is within a distance R from plane alpha_i, then it must be within a distance R from omega_i. - The volume of the set of points in B_M(O) at a distance not exceeding R from any plane alpha_i does not exceed 2 pi R (M+2R)^2. - Summing up for n planes, we have the total volume bounded by 2 n pi R (M+2R)^2. - For sufficiently large M, this volume will be less than the volume of B_M, which is frac{4}{3} pi M^3. Hence, Lemma 2 is proven. 3. **Problem Solution**: - First, find a point P in space such that it is at least 100 units away from each given plane. - Consider a sphere centered at point P with radius 100 that does not intersect any of the given planes. - Any raisin (central point) at a distance 10 units within this sphere remains uncut by the planes since the intersection range does not impact all raisins.

Let us consider an equilateral triangle with side length of 1 unit. Suppose this triangle is the base of a prism. 2. Keep in mind the plane intersects the lateral surface of the prism in an isosceles right triangle (meaning it has one 90° angle and two equal sides). 3. By translating the cutting plane so that one of its vertices, say (A), coincides with one vertex of the equilateral triangle base. Assume point (A) represents the right angle vertex. 4. Due to the symmetry, the plane intersects the other two edges of the prism (parallel to the base sides) at equal heights (B) and (C), meaning we have: [ BE = CD ] 5. From here, (DE = CB = 1) (since (BC) is a side of the base triangle and the plane intersects (BE) and (CD) at the same height). This leads to: [ triangle AEB text{ is a right triangle with } AE > AB = 1 ] 6. Likewise, in the right triangle ( triangle ADE), ( DE = 1 > AE > 1 ), which presents a contradiction. 7. Hence, (D) and (E) cannot be equidistant from the plane of triangle (ABC). 8. Let’s set (CD = x) and (BE = y), where (y > x). 9. Using the Pythagoras theorem in ( triangle ACD ): [ AD = sqrt{1 + x^2} quad text{similarly} quad AE = sqrt{1 + y^2} ] 10.

Considering triangle (DEF): [ DE = sqrt{1 + (y - x)^2} quad text{and thus} quad sqrt{1 + (y - x)^2} = sqrt{1 + x^2} ] 12. This equality simplifies to: [ (y - x)^2 = x^2 Rightarrow y - x = x Rightarrow y = 2x ] 13. Substituting back, we get: [ AD = sqrt{1 + 4x^2} ] 14. Given (AD = sqrt{1 + x^2}), then: [ frac{1}{sqrt{2}} sqrt{1 + 4x^2} = sqrt{1 + x^2} ] 15. Solving this equation step by step: [ left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}} sqrt{1 + 4x^2}right)^2 = ( sqrt{1 + x^2} )^2 ] 16.

This gives us the equation: [ h = 20 - 5t ] However, it's important to note that the candle can only burn as long as there is candle left to burn. Since the candle is 20 centimeters long and burns at 5 centimeters per hour, it will completely burn out after 4 hours. Therefore, the function is valid for t in the range from 0 to 4, inclusive. This means that t must satisfy 0 leq t leq 4. Putting it all together, the function relationship between the remaining length h (in centimeters) of the candle after burning for t hours is: [ boxed{h = 20 - 5t quad (0 leq t leq 4)} ]"},{"instruction":"f 3 letters are to be mailed into 4 mailboxes, then the total number of different ways to do this is ( ) A: 24 ways B: 4 ways C: 4^3 ways D: 3^4 way","output":"The first letter can be mailed into a mailbox in 4 ways, the second letter can also be mailed into a mailbox in 4 ways, and the third letter can be mailed into a mailbox in 4 ways.

Therefore, ( sin u = 0 ), which implies: [ u = k pi quad text{for some integer } k ] 4. **Further Simplification for (v):** If (u = kpi): [ cos u = (-1)^k ] Then, the first equation simplifies to: [ (-1)^k cos v = (-1)^{2k} - frac{1}{2} = 1 - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} ] Thus: [ cos v = (-1)^k cdot frac{1}{2} ] Solving for (v): [ v = pm frac{pi}{3} + k pi + 2lpi quad text{for integers } k text{ and } l ] 5. **Reconstructing (x) and (y):** Using (x = u + v) and (y = u - v): [ x = k pi + left( pm frac{pi}{3} + k pi + 2l pi right) = pm frac{pi}{3} + 2(k+l) pi ] [ y = k pi - left( pm frac{pi}{3} + k pi + 2l pi right) = mp frac{pi}{3} + 2 l pi ] Therefore, the solutions to the system of equations are: [ begin{aligned} & x = pm frac{pi}{3} + 2(k+l) pi & y = mp frac{pi}{3} + 2 l pi end{aligned} ] Where (k) and (l) are any integers. # Conclusion: [ boxed{ x = pm frac{pi}{3} + 2(k+l) pi, quad y = mp frac{pi}{3} + 2 l pi } ]"},{"instruction":"Alia studied 30 minutes each day for 7 days and 45 minutes each day for 4 days.

This statement is partially correct. An angle is indeed a symmetrical figure, and its symmetrical axis is indeed the bisector of the angle. However, the proposition seems to imply that this is a defining characteristic of angles, which is not necessarily incorrect but might be misleading in its wording. For clarity, we'll consider this proposition as **incorrect** due to its ambiguous implication. 2. **Proposition ②**: Two triangles symmetrical about a certain line must be congruent triangles. This statement is **correct**. If two triangles are symmetrical about a line, it means they are mirror images of each other across that line. This symmetry ensures that corresponding sides and angles are equal, satisfying the criteria for congruence. 3. **Proposition ③**: A regular pentagon has five symmetrical axes. This statement is **correct**. A regular pentagon, by definition, has equal sides and equal angles. It also has five lines of symmetry, each passing through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side. These symmetrical axes divide the pentagon into mirror-image halves. 4. **Proposition ④**: In an isosceles triangle, the altitude on the base, the median on the base, and the angle bisector at the vertex coincide with each other. This statement is **incorrect**. While it is true for an isosceles triangle that the altitude, median, and angle bisector from the vertex opposite the base can coincide (specifically when drawn from the vertex angle to the base), the proposition's wording might imply a broader application than is accurate. The key point is that these lines coincide when drawn from the vertex angle to the base in an isosceles triangle, not universally in all configurations. 5. **Proposition ⑤**: In a right triangle, the side opposite the 30^{circ} angle is equal to half of the hypotenuse. This statement is **correct**. This is a well-known property of a 30-60-90 right triangle, where the side opposite the 30^{circ} angle is indeed half the length of the hypotenuse.

Furthermore, in the third round, he scored 1.5 times the points he scored in the second round. Therefore, the points scored in the third round is: [ 1.5 times 2x = 3x ] 4. We need to identify how many points Misha scored in the second round. We know from the problem that Misha threw 8 darts each time, and the least points possible per dart is 3.

If ( A = overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0}_{10} ), then: [ 10A = overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0 0}_{10} ] This shifts all digits of ( A ) one place to the left and appends a zero at the end. 4. Now, subtract ( A ) from ( 10A ): [ 9A = 10A - A = overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0 0}_{10} - overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0}_{10} ] 5.

Since the digits of ( A ) form an increasing sequence, each subtraction ( a_{i-1} - a_i ) results in a non-negative digit, and the last term ( 10 - a_0 ) is also a non-negative digit. 7. The sum of the digits of ( 9A ) can be calculated as follows: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_{i-1} - a_i) + (10 - a_0) ] 8.

Define the central angles as follows: ( text{angle} , angle A_iOA_{i+1} = 2alpha_i ), where ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ).

The area of each triangle ( triangle OA_iA_{i+1} ) is: [ S_{OA_iA_{i+1}} = frac{1}{2} sin 2alpha_i ] - Therefore, the total area ( S ) of the polygon ( M ) is: [ S = frac{1}{2} (sin 2alpha_1 + sin 2alpha_2 + ldots + sin 2alpha_n) ] Now, let's consider the polygon ( M' ). 3. **Perimeter and Area of ( M' ):** - The side ( A_i'A_{i+1}' ) of the polygon ( M' ) would be the chord that subtends ( alpha_i + alpha_{i+1} ).

First, we note that (2007 = 3^2 times 223). Therefore, for the congruence equation (x^2 + a equiv 0 pmod{2007}) to have exactly two distinct non-negative integer solutions less than (2007), it must independently satisfy congruence equations modulo (9) and (223). 2. From (2007 = 9 times 223), the total number of solutions of (x^2 equiv -a pmod{2007}) is the product of the solutions of the congruence modulo (9) and modulo (223). 3. **Solving modulo (9)**: - The quadratic residues modulo (9) are (0, 1, 4, 7). - If (x^2 + a equiv 0 pmod{9}), then (a equiv -x^2 pmod{9}). This means (a) must be congruent to one of the residues modulo (9) when negated. - When: - (a equiv 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 pmod{9}): there are no solutions. - (a equiv 2, 5, 8 pmod{9}): there are two solutions. - (a equiv 0 pmod{9}): there are three solutions. 4. **Solving modulo (223)**: - We need to identify cases where (x^2 equiv -a pmod{223}). - Define (S = {b_i mid b_i equiv i^2 pmod{223}, 0 < b_i < 223, i = 1, 2, ldots, 111}). This set contains all quadratic residues of (223) (since (223) is prime and there are ((223 - 1)/2 = 111) quadratic residues). - If (-a in S), then there are two solutions to the equation (x^2 + a equiv 0 pmod{223}). - If (-a notin S cup {0}), then there are no solutions. - If (a = 0) modulo (223), there is exactly one solution. 5. We seek all values (a < 2007) such that the congruence (x^2 + a equiv 0 pmod{2007}) has exactly two non-negative solutions less than (2007): - This implies (a) must provide two solutions modulo (9) and exactly one solution modulo (223). 6. Assume (a = 223b): - Since (223 equiv -2 pmod{9}), and knowing (-2) is a quadratic residue modulo (9), it follows (-b) must also be a quadratic residue modulo (9). - The quadratic residues modulo (9) are (0, 1, 4, 7). Therefore, (b) must be such that (-b equiv) one of these residues modulo (9): this gives (b = 2, 5, 8 pmod{9}). 7.

To apply the arithmetic mean-geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality — which states that the arithmetic mean of non-negative quantities is greater than or equal to their geometric mean — we note that this expression includes 15 terms in the product. 4. To use the AM-GM inequality appropriately, we include an additional term, (1), making it an even total of 16 terms. This inclusion does not change the inequality because multiplying by (1) leaves the value unchanged. We can rewrite it as: [ sqrt[16]{(2 x)^8 cdot (2 x+1)^4 cdot (2 x+2)^2 cdot (2 x+3) cdot 1} ] 5. Applying the AM-GM inequality with all these 16 factors: [ sqrt[16]{(2 x)^8 cdot (2 x+1)^4 cdot (2 x+2)^2 cdot (2 x+3) cdot 1} < frac{8(2 x) + 4(2 x+1) + 2(2 x+2) + (2 x+3) + 1}{16} ] 6.

This means the remaining value should be at most ( 10% ) of the initial value, i.e., ( 0.1V_0 ). 4. Set up the inequality: [ V_0 times (0.9)^n leq 0.1V_0 ] 5. Divide both sides by ( V_0 ) (assuming ( V_0 neq 0 )): [ (0.9)^n leq 0.1 ] 6. Take the logarithm of both sides. Using the common logarithm (base 10): [ log_{10}((0.9)^n) leq log_{10}(0.1) ] 7. Apply the power rule of logarithms, ( log_{10}(a^b) = b log_{10}(a) ): [ n log_{10}(0.9) leq log_{10}(0.1) ] 8.

Recall that ( 0.9 = frac{9}{10} ), so: [ log_{10}(0.9) = log_{10}left(frac{9}{10}right) = log_{10}(9) - log_{10}(10) = log_{10}(9) - 1 ] 11. We know that ( 9 = 3^2 ), so: [ log_{10}(9) = log_{10}(3^2) = 2 log_{10}(3) ] 12. Given ( log_{10}(3) = 0.477 ): [ log_{10}(9) = 2 times 0.477 = 0.954 ] 13. Therefore: [ log_{10}(0.9) = 0.954 - 1 = -0.046 ] 14. Substitute back into the inequality: [ n geq frac{-1}{-0.046} = frac{1}{0.046} approx 21.74 ] 15.

Given the point Pleft(2a+1,1-aright), we have two conditions based on the quadrant criteria: 1. The x-coordinate 2a+1 must be less than 0. 2. The y-coordinate 1-a must be greater than 0.

For the y-coordinate: [1-a > 0] Subtracting 1 from both sides: [-a > -1] Multiplying both sides by -1 (remember this reverses the inequality): [a < 1] Combining both conditions, we find that a must satisfy both a < -frac{1}{2} and a < 1.

Suppose there is another sphere inscribed in the same pyramid ABCD with center O. Since O must also be equidistant from all the faces of the pyramid, it must coincide with Q.

This means that if he had scored 110 more marks, he would have passed. Therefore, the passing mark is 400 + 110.

Since the maximum marks M must be a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, in the context of an exam, the total marks are usually set as a whole number, so we can assume that the actual maximum marks are 927 or 928 (depending on the rounding rules applied by the examining body).

This similarity means that their dimensions scale proportionally. Let's denote the height of the smallest cone (topmost piece) as h and the radius of its base as r. We are considering four cones here: - Cone A: the smallest cone on top. - Cone B: composed of the top two pieces. - Cone C: composed of the top three pieces. - Cone D: the entire cone, all four pieces together. Given that each piece has the same height, the height of Cone B is twice that of Cone A, Cone C is three times, and Cone D is four times. Similarly, the radii of their bases scale in the same way because the cones are similar. The volume of a cone is given by the formula V = frac{1}{3} pi r^2 h. Using this formula, we calculate the volumes of Cones B, C, and D as follows: begin{align*} V_B &= frac{1}{3} pi (2r)^2 (2h) = frac{8}{3} pi r^2 h, V_C &= frac{1}{3} pi (3r)^2 (3h) = frac{27}{3} pi r^2 h, V_D &= frac{1}{3} pi (4r)^2 (4h) = frac{64}{3} pi r^2 h. end{align*} The largest piece is obtained by subtracting the volume of Cone C from Cone D: begin{align*} V_{1} &= V_D - V_C = frac{64}{3} pi r^2 h - frac{27}{3} pi r^2 h = frac{37}{3} pi r^2 h. end{align*} The second-largest piece is obtained by subtracting the volume of Cone B from Cone C: begin{align*} V_{2} &= V_C - V_B = frac{27}{3} pi r^2 h - frac{8}{3} pi r^2 h = frac{19}{3} pi r^2 h. end{align*} Finally, to find the ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the volume of the largest piece, we divide V_2 by V_1: begin{align*} frac{V_2}{V_1} &= frac{frac{19}{3} pi r^2 h}{frac{37}{3} pi r^2 h} &= frac{19}{37}. end{align*} Therefore, the ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to that of the largest piece is boxed{frac{19}{37}}."},{"instruction":"Given that a and b are real numbers, the complex number (a^{2}4a+5)+(b^{2}+2b6)i represents a point in ____.

The distance between the secant passing through the points ((n, n^2)) and ((n+1, (n+1)^2)) on the parabola ( y = x^2 ) and the tangent line to the parabola at a point parallel to this secant. 2. The ratio in which the foot of the perpendicular from the tangent point to the secant divides the chord formed by the secant. 1. Finding the Equation of the Secant Line: First, we find the equation of the secant line. The slope of the secant line between the points ( (n, n^2) ) and ( (n+1, (n+1)^2) ) is given by the difference in ordinates divided by the difference in abscissas: [ text{slope} = frac{(n+1)^2 - n^2}{(n+1) - n} = frac{n^2 + 2n + 1 - n^2}{1} = 2n + 1 ] We use point-slope form of the line equation to write the equation of the secant, using point ( (n, n^2) ): [ y - n^2 = (2n + 1)(x - n) ] Solving for ( y ): [ y = (2n + 1)x - (2n + 1)n + n^2 ] [ y = (2n + 1)x - (n^2 + n) ] 2. Tangent Line Parallel to the Secant Line: The tangent to the parabola ( y = x^2 ) at a point ( (a, a^2) ) has a slope of ( 2a ): [ y = 2a(x - a) + a^2 ] To be parallel to the secant, ( 2a ) must equal the slope of the secant, ( 2n + 1 ): [ 2a = 2n + 1 implies a = n + frac{1}{2} ] Therefore, the point of tangency is: [ left( n + frac{1}{2}, left( n + frac{1}{2} right)^2 right) = left( n + frac{1}{2}, n^2 + n + frac{1}{4} right) ] 3. Distance from the Tangent Line to the Secant Line: To calculate the perpendicular distance from the tangent point ( T ) to the secant, we denote the tangent point as ( T left( n + frac{1}{2}, n^2 + n + frac{1}{4} right) ) and the secant line equation as ( y = (2n + 1)x - (n^2 + n) ). The formula for the distance from a point ((x_1, y_1)) to a line (Ax + By + C = 0) is: [ d = frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} ] Here, (A = -(2n + 1)), (B = 1), and (C = n^2 + n): [ d = frac{|-(2n + 1) left( n + frac{1}{2} right) + n^2 + n + frac{1}{4} + n^2 + n|}{sqrt{(2n + 1)^2 + 1}} ] Simplifying: [ d = frac{|-(2n + 1)n - frac{2n + 1}{2} + n^2 + n + frac{1}{4} + n^2 + n|}{sqrt{4n^2 + 4n + 2}} ] [ = frac{|n^2 + n - frac{1}{4}|}{sqrt{4n^2 + 4n + 2}} ] Thus the absolute value of distance is: [ d = frac{1}{4sqrt{4n^2 + 4n + 2}} ] 4. Ratio that the Tangent Point Projection Splits the Secant Line: To find the ratio ( k ) in which the projection point ( U ) divides the chord, we analyze the x-coordinates of the endpoints of the chord ( A(n, n^2) ) and ( B(n+1, (n+1)^2) ): Solving the equations of the secant and the tangent projection intersect: From eq. (1) y = (2n+1)(x−n) + n^2 and The equation for the tangent at ( T ) is: [ y = -frac{1}{2n+1}(x - (n + frac{1}{2})) + (n^2 + n + frac{1}{4}) ] Setting these equal: [ (2n+1)x - (n^2 + n) = -frac{1}{2n+1}(x - n - frac{1}{2}) + n^2 + n + frac{1}{4} ] Solving for ( x_U ): [ x_U = frac{4n^3 + 6n^2 + 7n/2 + 3/4}{4n^2 + 4n +2} = n + frac{1}{2} - frac{2n+1}{4(4n^2 + 4n +2)} ] [ k = frac{x_U - x_A}{x_B - x_U} = frac{frac{1}{2} - frac{2n+1}{4(4n^2 + 4n +2)}}{frac{1}{2} + frac{2n+1}{4(4n^2 + 4n +2)}} ] Simplifying yields: [ k = frac{8n^2 + 6n + 3}{8n^2 + 10n + 5} ] Converting: For large n, (boxed{ k = 1 }) Increasing ( |n| ) causes the second term to minimize, making ( k approx 1 ).

We will use the fact that a quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of its opposite angles is 180 degrees. This is equivalent to the condition that the sum of any three sides must be greater than the fourth side. 1. **Establish the conditions for a cyclic quadrilateral:** For four integers (a, b, c, d), there exists a cyclic quadrilateral with side lengths (a, b, c, d) if and only if: [ a + b + c > d, quad b + c + d > a, quad c + d + a > b, quad d + a + b > c ] Given the perimeter constraint (a + b + c + d = 32), we can simplify these conditions to: [ a + b + c > 16, quad b + c + d > 16, quad c + d + a > 16, quad d + a + b > 16 ] Since (a + b + c + d = 32), each of these conditions simplifies to: [ a + b + c > d, quad b + c + d > a, quad c + d + a > b, quad d + a + b > c ] This means that each side must be less than 16. 2. **Count the number of valid quadruples ((a, b, c, d)):** We need to count the number of integer solutions to (a + b + c + d = 32) where (a, b, c, d < 16) and (a leq b leq c leq d). 3. **Case 1: All sides are equal:** If (a = b = c = d), then: [ 4a = 32 implies a = 8 ] This gives us one solution: ((8, 8, 8, 8)). 4. **Case 2: Three sides are equal:** Let (a = b = c) and (d) be different. Then: [ 3a + d = 32 implies d = 32 - 3a ] Since (a leq d) and (d < 16), we have: [ 3a leq 16 implies a leq frac{16}{3} approx 5.33 ] Therefore, (a) can be 6, 7, 9, or 10. This gives us 4 solutions. 5. **Case 3: Two pairs of equal sides:** Let (a = b) and (c = d). Then: [ 2a + 2c = 32 implies a + c = 16 ] We need to count the number of pairs ((a, c)) such that (a leq c) and (a neq c).

Every fourth year he added an extra day, making every year 11 minutes and 14 seconds too long. Over time, this led to a drift, accumulating to 44 minutes and 56 seconds (almost 3/4 hour) every 4 years. - To correct for this, every 32 years, a leap year should be skipped. Close approximations reveal that skipping one leap year every 128 years is more accurate ((frac{31}{128})). The **Gregorian Calendar**: - Introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. It refined the Julian calendar by correcting the inaccuracy by making every 4th centennial year not a leap year unless the century's year is divisible by 400. - Calculation-wise, after fixing the 10-day discrepancy from Caesar's time drift, the Gregorian Calendar only has 97 leap years every 400 years. Simplifying: [ 365 + frac{97}{400} = 365 + frac{20952}{86400} ] - Note that in 400 years, the extra days closely approximate (frac{20926}{86400} text{ days}), which rounds off the year's length to within 26 seconds correctly. # Conclusion: [ boxed{left(frac{20926}{86400}right), left(frac{1}{4}, frac{7}{29}, frac{8}{33}, frac{31}{128}, frac{163}{673}right)} ]"},{"instruction":"Given (m in mathbb{R}), let proposition (p) be: for any (x in [0, 1]), the inequality (2x 2 geqslant m^2 3m) always holds; let proposition (q) be: there exists (x in [1, 1]) such that (m leqslant ax) holds.

Each minute, one of the existing triangles is divided into two permissible triangles so that all resulting triangles are different. After some time, it turns out that no triangle can be further divided in this manner. Prove that by this point, all possible permissible triangles are present among the existing triangles.","output":"Given a prime number ( p ) and the definition that a triangle is allowed if all its angles are of the form (frac{m}{p} cdot 180^circ) where ( m ) is an integer, we need to prove that if at some point, no more triangles can be divided further while keeping them distinct, then among the existing parts there are all possible allowed triangles. 1. **Initial Triangle ( T(i,j,k) )**: The angles of an allowed triangle ( T(i,j,k) ) can be written as (frac{i}{p} cdot 180^circ), (frac{j}{p} cdot 180^circ), and (frac{k}{p} cdot 180^circ) where ( i + j + k = p ). For simplicity, let's measure angles in terms of (frac{180^circ}{p}). 2. **Basic Division**: Suppose ( j < k ). We can cut triangle ( T(i,j,k) ) such that one of the resulting triangles is similar to the original. To do this, divide angle ( k ) into angles ( j ) and ( k - j ). This way, we get two triangles: ( T(i,j,k) ) and ( T(i+j, j, k-j) ). This is termed as a basic division. 3. **Absence of Triangles**: If after completion of the dividing process, triangle ( T(i+j, j, k-j) ) does not exist, then neither does triangle ( T(i,j,k) ). Otherwise, if ( T(i+j, j, k-j) ) exists, we can perform the basic division on ( T(i,j,k) ), resulting again in triangles ( T(i,j,k) ) and ( T(i+j, j, k-j) ). 4. **Generating All Possible Triangles**: If a particular allowed triangle doesn't exist after the completion of the process, then any other triangle which can produce this missing triangle via basic division also doesn't exist. Thus, to prove that all possible triangles must eventually exist, it is sufficient to show that any triangle can be generated from any other triangle through basic divisions. 5. **Algorithm to Generate Any Triangle**: Take any triangle ( T(i,j,k) ). Use basic divisions: - If ( k > j ), replace ( k ) with ( k - j ). - If ( j > k ), replace ( j ) with ( j - k ). Repeat this process until the two remaining numbers are equal. If the last two numbers become equal, we get a triangle ( T(c,d,d) ) where ( d = gcd(j,k) ). Since ( gcd(c+d, d) = 1 ) (because they are co-prime to ( p )), repeatedly applying Euclid's algorithm will eventually yield a triangle ( T(1,1,p-2) ). 6. **Existence of All Triangles**: To ensure that if ( T(1,1,p-2) ) can generate any triangle, so the same applies for the reverse. Hence, every allowed triangle can be created by starting from ( T(1,1,p-2) ) and reversing the basic divisions. 7. **Verification**: - If ( i ) is the smallest present angle (greater than 1), divide the corresponding triangle, creating angles (1) and (i-1). The resultant triangles contain angles less than (i), implying they must have previously existed. - If angle (1) exists but ( T(1,1,p-2) ) is missing, choose ( i geq 2 ) and divide the triangle ( T(1,i,j) ), ensuring the resultant triangle ((i-1)) involves a previously missing angle. - If ( T(1,1,p-2) ) exists, explore all missing triangles and demonstrate that their formation through division is consistent. In conclusion, it follows that by the cessation of the dividing process, all possible allowed triangles must be present among the parts, completing the proof.

Each of the 2001 subscribers is connected to ( n ) other subscribers, so the total number of directed connections is ( 2001 cdot n ). 2. **Determining Pairs of Connected Subscribers:** Each connection between any two subscribers counts as a single link, but when we consider both directions, we effectively count each link twice. Therefore, the actual number of unique connections (or pairs of connected subscribers) should be divided by 2: [ text{Total unique connections} = frac{2001 cdot n}{2} ] 3. **Ensuring the Number of Pairs is an Integer:** For the above expression to be valid (i.e., the total number of unique connections should be an integer), ( frac{2001 cdot n}{2} ) must be an integer.

Geometrically, this corresponds to the region in the complex plane that is above and to the right of the ray from the origin making an angle of ( frac{pi}{4} ) with the positive real axis. **Step 3: Finding ( M cap N )** To find ( M cap N ), we need the intersection of the disk ( |z - 1| leq 1 ) and the region ( arg (z) geq frac{pi}{4} ). The boundary circle ( |z - 1| = 1 ) intersects the real axis at ( z = 0 ) and ( z = 2 ).

But in our case, the segment is subtended by ( frac{3pi}{4} ) radians (since it excludes an angle of ( frac{pi}{4} )).

The area of this triangle is: [ text{Area of triangle} = frac{1}{2} times 1 times 1 = frac{1}{2} ] 3. **Intersection Area Calculation:** The area of the intersection is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle: [ text{Intersection Area} = frac{3}{4} pi - frac{1}{2} ] # Conclusion: Thus, the area ( S ) of the intersection region ( M cap N ) is: [ boxed{frac{3}{4}pi - frac{1}{2}} ]"},{"instruction":"f the sequence ({a_n}) is an arithmetic sequence, (S_n) is the sum of its first (n) terms, and (a_1 = 2a_3 3), then (S_9 = () ()) A: (25) B: (27) C: (50) D: (54)","output":"This problem tests our understanding of the properties of arithmetic sequences and the sum of the first (n) terms of an arithmetic sequence, which is considered a basic topic.

Total distance covered = Length of first train (L1) + Length of second train Total distance covered = L1 + 210.04 meters Since distance = speed * time, we can write: L1 + 210.04 = Relative speed * Time taken to cross L1 + 210.04 = 55.56 * 9 L1 + 210.04 = 500.04 Now, we can solve for L1: L1 = 500.04 - 210.04 L1 = 290 meters Therefore, the length of the first train is boxed{290} meters."},{"instruction":"For each positive integer ( n ), express ( n ) as a sum of nonnegative integer powers of 2.

Utilizing the property that f is non-decreasing for specific ranges and deriving adequate induction steps using the recurrence relation and sum inequalities: [ f(2^n) > 2^{frac{n^2}{4}} ] 6. **Combining Results**: Having both proofs for the upper and lower bounds: [ 2^{frac{n^2}{4}} < fleft(2^nright) < 2^{frac{n^2}{2}} ] Thus we conclude the proof as required.

This can be rewritten as a_{n+2}+3=3(a_{n}+3). This indicates that the sequence formed by {a_{n}+3} is a geometric sequence with the first term a_{1}+3=4 and a common ratio of 3.

The given function simplifies to f(x) = (a-1)x - a. For this linear function to have \\"two roots,\\" the statement itself is contradictory because a linear function can have at most one root. The condition given in the problem is not mathematically consistent with the nature of linear functions. Therefore, the condition that a > 0 and a neq 1 simply ensures that the function is defined and is not a constant function. The requirement for two distinct roots cannot be fulfilled by a linear function like the one given. The solution provided, \\"a>1,\\" seems to address the condition for a to ensure the function has a defined slope that is not zero, but it does not directly relate to the condition for having two distinct roots, as that is not possible for a linear function.

Since the man is running in the same direction as the train, we subtract the man's speed from the train's speed to get the relative speed. First, let's convert the man's speed from km/hr to m/s, because the train's length is given in meters and the time is given in seconds. Speed of man in m/s = (Speed in km/hr) * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed of man in m/s = 6 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of man in m/s = 6000 / 3600 Speed of man in m/s = 1.6667 m/s (approximately) Now, let's calculate the relative speed using the time it takes for the train to pass the man. Relative speed (in m/s) = Distance / Time Relative speed (in m/s) = 400 m / 59.99520038396929 s Relative speed (in m/s) = 6.6668 m/s (approximately) This relative speed is the difference between the train's speed and the man's speed. To find the train's speed, we add the man's speed to the relative speed. Train's speed (in m/s) = Relative speed (in m/s) + Man's speed (in m/s) Train's speed (in m/s) = 6.6668 m/s + 1.6667 m/s Train's speed (in m/s) = 8.3335 m/s (approximately) Finally, let's convert the train's speed from m/s to km/hr. Train's speed (in km/hr) = (Speed in m/s) * (3600 s / 1 hr) * (1 km / 1000 m) Train's speed (in km/hr) = 8.3335 * (3600 / 1000) Train's speed (in km/hr) = 29.9998 km/hr (approximately) Therefore, the speed of the train is approximately boxed{30} km/hr."},{"instruction":"Given a>0, b>0, and a neq b, arrange the following in ascending order: frac{a+b}{2}, frac{2ab}{a+b}, sqrt{frac{a^2+b^2}{2}}, sqrt{ab}.","output":"According to the problem, by the basic inequality, we have frac{a+b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}.

The tournament is a knockout format, which means each match has two participants, the winner progresses, and the loser is eliminated from the championship. The goal is to find the maximum possible number of participants who have won at least 3 matches. 2. **Setting up the scenario**: In a knockout tournament, each match results in one participant being eliminated. Since there are 200 participants and only one winner at the end, there will be (200 - 1 = 199) matches played. This means there are 199 losers because each match eliminates one participant. 3. **Relating matches won and the progression of participants**: - To still be in the tournament after winning 3 matches, a participant must not lose before their 4th match. - Consequently, if we denote participants who win at least 3 matches, each of these participants would have contributed to the elimination of 3 others. 4. **Count of participants who can win 3 matches**: - Let's denote (k) as the number of participants who have won at least 3 matches. - Each of these (k) participants would eliminate exactly 3 participants. - Therefore, we have the inequality: [ k cdot 3 leq 199 ] - Simplifying, we get: [ k leq frac{199}{3} approx 66.33 ] - Since (k) must be an integer, the largest possible (k) is (66). 5. **Verification**: - To confirm that 66 participants can indeed win at least 3 matches, consider the sequence of eliminations: - Suppose the remaining participants after each round consistently win their next matches. - Distribute matches such that the top 66 participants win against the rest accordingly. 6. **Constructing a possible scenario**: - Let’s denote participants as (P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{200}). - Arrange matches such that (P_2, P_3, ldots, P_{67}) each eliminate 3 participants: - ( P_2 ) beats ( P_{68}, P_{69}, P_{70} ), - ( P_3 ) beats ( P_{71}, P_{72}, P_{73} ), - Continue this until ( P_{67} ) beats ( P_{197}, P_{198}, P_{199} ). - ( P_1 ) beats ( P_{67} ) or any other eliminated participant. # Conclusion: The maximum possible number of participants who can win at least 3 matches is [ boxed{66} ]"},{"instruction":"A *base* 10 *overexpansion* of a positive integer N is an expression of the form N=d_k10^k+d_{k1}10^{k1}+cdots+d_0 10^0 with d_kne 0 and d_iin{0,1,2,dots,10} for all i.

We are given that the graph of this power function passes through the point (3, frac{1}{9}). This means we can set up the equation f(3) = 3^{alpha} = frac{1}{9}. Now, we know that frac{1}{9} can also be written as 3^{-2}, because 9 = 3^2 and taking the reciprocal of a base to a power is equivalent to changing the sign of the exponent. Therefore, we have 3^{alpha} = 3^{-2}. From this equation, we can equate the exponents of the base 3 to solve for alpha. This gives us alpha = -2. Thus, our power function is f(x) = x^{-2}. Next, we need to determine the interval of monotonic decreasing for f(x) = x^{-2}. A function is monotonic decreasing if as x increases, f(x) decreases. For f(x) = x^{-2}, as x moves away from 0 in either direction (positive or negative), the value of f(x) decreases because the negative exponent means we're dealing with the reciprocal of x^2, which gets smaller as x gets larger in absolute value. However, since x^{-2} is undefined at x=0, we only consider the intervals where x is not equal to 0. For x > 0, as x increases, x^{-2} decreases, which means the function is decreasing in the interval (0, +infty). For x < 0, as x decreases (moves to the left on the number line), x^{-2} still decreases because we are looking at the reciprocal of a square, which is always positive and decreases as the absolute value of x increases. However, the function does not actually decrease as x moves from negative to positive; it increases due to the nature of the reciprocal of a square function. Therefore, the correct interval of monotonic decreasing is only (0, +infty).

The number of TV sets sold decreases by 20%, so the new quantity sold (Q') is Q * (1 - 20/100) = Q * 0.8. The new revenue (R') is P' * Q' = P * (1 + x/100) * Q * 0.8.

We need to find the minimum number of edges ( |E| ) such that adding any edge to ( G ) will form a triangle. 2. **Construct a specific example:** Consider a pentagon (5-cycle) with 5 vertices and 5 edges. For ( n > 5 ), add ( n-5 ) vertices and connect each of these vertices to two non-adjacent vertices of the pentagon. This construction ensures that the graph remains triangle-free, and adding any edge will create a triangle. 3. **Key idea:** The neighborhood of the neighborhood of any vertex must be the entire graph. This implies that the graph is highly connected. 4. **Proof by contradiction:** Suppose ( |E| leq 2n-6 ). We will show that this leads to a contradiction. 5. **Case 1: Vertex with degree 1:** If there exists a vertex ( v ) with degree 1, let ( w ) be its sole neighbor. Every other vertex must be adjacent to ( w ) to avoid forming a triangle. This would imply ( |E| = n-1 ), which contradicts ( |E| > n-1 ). 6. **Case 2: Vertex with degree 2:** If there exists a vertex ( v ) with degree 2, let ( w_1 ) and ( w_2 ) be its neighbors. Since ( w_1 ) and ( w_2 ) are not connected (else a triangle forms), we define sets: - ( A ): vertices adjacent to ( w_1 ) but not ( w_2 ) - ( B ): vertices adjacent to ( w_2 ) but not ( w_1 ) - ( C ): vertices adjacent to both ( w_1 ) and ( w_2 ), excluding ( v ) No edges exist between vertices in ( A cup C ) and ( B cup C ), else triangles form. If ( A ) is nonempty, ( B ) must be nonempty, and vice versa. If ( u_1 in A ) and ( u_2 in B ) are not connected, adding ( overline{u_1u_2} ) does not form a triangle, contradicting the assumption. 7. **Edge count analysis:** We need at least ( |A||B| + |A| + |B| + 2|C| + 2 ) edges. Since ( |A| + |B| + |C| = n-3 ), we have: [ |A||B| + |A| + |B| + 2|C| + 2 = |A||B| + |A| + |B| + 2(n-3 - |A| - |B|) + 2 = |A||B| - |A| - |B| + 2n - 4 ] Simplifying, we get: [ (|A| - 1)(|B| - 1) + 2n - 5 ] Since ( |A|, |B| geq 1 ), we have at least ( 2n - 5 ) edges. 8. **Case 3: Vertex with degree 3:** If no vertex has degree 2 or less, there exists a vertex ( v ) with degree 3, adjacent to ( w_1, w_2, w_3 ). The sum of degrees of vertices is: [ sum text{deg}(v) geq 3(n-3) + 3 + (n-4) = 4n - 10 ] Thus, the number of edges is at least: [ frac{4n - 10}{2} = 2n - 5 ] 9. **Conclusion:** Since all cases are covered, we conclude that ( |E| geq 2n - 5 ).

Assume (0,0), (2a,0), and (0,2b) are the coordinates of the vertices C, A, and B of the given triangle ABC respectively. 3. The coordinates of the center of the circumscribed circle O are (a, b) because O is the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB in right triangles. 4. The coordinates of the center of the inscribed circle I are (r, r) where r = a + b - R. This result follows because the incenter I of a right triangle divides the legs into segments whose sums equal the hypotenuse minus the inradius. 5.

Since ( gcd(b_n c_n, c_n) = gcd(b_n, c_n) = 1 ), it follows that (gcd(b_{n+1}, c_{n+1}) = 1). 4. **Rational square condition:** For (frac{b_n}{c_n}) to be a square of a rational number, both ( b_n ) and ( c_n ) must be squares of integers. We focus on the sequence ( c_n ): - Initial value ( c_0 = 1 ). - From the recurrence relation, ( c_{n+1} = b_n c_n ).

Given a secondorder arithmetic progression {a_{n}} where a_{1}=2, a_{2}=3, a_{3}=5, find a_{100}.","output":"To determine a_{100} in the given second-order arithmetic progression where a_{1}=2, a_{2}=3, and a_{3}=5, we first identify the pattern of differences between consecutive terms. Since {a_{n}} is a second-order arithmetic progression, the differences {a_{n}-a_{n-1}} form a first-order arithmetic progression (i.e., a regular arithmetic progression). We note that a_{2}-a_{1}=3-2=1 and a_{3}-a_{2}=5-3=2. This shows that the common difference of the arithmetic progression formed by the differences between consecutive terms is 1. Therefore, for any term in the sequence, the difference between it and its previous term can be expressed as: [a_{n}-a_{n-1}=n-1.] Starting from a_{2}-a_{1}=1, and following the pattern, we find that to reach a_{n} from a_{1}, the sum of the differences is: [1+2+⋯+(n-1)=frac{n(n-1)}{2}.] Therefore, the nth term of the sequence, a_{n}, can be calculated from the first term, a_{1}=2, by adding the sum of the differences: [a_{n}=a_{1}+frac{n(n-1)}{2}=2+frac{n(n-1)}{2}.] Substituting n=100 to find a_{100}: [a_{100}=2+frac{100(100-1)}{2}=2+50times 99=2+4950=4952.] Therefore, the 100th term of the sequence, a_{100}, is boxed{4952}."},{"instruction":"Given f(x)= begin{cases} f(x5),xgeqslant 0 log _{3}(x),x < 0 end{cases}, find the value of f(2017).","output":"From f(x)= begin{cases} f(x-5),xgeqslant 0 log _{3}(-x),x < 0 end{cases}, We can see that when xgeqslant 0, f(x+5)=f(x+5-5)=f(x), This implies that f(x+5k)=f(x), where k is a positive integer, Thus, f(2017)=f(403times5+2)=f(2)=f(-3)=log _{3}3=1. So the answer is: boxed{1}. This is because from the piecewise function, when xgeqslant 0, f(x+5k)=f(x), where k is a positive integer.

Multiplying these terms gives (3x^5)(4x^{11}) = 12x^{16}. So, the degree of this part is 16. 2. **Degree of the binomial raised to a power**: The expression (x^3 + 4)^6 is expanded by considering the highest degree term, which arises by choosing x^3 from each factor, resulting in (x^3)^6 = x^{18}.

We'll show that the centroid of (triangle PQR) is also (K). 3. Note that the sides of (triangle PQR) are perpendicular bisectors of the segments (SA, SB,) and (SC). 4. This problem simplifies to proving that the perpendicular bisectors of sides of (triangle ABC) are concurrent at point (K). By definition, point (K) is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of ( triangle ABC ) intersect since (K) is the circumcenter. 5. Let's denote the midpoints of (BC, CA,) and (AB) by (A_0, B_0,) and (C_0) respectively. Denote by (T) the midpoint of (PQ) and the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of (AB). 6.

Note that (T)'s projection onto (AB) is (C_0), the midpoint of (AB). 7. To complete the proof, we show that (C_0) bisects (ED), implying (A_0D = EB): Since (CS) is the radical axis of the circles circumscribing (triangle ABS) and (triangle BCS), we have: [ C_0F cdot C_0A = C_0G cdot C_0B ] 8. Given (C_0 A = C_0 B), divide through by (C_0A) to obtain: [ C_0F = C_0G ] 9. As (C_0) is the midpoint, it follows that: [ AF = BG ] 10. Since (AF) and (BG) are chords of the circles circumscribing (triangle BCS) and (triangle CAS) respectively, the points (D) and (E) are midpoints due to the perpendicular bisectors from the circle's center to the chords. Thus: [ AD = EB ] 11. Finally, since (A_0D = EB), it implies (C_0) indeed bisects (ED).

We'll denote the area of the figure as ( A_f ) and the area of a cell as ( A_c ). 2. **Positioning the Figure**: Place the figure arbitrarily on the graph paper. This means that the figure can be freely placed anywhere on the grid without any initial constraints on its position relative to the grid lines. 3. **Partitioning the Paper**: Cut the graph paper along the lines of the grid, resulting in a collection of cells. Each of these cells is of area ( A_c ). Move and stack the cut-out cells such that all cuts are parallel and cells are not rotated during the moving process. This ensures that the gridlines remain aligned correctly. 4. **Projection Consideration**: Next, project the contents of our stacked cells onto a single cell. Because the figure ( F ) covers an area ( A_f ) which is less than ( A_c ), it is impossible for the projections of the parts of ( F ) to cover the entire cell. There will always be some part of the cell left uncovered by the projections. 5. **Analyzing Projection on a Cell**: Recall how the figure ( F ) was originally placed on the paper. Shift the entire grid of the graph paper in a parallel manner, so that vertices of the grid align with the points that do not overlap any vertex in the projection onto a single cell. This shifting ensures that the figure will be placed such that it avoids all vertices. 6. **Resulting Configuration**: After aligning like described above, none of the vertices of the cells in the grid will be covered by any part of the figure ( F ). This ensures that the figure avoids covering any vertex of the cells when placed. # Conclusion: Thus, it is proven that a figure with an area less than that of a cell can be positioned on an infinite grid of graph paper without covering any vertices of the cells.

We can calculate the total number of coins without the nickels: 4 dimes + 16 quarters = 4 + 16 = 20 coins Since Linda has 35 coins in total, we can find out the total number of nickels by subtracting the number of dimes and quarters from the total number of coins: 35 total coins - 20 (dimes and quarters) = 15 nickels We already know that Linda initially had 5 nickels, so we can find out the number of nickels her mother gave her by subtracting the initial number of nickels from the total number of nickels: 15 nickels (total) - 5 nickels (initial) = 10 nickels (from mother) Now, we can find the ratio of the number of nickels her mother gives her to the number of nickels Linda has initially: Number of nickels from mother : Number of nickels initially = 10 : 5 This ratio can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 5: 10 : 5 = 2 : 1 So, the ratio of the number of nickels her mother gives her to the number of nickels Linda has initially is boxed{2:1} ."},{"instruction":"he total number of digit used in numbering the pages of a book having 366 pages , is","output":"To find the total number of digits used in numbering the pages of a book with 366 pages, we need to consider the number of digits on each page number.

We need to find r such that the probability of seeing exactly three sides of the hexagon from a random point on the circle is 1/2. 2. **Visualizing the Geometry**: The hexagon is regular and concentric with the circle. From any point on the circle, certain arcs will allow a view of exactly three sides of the hexagon. We need to determine these arcs. 3. **Determining the Arcs**: By projecting two non-adjacent and non-opposite sides of the hexagon to the circle, we define an arc where three sides are visible. There are six such pairs of sides, resulting in six arcs. 4. **Calculating the Total Arc Measure**: The probability of choosing a point on one of these arcs is 1/2. Therefore, the total measure of these arcs is frac{1}{2} cdot 360^circ = 180^circ.

Let P be the intersection of the projections of the corresponding hexagon sides on the line overline{AB}. 6. **Properties of Triangle APO**: Triangle APO is isosceles with angle AOP = 15^circ and angle OAP = 15^circ (since angle OAB = 30^circ and each angle at O is split evenly). 7. **Using Trigonometry**: In triangle APO, drop a perpendicular from P to OA at point D. Since triangle AOD is a right triangle, we use cos 15^circ = frac{AD}{OA} = frac{OP}{2r}, where OP is the distance from the center to a side of the hexagon, which is 2sqrt{3} (since the hexagon's side length is 2 and it is regular). 8. **Calculating r**: We know cos 15^circ = frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4}. Setting up the equation: [ frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{2r} implies r = frac{2sqrt{3}}{frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4}} = left(frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4}right) cdot 4sqrt{3} = 3sqrt{2} + sqrt{6} ] 9. **Conclusion**: The radius r that satisfies the given condition is 3sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}.

Start by considering which values from the sequence ( 1, 2, ldots, 1987 ) are greater than or equal to 994. 2. **Counting High Values**: Since there are ( 1987 ) numbers, the numbers which are greater than or equal to ( 994 ) are ( 994, 995, ldots, 1987 ). The number of such values is: [ 1987 - 994 + 1 = 994 ] This shows that half (actually more than half) of the values in the sequence are at least ( 994 ). 3. **Analyzing Positions**: Because ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{1987} ) is a permutation of ( 1, 2, ldots, 1987 ), the high values (the ones equal or greater than ( 994 )) could appear in any position in the sequence.

The rest is: 75 stuffies - 30 stuffies = 45 stuffies Now, Jean distributes these 45 stuffies among her 3 friends and her sister Janet in the ratio 3:4:2:5. To find out how many stuffies each person gets, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio. Total parts in the ratio = 3 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 14 parts Now, we need to find out what one part is equivalent to in terms of the stuffies. One part = Total stuffies given away / Total parts in the ratio One part = 45 stuffies / 14 parts One part = 45/14 stuffies Now, we can find out how many stuffies Janet gets by multiplying the number of parts that correspond to her by the value of one part. Janet's share in the ratio = 5 parts Janet's stuffies = 5 parts * (45/14 stuffies per part) Janet's stuffies = (5 * 45) / 14 Janet's stuffies = 225 / 14 Janet's stuffies = 16 with a remainder of 1 Since we can't give away a fraction of a stuffy, Janet gets boxed{16} stuffies."},{"instruction":"The monthly incomes of A and B are in the ratio 5 : 2.

Given: C_m = Rs. 14,000 A's annual income = Rs. 470,400 First, we need to find A's monthly income (A_m). Since there are 12 months in a year, we divide the annual income by 12 to get the monthly income. A_m = Rs. 470,400 / 12 A_m = Rs. 39,200 Now, we know that the ratio of A's to B's monthly income is 5:2. Let's use this ratio to find B's monthly income (B_m). A_m / B_m = 5 / 2 B_m = (2 / 5) * A_m B_m = (2 / 5) * Rs. 39,200 B_m = (2 * 39,200) / 5 B_m = 78,400 / 5 B_m = Rs. 15,680 Now we have B's monthly income. To find the percentage by which B's monthly income is more than C's monthly income, we use the following formula: Percentage Increase = [(B_m - C_m) / C_m] * 100% Percentage Increase = [(Rs. 15,680 - Rs. 14,000) / Rs. 14,000] * 100% Percentage Increase = [Rs. 1,680 / Rs. 14,000] * 100% Percentage Increase = 0.12 * 100% Percentage Increase = 12% Therefore, B's monthly income is boxed{12%} more than C's monthly income."},{"instruction":"Miley bought some cellphones for her parents.

The cost of one cellphone is 800, so without the discount, the total cost for ( n ) cellphones would be ( 800n ). Since Miley is receiving a 5% discount for buying more than one cellphone, we need to calculate the discounted price. A 5% discount means that Miley will pay 95% of the total cost (100% - 5% = 95%). The discounted total cost for ( n ) cellphones is therefore ( 0.95 times 800n ). We know that Miley paid 1520, so we can set up the equation: [ 0.95 times 800n = 1520 ] Now, let's solve for ( n ): [ 760n = 1520 ] Divide both sides by 760 to find ( n ): [ n = frac{1520}{760} ] [ n = 2 ] Miley bought boxed{2} cellphones."},{"instruction":"Find the value of (m + b) for the line that passes through the points ((2, 1)) and ((1, 4)).","output":"1. **Calculate the slope (m)**: Using the formula for the slope between two points ((x_1, y_1)) and ((x_2, y_2)), where our points are ((2, -1)) (point A) and ((-1, 4)) (point B): [ m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{4 - (-1)}{-1 - 2} = frac{5}{-3} = -frac{5}{3} ] 2. **Use one of the points to find b**: Substitute point A ((2, -1)) into the line equation (y = mx + b): [ -1 = -frac{5}{3} cdot 2 + b implies -1 = -frac{10}{3} + b implies b = -1 + frac{10}{3} = frac{7}{3} ] 3. **Find (m + b)**: Combine the slope and the y-intercept: [ m + b = -frac{5}{3} + frac{7}{3} = frac{2}{3} ] (boxed{frac{2}{3}}) is the value of (m + b)."},{"instruction":"An isosceles triangle has one angle that is 40% larger than the measure of a right angle.

The sum of distances between pairs of points of the same color is zero because there are no pairs of the same color. The sum of distances between pairs of points of different colors is the distance between the blue point and the red point, which is positive. Thus, the statement holds trivially. 2. **Inductive Step:**    Assume the statement holds for ( n = k ). That is, for ( k ) blue points and ( k ) red points, the sum of distances between pairs of points of the same color does not exceed the sum of distances between pairs of points of different colors.    We need to show that the statement holds for ( n = k + 1 ).     Let ( x_0 le x_1 le cdots le x_k ) be the coordinates of the blue points and ( y_0 le y_1 le cdots le y_k ) be the coordinates of the red points.

The sum of distances between pairs of points of the same color for these ( k ) points is less than or equal to the sum of distances between pairs of points of different colors. When we add back the points ( x_k ) and ( y_k ), the additional distances between pairs of the same color are ( sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (x_k - x_i) + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (y_k - y_i) ). The additional distances between pairs of different colors are ( sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (x_k - y_i) + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (y_k - x_i) ). Since ( x_k ge y_k ge x_{k-1} ), the sum of distances between pairs of different colors is greater than or equal to the sum of distances between pairs of the same color.    **Case 2: ( y_k < x_{k-1} )**    Continuously increase ( y_k ) until it reaches ( x_{k-1} ). During this operation, the difference between the sum of the distances between differently colored points and the distances between similarly colored points is non-increasing.

The sum of distances between pairs of points of the same color for these ( k ) points is less than or equal to the sum of distances between pairs of points of different colors. Adding back the points ( x_k ) and ( y_k ) as in Case 1, the sum of distances between pairs of different colors is greater than or equal to the sum of distances between pairs of the same color.

Lemma 1: If r_1, r_2, ldots , r_n are non-negative reals and x_1, x_2, ldots x_n are reals, then [ sum_{i, j}min(r_{i}, r_{j}) x_{i}x_{j}ge 0. ] **Proof of Lemma 1:** Assume without loss of generality that the sequence {r_i} is increasing.

We need to find the length ( OC ), given that ( AB = 6 ). 2. **Construct the Square:**    - Let the vertices of the square be ( A, B, D, E ), where ( D ) and ( E ) are outside the triangle and ( ABDE ) forms the square.     - Given that ( AB ) is a side of the square and ( AB = 6 ), all sides of the square are equal to 6. 3. **Diagonal of the Square:**    - The diagonal ( AD ) of the square forms a right angle of ( 45^circ ) with any of its sides (since all angles in a square are ( 90^circ )).    - The length of the diagonal ( AD ) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:      [      AD = sqrt{AB^2 + AD^2} = sqrt{6^2 + 6^2} = sqrt{36 + 36} = sqrt{72} = 6sqrt{2}      ] 4. **Understanding the Circumscribed Circle:**    - Note that the quadrilateral ( ACBD ) can be inscribed in a circle. This means ( angle ACB + angle ADB = 180^circ ).    - Given ( angle ACB = 135^circ ), the angles ( angle ADB = 45^circ ). As the diagonals of a square intersect at ( 45^circ ), ( O ), the center of the square, is the midpoint of the diagonal. 5. **Radius of the Circumscribed Circle:**    - The radius ( OC ) of the circle circumscribing ( ACBD ) is half of diagonal ( AD ) of the square, since ( O ) is at the midpoint.      [      OC = frac{1}{2} times 6sqrt{2} = 3sqrt{2}      ]      Conclusion Thus, the length ( OC ) is ( 3sqrt{2} ).

If k! has r+s+11 digits, the first four digits must lie between y and y+1 or from y+100. In this way, the first four digits could be derived from y. 8. **Ensuring All Combinations:**    For r geq 6 and considering x = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 10^6 - 1, the first four digits of 10^6 possible k! will cover all possible 4-digit numbers.

Thus, no finite solutions exist if we have (1 - c neq 0), (1 - b neq 0), (1 - a neq 0), and (a + b + c + abc neq 0). For the existence of solutions, one of the following conditions must hold: 1.

What is the maximum number of numbers that could remain uncrossed?","output":"1. We start by noting that the quadratic equation ( x^2 + ax + b = 0 ) has real roots if and only if its discriminant is non-negative. The discriminant ( D ) is given by:    [    D = a^2 - 4b    ]    The equation will have real roots if and only if ( D geq 0 ). This gives us the inequality:    [    a^2 - 4b geq 0 quad Rightarrow quad a^2 geq 4b    ]    Therefore, any two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) from the remaining list of numbers must satisfy ( a^2 geq 4b ). 2. To maximize the number of remaining numbers, observe that increasing ( a ) and decreasing ( b ) makes the inequality ( a^2 geq 4b ) harder to satisfy. We need to find the largest possible subset of numbers from 1 to 100 such that for any ( a ) and ( b ) in this subset, the inequality holds. 3. Let ( m ) be the smallest and ( M ) be the largest number in the selected subset.

The numbers that can be retained, therefore, range from 20 to 100. The total number of integers from 20 to 100 (inclusive) is given by:    [    100 - 20 + 1 = 81    ]    Therefore, it is possible to retain up to 81 numbers. 6.

Each unique pair of the 10 fillings is used exactly once:    [    binom{10}{2} = 45    ]    This is correct as we need all combinations of 2 fillings out of 10. 2. **Explanation of the trick details:**    - Vasya breaks ( n ) pies and learns their fillings.    - He must then identify at least one filling of any remaining pies without breaking them. 3. **Logical Deduction:**    - If Vasya breaks fewer than 36 pies, then more than 9 pies would remain. Assuming the worst case where the remaining pies each have different fillings.    - If fewer than 36 pies are broken, it implies at least 10 pies are left. In the worst case, these 10 pies could each lack one of the possible 10 fillings. 4. **Calculate minimum number of pies ( n ) required:**    - Consider ( n < 36 ):      - There would be at least 10 pies left unbroken.      - Since there are only 9 pies each containing a specific filling pair.      - Therefore, among the remaining pies, there is at least one pie that does not contain a specific filling.      - In this case, Vasya cannot guarantee knowing at least one filling in any remaining pie because he might pick a pie with a filling he hasn't seen yet. 5. **Verification when ( n = 36 ):**    - If Vasya breaks exactly 36 pies, 9 pies will remain.    - There are only 9 possible ways to have pairs of fillings (each filling appears in exactly 9 pies).    - By breaking 36 pies, Vasya can ensure that he has seen at least one of every filling type.    - This means that each of the 9 remaining pies must have a filling type that Vasya has already seen, hence he can confidently identify at least one filling in each remaining pie. # Conclusion: This ensures that ( n = 36 ) is the minimum number of pies Vasya needs to break in order for the trick to work.

We will draw horizontal support lines l and m, which pass through some vertices of the polygon (in this case, the top vertex X and the bottom vertex A), but do not contain any internal points of the polygon. 2. **Setup the Leading Segment**:    Name the diagonal (or side) AX as the leading segment for the support lines l and m. We will rotate lines l and m such that they remain parallel and as support lines while observing how the leading segment changes. 3. **Observing Changes**:    Initially, let our support lines touch the sides of the polygon as illustrated. The first significant event occurs when one of the support lines, say l, coincides with a side of the polygon. This changes our leading segment. 4. **Angle Calculation**:    For instance, in the figure, when l coincides with the side AB, then XH is the new leading segment. Note that the leading segment has rotated counterclockwise by the angle AXH, which is the angle at which the side AB is perceived from the most distant vertex X (this is also the vertex X which provides the maximum angle view for AB). 5. **Summing All Changes**:    As we continue rotating the lines l and m by 180^circ, they will interchange positions while maintaining their roles as support lines, encountering and aligning with each side of the polygon exactly once. This allows the leading segment to traverse each leading diagonal of the polygon, covering all those angles previously discussed. 6. **Result**:    Since every support line will encounter and align with each polygon side just once, and the leading segment will return to its initial position after a rotation of 180^circ with all angles considered, the total angle formed sums to: [ text{Sum of all angles} = 180^circ ] This results in the conclusion of our proof.

The probability of then picking a letter from Ronda's name is frac{5}{9}, because there are 5 letters from Ronda's name out of the remaining 9 cards.    - Therefore, the combined probability for this scenario is frac{5}{10} cdot frac{5}{9} = frac{5}{18}. 2. **Probability of picking a letter from Ronda's name first, then Cybil's name:**    - Similarly, the probability of picking a letter from Ronda's name out of the 10 cards is frac{5}{10}.    - After picking a letter from Ronda's name, the probability of then picking a letter from Cybil's name is frac{5}{9}, for the same reasons as above.    - Therefore, the combined probability for this scenario is also frac{5}{10} cdot frac{5}{9} = frac{5}{18}. 3. **Total probability of picking one letter from each sister's name:**    - To find the total probability of one letter being selected from each sister's name, we add the probabilities of the two scenarios together: frac{5}{18} + frac{5}{18} = frac{10}{18}.    - Simplifying the fraction frac{10}{18} gives us frac{5}{9}.

The domain of f(x) must be symmetric about the origin. The domain is defined by the conditions x neq -1 and x neq a. For the domain to be symmetric and for f(x) to be odd, we must have a = -1 or the negative of any other number in the domain. However, the solution states a=1, which seems to be a mistake in the interpretation of the domain's symmetry. The correct interpretation should focus on ensuring the function's symmetry, which is achieved if a is chosen such that the excluded values are symmetric. Thus, the correct statement should involve recognizing the need for symmetry in the domain, but the conclusion that a=1 directly ensures the function is odd is not accurate without further justification. The correct analysis should involve checking f(-x) = -f(x) explicitly. **For Option B:** Given f(x)=frac{x}{(x+1)(x-a)} and setting a=1 based on the initial solution, we simplify the function to f(x)=frac{x}{x^2-1}. The domain is determined by the condition x^2-1 neq 0, which simplifies to x neq pm 1. Therefore, the domain is left(-infty, -1right) cup left(-1, 1right) cup left(1, +inftyright). This shows that the domain is not limited to left(-1, 1right), making option B incorrect. **For Option C:** To find the range of f(x)=frac{x}{x^2-1}, we consider the equation y = frac{x}{x^2-1}. Rearranging, we get yx^2 - x - y = 0. The discriminant of this quadratic equation in terms of x is Delta = (-1)^2 - 4(y)(-y) = 1 + 4y^2. Since Delta geq 0 for all real y, it implies that for every real y, there exists a real x that satisfies the equation. Therefore, the range of f(x) is mathbb{R}, making option C correct. **For Option D:** Considering f(x)=frac{x}{x^2-1} and transforming it into f(x)=frac{1}{x-frac{1}{x}}, let t = x - frac{1}{x}. Then, y = frac{1}{t}. The function t = x - frac{1}{x} is increasing for its domain because the derivative t' = 1 + frac{1}{x^2} is always positive for x neq 0. However, y = frac{1}{t} is a decreasing function because as t increases, y decreases. This means f(x) does not have intervals where it is increasing over its entire domain, making option D incorrect. Therefore, the correct choices, after careful analysis, are C. However, the initial solution incorrectly identifies option A as correct without proper justification and overlooks the precise reasoning needed for the odd function property and the domain's symmetry. The correct conclusion should be drawn based on a detailed analysis of the function's properties, leading to boxed{C} as the correct choice."},{"instruction":"the diagram, triangles ABC and CDE are isosceles.

Therefore, we can cover ( S ) with a finite number of such balls. 2. **Step 2: Banach-Tarski Paradox (Informal usage)**     - According to the Banach-Tarski paradox, we can decompose the ball (in ( mathbb{R}^3 )) into a finite number of disjoint pieces and, by only using rigid motions, reconstruct two balls of the same size as the original.     - Although Banach-Tarski paradox does not work in higher dimensions or with such precise control, here we use a similar mindset: decomposing subsets into smaller balls and reassembling them.     - Decompose ( S ) into smaller subsets such that each subset can fit into a ball of radius ( 1 ). 3. **Step 3: Assembling new parts**     - Pair up these smaller subsets to form new parts, which again are within balls of radius ( 1 ). Continue this process of pairing and assembling.     - Ultimately, this decomposition and reassembling will result in subsets (balls) of radius ( 1 ). 4. **Step 4: Utilizing decomposition for different radii**     - Now consider that if the included ball in the initial set ( S ) has a different radius, say ( r ), the same method can be applied.     - Decompose the subset of balls of radius ( 1 ) into even smaller parts that can be reassembled into portions of a ball of radius ( r ).     - Finally, by assembling these parts, one can obtain the ball of the original radius ( r ). 5. **Step 5: Application of the Cantor-Bernstein theorem**     - By utilizing a form of the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, which states that if there exists an injective function from set ( A ) to set ( B ) and vice versa, then there exists a bijective function between ( A ) and ( B ) (establishing their equivalence), we can conclude the decomposability.     - With an appropriate function that maps parts of the regenerated subsets to the original set, it follows that ( S ) is decomposable into balls of any radius that includes a ball of the set ( S ). 6. **Conclusion**     - By the equivalence in decomposability, any bounded set in (mathbb{R}^n) that includes a ball can be decomposed into any subset including that ball.      - This results in the assertion that any bounded set that includes a ball can be decomposed in terms of a ball of radius ( 1 ) and vice versa.

If we try to place ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ), we must cover all three vertices of ( T ).    - Given the symmetry and equal side length constraints, at least one of the vertices of ( T ) must belong to both ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ). 6. **Possible Overlaps**:    - If one vertex of ( T ) is covered by both ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ), then the remaining parts of ( T ) would still need to be covered by the areas of ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ) respectively. 7. **Contradiction by Area**:    - The area of ( T ) is greater than the combined area of ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ) since both ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ) are strictly smaller.    - This leads to a contradiction because two smaller triangles cannot fully cover a larger triangle without overlapping. 8. **Summing Up Overlaps**:    - Even overlapping cannot resolve the issue since the smaller triangles do not increase in their combined area enough to cover ( T ). 9. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, it is impossible for two strictly smaller equilateral triangles to completely cover an equilateral triangle.

Let sigma(a_{1}) = a_{2}, sigma(a_{2}) = a_{3}, ldots, sigma(a_{k}) = a_{1} and the numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k} are pairwise distinct.

This transposition can cause inversions to either appear or disappear only between sigma(i), sigma(j), and other elements sigma(k). 3. **Changes in Inversions:**    - Let’s analyze the specific pairs ((i, j)) and ((i, k), (j, k)) while swapping (sigma(i)) and (sigma(j)):      - If i < j and before the swap sigma(i) > sigma(j), then ((i, j)) is an inversion.      - When sigma(i) and sigma(j) are swapped, this specific inversion disappears. Similarly:        - Pairs involving k would create or eliminate inversions depending on their relative order positions.        - If sigma(k) is between sigma(i) and sigma(j), then it impacts the count of inversions. 4. **Count Verification:**    - Check if the combination and positions of k systematically impact the count:      - For k such that sigma(i) > sigma(k) > sigma(j), new inversions may be created.      - The key is to recognize that every interchange is directly impacting an even number of these pairs hence overall maintaining or flipping the parity. 5. **Conclusion:**    - Each transposition affects the total number of inversions by an odd count (precisely one or reinverting pairs), hence altering parity from even to odd or vice versa.

Suppose also that AE = CF. We need to prove that DE = DF.  First Method: 1. **Identify Angles and Properties of the Cyclic Quadrilateral:**     Suppose angle EAD = alpha. So, angle BAD = 180^circ - alpha, because angles on a straight line sum up to 180^circ. 2. **Sum of Opposite Angles for a Cyclic Quadrilateral:**     Since ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, we use the property that the sum of the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180^circ:     [     angle BCD = 180^circ - angle BAD = 180^circ - (180^circ - alpha) = alpha.     ]     Therefore, angle FCD = 180^circ - alpha. 3. **Applying the Law of Sines:**     By the Law of Sines for triangle ADE:     [     frac{AE}{sin angle EDA} = frac{DE}{sin alpha}.     ]     Thus,     [     DE = frac{AE sin alpha}{sin angle EDA}.     ]     By the Law of Sines for triangle CFD:     [     frac{CF}{sin angle CDF} = frac{DF}{sin (180^circ - alpha)}.     ]     But sin (180^circ - alpha) = sin alpha, so:     [     frac{CF}{sin angle CDF} = frac{DF}{sin alpha}.     ]     Solving for DF:     [     DF = frac{CF sin alpha}{sin angle CDF}.     ] 4. **Equating the Expressions for DE and DF:**     Since AE = CF (given in the problem):     [     DE = frac{AE sin alpha}{sin angle EDA} = frac{CF sin alpha}{sin angle CDF} = DF.     ]     Also, angle EDA = angle CDF (as vertically opposite angles).     Therefore, DE = DF.  Second Method: 1. **Choose a Point G:**     On the extension of ray DA beyond point A, select point G such that AG = DC. 2. **Triangle Properties:**     Notice that segment AE is common, AG = DC (by construction), and angle GAE = 180^circ - angle DAE = angle DCF (as shown in the first method). 3. **Congruence of Triangles:**     Triangles GAE and DCF are congruent by the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) congruence criterion. Therefore, angle AGE = angle CDF, and subsequently angle CDF = angle ADE. 4. **Isosceles Triangle:**     In triangle GDE, we now have equal angles angle DGE and angle GDE, making it an isosceles triangle, so GE = DE.     Also from triangle congruences, since GAE cong DCF, we conclude GE = DF.

First, we know that her rent is 1200, and this is half of what she spends on food and travel expenses. So, her food and travel expenses would be 2 times her rent, which is: 2 * 1200 = 2400 Now, we add her rent and food and travel expenses to find her total monthly expenses: 1200 (rent) + 2400 (food and travel) = 3600 Since Shelby moved in with her to share the rent, they would split the rent cost in half. So, Kathryn's share of the rent would now be: 1200 / 2 = 600 We need to adjust her total monthly expenses by subtracting the amount she saves on rent now that Shelby is sharing the cost: 3600 (original expenses) - 600 (saved on rent) = 3000 After all her expenses, Kathryn has 2000 remaining.

Given: For any two angles ( alpha ) and ( beta ) of ( triangle ABC ), there exists an angle in the quadrilateral that equals ( alpha + beta ). We need to prove that ( triangle ABC ) is isosceles. 1. **Step 1: Assumptions and Representations**      Denote the angles of the quadrilateral as ( x, y, z, ) and ( w ). 2. **Step 2: Properties of Triangles and Quadrilateral Angles**      Recall that the sum of the angles in a triangle is ( 180^circ ):    [    alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ    ]    Also, the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is ( 360^circ ):    [    x + y + z + w = 360^circ    ] 3. **Step 3: Using the Given Condition**      According to the problem, for any two angles of the triangle, there is a corresponding angle in the quadrilateral that matches their sum:    So, we have:    [    x = alpha + beta, quad y = beta + gamma, quad z = gamma + alpha    ] 4. **Step 4: Summation and Substitution**      Sum these equations:    [    x + y + z = (alpha + beta) + (beta + gamma) + (gamma + alpha)    ]    Simplify the right-hand side:    [    x + y + z = 2alpha + 2beta + 2gamma = 2(alpha + beta + gamma)    ]    Recall ( alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ ):    [    x + y + z = 2 cdot 180^circ = 360^circ    ] 5. **Step 5: Compare to the Quadrilateral Sum**      Since ( x + y + z = 360^circ ), and we know ( x + y + z + w = 360^circ ), it follows that ( w = 0^circ ).    Since an angle of zero degrees in a quadrilateral is not geometrically feasible, we need to reassess our situation based on the given conditions. 6. **Step 6: Symmetric Angles in Triangle**      From the given conditions:    - If ( alpha + beta = beta + gamma ), then ( alpha = gamma ).    - If ( beta + gamma = gamma + alpha ), then ( beta = alpha ).    - If ( alpha + gamma = alpha + beta ), hence ( gamma = beta ).

Probability of winning exactly 4 games:    - This can happen in binom{5}{4} = 5 different ways (choosing 4 games to win out of 5).    - The probability for each scenario is left(frac{3}{5}right)^4 left(frac{2}{5}right)^1.    - So, P(text{win exactly 4 games}) = 5 times left(frac{3}{5}right)^4 left(frac{2}{5}right). 2.

Find  AD .","output":"1. Given that (ABCD) is a cyclic quadrilateral inscribed in a circle of radius (5), with (AB = 6), (BC = 7), and (CD = 8), we need to find the length of (AD). 2. Since (ABCD) is a cyclic quadrilateral, we can use Ptolemy's Theorem, which states that for a cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD):    [    AB cdot CD + AD cdot BC = AC cdot BD    ] 3. To apply Ptolemy's Theorem, we need to find the lengths of diagonals (AC) and (BD). However, we can use the fact that the circle's radius is (5) to find these lengths. 4. First, we find the length of diagonal (AC). Since (AB) and (BC) are given, we can use the Law of Cosines in (triangle ABC):    [    AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 cdot AB cdot BC cdot cos(angle ABC)    ]    However, we need (angle ABC), which we can find using the fact that (triangle ABC) is inscribed in a circle. 5. Similarly, we find the length of diagonal (BD). Since (BC) and (CD) are given, we can use the Law of Cosines in (triangle BCD):    [    BD^2 = BC^2 + CD^2 - 2 cdot BC cdot CD cdot cos(angle BCD)    ]    Again, we need (angle BCD), which we can find using the fact that (triangle BCD) is inscribed in a circle. 6. Instead of finding the angles, we can use the fact that the circle's radius is (5) and the given side lengths to find the diagonals directly. 7. Using the given solution's hint, we can split (triangle AOB) and (triangle COD) into right triangles. Since the radius is (5), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the diagonals. 8. For (triangle AOB), we have:    [    AO = BO = 5    ]    Since (AB = 6), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the altitude from (O) to (AB):    [    left(frac{AB}{2}right)^2 + h^2 = 5^2    ]    [    left(frac{6}{2}right)^2 + h^2 = 25    ]    [    9 + h^2 = 25    ]    [    h^2 = 16    ]    [    h = 4    ] 9. Similarly, for (triangle COD), we have:    [    CO = DO = 5    ]    Since (CD = 8), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the altitude from (O) to (CD):    [    left(frac{CD}{2}right)^2 + h^2 = 5^2    ]    [    left(frac{8}{2}right)^2 + h^2 = 25    ]    [    16 + h^2 = 25    ]    [    h^2 = 9    ]    [    h = 3    ] 10.

Pipe A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1 pool per 8 hours, or (frac{1}{8}) of the pool per hour. Pipe B can fill the pool in 12 hours, so its rate is 1 pool per 12 hours, or (frac{1}{12}) of the pool per hour. Pipe C can fill the pool in 16 hours, so its rate is 1 pool per 16 hours, or (frac{1}{16}) of the pool per hour. When all three pipes are used together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: (frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{12} + frac{1}{16}) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8, 12, and 16 is 48. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 48: (frac{1}{8} = frac{6}{48}) (because (8 times 6 = 48)) (frac{1}{12} = frac{4}{48}) (because (12 times 4 = 48)) (frac{1}{16} = frac{3}{48}) (because (16 times 3 = 48)) Now we can add the fractions: (frac{6}{48} + frac{4}{48} + frac{3}{48} = frac{13}{48}) This means that when all three pipes are used together, they can fill (frac{13}{48}) of the pool per hour. To find out how many hours it will take to fill the pool, we need to divide 1 (the whole pool) by the combined rate: (1 div frac{13}{48} = frac{48}{13}) (frac{48}{13}) hours is approximately 3.69 hours.

Thus, we will focus on a (4 times 4) portion of the chessboard and the corresponding quarter circle with radius 4.  3. **Area Calculation in One Quarter:**    - The total area of the quarter circle is:       [      text{Area}_{text{quarter circle}} = frac{1}{4} pi r^2 = frac{1}{4} pi times 4^2 = 4pi      ]    - The total area of the (4 times 4) square is:      [      text{Area}_{text{square}} = 4 times 4 = 16      ] 4. **Square Area Distribution:**    In the (4 times 4) square portion, we will differentiate between the areas inside the quarter circle and those outside the quarter circle.    - (S_1') (inside the circle):      - It’s the area of the quarter circle: (S_1' = 4pi)    - (S_2') (outside the circle):      - The remaining area in the (4 times 4) square after subtracting the quarter circle area:      [      S_2' = 16 - 4pi      ] 5. **Extending to Whole Circle:**    Since the entire board and entire circle follow the same proportional areas, for the whole board:    [    S_1 = 4 times S_1' = 4 times 4pi = 16pi    ]    [    S_2 = 4 times S_2' = 4 times (16 - 4pi) = 4 times 16 - 4 times 4pi = 64 - 16pi    ] 6. **Ratio Calculation:**    - The ratio of the areas is:      [      frac{S_1}{S_2} = frac{16pi}{64 - 16pi}      ]    - Approximate values:      - (pi approx 3.14)      - Thus,        [        16pi approx 16 times 3.14 = 50.24        ]        [        64 - 16pi approx 64 - 50.24 = 13.76        ]        [        frac{S_1}{S_2} approx frac{50.24}{13.76} approx 3.65        ] 7. **Conclusion:**    The integer part of this ratio is:    [    boxed{3}    ]"},{"instruction":"Find the sum of all fourdigit numbers that can be formed using the digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) such that each digit appears at most once.","output":"1.

We are interested in finding the sum of all such four-digit numbers.  3. Let’s determine how often each digit appears in each decimal place (units, tens, hundreds, and thousands) within all the permutations of these digits. 4. First, calculate the number of permutations of any four chosen digits (from the five given digits) in a four-digit number:    [    4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24    ]    This means each digit will appear 24 times in each decimal place. 5. Next, find the sum of these digits:    [    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15    ] 6. Now, compute the total sum of the digits in any one decimal place:    [    24 times 15 = 360    ]    Since the sum of digits in each decimal place is 360, we will use this sum to compute the total of all four-digit numbers. 7. A four-digit number can be expressed as:    [    1000a + 100b + 10c + d    ] 8.

First, let's find the slopes of l_{1} and l_{2}. The slope of a line in the form Ax+By+C=0 is given by -frac{A}{B}.  For l_{1}, the slope m_{1} = -frac{a}{a+2}.

Correcting the procedure, we should solve the original equation correctly: [ -frac{a}{a+2} cdot (-frac{1}{a}) = -1 ] leads to [ frac{a}{a^2 + 2a} = -1 ] Multiplying both sides by a^2 + 2a and solving for a correctly should yield a = -3, as per the standard solution provided.

Substituting A from the expression in step 1:    [    a cdot 10^{n-1} + B = 57B    ] 4.

Since a is a digit (i.e., 1 leq a leq 9) and the right-hand side of the equation must include a factor of 7, a must be 7 (as within the digit range, 7 is the only factor of 7).  7.

Rediscovering Literature   Radar   After Mo Yan won the award, I attended a large academic seminar on The Globalization of Chinese Literature, where I expressed a slightly different view in my speech. The issue is no longer whether Chinese literature is going global or not; Chinese literature has already entered the global stage. It is not outside but inside world literature. Mo Yan's award is a clear proof of this. A part of Chinese literature is being accepted and appreciated by the world. Comparing the works of recent Nobel Prizewinning foreign authors with those of some outstanding Chinese authors, I believe ours are not inferior in quality or significance, nor are they behind in literary concepts. This is an important judgment. In a sense, what we need now may be a rediscovery of literature. Why do I say this? Since the 1990s, literature has been marginalized again and again. The circulation and audience size of pure literary journals and books have not increased but decreased. In contrast, there has been a surge in popular consumer culture, including the popularity of images, genres, microblogs, etc., which are extremely hot. We are now in the era of multimedia, images, and shallow reading, or what could be called the era of universal entertainment. Not many people are willing to sit down and read literature quietly. Pleasure reading is replacing soulful reading, and practical reading is overwhelming aesthetic reading. In such an atmosphere, shouldn't we rediscover the value and significance of literature, and reacquaint ourselves with the actual achievements and the shining pearls of contemporary literature? Mo Yan's award means, at least for Chinese literature, the return, establishment, and growth of literary confidence in a certain time and space. We may still remember Lu Xun's attitude towards the Nobel Prize during his lifetime. He thought he was not qualified, and he also thought that others like Lin Yutang were not qualified. The reason was that he was negative about the grand tradition of Chinese classical literature, unwilling for Chinese youth to read ancient Chinese books, and felt that Chinese writers were not mature enough in learning from Western literature, to the extent that he thought he was far behind writers like Gogol and Ibsen. Of course, Lu Xun's words made sense. At that time, China was not only inferior in skill and inferior in system, but its literature had not yet gone global. Over the past 30 years since the reform and opening up, we have proposed to face the world and the future. Throughout the entire 1980s to the present, we have been continuously opening our doors, actively learning from the beneficial aspects of Western culture, boldly experimenting with certain aesthetic experiences of modernism and postmodernism, and gradually establishing our literary confidence. Not only have avantgarde writers competed to write experimental novels, but there has also been a liberation of thought and an explosion of ideas among the entire nation. After a period of calm, this search and exploration have never ceased, but have focused more on the Chinese experience and the localization of tradition. This is a precious spiritual record in the history of contemporary literature. Isn't thirty years a short time? Without this phase, there would not be the achievements of today's Chinese literary world, and more directly, there would not be Mo Yan's award today. Mo Yan is just one of the outstanding representatives of contemporary Chinese literature. He has made many Chinese writers realize that they are already in the midst of the world literary scene, not outside of it. As long as they write Chinese literature to the fullest, and have the conditions to be translated and disseminated, they will be recognized by the world and reap rich rewards. This is a recovery of literary confidence and cultural consciousness.

Calculate the area of the smaller triangles:     begin{aligned}     T_{AFH_1} &= frac{1}{2} cdot frac{2}{3} cdot T = frac{T}{3},     T_{AFH_2} &= frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{3} cdot T = frac{T}{6},     T_{BFN_x} &= frac{1}{2} cdot frac{n-x}{n} cdot T = frac{T (n-x)}{2n},     T_{CH_1N_x} &= frac{1}{3} cdot frac{x}{n} cdot T = frac{T x}{3n},     T_{CH_2N_x} &= frac{2}{3} cdot frac{x}{n} cdot T = frac{2T x}{3n}.     end{aligned} 6. Substitute these areas back into the expressions for the areas of triangle N_x F H_1 and triangle N_x F H_2:     begin{aligned}     T_{N_x F H_1} &= T - left(T_{AFH_1} + T_{BFN_x} + T_{CH_1N_x}right)     &= T - left(frac{T}{3} + frac{T (n-x)}{2n} + frac{T x}{3n}right)     &= T left(1 - frac{1}{3} - frac{n-x}{2n} - frac{x}{3n}right)     &= T cdot frac{n + x}{6n},     end{aligned}     and     begin{aligned}     T_{N_x F H_2} &= T - left(T_{AFH_2} + T_{BFN_x} + T_{CH_2N_x}right)     &= T - left(frac{T}{6} + frac{T (n-x)}{2n} + frac{2T x}{3n}right)     &= T left(1 - frac{1}{6} - frac{n-x}{2n} - frac{2x}{3n}right)     &= T cdot frac{2n - x}{6n}.     end{aligned} 7. Notice that for different values of x, the areas T_{N_x F H_1} and T_{N_x F H_2} will differ. To find triangles of equal areas, we need:     begin{aligned}     T_{N_x F H_1} &= T_{N_y F H_2},      frac{n + x}{6n} &= frac{2n - y}{6n},      n + x &= 2n - y,      y &= n - x.     end{aligned} 8. This equation tells us that each x value corresponds exactly to one y value. Thus, for any chosen T_{N_x F H_1}, there is exactly one T_{N_y F H_2} with an equal area. Therefore, the statement is verified: boxed{x + y = n}"},{"instruction":"2019 students are voting on the distribution of ( N ) items.

Suppose that no student votes for the same person twice. Compute the maximum possible number of items one student can receive, over all possible values of ( N ) and all possible ways of voting.","output":"1. **Identifying the Problem**: The problem involves 2019 students voting on the distribution of ( N ) items. We need to find the maximum possible number of items one student can receive, given that each student only submits one vote per item and no student votes for the same person more than once. 2. **Condition for Receiving an Item**: For a student to receive a particular item, that student must receive the most votes for that item. Because there are 2019 students, to receive any item, a student must receive more than half of the votes if votes are fairly distributed. In case of a tie, no one receives the item, so the minimum to ensure receipt of an item is at least 2 votes. 3. **Analyzing Vote Distribution**: Each student can receive at most one vote from each of the other 2018 students (excluding their own self-vote). Hence, each student can receive a maximum of 2018 votes in total across all items. 4. **Calculating the Maximum**:    - Since each item must have at least 2 votes for a student to secure it,     - We must divide the total number of potential votes by the minimum number of votes required per item:    [    text{Maximum items one student can receive} leq leftlfloor frac{2018}{2} rightrfloor    ]    Calculating this:    [    frac{2018}{2} = 1009 text{ (items)}    ]    The floor function ensures that we consider the integer part, as partial items are not possible. 5. **Constructing a Voting Scenario**:    - **Let's Check Feasibility**: We need to construct a scenario where one student can receive exactly 1009 items. This requires:      - Tailoring the votes so that the selected student gets exactly 2 votes per item they receive.    - Arrange the votes in such a way that for each item, two distinct students vote for the target student. With ( 2019 ) students, each student can arrange their 2018 votes effectively for our scenario.    - This hypothesis holds because:      - For 1009 items, it’s feasible to divide the votes such that one student gets exactly 2 votes per item from different students each time. 6. **Conclusion**:    [    boxed{1009}    ]"},{"instruction":"Set A={(x,y)|y=a}, Set B={(x,y)|y=b^x+1, b>0, bneq 1}.

First, we are given that for a polynomial P(x) of degree ( n ) (where ( P(x) ) is an integer-coefficient polynomial and non-constant), we need to show that there are at most ( n + 2 ) distinct integers ( k ) such that: [ [P(k)]^2 = 1 ] 2. Since ([P(k)]^2 = 1), it implies that ( P(k) ) can only take the values ( +1 ) or ( -1 ). 3. Let ( p ) be the number of distinct integers ( k ) for which ( P(k) = +1 ), and let ( m ) be the number of distinct integers ( k ) for which ( P(k) = -1 ). 4. Define two new polynomials:    [    Q(x) = P(x) - 1 quad text{and} quad R(x) = P(x) + 1    ] 5. Each of these polynomials, ( Q(x) ) and ( R(x) ), will have at most ( n ) distinct roots because a polynomial of degree ( n ) has at most ( n ) distinct roots. 6.

Let the integer roots of ( R(x) ) be ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m ), and let ( x_0 ) be an integer root of ( Q(x) ). 12. Since ( R(x) ) is divisible by:     [     R_1(x) = (x - x_1)(x - x_2) cdots (x - x_m)     ]     we write:     [     R(x) = R_1(x) cdot R_2(x)     ]     where both ( R_1(x) ) and ( R_2(x) ) have integer coefficients (since the coefficients of ( R(x) ) are integers). 13.

Notationally, we say ( p_1 > p_2 ) if player ( p_1 ) beats player ( p_2 ). 1. **Base Case: ( M = 2 )**    When ( M = 2 ), the condition implies that the relation between players is transitive. This means if player ( P_0 ) beats player ( P_1 ) and player ( P_1 ) beats player ( P_2 ), then player ( P_0 ) must also beat player ( P_2 ). This transitivity allows us to uniquely order the players.    - Take the player with the most wins.

Hence, there is an undefeated player.    - Remove this undefeated player and apply the same argument to the remaining ( N-1 ) players.

The condition given is equivalent to there being no cycle of length ( M+1 ). We now split the proof into two cases.    **Case 1: There is an ( M )-cycle ( v_1 > v_2 > cdots > v_M > v_1 )**    - Consider some player ( w ) not in the cycle ( C ). If ( w > v_i ) for some ( i ), then:      [      w > v_i > v_{i+1} > cdots > v_{i-1}      ]      This forms a cycle of length ( M+1 ), where the indices are taken modulo ( M ). Hence, ( w > v_{i-1} ). By similar reasoning, if ( w > v_1 ), then ( w > v_i ) for all ( i ). Similarly, if ( w < v_1 ), then ( w < v_i ) for all ( i ).    - Thus, we can partition the tournament into sets ( A, B, ) and ( C ), where ( A ) beats all members of ( C ), ( C ) beats all members of ( B ), and ( a + b + M = N ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are the sizes of ( A ) and ( B ).    - For any member ( x ) of ( A ) and any member ( y ) of ( B ), we have:      [      x > v_1 > v_2 > cdots > v_{M-1} > y      ]      Hence, ( x > y ).    - We now assign the labels ( {1, cdots, b} ) to ( B ), ( {b+1, cdots, N-a} ) to ( C ), and ( {N-a+1, cdots, N} ) to ( A ). By the inductive hypothesis, we can assign some relative ordering of the labels in each set that is internally consistent with the desired property of the problem in both ( A ) and ( B ). We can label ( C ) arbitrarily in an internally consistent way, as long as the player labeled ( M ) beats the player labeled ( 1 ).    - Since all members of ( A ) beat all members of ( C ), which beat all members of ( B ), the property ( a ge b + M - 1 implies ) player ( a ) beats player ( b ) is vacuously true between two members of any two of ( A, B, C ). Thus, we can construct a valid labeling.    **Case 2: There is no ( M )-cycle**    - By the inductive hypothesis on ( M ), we can label the players in such a way that ( a ge b + M - 2 ) implies ( a ) beats ( b ), which is a strictly stronger condition than the one needed.

According to the information given, the coffee shop sold four times the number of teas plus x to get the number of lattes sold. So, we can write the equation as: 4 * (number of teas) + x = number of lattes We know that the number of teas sold is 6 and the number of lattes sold is 32. Plugging these values into the equation, we get: 4 * 6 + x = 32 Solving for x: 24 + x = 32 Subtract 24 from both sides: x = 32 - 24 x = 8 So, the number that was added to four times the number of teas to get the number of lattes sold is boxed{8} ."},{"instruction":"During the Qing Dynasty, the poet Yuan Mei wrote a poem Moss: The white sun does not reach everywhere, but youth comes just in time.

When the boat is going with the stream (downstream), the effective speed of the boat is ( (x + 6) ) kmph because the stream speed adds to the boat's speed. When the boat is going against the stream (upstream), the effective speed of the boat is ( (x - 6) ) kmph because the stream speed subtracts from the boat's speed. The distance to the place and back is the same, so it is 170 km each way. The time taken to go downstream is ( frac{170}{x + 6} ) hours, and the time taken to go upstream is ( frac{170}{x - 6} ) hours. The total time taken for the round trip is the sum of the time taken to go downstream and upstream, which is given as 68 hours. So, we have the equation: [ frac{170}{x + 6} + frac{170}{x - 6} = 68 ] To solve for ( x ), we first find a common denominator and combine the fractions: [ frac{170(x - 6) + 170(x + 6)}{(x + 6)(x - 6)} = 68 ] [ frac{170x - 1020 + 170x + 1020}{x^2 - 36} = 68 ] [ frac{340x}{x^2 - 36} = 68 ] Now, we cross-multiply to get rid of the fraction: [ 340x = 68(x^2 - 36) ] [ 340x = 68x^2 - 2448 ] Now, we move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero: [ 68x^2 - 340x - 2448 = 0 ] Divide the entire equation by 68 to simplify: [ x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0 ] Now, we factor the quadratic equation: [ (x - 9)(x + 4) = 0 ] So, ( x ) can be 9 or -4.

Additionally, we need to determine the center and the angle of the resultant rotation. We will also consider the case when the sum of the angles is a multiple of 360^circ. # 2. Composition of Rotations: Consider the composition R_B^{beta} circ R_A^{alpha}, where R_A^{alpha} is a rotation by angle alpha around point A, and R_B^{beta} is a rotation by angle beta around point B. # 3. Case When A = B: If A = B, then the composition R_B^{beta} circ R_A^{alpha} is simply a rotation by the angle alpha + beta around point A. This is straightforward. Hence, we will focus on the case when A neq B. # 4. Lines Through Rotation Centers: Let l be the line segment AB. Let a and b be lines passing through A and B, respectively, such that angle(a, l) = frac{alpha}{2} and angle(l, b) = frac{beta}{2}. This means a is rotated by frac{alpha}{2} from l, and b is rotated by frac{beta}{2} from l. # 5. Composition Using Reflections: Using the properties of reflections, we can express the composition R_B^{beta} circ R_A^{alpha} as follows: [  R_B^{beta} circ R_A^{alpha} = S_b circ S_l circ S_l circ S_a = S_b circ S_a. ] Here, S_x denotes reflection across line x. # 6.

Intersecting Lines Case: If lines a and b are not parallel, they intersect at point O. Thus, S_a circ S_b is a rotation around point O by angle 2 theta, where theta is the angle between lines a and b. # 8. Determining the Angle of Rotation: From the alignment of lines a and b, we know theta = frac{alpha}{2} + frac{beta}{2}. Therefore, we get: [ text{Rotation angle} = 2left(frac{alpha}{2} + frac{beta}{2}right) = alpha + beta. ] # 9. Rotation Condition: If alpha + beta is a multiple of 360^circ, say alpha + beta = 2k pi for some integer k, then a | b and the composition becomes a translation.

From the monotonicity, we know g_{max}=g(x_{0})=ln x_{0} -e^{x_{0}}+2=-x_{0}- frac{1}{x_{0}} +2=-x_{0}+ frac{1}{x_{0}} +2, Since x_{0} in left( frac{1}{2}, 1right), hence -x_{0}+ frac{1}{x_{0}} < -2, Therefore, g_{max}=g(x_{0})=-x_{0}+ frac{1}{x_{0}} +2 < 0, This means the graph of g(x)=xf(x)+2 is always below the x-axis. boxed{text{Always below the } xtext{-axis}}."},{"instruction":"Prove the inequality sqrt {2}+ sqrt {7} < sqrt {3}+ sqrt {6} using the most suitable method, which is (　　) A: Synthetic method B: Analytical method C: Indirect proof method D: Reasoning method","output":"To prove the inequality sqrt {2}+ sqrt {7} < sqrt {3}+ sqrt {6}, we only need to prove ( sqrt {2}+ sqrt {7})^{2} < ( sqrt {3}+ sqrt {6})^{2}, which means proving 9+2 sqrt {14} < 9+2 sqrt {18},   thus, we only need to prove sqrt {14} < sqrt {18}, which is equivalent to proving 14 < 18.

The segment BD is constructed as shown. Determine angle ABD in degrees. 1. **Define Additional Point and Triangle**: Let E be the point inside triangle ABC such that triangle EBC is equilateral. This means BE = BC = EC, and all angles in triangle EBC are 60^circ. 2. **Congruence of Triangles**: Connect points A and D to point E. We need to prove that triangle AEB cong triangle AEC. Notice:     - AE = AE (common side),     - AB = AC (given since triangle ABC is isosceles),     - BE = CE (equilateral property of triangle EBC).     With these equalities, the Side-Side-Side (SSS) criterion tells us that triangle AEB cong triangle AEC.      3. **Angle Calculation**: Because triangle AEB cong triangle AEC, corresponding angles in these triangles are equal. Thus,     - angle EAB = angle EAC.     - Since AB = AC and angle A = 20^circ, the angles angle BAE and angle CAE split angle A equally:     [     angle EAB = angle EAC = frac{20^circ}{2} = 10^circ.     ] 4. **Property of AD and BC**:     - Given AD = BC (equilateral property gives BC = BE),     - Therefore, AD = BE. 5. **Congruence of Triangles Involving D**:     - The angle angle EBA = 60^circ - 20^circ = 40^circ and angle EAB = 10^circ, thus confirming:     [     angle EBD = 60^circ text{ (since } EBC text{ is equilateral)}.     ] 6. **Triangle ABD**:     - We want to find angle ABD.     - Since AD = BE and angle DAB = angle EAB = 10^circ, we have triangle ABD cong triangle ABE by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion.     - Therefore, angle ABD = angle BAE = 10^circ. # Conclusion: [ boxed{10} ]"},{"instruction":"the complex plane, the corresponding points of the complex numbers ( z_1, z_2, z_3 ) are ( Z_1, Z_2, Z_3 ) respectively.

Since |z_1| = |z_2| = sqrt{2} and overrightarrow{OZ_1} cdot overrightarrow{OZ_2} = 0, the points Z_1 and Z_2 lie on a circle of radius sqrt{2} centered at the origin. Orthogonal vectors mean that z_1 and z_2 are located 90^circ apart on the circle. Therefore, if we place Z_1 at (sqrt{2}, 0), then Z_2 must be at (0, sqrt{2}). 3. The next part is to analyze the expression |z_1 + z_2 - z_3| = 2, which implies that z_3 is at such a position that when subtracted and z_1 + z_2 - z_3 gives a complex number with magnitude 2.     Let's calculate z_1 + z_2. Since:     [     z_1 = sqrt{2} + 0i, quad z_2 = 0 + sqrt{2}i     ]     we have:     [     z_1 + z_2 = (sqrt{2} + 0i) + (0 + sqrt{2}i) = sqrt{2} + sqrt{2}i     ]     so the point representing z_1 + z_2 in the complex plane is (sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}). 4.

We now need to determine the values |z_3| can take. Recognize that z_3 has to be within a distance of 2 from (sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}). Hence, |z_3| represents the distance from the origin to z_3. To find the range of possible values of |z_3|, we use the properties of circles and triangles:     - The maximum distance from the origin to a circle of radius r with center at distance d from the origin is d + r.     - The minimum distance from the origin to a circle is |d - r|.     In our case, the center (sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}) has a distance of:     [     sqrt{(sqrt{2})^2 + (sqrt{2})^2} = sqrt{2 + 2} = sqrt{4} = 2     ]     Hence, the maximum distance from the origin is:     [     2 + 2 = 4     ]     And the minimum distance is:     [     |2 - 2| = 0     ] 6.

This means that there exists an integer (n) (the period length) such that the decimal expansion eventually repeats. Formally, the number can be written as:    [    0.a_1a_2a_3ldots text{ where } a_{k+n} = a_k text{ for all } k geq N text{ and some } N    ] 3. **Choice of ( m )**: Choose (m) sufficiently large so that the digit sequence (10^{m+2n}), where (m+2n) is much larger than (N), corresponds to a position in the sequence after the starting index of the periodic part, (a_N). 4. **Analyzing the Periodicity**:    - By our construction, beyond a certain point (N), the digits should start repeating with a fixed period (n). For the sake of simplicity, consider this period to be something well within the nature number sequence and we continue writing them consecutively.    - On the one hand, if periodicity truly commences after (N), the sub-sequence should consist of repeating digits.    - On the other hand, the original sequence (0.1234567891011 ldots) inherently does not show repeats but keeps concatenating natural numbers incrementally. 5. **Contradiction**:    - Observe that, within the original sequence, significant transitions occur (e.g., from lower digits (1-9) to higher grouped digits (10, 11, 12, etc.)).    - Thus, a correct placement of such a repeat unit would involve sequences without pure repetition but merges into following digits producing inconsistencies.    - Specifically, if the periodic sequence must include a large constant block, this translates into infinite distinct patterns as numbers grow, opposing any pure periodicity claim. 6. **Conclusion**:     Given the conflict arising from assuming periodicity while evaluating real sequence behavior, we reach a contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption that the number is rational contradicts the known properties of natural number concatenation, hence the number must be irrational.

Prove that angle RPB = angle RPA where R is the reflection of point P with respect to A.","output":"Given the problem, we need to show that (angle RPB = angle RPA) under the given geometric configuration. 1. **Understanding the Given Configuration:**    - Let (A, B, C) be the vertices of a triangle with (angle BAC = alpha ).    - Let (Gamma) be the circumcircle of (triangle ABC).    - (P) is a point on the circumcircle (Gamma) such that (P) lies on the angle bisector of (angle BAC). 2. **Symmetric Points with Respect to the Angle Bisector:**    - Since (Gamma) is symmetric with respect to the angle bisector of (angle BAC), any tangent to (Gamma) at point (P) would also respect this symmetry.    - Let (Q) be the symmetric point of (B) with respect to the angle bisector of (angle BAC). 3. **Properties of Symmetry:**    - By symmetry, (angle QPA = angle BPA).    - The bisector of (angle BAC) divides (angle BAP) equally: (angle BAP = frac{1}{2}alpha ) and (angle QAP = frac{1}{2}alpha ). 4. **Izogonal Conjugates:**    - Points symmetric with respect to the angle bisector are known as izogonal conjugates.    - Since (P) is on the circle and bisects the angle, both (Q) and (B) must lie equivalently with respect to (angle BAC). 5. **Denoting Angles:**    - Denote (angle BAP = angle QAP = x).    - It follows that since point (P) is on the circumcircle and (P) lies on the angle bisector, we have (angle BAP = angle CAP = x). 6. **Angle Relationships:**    - From the angle bisector properties, (angle BAP = angle QAP = x).    - Furthermore, since (B) and (Q) are izogonal conjugates: (angle PBA = angle PAQ = x). 7. **Conclusion:**    - From the geometry and symmetry, we then have:         [    angle RPB = angle RPA = x    ]     Thus, the conclusion is: (boxed{angle RPB = angle RPA})."},{"instruction":"Find x if 5(x  9) = 3(3  3x) + 9.","output":"Expand and simplify both sides of the equation: [ 5x - 45 = 9 - 9x + 9. ] Simplify the right-hand side: [ 5x - 45 = 18 - 9x. ] Add 9x and 45 to both sides: [ 14x = 63. ] Divide by 14: [ x = frac{63}{14} = boxed{4.5}. ]"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],z={key:0},N={key:1};function I(n,e,h,u,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(i(!0),a(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(i(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
