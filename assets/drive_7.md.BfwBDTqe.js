The inhabitants of planet U destroyed the ozone layer by their actions, while their neighboring planet N didn't.  Which planet had inhabitants that used fewer aerosol sprays? A:","output":"To determine which planet had inhabitants that used fewer aerosol sprays, we need to consider the effects of aerosol sprays on the ozone layer. Aerosol sprays containing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances are known to contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer. Given the information provided: 1. Planet U: Inhabitants destroyed the ozone layer by their actions. 2. Planet N: Inhabitants did not destroy the ozone layer. From these premises, we can infer the following: A. Inhabitants on planet U likely used more aerosol sprays containing ozone-depleting substances, which resulted in the destruction of the ozone layer. B. Inhabitants on planet N likely used fewer aerosol sprays containing ozone-depleting substances or used alternatives, which allowed their ozone layer to remain intact.

Please answer the following question: This article: Brian Epstein managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967. He had no previous experience managing artists, but he had a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, \\"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me.\\" McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, \\"Love Me Do\\", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, \\"Twist and Shout\\". The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itself, Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: \\"We were just writing songs ... pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant\\". In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon: \\"He was like our own little Elvis ... We all looked up to John.

Chelsea King's dad says he wanted to avoid agony of trial, bring closure to Dubois family. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: John Albert Gardner III Pleads Guilty In Brutal Rape and Murder Cases, Accepts Plea Deal John Albert Gardner III, convicted of the rape and murder of two San Diego-area teenagers, entered a guilty plea in a last-minute deal that spared him from the death penalty. Gardner, who has admitted to the brutal killings of Chelsea King and Amber Dubois, also confessed to attacking a female jogger in December. According to prosecutors, they would have lacked sufficient evidence to charge Gardner in the death of Amber Dubois without his confession and the ensuing plea deal. Chelsea King, a 17-year-old high school student, went missing on February 25, 2010, during a routine afternoon run at a local park in the city of Poway. Her body was discovered five days later, buried in a shallow grave near the trail. Gardner was arrested shortly after for her rape and murder. The case garnered national attention and prompted calls for tougher penalties for sexual predators. Amber Dubois, a 14-year-old freshman at Escondido High School, disappeared on her way to school on February 13, 2009. For over a year, her family and friends held out hope that she would be found alive, but Gardner’s confession and guilty plea ultimately confirmed their worst fears. Authorities discovered Amber's remains on a remote hillside on March 6, 2010, just days after Gardner's arrest in Chelsea's case.  In exchange for his guilty pleas to the rape and murder of both Chelsea and Amber, as well as the attempted rape and assault of a woman in December 2009, Gardner was spared the death penalty. He was instead sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The plea deal was reached after garnering much debate and discussion among the lawyers, investigators, and families involved in the case.  Chelsea King’s father, Brent King, expressed that his primary motivation for supporting the plea deal was to spare his family from the agony of a lengthy trial. He also expressed his desire to bring some closure to the Dubois family, who had been left in the dark about their daughter’s fate for over a year. The Dubois family expressed gratitude to the King family for their support and advocacy for Amber. The tragic deaths of Chelsea King and Amber Dubois have left a profound impact on their communities and the nation at large. Their cases prompted lawmakers to reconsider the policies surrounding the monitoring and punishment of convicted sex offenders. Gardner, a registered sex offender, managed to kidnap, rape, and murder both Chelsea and Amber despite being under law enforcement supervision.  The plea bargain and sentencing of John Albert Gardner III have at least brought some closure to the families of Chelsea King and Amber Dubois. However, their cases continue to serve as a stark and chilling reminder of the threats posed by sexual predators and the ongoing need for better policies and procedures to protect our children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And although I tell myself not to worry about them, I always do! So I'm not surprised that my students worry about them, too, even though they usually don't need to. Because they are afraid of failing. However, since it is hard not to worry at all, we all must try not to worry too much. Why? Because worrying makes exams worse! How to do this?

Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off after inspiring Real Madrid to an incident-packed 4-2 victory at home to Almeria on Saturday night, in which he created a goal, scored one and also missed a penalty. The world's most expensive player helped Real bounce back from last weekend's 1-0 \\"El Clasico\\" defeat to Barcelona as the big-spending capital outfit came back from 2-1 down in an explosive final 20 minutes. However, unbeaten Barca stayed five points clear at the top -- having played one more match -- with a 2-1 victory at Deportivo La Coruna as Lionel Messi scored twice. Ronaldo, making his first appearance at the Bernabeu in two months following ankle problems, crossed for Sergio Ramos to head the opening goal in the 31st minute. However, Fernando Soriano leveled with a deflected shot in the 58th minute and Kalu Uche put lowly Almeria head just three minutes later as Real failed to clear a corner. The hosts equalized with 17 minutes left as Argentina forward Gonzalo Higuain kept up his hot scoring run with a predatory finish after the Almeria defense did not deal with a cross from the left. With eight minutes remaining, Ronaldo went down under the challenge of the onrushing Diego Alves, but the goalkeeper saved his resulting penalty -- however, Karim Benzema followed up to smash in the rebound to put Real ahead. Ronaldo wrapped it up a minute later from Higuain's low cross, and was booked for tearing off his shirt to pose in front of his adoring fans. The Portugal captain received his second yellow card five minutes later for kicking out at Michel, but it was not costly as Real completed a morale-boosting win ahead of Tuesday's Champions League trip to Marseille. Barcelona, whose European title defense is still in the balance ahead of Wednesday's trip to Dynamo Kiev, took the lead against Deportivo in the 27th minute when Messi scored with a trademark neat finish. However, Adrian leveled in the 39th minute with a header after an error by Sergi Busquets, who returned from suspension. But Messi, named Europe's top player for 2009 during the week, put Barca ahead again with 10 minutes left from Pedro's cross and Zlatan Ibrahimovic followed up his winner against Real by wrapping up the victory on 88. Third-placed Sevilla again failed to keep pace with the leaders after being held 1-1 at home by mid-table Valladolid, who had a player sent off. Angola striker Manucho put the visitors ahead in the 33rd minute with a glancing header from Diego Costa's cross but five minutes later Borja Fernandez was red-carded for a lunge on Diego Perotti. Sevilla, who were held at home by Malaga last weekend, leveled with a penalty from Luis Fabiano just before halftime after Marcos brought down Jesus Navas. Brazil striker Fabiano squandered two golden second-half opportunities as Valladolid held on, meaning Valencia can move above Sevilla with victory away to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Atletico Madrid moved further away from relegation trouble with a 2-0 victory at promoted strugglers Xerez, with star strikers Diego Forlan and Sergio Aguero scoring in each half. Uruguay international Forlan put Atletico ahead in the 29th minute from a cross by Jose Antonio Reyes, while Argentina's Aguero doubled the lead on 65 with a low shot from 12 yards. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"In this article, Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid won a game against Almeria with a score of 4-2. During the game, Ronaldo created a goal, scored one, missed a penalty, and later received a red card for getting two yellow cards.

The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801.

Answer the following question: Background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  Paragraph: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, raspberries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apples or plums? Answer:","output":"Apples. Step 1: Identify the fruits Mary decided to candy based on the paragraph. From the paragraph, we learn that Mary decided to candy raspberries, apricots, and apples. Step 2: Identify which fruit is not candied. The paragraph also states that Mary did not candy plums, raspberries, and pears. Step 3: Determine which fruit is saturated with sugar. According to the background information, the process of candying involves drenching the fruit in the syrup, which causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar. Since Mary candied apples but not plums, the apples are the fruit saturated with sugar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The girl put the history book back on the shelf and read the magazine because the book was boring. She picked up the vibrant magazine, flipping through its colorful pages filled with stunning pictures, fascinating articles, celebrity interviews, and the latest trends. The glossy paper felt smooth under her delicate fingertips. As she lounged on the cozy bean bag in the reading nook, she glanced around, taking in the small coffee shop's atmosphere. Soft jazz music whispered through the speakers overhead, mingling with the scent of freshly brewed coffee that filled the air. Patrons were scattered throughout the establishment, some hunched over laptops, others lost in lively conversation. The girl felt a sense of serenity wash over her, something she rarely experienced amidst her hectic daily life. Returning to the magazine, she chose an article focusing on the environmental impact of single-use plastics. It was an issue close to her heart, and the article's depth and insights reminded her that she had wanted to use her knowledge and passion to make a positive difference in the world. The magazine seemed to resonate with her soul in a way the history book never could. As she reached the end of the article, she felt inspired to take action. An idea began to form in her mind. At the bottom of the page, she noticed a call to join the organization that had sponsored the magazine article. They were seeking passionate individuals like herself to make a change. Excitedly, she pulled out her phone, went to the organization's website, and signed up for their next event. The event would serve as an opportunity to learn about plastic alternatives, ways to reduce waste, and steps to organize local clean-up efforts. The girl felt a new sense of purpose and determination. Just as she entered her contact information and hit submit, a sudden rainstorm burst from the previously clear blue sky. The downpour showered against the windows, drawing her attention outside. She watched as people scrambled to take cover, shielding themselves from the unexpected deluge. The rain seemed to symbolize a kind of cleansing, not only for the world outside but also within her own life. As the storm began to subside, a brilliant double rainbow emerged, painting the sky in multicolored bands. The girl felt a renewed sense of hope and promise – as if the universe was affirming her decision. She decided to hold onto that fleeting moment of serendipity, using its sense of purpose and wonder to propel her on her new journey. With that, the girl closed the magazine, placed it on the coffee table, and prepared to leave, no longer seeing the history book as a source of personal intrigue. As she stepped out into the rain-freshened world, her heart swelled with anticipation for the challenges and successes that awaited her - all inspired by the pages of a single magazine that had transformed a boring afternoon into a life-changing experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For several weeks this DVD leaped off the shelf at me every time I went in the store - having seen Steve Carrell in a couple of films previously, I didn't want to smear my thought process of him - so I resisted and resisted, until finally I grabbed it up with a 'What the hell!' attitude! And how surprised was I! I just wish I had purchased it earlier. Having watched it three times in two days I am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters, yearning for that which is missing since the passing of his beloved wife, who thus meets an intriguing woman, charming her in such a profound and interesting (dare I say bookish?) way, throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what he has been searching for. The snag of that woman being his brothers girl complicates matters - which portray Dan comically shy and with a heartfelt chagrin, seeing his \\"someone special\\" bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as his brothers life. You just really begin to feel for him. Then when the blind date occurs with Ruthie Draper - that is the turning point in Marie's estimation of Dan!! The look she gives him when he repeats her comment, about not liking Ruthie - sheer Green-Eyed Monster! Triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most well-crafted as Dan starts to loosen up with regard to Marie. Other gut-wrenching scenes - Dan returns from the Book and Tackle Shop, confronted by his brothers, begins to describe what has just occurred....when Dan's face drops it brings a sharp intake of breath!! His youngest daughter Lilly making the present celebrating their love for Suzanne, his late wife, brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little gulp as Dan realizes just what he has lost in life. When Dan plays guitar and sings at the Talent Show....his voice cracking slightly as he reprises the song....absolute gem!  The acceptance of what occurs late in the film by his daughters...they all three love their father and want to see him happy, will not let him deny his love for Marie; the desperateness of Dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock, their stronghold...and tell him so much more than that with just a few words. I could go on and on but I will leave it for now - maybe return and add more comments here in the near future....but I will end by saying.... ....if you want to watch a film that is just so damn good, with twists of comedy to lighten up the drama, that never feels forced or crass, that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life - not just with a woman but also with his extended family, then look no further.

Article: Your stomach growling is caused by your digestive system doing what it’s supposed to do: mixing food, fluids, and gastric juices and pushing them through the intestinal tract. The rumbling occurs when the walls of your gastrointestinal tract contracts and relaxes to squeeze everything through the intestines. Even with a proper diet, growling is bound to happen sometimes and is no reason to be embarrassed. When you eat too much food, it will put your digestive system into overdrive. The growling can occur more often when this happens, because there is more to move through the intestines. When your stomach has been empty for two hours, the growling sounds louder. This is because there is little or nothing in the stomach to absorb or muffle the noise. When you go hours without eating, your body releases hormones that let the brain know it’s time to clear anything left in the stomach to make room for whatever food is to come.  Have small, healthy snacks with you at all times. Constantly hydrate yourself with liquids. Use water, juice, tea, etc. Certain carbs are resistant to digestion. Don’t avoid carbs completely because they help supply you with energy and play a main role in the health of your digestive tract. Simply eat them in moderation to keep your stomach healthy but less likely to growl.  Resistant starch: potatoes or pasta that has been cooled after cooking, sourdough bread, and unripe fruit. Insoluble fiber: whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, cabbage, lettuce, and bell peppers Sugar: apples, pears, and broccoli Remember that growling can happen both when you’ve just eaten and when you haven’t eaten in a while. To avoid over-eating and excessive stomach growling, know when you’re actually hungry. Learning the timing scheme your normal eating regimen is the best way to keep track and avoid mindless eating. People who swallow a lot of air usually experience more stomach growling than others. If you eat too fast or talk a lot while eating, you are likely swallowing a lot of air. Eat more slowly to avoid this. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article explains that stomach growling is a normal function of the digestive system, which occurs when the gastrointestinal tract contracts and relaxes to move food, fluids, and gastric juices through the intestines. Growling can occur when one overeats or when the stomach is empty for a prolonged period. To reduce stomach growling, the article suggests maintaining a balanced diet with healthy snacks, staying hydrated, consuming resistant starch and fiber in moderation, and paying attention to hunger cues to avoid overeating. Additionally, eating slowly and minimizing swallowed air can also help lessen stomach growling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat.

It is common to mark the altitude with the letter h (as in height), often subscripted with the name of the side the altitude is drawn to. is altitude the same as height in a triangle?","output":"Yes, altitude can be considered as the height of a triangle when it is measured with respect to a specific side. The terms 'altitude' and 'height' are often used interchangeably in the context of triangles. However, it's essential to understand both terms and how they are used to discuss different properties of a triangle. In a triangle, an altitude is a segment that extends from a vertex and is perpendicular to the opposite side, also known as the base. There are three altitudes that can be drawn in a triangle, one from each vertex to the respective opposite side. These altitudes have the distinct property that they intersect at a single point, called the orthocenter of the triangle. On the other hand, the term 'height' generally refers to the length or measure of an altitude segment. It represents the shortest distance between a vertex of the triangle and the line containing the opposite side. In this sense, the height of a triangle can also be thought of as the vertical distance from the highest point of the triangle (the vertex opposite the longest side) to its base when the triangle is oriented appropriately. To summarize, an altitude refers to a specific geometric construction within a triangle - a line segment that is drawn from a vertex, perpendicular to the opposite side. The height describes the length of this altitude segment and is a measure of the vertical distance between the vertex and the base of the triangle. While both terms are related, altitude captures the geometry of the construction, whereas height refers to its length or measure. In practical contexts, especially when discussing the area of a triangle, both terms can often be used interchangeably, as they convey the same idea – a perpendicular distance from a vertex to the line containing an opposite side."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Rolling Stone magazine is a renowned American monthly magazine that focuses on music, politics, and popular culture. Initially, it was known for its coverage of rock music and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. The magazine started in 1967 by Jann Wenner and music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage of rock and roll and its political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. Over time, however, it moved towards embracing a broader range of popular culture.  The reference to Rolling Stone magazine in relation to Madonna's album, True Blue, indicates the publication's prominence in evaluating and critiquing music.

Earmarks do not accord with democratic principles of equity, fairness and justice Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"Earmarks, also known as \\"pork barrel\\" spending or legislative \\"sweeteners,\\" represent government funds allocated to specific projects or initiatives, often in the home districts of the lawmakers who inserted them into legislation. Critics argue that earmarks do not accord with democratic principles of equity, fairness, and justice for several reasons. In response, I have collected evidence to support this claim, categorized under various aspects of earmarks, including allocation, influence, and transparency. 1. Allocation: a. Inequitable Distribution: Earmarks often prioritize congressional districts represented by lawmakers in influential positions, such as party leadership or key committee membership. This arbitrary allocation method leads to an unequal distribution of funds, where some regions receive substantially more funding than others based on political connections, rather than need or merit (La Raja, 2007). b. Preference for Wealthier Districts: Research shows earmarks tend to benefit wealthier districts, reinforcing economic inequity. A study conducted by the American Political Science Association (APSA, 2009) discovered that earmarks disproportionately favor affluent districts, thus neglecting poorer areas that would likely benefit from increased federal funding. 2. Influence: a. Special Interest Groups and Lobbyists: Earmarks often arise from deals between lawmakers and special interest groups, with lobbyists playing a significant role in introducing and pushing for specific projects (de Figueiredo & Silverman, 2006). These interest groups typically seek government funding to promote their agendas, contributing to a political environment that prioritizes their needs over broader public interests. b. Political Rewards and Punishments: Earmarks can be used by party leaders and lawmakers as a tool to reward loyal supporters or punish political opponents. This practice can undermine democracy, as it encourages votes based on preserving political relationships rather than evaluating proposed projects on merit. Examples of this practice include the infamous \\"Bridge to Nowhere\\" earmark, where then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) secured funding for a highly criticized Alaskan bridge to reward a political ally (Young & Sager, 2006). 3. Transparency: a. Lack of visibility and accountability: Earmarks have historically been inserted into legislation without debate and sometimes even without proper documentation. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for the public and other legislators to scrutinize and challenge spending decisions, raising concerns about the democratic accountability of the process (Murphy, 2010). b. Erosion of public trust: Surveys and polls indicate that the public perceives earmarks as a symbol of corruption and government waste, further eroding trust in institutions (Newport, 2006). A Gallup poll conducted in 2006 revealed that 80% of adults in the United States considered federal government spending on earmarks as a \\"very serious\\" or \\"somewhat serious\\" problem. Overall, these various pieces of evidence demonstrate how earmarks can undermine democratic principles of equity, fairness, and justice by promoting unequal resource distribution, perpetuating political favoritism, and eroding transparency and accountability. As a result, it is essential to maintain scrutiny over the earmark process to ensure it aligns with the ideals of a well-functioning democracy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Never been cleaned type of disgusting. It was 1130am, they open at 11, so you know it was from not being cleaned at all. This wasn't one occasion either. I had to visit my Uncle at the VA everyday and this was my lunch spot. It never looked clean.  Secondly, their kids meals are disgusting. My son loves sushi, not so much the kids meal. The rice is stale and absolutely different and gross tasting. He likes salmon on his roll, when I asked the charge they told me 0.75 extra, but they charged me for a full add (2.50). Since they only gave me half of the normal serving (since the roll is half the size), but charged me full, I asked for them to add the other piece to the side, which they refused! They made such a huge condition about it that it was embarrassing.  Thirdly, their employees that have been there are fantastic. The new ones are pretty horrible.

Answer: As a result, by the late 1990s parliamentary politics had become virtually irrelevant and alternative avenues for political expression were curtailed as well.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"In the 1990s, a number of laws were enacted that had significant impacts on culture across the globe. Some of these laws targeted the internet, intellectual property, entertainment, and environmental issues. Here is a detailed and long answer for you: 1. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998, US): This law was designed to address copyright issues arising from the rapidly growing digital environment. It criminalized the production and distribution of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works. This law had a significant impact on the sharing of creative content online and led to increased protection of intellectual property. 2. The Communications Decency Act (1996, US): This was the first notable attempt by the US government to regulate the content of websites on the internet. As part of the Telecommunications Act, it sought to control online indecency and obscenity; however, the Supreme Court ruled that the act violated the First Amendment, resulting in many of its provisions being overturned. This development shifted the way online content was viewed and made freedom of speech on the internet a focal point for debates. 3. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (1993, US): This influential firearms law mandated federal background checks on individuals who want to purchase firearms in the United States. Named after James Brady, who was injured during an assassination attempt on President Reagan, the law aimed to reduce gun violence across the nation. The act has had a profound impact on the gun control debate in the US and remains a contentious issue in the discussion surrounding gun rights and violence. 4. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (1994, US): This law enacted a series of comprehensive crime control and prevention measures targeting various aspects of American life, including increased penalties for violent crimes, federal funding for prisons, and the formation of community policing initiatives. It also introduced the controversial “three-strikes” provision, which mandated life imprisonment for individuals convicted of certain repeat felonies. This law played a role in shaping the cultural discussion on crime, policing, and incarceration in the US. 5. The Kyoto Protocol (1997, International): Although not a national law, this international treaty had far-reaching impacts on global culture. Over 190 countries agreed to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases in an effort to combat climate change. This treaty signaled a growing global awareness of environmental issues and pushed sustainable development and clean energy solutions to the forefront of the cultural discussion. These are just a few examples of laws created in the 1990s that had considerable impacts on culture. It is worth noting that these laws not only shaped the conversations and debates during that decade but continue to have lasting effects on contemporary cultural, social, and political discourse as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Answer:","output":"The process that is driven by the sun's energy and moves water over the surface of the Earth is known as the Water Cycle, or the Hydrologic Cycle. This is a continuous cycle where water evaporates, travels into the air and becomes part of a cloud, falls down to the earth as precipitation, and then evaporates again. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of this process: 1. Evaporation: The sun heats up water from oceans, lakes, rivers, and even puddles in the street. As the water heats up, it becomes vapor or steam and enters the air. 2. Condensation: As water vapor in the air cools down, it becomes water again (often forming clouds in the process). This is condensation. 3. Precipitation: When the water droplets in clouds combine, they become heavy and fall back down to the surface of the Earth. This is known as precipitation and includes forms such as rain, snow, sleet, and hail. 4. Collection: The water that falls as precipitation is collected in rivers, lakes and oceans. Some of it also seeps into the ground becoming groundwater. 5. Transpiration: Water also returns to the atmosphere through plants in a process called transpiration. Plants take in water through the roots and release water vapor through pores in their leaves. 6. Runoff and Infiltration: Water that's on the Earth's surface can either infiltrate into the subsurface or it can become streamflow or surface runoff, moving into lower elevation points.

Free Wi-Fi Is Coming to Select Airports via MediaShift Free airport Wi-Fi sounds too good to be true, but a select group of 20 U.S. airports will soon be offering the service as part of a partnership with the digital advertising company MediaShift. It's called the Premier Airport Network and the deal will place ads throughout a user's surfing session. MediaShift, which has more than 23 million users, is known for monetizing private Wi-Fi networks for travel companies and hotels, and providing detailed info on information that could help boost vendors' bottom lines, such as click-through rates, conversions and behavioral data. It has not yet revealed which airports are participating in the network. “MediaShift provides the technology at no cost to the airports,\\" Brendon Kensel, MediasShift's president, told Mashable. \\"For the first time, airports can participate in ad revenues that have traditionally eluded last mile online access providers. Airports receive incremental revenue with no start-up costs, investment or capital expenditure for airports.” The average traveler's airport browsing session is already at 57 minutes, and MediaShift is betting those numbers shoot up if travelers don't have to pay to surf. And it gives merchants a new way to monetize those users with the addition of targeted ads. MediaShift expands its reach, airport economies get a shot in the arm, and users get a new tool to improve their journey. \\"This would make a world of a difference for travelers, especially international visitors, who don't have data plans in the U.S. and rely solely on Wi-Fi access to connect to the world,\\" says Aigerim Shorman, the cofounder and CEO of Triptrotting, a social network linking travelers with authentic in-country experiences.

Together, both days are considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in Christendom and Western society.  - Christmas or Christmas Day (meaning \\"Christ's Mass\\") is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family.  - Universal Music Group, Inc.

A: Answer:","output":"The number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time is referred to as the frequency of the wave. Frequency is one of the fundamental properties of waves, including sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and mechanical waves, such as those that travel through a solid, liquid, or gas medium. Frequency is typically measured in Hertz (Hz), which represents the number of cycles per second. One Hertz is equal to one cycle per second. The relationship between frequency, wavelength (the distance between two consecutive points in the same phase of a wave), and the speed of the wave can be described by the equation: v = fλ Where: - v is the speed of the wave - f is the frequency of the wave (in Hertz) - λ (lambda) is the wavelength of the wave Higher-frequency waves have shorter wavelengths, while lower-frequency waves have longer wavelengths. In the context of sound waves, frequency is related to the perception of pitch. Higher-frequency sound waves produce higher-pitched sounds, while lower-frequency sound waves produce lower-pitched sounds. The frequency range of human hearing is generally considered to be between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz, although this range can vary among individuals and tends to decrease with age. In the electromagnetic spectrum, frequency is also an important property of electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. The frequency of electromagnetic waves determines the energy they carry, as well as their potential applications and effects on surrounding materials. For instance, in the context of visible light, different frequencies correspond to different colors that the human eye can perceive. On one end of the visible spectrum, you have lower-frequency, longer-wavelength colors like red, while on the other end, you have higher-frequency, shorter-wavelength colors like violet. Lastly, in mechanical waves like those traveling through solid, liquid, or gas media, frequency is directly related to how quickly particles oscillate back and forth as the wave passes through the medium. In the case of water waves, for example, the frequency of the wave at a particular point in space represents the number of oscillations or crests that pass that point in a given time period. To summarize, the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time is called the frequency of the wave, typically measured in Hertz (Hz). This property is a fundamental characteristic of various types of waves, including sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and mechanical waves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It can, however, thicken mucus, making it more difficult to expel. If home remedies don’t work for your condition, you can try using OTC sinus medicine to treat your particular condition. Be sure that the medicine you choose is designed for your sinus problem. For example, if you have seasonal allergies, you might try an antihistamine medicine.

Answer based on context: According to Statistics Canada, up to 244,000 English-speaking people have emigrated from Quebec to other provinces since the 1970s; those in Quebec whose sole native language was English dropped from 789,000 in 1971 to 575,555 in 2006, when they accounted for 7.6% of the population. Altogether, in 2006, 744,430 (10%) used mostly English as their home language, and 918,955 (12.2%) comprised the Official Language Minority, having English as their First Official language spoken. When many anglophones relocated outside of Quebec after the introduction of the Charter in the 1970s, several English-language schools in Montreal closed their doors. These school closures may also have been brought about by restrictions on who can attend English schools, which has been another ongoing drain on the English school system. Of the Anglophones between 25 and 44 years old who left the province between 1981 and 1986, 15000 individuals, which was half of this group, had university degrees. The provinces unemployment rate rose from 8.7 percent in 1976 to 10.4 percent in 1977, remaining above 10 percent for 19 of the last 23 years of the 20th century. The language barrier has also been regarded as a \\"soft cap\\" for population growth; for instance from 2013 to 2014 while Montreal gained around 43,000 immigrants from other parts of the world it lost 10,000 residents to other provinces.

As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good.

Write an article based on this \\"A jury has returned a verdict of death by misadventure at the inquest of a man who was died in a potash mine.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Potash Mine Tragedy: Death by Misadventure Ruled by Jury in Inquest Introduction: A recent inquest held for a man who died in a potash mine has ended with a ruling of death by misadventure by the jury. This decision highlights the need for continued vigilance and adherence to safety protocols in the mining industry. Step 1: Provide background information The inquest followed a tragic incident in which the victim, a male worker in his 30s, was fatally injured while working in a potash mine. Potash, a vital component in the production of fertilizers, is commonly extracted from deep underground mines using a combination of sophisticated equipment and manual labor. While potash mining remains essential to global agriculture, it poses inherent risks to the miners who struggle to achieve a delicate balance between productivity and safety. Step 2: Describe the incident Details surrounding the incident reveal that the victim was engaged in a standard mining operation when an unexpected collapse occurred within the mine. The victim, who was operating a large mining vehicle at the time, was unable to extricate himself from the dangerous situation, as debris from the cave-in rapidly enveloped him. Despite the best efforts of his fellow miners and emergency responders, the victim ultimately succumbed to his injuries. Step 3: Discuss the inquest and the verdict During the inquest, the jury carefully examined the circumstances of the accident and considered the testimony of numerous witnesses, including the victim's coworkers, supervisors, and safety experts. The jury also reviewed mining regulations and the mine's safety record. After weighing all the evidence, they determined that the victim's death was a result of misadventure. The verdict of death by misadventure typically signifies that the deceased took a risk that led to an unintended outcome – in this case, his own death. However, the jury acknowledged that the incident was an unfortunate and unforeseen accident and did not assign blame to any specific individual or group. Step 4: Highlight the importance of mine safety and preventing future incidents While the ruling may bring some closure to the victim's family, it serves as a stark reminder of the inherent dangers associated with potash mining and the urgent need for continued safety measures within the industry. Mines must emphasize the importance of worker safety to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. This includes conducting regular safety training sessions, thoroughly inspecting and maintaining equipment, and creating an environment that encourages workers to report safety hazards. Conclusion: The inquest into the fatal potash mine incident, resulting in a verdict of death by misadventure, underscores the dire need for heightened safety measures within the mining industry. Both mine operators and employees must be vigilant in adhering to safety regulations to minimize the risk of accidents and ensure the well-being of all workers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gunmen wearing army uniforms stormed a military compound in the Balkh province, killing at least eight soldiers and wounding 11 others,... (Associated Press)      KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Gunmen and suicide bombers wearing army uniforms stormed a military compound in the Balkh province, killing or wounding more than 100 army personnel, Afghan officials said Saturday.      Gen. Daulat Waziri, spokesman for the Afghanistan Ministry of Defense, said the attack a day earlier on a compound of the 209th Corps of the Afghan National Army left dozens of soldiers and other personnel dead or wounded.      Gen. Mohammad Radmanish, deputy spokesman for the Defense Ministry, said the militants entered the base using two military vehicles and attacked army personnel inside the compound's mosque.      \\"Two suicide bombers detonated their vests full of explosive inside the mosque of the army corps while everyone was busy with Friday prayers,\\" he said.      Waziri said there were 10 attackers, including the two who carried out the suicide attacks. Eight others were killed in a gun battle with soldiers.      Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the assault in an email sent to media.      President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday traveled to the base and strongly condemned the attack, according to a tweet from the official Twitter account of the presidential palace.      \\"The attackers are infidels,\\" Ghani was quoted as saying in the tweet.      Reports conflicted on the death toll, but a source within the army corps who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the media, said more than 130 were killed and around 80 others were wounded.      In March, an attack on a military hospital in the capital Kabul killed 50 people. Responsibility for that attack was claimed by the Islamic State group. According to officials, five attackers were involved, including one suicide bomber who detonated an explosives belt and four gunmen who stormed the building.      The 209th corps is located in the Dihdadi district of Balkh. It is one of seven corps of the country's Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for providing security for Afghanistan's northern and northeastern provinces. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Afghan troops keep watch at the base near Mazar-e-Sharif after the attack      More than 100 Afghan soldiers were killed or wounded in a Taliban attack on an army base on Friday, the defence ministry has confirmed.      Fighting lasted for several hours near the city of Mazar-e Sharif in northern Balkh province.      Insurgents targeted those leaving Friday prayers at the base's mosque and others in a canteen, the army said.      The Taliban said in a statement they had carried out the attack, using suicide bombers to breach defences.      Earlier estimates put the death toll as high as 134, but a statement from the defence ministry on Saturday gave the figure of more than 100 killed or injured.      It is one of the deadliest tolls in a Taliban attack on the Afghan army.      At least 10 Taliban militants were also killed in the fighting and one attacker was detained.      The Afghan government has declared Sunday a day of national mourning.      Separately, the US military command in Afghanistan said that Taliban commander Quari Tayib had been killed in a coalition air strike.      It said that Tayib was \\"once known as the shadow Taliban governor of Takhar province\\" in the north-east, and was killed along with eight other Taliban fighters in the strike on 17 April.      The Taliban fighters who attacked the base wore army uniforms and drove through checkpoints to launch the raid, a military spokesman said.      One injured soldier, Mohammad Hussain, said: \\"When I came out of the mosque, three people with army uniforms and an army vehicle started shooting at us. Of course, they had some infiltrators inside the base, otherwise they would never have been able to enter.      \\"One of them sitting inside a vehicle had set up a machine gun at the car's window and shot everyone in his way.\\"      President Ashraf Ghani flew to the area on Saturday and visited wounded troops.      US military spokesman John Thomas described the attack as a \\"significant\\" strike, but he praised Afghan commandos for bringing the \\"atrocity to an end\\".      Relatives' anger: Syed Anwar, BBC News, Kabul      Image caption Jan Agah from Jowzjan province lost a nephew in the attack      There are conflicting reports about casualties. The defence ministry confirmed more than 100 soldiers had been \\"killed or injured\\" but a security official in Mazar-e Sharif told the BBC that more than 100 had died, including a top military commander.      Relatives of some of the soldiers gathered outside the base to take possession of coffins. They all questioned the security measures in place at the main entrance.      \\"If strict inspections had taken place, the attackers would not have passed the first gate,\\" said Jan Agah, from Jowzjan province. One of his nephews serving at the base died and another was injured in the attack.      The raid shows the Taliban can plan and carry out complex attacks. The militants said four of the attackers had served as soldiers for a long time and had knowledge of every corner of the base.      The base at Mazar-e-Sharif is home to the Afghan National Army's 209th Corps, responsible for providing security to most of northern Afghanistan, including Kunduz province - which has seen heavy recent fighting.      Several German and other foreign soldiers are reported to be garrisoned there.      Last month about 50 people were reported to have died when militants believed to be from the group known as Islamic State targeted patients and staff at a military hospital in Kabul with guns, grenades and knives.

Colleen LaRose, the Pennsylvania woman indicted for allegedly conspiring to support terrorists and kill a person in a foreign country, attempted to commit suicide in 2005, according to a police report filed at the time. LaRose, who authorities say called herself \\"Jihad Jane,\\" was depressed about the death of her father, the report from Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, Police Officer Michael Devlin said. LaRose told Devlin she swallowed as many as 10 pills of cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant. The pills were mixed with alcohol. \\"Colleen was highly intoxicated and having difficulty maintaining her balance,\\" Devlin wrote. I \\"questioned LaRose about harming herself, at which point she stated she does not want to die.\\" Devlin was dispatched to check on LaRose in response to a 911 call made by LaRose's sister in Texas, who was worried LaRose might try to kill herself. LaRose was arrested on the terrorism charges in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 15, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office said Tuesday. She is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia, according to the U.S. attorney's office. She will be arraigned at 10:30 a.m. March 18 in Philadelphia, the Justice Department said. Among other things, LaRose has also been charged with making false statements to a government official and attempted identity theft. If convicted, she faces a possible life prison sentence and a 1 million fine. Last year, LaRose agreed to kill a resident of Sweden, an indictment says, and a U.S. government official familiar with the case identified the target as Lars Vilks, a cartoonist who outraged some with a drawing of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed. LaRose worked with at least five co-conspirators, the indictment says. Authorities did not identify them, but police in Ireland took into custody seven people in arrests Tuesday that the U.S. official said were directly related to the plot involving LaRose. Read the indictment (PDF) Authorities in Ireland said the seven people they arrested also were plotting to commit a murder abroad. Irish media reports, citing unnamed police sources, identified their target as Vilks. A person from Pennsburg who knew LaRose said she \\"didn't have the smarts or brains\\" to pull off the alleged plot. \\"Not without someone telling her what to do, maybe even brainwashing her,\\" said the person, who asked not to be identified for privacy reasons. It appears that LaRose was not well known in her neighborhood in Pennsburg, which is about an hour north of Philadelphia. One neighbor reacted to the news by saying, \\"It scares the hell out of me.\\" Meanwhile, LaRose's former boyfriend, Kurt Gorman, told CNN on Wednesday that the circumstances surrounding her arrest are \\"just crazy ... really crazy.\\" Gorman said that when he lived with LaRose, she spent most of her time at home and frequently used a personal computer. \\"I think she just used it to play games mostly,\\" he said. \\"I really didn't pay much attention.\\" The alleged terrorist conspiracy began in June 2008, when LaRose posted a comment on YouTube under the username JihadJane saying she was \\"desperate to do something somehow to help\\" Muslims, according to a federal indictment unsealed Tuesday. From December 2008 to October 2009, LaRose engaged in electronic communication with five alleged co-conspirators about their shared desires to wage jihad and become martyrs, according to the indictment. LaRose and the alleged co-conspirators, according to a Justice Department statement, used the Internet to develop plans that \\"included martyring themselves, soliciting funds for terrorists, soliciting passports and avoiding travel restrictions (through the collection of passports and through marriage) in order to wage violent jihad.\\" According to the U.S. government official familiar with the case, LaRose raised money for the cause and recruited people to join it. The official also said she was in contact with committed jihadists in South Asia, Western Europe and Eastern Europe. The official declined to link her to any specific terrorist organizations.

The indictment says that at one point, LaRose stole a U.S. passport to \\"facilitate an act of international terrorism.\\" Gorman told CNN that after LaRose left him suddenly last August, he realized his passport was missing. He said he reported the lost document to the State Department. Several months later, he said, the FBI came to see him, and he told them what he knew about her. In November, he said, he testified in Philadelphia before a grand jury. The FBI told him she was already in custody then, Gorman said. \\"I really don't know much,\\" he said. LaRose had received \\"a direct order to kill a citizen and resident of Sweden, and to do so in a way that would frighten 'the whole Kufar [nonbeliever] world,' \\" according to the indictment. LaRose agreed to carry out the murder, according to the Justice Department statement. \\"I will make this my goal till I achieve it or die trying,\\" LaRose said via electronic communication, according to the indictment. In 2007, Vilks drew a cartoon of Mohammed with the body of a dog, prompting the al Qaeda terrorist network to offer 100,000 to anyone who killed him, plus an extra 50,000 if the killer slits his throat. Watch a profile of Vilks from 2007. Irish police did not confirm that Vilks was the target, but responded to a CNN question about Vilks by saying the arrests were \\"part of an investigation into a conspiracy to commit a serious offense, namely, conspiracy to murder an individual in another jurisdiction.\\" Irish police arrested four men and three women in Waterford and Cork, authorities said. They range in age from the mid-20s to late 40s. Ireland's national broadcaster, RTE, said the suspects are originally from Morocco and Yemen but are all living legally as refugees in Ireland. Irish police worked with counterparts in the United States and \\"a number of European countries,\\" they said. LaRose, along with the co-conspirators, believed that \\"her appearance and American citizenship would help her blend in while carrying out her plans, calling it a possible \\"way to achieve what is in my heart,\\" according to the indictment. The indictment alleges that LaRose even agreed to marry one of the co-conspirators to obtain residency status in a European country. LaRose traveled to Europe in August 2009 and \\"tracked the intended target online in an effort to complete her task,\\" the Justice Department statement said. According to the indictment, LaRose told the co-conspirator who allegedly ordered the murder that she considers it an \\"honour & a great pleasure to die or kill for\\" the co-conspirator, and she pledged that \\"only death will stop me here that I am so close to the target.\\" The killing did not occur, and LaRose was arrested about two weeks after the electronic message was sent. Mark Wilson, a federal public defender representing LaRose, declined to comment on the case Tuesday. The Justice Department said LaRose was born in 1963 and lives outside of Philadelphia in Montgomery County. Police records show she was arrested twice in 1997: once for driving while intoxicated and once for passing a bad check in the San Antonio, Texas, area. She moved from Texas to Pennsylvania in 2004.

LaRose agreed to kill a resident of Sweden, identified as Lars Vilks, a cartoonist who had drawn the Muslim Prophet Mohammed and angered some members of the Muslim community. She worked with at least five co-conspirators in a terrorist conspiracy that began in June 2008, using the Internet to develop plans including committing martyrdom, soliciting funds for terrorists, soliciting passports, and avoiding travel restrictions. LaRose allegedly stole a U.S. passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism and had received a direct order to kill the Swedish citizen in a way that would terrorize nonbelievers. Although she agreed to the task, the murder did not occur, and LaRose was arrested.

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement.","output":"Yes, we can infer that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement based on the given information. The statement \\"Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement in order to spend time with her ill husband\\" clearly states that she made the decision to retire from her position. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States, was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and took office on September 25, 1981. Her tenure on the court lasted nearly a quarter of a century, during which she provided key votes on various landmark cases and often acted as a swing vote on closely divided issues. After serving for 24 years as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court, O'Connor submitted a letter of her decision to retire to President George W. Bush on July 1, 2005. The primary reason for her retirement, as stated, was to spend more time with her husband, John Jay O'Connor III, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. She believed that leaving her demanding position would allow her to support, care for, and be present during her husband's ongoing battle with this degenerative illness. Justice O'Connor's retirement set off several events, including the nomination and confirmation of John G. Roberts Jr. as Chief Justice, following the death of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and the subsequent nomination and confirmation of Samuel A. Alito Jr., who succeeded O'Connor as Associate Justice. In conclusion, the statement \\"Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement in order to spend time with her ill husband\\" allows us to infer that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did indeed announce her retirement from the Supreme Court, a decision made to be able to devote more time to her husband, who was battling Alzheimer's disease at the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Question: Where will Trump send the National Guard to protect the US from drug smuggling?

US Defence Secretary James Mattis said the USS Carl Vinson strike group is now proceeding to the Western Pacific. The ship is part of what President Trump said last week was an \\"armada\\" being deployed off North Korea amid tensions over its nuclear plans. But the vessels were heading the other way for training with Australia's navy. Seeking to clear up confusion on Wednesday, the Pentagon chief said he wanted \\"to be open about what we're doing\\". Speaking in Saudi Arabia, Mr Mattis said: \\"We're doing exactly what we said we're going to do. She will be on her way. \\"And I'll determine when she gets there and where she actually operates - but the Vinson is going to be part of our ensuring that we stand by our allies in the north-west Pacific.\\" The confusion began on 9 April when the US Navy said the Carl Vinson strike group was travelling from Singapore to the Western Pacific. Two days later, President Trump said in an interview with Fox Business: \\"We are sending an armada, very powerful\\" towards the Korean peninsula. His remark stoked fears across East Asia that the US was poised for a pre-emptive military strike. But rather than heading north to the Sea of Japan, on 13 April the Vinson was travelling in the opposite direction, south towards Australia, for a scheduled weekend exercise with that country's navy. A US Navy photo dated 15 April showed the Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier heading through the Sunda Strait into the Indian Ocean. The Vinson battle group is not expected to reach the Korean peninsula until next week.

Birth defects in monochorionic twin      A birth defect or anomaly is a medical term meaning irregular or different from normal. Anomalies occur more frequently in identical twins than in other pregnancies.      What are the different kinds of twins?      Monochorionic twins are identical twins who share one placenta. This occurs in approximately 70 percent of pregnancies with identical twins.      Monochorionic-monoamniotic twins are identical twins who share both a placenta and an amniotic sac .      Monochorionic-diamniotic twins are identical twins who share a placenta but not an amniotic sac.      Dichorionic twins each have their own placenta and amniotic sac. This occurs in approximately 30 percent of pregnancies of identical twins. All fraternal (non-identical) twins also are dichorionic twins.      Problems that can affect the health of monochorionic twins include:      Prenatal diagnosis of monochorionic twin anomalies      Doctors typically detect monochorionic twin pregnancies during a routine prenatal ultrasound. The best images are visible when ultrasounds are conducted prior to 14 weeks of pregnancy. This is when the structures of the placenta and amniotic sac are most visible. The ultrasound will show a single placenta supplying blood flow and two fetuses with a single, thin dividing membrane if they are monochorionic twins.      At this point, the ultrasound may also show if there is one amniotic sac or two. If there are two, physicians will look to see if there are differences in the amount of amniotic fluid present in each.      What happens after diagnosis?      Depending on the ultrasound findings, your obstetrician will likely refer you to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist (a doctor who specializes in high-risk pregnancies). Additional maternal and fetal tests may be required to screen for anomalies, such as TTTS and TRAP sequence. One screening test is a fetal echocardiography. This specialized ultrasound of your babies’ hearts and blood vessels shows the flow of blood between the twins.      To monitor the size of your babies, along with their blood supply and amniotic fluid, your doctor will order repeat testing and ultrasounds throughout your pregnancy.      How do monochorionic anomalies affect my babies?      Twins in general are more likely than single fetuses to face challenges with development and delivery. These chances increase for monochorionic twins. Some concerns are:      Low birth weight      Birth weight is a factor for nearly all monochorionic twins. All twins are 10 times more likely to have a lower birth weight than babies from single pregnancies are. For monochorionic twins, the risk of low birth weight is four times higher than in pregnancies in which each fetus has its own placenta.      Weight inequality between your twins      Weight inequality also can be a concern. A significant difference in the weight of the babies is more common among monochorionic twins. When there is not enough nutrition for one or both fetuses to develop at a normal rate, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) can occur.      Differing amniotic fluid levels      Unequal amniotic fluid levels can affect your twins. Twins deprived of a blood supply will produce too little amniotic fluid – a condition called oligohydramnios. This condition limits their movement and bladder size, among other consequences. A larger than normal blood supply will result in excess amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios), enlarged bladder and the possibility of hydrops (heart failure).      Cord entanglement or compression      Cord entanglement or compression is a risk for all monochorionic-monoamniotic twins who share the same space in a single amniotic sac. Umbilical cords are the lifeline to blood and nutrients for all fetuses. Like a garden hose, if the cords flatten or bend, the supply line can be damaged or cut off, impacting fetal development and increasing the risk of death.      TTTS and TRAP sequence      Two conditions called TTTS and TRAP sequence may develop in rare circumstances. These conditions, caused by inequalities in the blood supply, have serious implications for the fetuses and require highly specialized care. If TTTS is not detected and treated, it is likely to result in the loss of both babies. In TRAP sequence, one twin will not survive because it does not have a developed heart and brain structure. The survival rate for the healthy twin is 25 to 50 percent when TRAP sequence is not detected and treated.      How do anomalies in monochorionic twins affect the pregnancy?      Care guidelines for monochorionic pregnancies with anomalies are similar to those for mothers carrying all twins. Depending on your babies’ needs, your doctor will make adjustments in your care plan. For example, your doctor may change guidelines for:      Nutrition      Rest      Prenatal visits      Other factors      Your doctor will also want to closely observe your babies and monitor their health through ultrasound and other tests.      Your doctor may also recommend:      Bed rest      Tocolytic medications (medications to stop contractions or labor)      Other measures to prevent early delivery      There is a possibility you will have to be hospitalized for constant monitoring. This is the case for babies with cord entanglement, TTTS and TRAP sequence, for example.      What to expect during labor and delivery      There is a good chance your labor and delivery will be early. Premature delivery is the most common complication of twin pregnancy. This rate does not increase significantly when the pregnancy is monochorionic, but the rate of very early delivery (before 32 weeks) is nearly twice as high when compared with dichorionic twins. Even without major complications, most doctors will recommend that monochorionic twins be delivered at least three weeks before the official due date.      There is also a greater incidence of cesarean section deliveries in monochorionic pregnancies, especially when they are monoamniotic and at risk for cord entanglement at birth.      How are abnormalities and complications in monochorionic twins treated?      Treatments for complications of monochromic pregnancies vary depending on the condition of the babies.      Cord entanglement      In the case of cord entanglement, physicians may recommend delivery of the twins as soon they are mature enough to survive, which may be as early as 24 weeks. In these cases, your doctor may give you corticosteroid medications to accelerate lung development in your twins so they have a greater chance of surviving outside of the womb. Many cases of cord entanglement need extensive monitoring of the twins in the hospital to help determine the best time to deliver them.      Amniotic fluid issues      If excessive amniotic fluid is a concern, your physician may perform an amnioreduction to reduce the amount of amniotic fluid. This procedure will:      Make you more comfortable      Reduce the chance of premature labor      Better equalize the flow of blood between your twins      Your physician may need to repeat this procedure throughout your pregnancy.      TTTS      In the case of TTTS, an increasingly successful approach involves disconnecting part of the blood supply between the twins using a technique called fetoscopic laser ablation of the shared placental vessels, otherwise known as laser ablation.      This procedure is only offered at select treatment centers, like Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin through the Fetal Concerns Center. In 80 to 85 percent of laser surgery procedures, at least one twin survives; both twins survive in 65 to 70 percent of cases. The survival rate of both twins with TTTS without laser ablation is 10 to 20 percent.      TRAP sequence      If your doctor has diagnosed TRAP sequence, he or she may recommend delivery of the healthy twin if your pregnancy is far enough along. In other cases, your doctor may recommend prenatal treatments to stop the extra pumping between the twins. These procedures, performed using highly specialized techniques within the womb, may include radiofrequency ablation. RFA is usually performed between 17 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.      RFA is a procedure performed by our team of experts in the Fetal Concerns Center and at a very limited number of neonatal centers across the country. The procedure uses heat energy to stop the blood flow to the umbilical cord of the underdeveloped twin. RFA has been shown to be extremely successful, with a 90 percent or higher survival rate for the normal twin when delivered at least 35 weeks into the pregnancy.      Are there risks of treatment?      Procedures such as amnioreduction, laser ablation or RFA, like any surgeries, pose a risk of bleeding and infection that can lead to complications for both the mother and baby.      Other potential complications related to fetal surgery include injury to the baby and premature labor and delivery.      If you have one of these procedures, you will most likely be admitted to the hospital for monitoring for two to three days. After your stay, your doctor will discharge you for ongoing care by your obstetrician. You may have to be on bed rest and you may have to take medications to prevent premature delivery.      If your babies are born prematurely or with special needs, they will be cared for in a special care nursery called a neonatal intensive care unit. At the NICU, expert physicians and staff can quickly respond if your babies need specialized care.      Will I be able to help care for my babies?      Yes. Ask your nurse about ways to interact with and care for your babies. Babies that are healthy at birth may need only a brief stay in a special care nursery. Others may need more time in the NICU to resolve health issues.      Breastfeeding and pumping/storing      Many mothers are able to successfully breastfeed their twins. Lactation specialists can help mothers of multiples learn techniques for breastfeeding their babies separately and together and increase their milk supply.      Mothers whose babies are unable to breastfeed because they are sick or premature can pump their breast milk and store the milk for later feedings.      Getting help with your babies      Families with more than one baby need help from family and friends, especially if the pregnancy was complicated and there are other siblings at home. Having help will allow you more time to get to know your babies, take care of feedings and rest and recover from delivery.      When can my babies go home?      Most monochorionic twins with anomalies will need to be cared for in the NICU. How long your babies remain hospitalized will vary depending on their conditions. Once babies are able to feed, grow and stay warm, they usually can go home.      What is the long-term prognosis for my babies?      The long-term prognosis depends on the types of complications caused by the monochorionic pregnancy, including birth weight and prematurity. Low-birth-weight babies have an increased risk of long-term problems, such as:      Mental retardation      Cerebral palsy      Vision loss      Hearing loss      Babies born between 24 and 32 weeks have a high risk of death or severe handicaps if they survive. Babies born after 32 weeks often face feeding and breathing problems, but they nearly always survive.      What about future pregnancies?      Having a previous monochorionic pregnancy does not influence whether or not you will have another one. The incidence of identical twins is not influenced by family history, so the chances of having them are the same for all women – approximately 1 in 285 pregnancies.      The chance for any woman to have a monochorionic pregnancy with anomalies is approximately 1 in 5,816 pregnancies or less than 0.05 percent. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video      ANKENY, Iowa -- An Ankeny woman went into a walk-in clinic with stomach pains and received news she never expected, she was pregnant with a rare set of twins and didn't even know it.

They have one placenta and one amniotic sac and both of those twins share the placenta as well as the sac,�? says Dr. Jennifer Krupp with Perinatal Center of Iowa.      Dr. Krupp says less than one percent of all twins are monoamniotic and those babies face serious complications including a fifty-percent survival rate.      “The entanglement of the cords is what we worry about. We bring the patients into the hospital at 24 to 26 weeks, so we can monitor the babies several times a day, because we know the risk of one or both of those babies dying is fairly significant,�? says Dr. Krupp.      Magnani and Croskey realize how different things could have turned out.      “I\`m still trying to process. It\`s crazy how high risk mono-mono twins can be, and how good they\`re doing now, it\`s really a blessing,�? says Magnani.      Ava and Anna were delivered by C-section on Thursday weighing just four and three pounds each.      The girls will spend the next several weeks in the NICU at Mercy but other than some monitoring are expected to be okay.      “They\`re both just little miracles, it could have been so many things that went wrong that didn't,�? says Magnani.      Magnani and Croskey missed out on the worst part of having monamniotic twins, the worry. Now they can just focus on the best part, being parents to two beautiful little girls.      “I love them, I love them more than anything,�? says Croskey.      Doctors expect Anna and Ava to be able to go home in a couple weeks.      Croskey and Magnani are both attending classes at DMACC for automotive technology and hope to open their own business following graduation.      The family is scrambling to find clothes, diapers and everything else needed to care for the twins. A donation site has been set up to help raise money for the girls, click here for more information and to donate. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the challenges and possibilities surrounding monochorionic twin pregnancies. Monochorionic twins share one placenta, with types varying in whether they share an amniotic sac or not. Early ultrasound diagnoses can detect these pregnancies and spot potential anomalies, leading to specialist care and monitoring. Monochorionic twins have an elevated risk of low birth weight, weight inequality, differing fluid levels, and rare but dangerous conditions like TTTS and TRAP sequence. Early or cesarean delivery is commonly needed, and treatments for complications involve procedures like amnioreduction, laser ablation, or radiofrequency ablation. It also details the prognosis for babies born from such pregnancies, and illustrates the above information with a case where an Iowa woman unwittingly carried a less common type of monochorionic twin pregnancy, with both babies surviving and potentially defying the general 50% survival rate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A TV program was being videoed. Tonight it was to select the sweetest whisper of love ever said between husband and wife. The final competition was held among 10 married couples. Seven of them were young ones, two middle-aged and one old. The last turn came to the old couple. The old lady took the microphone and said the sweetest whisper of love she had ever heard was: \\" Are you standing or sitting?\\" The host fixed his eyes on her, quite puzzled by her words. Regardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story. Her husband had been a doctor before he retired. One day when he was on duty at the hospital, he felt a sharp pain at the heart. By his professional knowledge he knew immediately he suffered a fit of heart attack. His colleagues carried him at once to the operation room and prepared  him for a bypass operation, which was highly risky. The patient's family members had to be informed before it began. The patient himself was allowed to put in a word. Lying silently on the operation table with a trembling hand, he dialed after a moment's thinking of the number of his wife's phone. Finally a familiar voice came from the other end... \\"So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind. What he said in the beginning was: 'Are you standing or sitting?' He was actually worried about me, wondering how I felt at the news. He was afraid I would have fallen flat onto the ground. In such a critical  state as he was then, his thought still went to me...\\" The old lady concluded slowly, \\"That's the sweetest whisper of love I've ever heard all my life.\\" A loud applause followed in the wake of a short silence. Question: Why did the audience begin talking agter hearing the old woman's first sentence? - They didn't believe what she had said. - They couldn't hear what she was saying. - They got bored with her story. - They felt confused by her words.

Q: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and... According to the above context, answer the following question. When should we build a Roadmap The answer is:","output":"We should build a Roadmap at the beginning of each cycle, which is typically a six-month period. This practice ensures that the team has a clear direction and set of goals to work towards during that specific time frame. By developing a roadmap at the start of a cycle, it allows the team to have a better understanding of the tasks, resources, and commitments needed for successful project completion. Moreover, it fosters a sense of accountability, empowers team members, and helps track progress and achievements throughout the cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On March 19, 2002, Audioslave was confirmed for the seventh annual Ozzfest; despite, at that time, having neither an official name nor a release date for their debut album. A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\").

They fly in to their base and go about the usual routine. Capt William Lennox [Josh Duhamel] is contacting his wife and seeing his baby girl again, when a helicopter previously thought to have been shot down over Afghanistan comes up on the radar. It lands at the base, and the base commander orders it to stand down; but, instead, it transforms into the Decepticon Blackout and attacks the base. Blackout also lets out some kind of jamming field that blocks all communication channels. He blasts his way through the base, only momentarily dazzled by flares shot at his face (which saves Tech Sgt Robert Epps [Tyrese Gibson], after Epps got scans of Blackout). Blackout locates the base's mainframe and downloads information until the humans cut the computer's hardline, terminating the network's connection. Blackout then destroys the base and everyone on it, save for a few who escape.

The good thing is you no longer need to wonder, because something like this already exists. And its name is Siri. Siri is a voice recognition application designed for Apple products and the concept has been around for almost a year. When Siri first came out it could only speak English, but now it has \\"learned\\" lots of new languages, including Chinese, Cantonese and Taiwanese, reported The Wall Street Journal. So, you can give it orders in your mother tongue. But how could a cell phone or a computer \\"hear\\" what you are saying and understand it? This is all because of voice recognition technology. When you speak, your voice creates vibrations   in the air - a bit like waves in the water when you throw a rock into the lake. The microphone receives the vibrations and the computer changes them into digital data that is then divided into many parts. They are analyzed one by one to see what pronunciations each part stands for. The computer then puts these pronunciations together into possible words according to its built-in dictionary. But figuring out the words is far from enough; building words into meaningful sentences is the most difficult part. The computer has to compare what it hears to a large library of known phrases and sentences to determine what the user is saying. However, people don't always talk in the most standard way and sometimes make grammatical mistakes. This is why traditional voice recognition software always requires you to remember keywords and to speak in a certain way. Fortunately, Siri isn't like that. It's not just \\"voice recognition\\"; it's \\"natural language understanding (NLU)\\". You can ask it things like \\"Do I need an umbrella today?\\" and it will know that you are asking about the weather, according to ABC News. \\"The key thing is NLU -...

(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Several months after the events of The Fly, Veronica Quaife delivers Seth Brundle's child. After giving birth to a squirming larval sac, she dies from shock. The sac then splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. The child, named Martin Brundle, is raised by Anton Bartok, owner of Bartok Industries (the company which financed Brundle's teleportation experiments). Fully aware of the accident which genetically merged Seth Brundle with a housefly (a condition that Martin has inherited), Bartok plans to exploit the child's unique condition. Martin grows up in a clinical environment, and is constantly subjected to studies and tests by scientists. His physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease. As Martin grows, Bartok befriends him. At age 3, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old, and frequently sneaks around and explores the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals, and befriends a Golden Retriever. The next night, he brings the dog some of his dinner, only to find it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have managed to reassemble Brundle's Telepods, but were unable to duplicate his programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects. Using the Golden Retriever as a test subject, the experiment fails, leaving the dog horribly deformed. The dog attacks and maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin. Two years later, Martin's body has matured to that of a 25-year-old. On his fifth birthday, Bartok presents Martin with a bungalow on the Bartok facility's property. He also...

Former Nebraska senator Chuck Hagel will testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee today as he seeks to make the case for why he should be the next Secretary of Defense.      While Hagel’s nomination has been quite controversial — on both the left and the right — he appears to have weathered the initial storm and, having won the backing of influential New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, seems likely headed for confirmation.      Still, much rides on Hagel’s performance before the committee today. The committee is packed with opponents (ranking Republican Jim Inhofe has already said he would oppose Hagel’s nomination), former friends (John McCain) and likely supporters who still need to hear a few correct answers to reassure them (Kirstin Gillibrand).      Below are five senators on the Armed Services Committee worth keeping an eye on — for a variety of reasons — during Thursday’s hearing. Whom did we miss? The comments section awaits.      1. Ted Cruz: The Texas Republican senator may have only been elected in 2012, but he’s already making waves for his outspokenness in the Senate. (He was a forceful advocate for gun rights in a hearing on gun violence in the Senate Wednesday, for example.) Cruz, who was elected thanks to the power of the tea party movement, has already come out in opposition to Hagel’s nomination; Cruz has said Hagel has “consistently advocated weakness” in matters of foreign affairs. And Cruz was one of only three senators to vote against John Kerry’s confirmation as Secretary of State on Tuesday.      2. Kirstin Gillibrand: The New York Democrat has given every indication since meeting with Hagel that she will be a ‘yes’ vote but has said she will resist coming out publicly one way or the other until after the hearing. Expect Gillibrand’s questioning to focus heavily on Hagel’s past statements about Israel and the threat posed by Iran — areas of considerable concern not only to her constituents in the Empire State but also of major importance if she wants to pursue national office at some point. Gillibrand, an early sponsor of repealing the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy for gays in the military, is also expected to get Hagel to state publicly that he’ll do whatever is necessary to ensure that the policy is fully repealed.      3. Lindsey Graham: The South Carolina senator has every reason to give Hagel a hard time. Graham has already called Hagel’s pick an “in-your-face nomination” by President Obama and insisted that the former GOP senator has “long severed his ties with the Republican party.” Graham faces the very real possibility of a primary challenge from his ideological right next year, and the Hagel hearings are a good place to allay some concerns conservatives have with him.      4. Jim Inhofe: You might think that Inhofe, of Oklahoma, might go easy on his fellow Plains-state senator. You’d be wrong. Very wrong. Not only has Inhofe already gone on record in opposition to Hagel’s nomination, but he has also suggested that voting for Hagel would amount to “giving (Obama) that added impetus to do the things that I think are destroying America.” So there’s that. Now, while Inhofe is expected to hammer Hagel on things like Iran, the two are friendly on a personal level, and so that may limit Inhofe’s aggressiveness. Or it may not.      5. John McCain: The history of faded friendship between Hagel and McCain makes this perhaps the most intriguing coupling of the hearing. McCain has withheld his endorsement from Hagel to date and said Sunday he won’t decide how he will vote until after the hearing. He and Hagel parted ways during the early part of the last decade over the way forward in Iraq, and in the immediate aftermath of Hagel’s nomination, McCain said he had “serious concerns about positions Sen. Hagel has taken on a range of critical national security issues in recent years.” Will McCain allow a once-close friendship to trump those policy concerns? Or will it be the other way around?      DCCC raises 1.9 million: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee will announce today that it raised 1.9 million since late November, ending the 2012 cycle with nearly 184 million raised, a DCCC aide tells The Fix.      That figure is actually 20 million more than the committee raised during the 2010 election cycle, when the party was in the majority.      It also has less debt (13.5 million) than it did after the 2010 cycle (19 million), along with more cash (1.5 million versus 800,000), leaving it in better financial shape to start the 2014 election cycle.      Cuccinelli sounds like Romney in book: Virginia governor hopeful Ken Cuccinelli (R) is set to come out with a book in which he echoes — in part — Mitt Romney’s “47 percent” comment.      “Sometimes bad politicians set out to grow government in order to increase their own power and influence,” the attorney general writes. “This phenomenon doesn’t just happen in Washington; it happens at all levels of government. The amazing thing is that they often grow government without protest from citizens, and sometimes they even get buy-in from citizens — at least from the ones getting the goodies.”      He adds: “Citizens will vote for those politicians who promise more benefits each year, rather than the fiscally responsible politicians who try to point out that such programs are unsustainable and will eventually bankrupt the states or the nation.”      Cuccinelli is very conservative — there is no doubt about that — and Democrats will undoubtedly try to use stuff like this to marginalize him.      Fixbits:      Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) responds to Erick Erickson’s criticism of his immigration reform push. Meanwhile, Ann Coulter and Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) go after Rubio.      Rubio is moving his family to Washington, and selling his house back in Florida. He will still keep a home in his home state, though.      Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) says Rubio is “amazingly naive” on the immigration issue.      Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) says video games are a bigger problem than guns.      Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) is very close to announcing his Senate campaign.      Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) says allegations that he used prostitutes in the Dominican Republican are “false.” The office of a Menendez ally whose plane that senator has used was raided this week.      Potential Kentucky Senate hopeful Ashley Judd (D) and her race-car driver husband Dario Franchitti are getting divorced.

If confirmed as secretary of defense, the one-time infantry sergeant and twice-wounded Vietnam veteran would be the first Pentagon chief to have spent his entire military service in the enlisted ranks. The former Republican senator from Nebraska gets his chance to answer questions Thursday morning during his confirmation hearing, and here are five subjects where he can expect them:      1. Afghanistan      If confirmed, Hagel will be tasked with closing out the longest war in U.S. history, one that has now lasted more than 11 years. He opposed President Barack Obama's decision to send another 30,000 troops into the conflict in 2009, telling the National Journal, \\"I think we're marking time as we slaughter more young people.\\" The Obama administration now plans to pull combat troops out of Afghanistan by 2014, replacing them with a training mission to advise Afghan forces, steps Hagel will oversee if confirmed.      2.

MUST WATCH Top generals back Hagel 05:36      As a senator, Hagel supported the \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy that kept gays and lesbians from serving openly in the U.S. military. He told The New York Times in 1999, \\"The U.S. armed forces aren't some social experiment.\\" And the nominee's opponents have seized on his 1998 criticism of a Clinton administration State Department nominee as being \\"openly, aggressively gay,\\" a remark for which Hagel apologized in December.      Now he's been asked to lead a department that has allowed gays and lesbians since 2011. And he'll be left to implement the plans outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced last week to open front-line combat units to women, which allow the generals and admirals to ask for exemptions for certain posts. As defense secretary, Hagel would have to make the final call on those requests.      3. The Big One      Hagel is among the backers of the \\"Global Zero\\" movement, which has called for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons under a worldwide regime of inspections. He was a co-author of a 2011 study by the group that called for reducing the current U.S. arsenal of about 5,000 warheads and bombs to about 900, a force Global Zero says would be enough to deter potential attackers while reducing the risk of proliferation or nuclear terrorism.      That position has raised some eyebrows, since Hagel would be the steward of that American arsenal if confirmed. In a recent statement, Hagel's co-authors say their views and his \\"are in the U.S. national security interest and squarely in the mainstream,\\" while keeping nuclear stockpiles at Cold War levels aren't. And he's not the only high-profile figure to ultimately endorse the idea of a world without the bomb: Obama held out the same hope in 2009, as have presidents dating back to Ronald Reagan.      4. Cutting the Pentagon      Within weeks of taking office, Hagel could be forced to implement steep cuts in the Pentagon budget as a result of \\"sequestration,\\" the automatic spending cuts set up in the deal that ended the 2011 standoff over the federal debt ceiling. At the beginning of the year, Congress voted to put off those cuts for two months.      Panetta has called those across-the-board cuts of about 9.4% \\"potentially devastating\\" and urged Congress to find another way to reduce spending. But Hagel has called the defense budget \\"bloated\\" and said the Pentagon \\"needs to be pared down.\\" Look for questions about how Hagel would wield that knife.      5. The Middle East: Iraq, Iran and Israel      This has been the biggest source of criticism for Hagel since Obama picked him to replace Leon Panetta in December and the rawest nerve for the Republicans with whom Hagel broke over the war in Iraq.      Hagel supported the U.S. invasion in 2003. But by 2007, he had come to believe it was a \\"blunder\\" and joined Democrats who tried to force the Bush administration to withdraw American troops. \\"He has long severed his ties with the Republican party,\\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CNN's \\"State of the Union.\\"      Republicans have accused him of being too cool to Israel, the leading U.S. ally in the Middle East, and too soft on Iran. Hagel has called for direct talks with the Islamic republic, which Western powers suspect is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, and he complained in 2007 that the \\"Jewish lobby\\" in Washington scared lawmakers away from supporting a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.      But others have rallied around him, including his friend Rabbi Aryeh Azriel of Temple Israel in Omaha, Nebraska. Azriel said Hagel is \\"definitely a friend of Israel\\" and \\"has wonderful, fresh ideas to try to re-engage the discussion about the Middle East.\\"      An Obama administration official working on the senator's confirmation hearing told CNN that Hagel will testify that he believes Iran is a state sponsor of terror; he supports the president's sanctions strategy against Iran and believes all options should be on the table including the military option. ||||| Chuck Hagel, the former Republican senator tapped to become the next secretary of defense, has gone on a charm offensive in the lead-up to his confirmation hearing on Thursday, attempting to beat back a well-funded, aggressive campaign that has sought to depict him as an anti-Israel, homophobic politician eager to gut the Pentagon’s budget.      Hagel’s pushback during meetings with more than 50 senators and leaders of special interest groups this month appears to have been effective, said an official helping him prepare for the hearing.      The effort to vilify Hagel and his record, which began when his name was first floated for the job in December, has remained at a buzz but has not reached the type of crescendo that has doomed high-profile political nominations in the past.      “We’ve had a very aggressive strategy for tackling some of the issues that have been raised,” the Hagel aide said Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the nominee’s outlook. “I think we’re in a good place.”      That’s not to say Hagel’s confirmation is a forgone conclusion, supporters concede. Critics have piled onto the initial critiques with charges that Hagel’s ties to defense contractors and other private-sector firms may create conflicts of interest. They also have criticized his support for a global movement to eliminate nuclear weapons.      Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Hagel will face tough questions about his past statements. Democrats outnumber Republicans on the panel 14 to 12, but committee insiders say they are not assuming that Hagel will get the vote of every Democrat.      “The confirmation will not be an easy one,” Levin said in a recent interview. “On the other hand, a lot of people who have worked with Hagel remember him as someone who was effective here, involved in foreign affairs, well-qualified.”      Hagel, 66, a Vietnam veteran, is counting on those bonds, the aide said.      “If you read the tea leaves, I think he might get more Republican votes than people might think,” the official said. “Those relationships are important.”      After Thursday’s hearing, senators can submit additional written questions to Hagel. The committee and the full Senate could vote next week.      Hagel’s opening remarks will offer a blunt rebuttal to his critics, including conservative groups formed to foil his nomination. The official helping Hagel prepare said he also intends to offer a clear-eyed view of the Pentagon’s fiscal challenges, convey his commitment to preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons and voice strong support for the U.S. alliance with Israel.      Opposition from gay rights advocates over disparaging remarks Hagel made in 1998 about an openly gay man nominated for an ambassadorship has largely subsided. James Hormel, the former diplomat Hagel disparaged as “aggressively gay,” endorsed him this week, saying he believes that Hagel’s views have evolved. Hagel has said he is committed to expanding benefits to same-sex military couples.      The former senator will also say that he will try to avoid the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, which will come into effect March 1 if the White House and lawmakers do not reach a deal — a prospect that appears increasingly likely.      Sen. James M. Inhofe (Okla.), the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said he and other senators who oppose Hagel have not been convinced by his efforts to clarify, retract or expand on previous positions.      He said Hagel’s perceived lukewarm commitment to Israel’s security will probably be the nominee’s chief vulnerability.      Inhofe and five other Republican lawmakers opened a new line of inquiry this week, asking Hagel in a letter to answer detailed questions about his ties to several companies that together paid him more than 1 million last year.      M.I.C. Industries, a Reston firm, paid Hagel 120,000 last year. Since 2008, the company has received more than 50 million in Defense Department contracts, according to federal contracting records.      Hagel received 116,000 last year from Chevron, which has billed the Defense Department more than 1.5 billion since 2008.      It is not uncommon for high-profile former lawmakers to land lucrative consulting fees and posts on company boards. Following protocol, Hagel has agreed to divest his stocks in Chevron and the McCarthy Group, a financial firm he ran after leaving the Senate in 2008, and sever ties with other organizations, including Georgetown University, where he has taught since 2009.      Hagel became a star professor at the university’s Walsh School of Foreign Service, where his geopolitics class routinely had a waiting list. Michael Podberezin, 27, who took the class last fall, said students admired Hagel’s informed, nuanced views on current events.      Podberezin, an Israeli citizen who served in his country’s armed forces, said he debated with Hagel on policy issues, including whether Israel should attack Iran’s nuclear program and the United States’ response to Syria’s civil war.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Out of fuel GOCE satellite to crash-land on Earth Sunday afternoon A 2,000-pound European satellite has run out of fuel and will plunge back to Earth sometime between 5:30 P.M. EST and 7:30 P.M., a spokesman for Europe's Space Debris Office told FoxNews.com. As of 3:00 P.M. it was buzzing Africa's Western shores preparing to cross the Atlantic Ocean en route to Greenland. Its next orbit will bring it closer to North America's East Coast. Where precisely it will crash remains up in the air. Full name: Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer Launch site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia Mission control: European Space Operations Centre (ESOC), Darmstadt, Germany Mission cost: 470 million (including launcher and operations) Size: 17.4 feet long, about 3 feet body diameter Propulsion tank: 88 pounds of xenon As the whizzing GOCE -- or Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer -- descends, scientists are carefully monitoring it to determine the landing site and ensure public safety. \\"We've seen the spacecraft again over Kiruna\\" in Sweden, wrote Christoph Steiger, GOCE Operations Manager for ESA, on the agency's Rocket Science blog. \\"GOCE is still doing great.\\" With each orbit, it descends from a current altitude of under 78 miles by about 0.6 miles per hour. \\"With a very high probability, a re-entry over Europe can be excluded,\\" wrote Heiner Klinkrad, head of ESA's Space Debris Office, Sunday morning. Klinkrad, who is closely monitoring the GOCE re-entry, cited radar measurements and satellite-to-satellite tracking. “The most probable impact ground swath runs over oceans and polar regions, as well as uninhabited areas of Australia,” he said. WHERE IS IT NOW? Track the GOCE satellite here GOCE ran out of gas last month and has been steadily sinking towards the Earth. As the planet rotates, the satellite whizzes over nearly every point between the poles. Experts expect it to plunge harmlessly into the oceans that cover 70 percent of the planet's surface. But not everyone is convinced of that. On Saturday, odds makers with British gaming company Ladbrokes gave FoxNews.com 6 to 4 odds it would crash-land in North or South America. - Marcia S. Smith, president of the Space and Technology Policy Group Should the satellite end up in your backyard, experts said the government responsible for launching it would be responsible for any damage -- that would be Russia, in this case. “Basically, governments are responsible for their own spacecraft,” explained Marcia S. Smith, president of the Space and Technology Policy Group in Arlington, Va. “[If] you could prove a piece of GOCE hit your Honda, you could go to your government to make a claim,” she told FoxNews.com. GOCE has been orbiting Earth since March 2009 at the lowest altitude of any research satellite. With a sleek, aerodynamic design meant to eliminate drag on the craft from the planet -- it's been called the \\"Ferrari of space\\" -- GOCE has mapped variations in Earth’s gravity, creating a model of the planet's \\"geoid.\\" INTERACTIVE: Larger module to track Europe's falling, 2,000-pound satellite The satellite is 17.4 feet long, according to the European Space Agency. A 2014 Chevrolet Suburban is 18.5 feet long, including the bumpers. The slim satellite is only 1/3 the weight of the truck, however.

In the first part of the triple \\"2QR AGGREGATE 3-3 (a.g.)\\", it presents a situation where 2QR has played against another team in an aggregate match and the result stands at a 3-3 draw. The term 'aggregate' here refers to a format used primarily in association football in knock-out competitions where the two participants play twice, at home and away, with the combined score over two legs deciding the winner. In some cases, such as this specific one mentioning \\"a.g.\\", there might be a rule called \\"away goals\\" which serves as a tie-breaker. When teams score an equal number of goals over the two legs, the team that has scored more goals in their away fixture advances. On the other hand, the second part of the triple \\"2QR AWAY 0-2\\", is portraying a typical away match scenario for 2QR. 'AWAY' describes that the match mentioned was played on the opponent's ground rather than 2QR's home ground. The result states that 2QR has lost this match by a 0-2 score, meaning the opposing team managed to score two goals without a reply from 2QR.

The comparison of the movie to lint accumulation in a fat man's navel indicates that the critic believes the movie to be undesirable, of low quality, or easily forgettable, much like how lint in a navel is an undesirable and often unnoticed occurrence. Additionally, the language used in this expression is not flattering. The words \\"fat man's navel\\" paint an unappealing image which adds a layer of disgust or displeasure to the review. It prompts the reader to associate the movie with something unattractive, making it less appealing to potential viewers.  Furthermore, this phrase also implies that the critic thinks the movie is insignificant and easily ignored, as lint in a navel is usually not a prominent concern for most people. Thus, the critic does not see any outstanding or remarkable qualities in the movie that would make it stand out or be worth going out of your way to watch. In light of these factors, it is evident that the critic's mindset during the review was negative, as the comparison chosen effectively conveys a sense of disappointment, unattractiveness, and insignificance in regards to the movie in question.

Q:During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states.  Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan.

She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision.  Would Jennifer see more or less sunsets in Malarn? A:","output":"Jennifer would likely see more red sunsets in Malarn due to the large amount of dust in the air from the nearby desert. The dust particles in the atmosphere can scatter sunlight, leading to an increase in red sunsets. However, it is important to note that the dust can also negatively impact air quality and suppress rainfall, which are factors Jennifer may want to consider when making her decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"During the First Opium War, the British navy defeated Eight Banners forces at Ningbo and Dinghai.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, that is correct. The British navy defeated the Eight Banners forces at Ningbo and Dinghai during the First Opium War. To provide more context, here is a detailed explanation of the event and its historical significance: The First Opium War took place between 1839 and 1842 and was fought between the British Empire and the Qing Dynasty of China, primarily over their disagreements regarding the trade of opium. The war marked a turning point in China's dealings with foreign powers and set the stage for a series of unequal treaties that would have far-reaching consequences for China. The Eight Banners forces were an integral part of the Qing Dynasty's military organization. The Eight Banners system was established during the early years of the dynasty and comprised soldiers from various ethnic groups, including the Manchu, Han, Mongols, and others. These forces were divided into eight separate banners, each represented by different colors and insignia. The primary purpose of the Eight Banners forces was to serve as the backbone of the Qing military. Doing so, they played a crucial role in maintaining social order and protecting the empire from external threats. In 1841, the British navy, under the command of Admiral Sir William Parker, launched an offensive campaign against the Chinese coastal cities of Ningbo and Dinghai. These cities were strategically important, as they controlled the access routes to the larger cities of Hangzhou and Shanghai. By capturing Ningbo and Dinghai, the British navy aimed to exert further pressure on the Qing government and force them to negotiate on their terms. The British navy's superior firepower and advanced military tactics soon proved to be too much for the Eight Banners forces stationed at Ningbo and Dinghai. Despite a fierce resistance and the use of advanced weaponry, such as the deployment of the \\"Red Barbarian\\" cannon and the strategic positioning of fire ships, the Qing military was ill-prepared for the British navy's onslaught. Commanders on the British side included senior officers such as Captain Richard Saunders Dundas and naval strategist Sir Henry Pottinger, who played key roles in outmaneuvering their opponents. The British navy successfully defeated the Eight Banners forces at Ningbo on March 10, 1841, and later at Dinghai on July 2, 1841. The Qing forces not only suffered significant casualties in these battles, but following the capture of these cities, the British forces ravaged the surrounding towns and villages, further exacerbating the devastation faced by the local population. The Ningbo and Dinghai victories significantly weakened China's ability to resist further British incursions. The British victory over the Eight Banners forces at Ningbo and Dinghai ultimately paved the way for the end of the First Opium War. As a result of their losses and the crippling decline in their military capabilities, the Qing government was eventually forced to sign the Treaty of Nanking in August 1842. This treaty, considered the first of the unequal treaties, marked the beginning of a series of humiliating and exploitative treaties imposed by Western powers upon China during the 19th century. In conclusion, during the First Opium War, the British navy defeated the Eight Banners forces at Ningbo and Dinghai, leading to the eventual signing of the Treaty of Nanking and the beginning of China's \\"Century of Humiliation.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why was the narrator fine with the Image books being so late ?","output":"The narrator was fine with the Image books being so late because they felt that the quality and content of the books made the wait worthwhile. The passage suggests that the storyline and direction of the series, such as Cyberforce with its interesting twists and turns, as well as the introduction of a supernatural edge in the later issues, provided an engaging and satisfying experience for the reader. Additionally, the fact that the main enemy was destroyed in the 25th issue showcased the series' ability to evolve and keep the readers interested by changing directions and exploring new themes. The transition from a more conventional storyline to a supernatural one also worked well within the context of Top Cow's overarching themes, adding another layer of enjoyment for the fans of the publisher. In summary, the narrator was fine with the Image books being late because they believed that the overall experience and satisfaction derived from the series outweighed the inconvenience caused by the delays in the publication schedule. The well-crafted storylines, engaging characters, and the introduction of novel elements kept the readers invested and eager to follow the series despite the lateness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Mutation Mutations are changes to an organism’s DNA and are an important driver of diversity in populations. Species evolve because of the accumulation of mutations that occur over time. The appearance of new mutations is the most common way to introduce novel genotypic and phenotypic variance. Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are quickly eliminated from the population by natural selection. Others are beneficial and will spread through the population. Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and reproduce. Some mutations do not do anything and can linger, unaffected by natural selection, in the genome. Some can have a dramatic effect on a gene and the resulting phenotype.   Q: What term is used to describe changes to an organism’s dna and are an important driver of diversity in populations?   A: pick from the following. a). adaptations b). pathogens c). evolutions d). mutations Answer:","output":"d). mutations The term used to describe changes to an organism's DNA and an important driver of diversity in populations is \\"mutations.\\" According to the given paragraph, mutations are changes to an organism's DNA that contribute to the evolution of species due to the accumulation of these mutations over time. These mutations are responsible for introducing novel genotypic and phenotypic variance, and they can be either harmful, beneficial, or neutral. Harmful mutations are usually eliminated from the population through natural selection, while beneficial mutations spread throughout the population. The determination of a mutation's effect depends on whether it helps the organism survive until sexual maturity and reproduce. Neutral mutations do not affect the organism and can stay in the genome, unaffected by natural selection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a title for this article: The actress, who stars as a vice girl in The Deuce, was filming scenes in Harlem, New York MAGGIE Gyllenhaal donned a skimpy crochet bra top and hot pants as she filmed scenes for her latest drama The Deuce, ih which she plays a prostitute. The usually demurely dressed star showed off her fine physique in the outfit, which she was wearing for her role as a prostitute in the 70’s HBO drama. Shooting scenes in Harlem, in New York on Monday, the actress, 38, left little to the imagination in her get-up. She was seen leaning nonchalantly into a car, as she appeared to chat up a prospective customer in the role. The cream flannel high-waisted hotpants she wore showed off her slender pins, and her yellow crochet bikini top barely kept control of her cleavage. The raunchy streetwalker look was dramatically different from her red carpet style, which is effortlessly stylish and classy. Golden Globe Maggie, who plays hooker Eileen Merrell, who is also known as Candy, stopped to speak to crew as they took a break from filming. She had a beaded bag slung casually over her shoulder, and carried a silver jacket in her hands. However her footwear was less than glam as she strolled along the sidewalk, wearing a pair of black sliders. But she changed it up to a pair of strappy high heels for some of the scenes. In one she posed, looking bored with some other women, who were touting their wares for business in similar skimpy outfits. She also puffed languidly on a cigarette for another take. James Franco and Zoe Kazing are starring in the drama, which Maggie is also producing. The series focuses on life in New York in the late 70’s and 80’s when prostitution and porn were prevalent. It follows the legalization of the industry, as well as the rise of HIV and the cocaine epidemic. James is playing twin brothers in the show – who were big in the seedy world of adult entertainment which grew up around Times Square. He is also co-producing the project, which was written by David Simon and George Pelacanos, who worked on The Wire and Treme. Maggie meanwhile has moved from the big to the small screen to prove her acting chops. She won an Outstanding Actress Golden Globe for playing the role of Nessa Stein in The Honourable Woman. The British political spy thriller aired on BBC Two in 2014, as a miniseries in eight parts. It was directed and written by Hugo Blick for the BBC and SundanceTV.

It contains approximately 85 species in two genera, \\"Alangium\\" and \\"Cornus\\". They are mostly trees and shrubs, which may be deciduous or evergreen, although a few species are perennial herbs. Members of the family usually have opposite or alternate simple leaves, four- or five-parted flowers clustered in inflorescences or pseudanthia, and drupaceous fruits. In northern temperate areas, Cornaceae are well known from the dogwoods \\"Cornus\\".  - An inflorescence is a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a stem that is composed of a main branch or a complicated arrangement of branches. Morphologically, it is the part of the shoot of seed plants where flowers are formed and which is accordingly modified. The modifications can involve the length and the nature of the internodes and the phyllotaxis, as well as variations in the proportions, compressions, swellings, adnations, connations and reduction of main and secondary axes. Inflorescence can also be defined as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern.  - Alangium is a small genus of flowering plants. The genus is included either in a broad view of the dogwood family Cornaceae, or as the sole member of its own family Alangiaceae. \\"Alangium\\" has about 40 species, but some of the species boundaries are not entirely clear. The type species for \\"Alangium\\" is \\"Alangium decapetalum\\", which is now treated as a subspecies of \\"Alangium salviifolium\\". All of the species are shrubs or small trees, except the liana \\"Alangium kwangsiense\\". \\"A. chinense, A. platanifolium\\", and \\"A. salviifolium\\" are known in cultivation.  - Cornus is a genus of about 3060 species of woody plants in the family Cornaceae, commonly known as dogwoods, which can generally be distinguished by their blossoms, berries, and distinctive bark. Most are deciduous trees or shrubs, but a few species are nearly herbaceous perennial subshrubs, and a few of the woody species are evergreen. Several species have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an involucre of large, typically white petal-like bracts, while others have more open clusters of petal-bearing flowers. The various species of dogwood are native throughout much of temperate and boreal Eurasia and North America, with China and Japan and the southeastern United States particularly rich in native species.  - Mastixia glauca is a tree in the family Cornaceae . The specific epithet glauca is from the Greek meaning \`\` bluish - grey '' , referring to the colour of the leaf underside .  - The Cornales are an order of flowering plants, basal among the asterids, containing about 600 species. Plants within the Cornales usually have four-parted flowers, drupaceous fruits, and inferior gynoecia topped with disc-shaped nectaries.

Rak-Su, originating from Watford, England, is an R&B/Pop boy band made up of four talented members: Ashley Fongho, Jamaal Shurland, Myles Stephenson, and Mustafa Rahimtulla. The charismatic group noted for their original songs was the first male group and the second group ever to win the UK's X-Factor. The band's appeal was not just limited to their music. Their charisma and chemistry as well were captivating, and they had a unique style that set them apart from other competitors. Rak-Su’s journey on The X-Factor was unique because they often performed their original compositions rather than just covering famous songs as is tradition on the show. Their songs \\"Mona Lisa\\" and \\"I'm Feeling You\\" were notably popular, and their winning musical number was another original piece entitled \\"Dimelo.\\" Let's dive into their journey a bit more: At the first audition, Ash, Jamaal, Myles, and Mustafa impressed the judges and the audience with their original song \\"I'm Feeling You.\\" The quartet managed to entertain the crowd and the jury, led by Simon Cowell, who did not hesitate to send them into the next phase. Throughout the show, they continued to enthral everyone with their original compositions. They weren't just performers, but also composers who injected their unique style into the songs they created. During the live shows, Rak-Su continued to dominate, winning four out of six weekly public votes with their performances. It was clear that they were audience favorites. In the Grand Finale of X-Factor UK Season 14, Rak-Su was up against Grace Davies. Grace was an equally talented artist who had also performed her original songs throughout the competition. However, Rak-Su's performance of their original song \\"Dimelo,\\" featuring Wyclef Jean and Naughty Boy, finally sealed their X-Factor victory. With their X-Factor triumph, Rak-Su signed a record deal with Simon Cowell’s company, Syco Music. The group's success story on the X-Factor UK Season 14 is an excellent example of how a fusion of talent, originality, and charisma can create magic on stage and win the hearts of the jury and viewers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You shouldn't have played with rifles because to have is dangerous.","output":"The sentence you provided, \\"You shouldn't have played with rifles because to have is dangerous,\\" may convey the intended message, but it doesn't adhere to the strictest standards of grammatically correct or stylistically preferred English. A linguist might point out the following issues: 1. Ambiguity in \\"to have\\": The use of \\"to have\\" in the sentence is problematic because it can lead to ambiguity. In this context, it seems like you're trying to say that possessing rifles is dangerous in general. However, \\"to have\\" is a bit vague, and it's unclear whether you're referring to the mere possession or the act of handling rifles. 2. Lack of parallelism: The first part of the sentence talks about the past action of playing with rifles (using \\"shouldn't have played\\"), while the second part discusses the general dangerous nature of rifles in the present tense (using \\"is dangerous\\"). This difference in tenses can make the sentence sound disjointed and might confuse the reader. Here's a revised version of the sentence that addresses these issues and would generally be considered more correct by a linguist: \\"You shouldn't have played with rifles because possessing them is dangerous.\\" In this version, the sentence is more concise, and the specific term \\"possessing\\" replaces the ambiguous \\"to have.\\" Additionally, parallelism is maintained throughout the sentence, making it more reader-friendly and linguistically accurate."},{"instruction":"Given the question \\"What are Paula and her roommate planning to do?\\" and the answer \\"To talk to their landlord.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Whitney Brown, a privileged and popular Philadelphia teenager, nominates herself and her best friend, Lindsay, for class president (which they win because they promised to throw the best school formal). Her mother, Joan, then gives her a credit card so she can buy a dress for the formal. After Whitney does a great deal of shopping, Joan's credit card is eventually declined. Later, they see on television that the office where Whitney's father, Henry, works has declared bankruptcy. This means her father is now unemployed and her family will be destitute. The bank repossesses everything they have and Whitney's world becomes upended.  Her family has to move to Whitney's grandparents' old farm in the country. There, far from her dizzying world of shallow girlfriends, endless parties, and school pressures, she finds a new best pal: Bob, a beautiful and spirited Gypsy horse belonging to her new neighbor. The neighbor, Dusty, is a crusty rancher who turns out to be her estranged grandfather. Through her new relationships with Bob, Dusty, and her parents, Whitney rediscovers what it means to respect not only nature and her family, but also someone very special she had almost lost touch with: herself.

These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the first year of the 20th century, 1901, the introduction of 10-inch disc records took place. This significant advancement in the audio recording industry allowed for a longer playback time of more than three minutes, as opposed to the existing cylinder records, which could only play for about two minutes.

Question What may be the reason they are procrastinating ? Answer:","output":"There could be several reasons why an individual is procrastinating, and it could be a combination of various factors as well. In the given context, the individual seems to be overwhelmed with multiple tasks and assignments from different areas, including laundry, psychology reading, Latin translations, and French work, which were due at different times. Considering this, the potential reasons for their procrastination might include: 1. Lack of time management skills: The individual may not have adequately planned out their tasks and how to allocate time for each of them. Consequently, they ended up postponing or delaying the tasks, resulting in procrastination. 2. Overwhelm and stress: It seems like the individual has many tasks that require attention. The sheer volume of work may be causing feelings of overwhelm, and instead of tackling the tasks, they may be avoiding them to reduce the stress and anxiety associated with these pending tasks. 3. Task aversion: The person may dislike or find some or all of the tasks unpleasant or uninteresting, leading them to avoid the tasks in favor of more pleasurable activities. 4. Fear of failure or underperformance: In some cases, procrastination may stem from a fear of not being able to complete a task to a satisfactory standard. The individual may worry about their ability to manage tasks effectively, leading to a cycle in which they postpone tasks to avoid failure. 5. Perfectionism: Paradoxically, the individual's desire to complete tasks perfectly may lead to procrastination. They may spend too much time planning how to complete the tasks optimally without actually starting, leading to delays in taking action. 6. Low motivation: The individual may lack the necessary motivation to begin or complete the tasks, resulting in procrastination. They may not see the value of completing the tasks on time, or the tasks may not have any immediate and tangible rewards. 7. Poor self-discipline: In some cases, procrastination may arise from a lack of self-discipline, where the person lacks the ability to push themselves to start and complete tasks even when they do not feel inclined to do so. 8. External factors: Distractions or interruptions in the individual's environment, such as social media, family members, or other activities, may make it challenging to focus on tasks, leading to procrastination. To address procrastination, the person may need to identify the underlying causes and work on developing strategies to improve their time management, motivation, self-discipline, and overall approach to tasks. This may involve setting specific goals, breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps, and finding ways to make the tasks more enjoyable or rewarding. Additionally, they may need to prioritize tasks and create a schedule to allocate time for each task effectively. Addressing these factors may help them overcome procrastination and successfully complete their tasks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article using the following points: FECAFOOT released a statement confirming their ethics committee will probe claims of 'fraud' by seven Cameroon players in all three of their Group A games. A convicted fraudster correctly predicted Cameroon would lose 4-0 and have a man sent off against Croatia. Allegations were made by convicted match fixer Wilson Raj in Der Spiegel.","output":"Title: The Dark Cloud of Fraud Looms Over Cameroon's National Football Team: Ethics Committee to Investigate Introduction The Fédération Camerounaise de Football (FECAFOOT) has recently released a statement confirming that their ethics committee will commence an investigation into alleged fraudulent activities by seven of the nation's football players. The accusations suggest that these players had manipulated the outcomes of all three Group A games in a recent football tournament. The shocking revelations initially surfaced after a convicted fraudster accurately predicted the outcome of Cameroon's match against Croatia, which ultimately ended with a 4-0 defeat and the expulsion of one of the team's players. Details of these allegations, brought forth by the notorious match-fixer, Wilson Raj, were published in a recent issue of the German magazine, Der Spiegel. Dismissal During the Croatia Match It is critical to highlight the red-flag event that propelled this investigation into the public eye and raised concerns surrounding the credibility of the Cameroonian National Football Team. During Cameroon's match against Croatia in the group stage, midfielder Alex Song received a red card and was subsequently dismissed from the game, leaving his team a man short. Notably, this precise event was accurately predicted by the convicted fraudster, who had also managed to foresee Cameroon's defeat by a 4-0 margin. The eerie ease with which this individual could predict the match's outcome has fuelled suspicion among football fans and analysts alike. Allegations Made by Wilson Raj The man behind these sensational allegations is none other than Wilson Raj Perumal, a convicted match-fixer hailing from Singapore. He is widely known for his involvement in infamous match-fixing syndicates that have entangled numerous football leagues across the globe, with European countries like Italy and Finland among his victims. Raj has claimed responsibility for bribing seven Cameroon players to rig the outcomes of their matches in their national team's group stage fixtures. FECAFOOT's Response and Ethics Committee Investigation Although it is not the first time that such accusations have shaken the world of football, the detailed claims made by Wilson Raj have compelled FECAFOOT to take them seriously and launch a thorough investigation. The organization's ethics committee will probe into these allegations and assess the credibility of Raj's statements by scrutinizing the evidence he has provided. This evidence, consisting primarily of BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) conversations between Raj and an accomplice, supports his claim that several Cameroon players were bribed to sway the results of their group games. While the investigation is ongoing, the ethics committee, as well as both FIFA, are expected to cooperate to ensure that the inquiry is comprehensive and unbiased. It is essential that the probe examines all angles of these allegations, including potential links between players and the widespread networks of match fixers that have already been uncovered in other countries. Ultimately, this investigation aims to not only uncover the truth behind these accusations but also work towards the long-term eradication of such corrupt activities from the sport of football. Conclusion As the cloud of match-fixing and fraud continues to cast a shadow over Cameroon's national football team, FECAFOOT's ethics committee is duty-bound to conduct an impartial and extensive investigation into these allegations. Should these claims be substantiated, it would, once again, expose the deeply-rooted corruption that has plagued football, causing fans to question the integrity of the sport they hold close to their hearts. The football fraternity must take a stand against these corrupt forces and work towards upholding the values of sportsmanship and fair play in the beautiful game. Only then can the ugliness of fraud and manipulation be vanquished, ensuring that the passion for football remains untainted and unblemished."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What is one of the streaming platforms on which Yang Soobin is a South Korean influencer known for food broadcasting?

Here is a news article: As part of a young couple's quest for YouTube fame, a 19-year-old woman shot at a book her boyfriend was holding against his chest, killing him at close range outside their northwestern Minnesota home.      Monalisa Perez was charged Wednesday with second-degree manslaughter in the shooting of her boyfriend, 22-year-old Pedro Ruiz III, Monday night in Halstad.      Perez, who is pregnant, appeared from jail by video at a Norman County District Court proceeding Wednesday. She posted 7,000 cash bail and was released late Wednesday afternoon.      Ruiz held up the book — described by County Attorney James Brue as a hardcover encyclopedia — and Perez pulled the trigger on a .50-caliber Desert Eagle pistol, trying to see whether the bullet would go through, according to the criminal complaint.      A few hours before the shooting, a posting went up on Perez's Twitter account that read: \\"Me and Pedro are probably going to shoot one of the most dangerous videos ever. HIS idea not MINE.\\" The note included two wide-eyed emoji faces and another of an eye-covering monkey with a gaping mouth.      The Desert Eagle is described by retailer Cabela's in an online ad as \\"one of the world's most powerful semiautomatic handguns.\\"      MonaLisa Perez      Brue said there are \\"multiple videos\\" of the shooting, and they will not be released publicly at this time.      \\"We called him our little daredevil,\\" said Lisa Primeau, an aunt who added that she \\"pretty much raised\\" Ruiz after his mother died in Texas when he was young. He tried living with his father in this part of the country, but it didn't work out, Primeau said.      Primeau said Ruiz was always chasing a thrill, \\"putting a dangerous twist on everything he did.\\" His antics included \\"jumping into the swimming pool from the top of the house, no hesitation. He was a crazy driver with go-carts.\\"      She said Ruiz also \\"had plenty of guns. He liked guns.\\"      Another aunt of Ruiz's told WDAY-TV in Fargo that the shooting outside the couple's home on Hwy. 75, with their 3-year-old daughter nearby, was part of a stunt they intended to post on YouTube.      \\"He had told me about that idea,\\" the aunt told the TV station, \\"and I said, 'Don't do it. Don't do it. Why are you going to use a gun? Why?' \\"      She quoted him as replying, \\" 'Because we want more viewers. We want to get famous.' \\"      Perez has a YouTube channel with many videos the couple have made, with stunts and pranks prevalent. The most recent one went up the morning before the shooting. It's titled \\"Doing Scary Stunts at the Fair, Part I\\" and shows the couple attending a fair last Thursday. Ruiz and a young relative were featured enjoying various rides.      \\"Imagine when we have 300,000 subscribers,\\" Perez says during the video.      Ruiz replies, \\"I told them, the bigger we get, I'll be throwing parties.\\"      One hour before their future unraveled Monday evening, Perez wrote on Facebook, \\"We are in the process of making Pedro a YouTube channel oh man is it going to be sweet! LOL.\\" She added: \\"All the crazy stuff will [be] on his channel and mine. will be our family life!!!\\"      Soon after the shooting, Perez told a sheriff's deputy that it was Ruiz who had been pushing his idea for the video, which was recorded by one camera on the back of a parked vehicle and another on a ladder, according to the complaint. He had shown her another book that he had shot and the bullet didn't go all the way through, the charging document continued.      \\"Perez stated that she shot from about a foot away while [Ruiz] held the book to his chest,\\" the complaint read.      In May, Perez posted a video revealing the sex of the child they are expecting in late September. It is a boy.      Ruiz and Perez had been together for six years, Primeau said, and Perez became pregnant at 15.      As they anticipated another child, Ruiz was supporting his growing family working for BNSF Railway and was studying to be a foreman, Primeau said. She added that she and others related to Ruiz \\"are all supporting Mona. It's a tragic incident. What she did … she has to live with that. It's the worst punishment she can get. She is pregnant with their second kid. It's just heartbreaking.\\" ||||| My Summer Night Time Routine Mommy Edition | 2018On a smooth day this is usually how I end the night!

This change not only indicates a shift in the local political landscape but also suggests that the Conservative party is managing to grasp the trust of Suffolk constituents. In this article, we will discuss the events leading up to this crucial juncture and analyse the potential impact on Suffolk's future. Background: Suffolk, a tranquil county in the East of England, has recently witnessed a fascinating political development. Two of its councils, which were previously uncontrolled by any political party, have come under the Conservative fold. This is seen as a significant victory for the Conservatives and a reflection of the party's growing influence in the region. The Preceding Scenario: The two local councils were once known for their balanced power structure, with no single party commanding overall control. As a result, major decisions often involved lengthy negotiations and required a considerable amount of consensus-building among various political factions. While this approach ensured that each decision was meticulously thought through, it often led to delays and bureaucratic obstacles. Factors Behind the Conservative Takeover: Following are some essential factors that led to the recent Conservative coup in Suffolk: 1. Strong Local Campaign: The Conservatives put forth a dedicated and robust local campaign, focusing on the most pressing issues faced by the residents of Suffolk. By addressing concerns such as infrastructure, education, and public safety, the party managed to engage with a significant number of voters. 2. Unity & Leadership: The Conservatives were successful in presenting a united front, with strong leadership guiding their efforts. This not only bolstered confidence in the party's ability to deliver on their promises but also helped in dissipating any uncertainties that were lingering among the electorate. 3. National Political Climate: The political climate at the national level also played a crucial role in swaying the electorate in Suffolk. The Conservatives in government have recently demonstrated their commitment to investing in local communities, particularly in the areas of housing, transport, and digital infrastructure. Consequently, this may have influenced voter decisions in the councils as a reflection of trust in the wider party. Implications of the Conservative Takeover: The change in the local political landscape is expected to have far-reaching implications for Suffolk. Some key consequences include: 1. Expedited Decision-Making: With the Conservatives now in charge, the decision-making process at the council level is likely to accelerate. This will enable the local authorities to respond promptly to residents' needs and provide more efficient public services. 2. Enhanced Funding and Resources: Aligning with the ruling party at the national level can potentially open up new avenues for funding and resources. This may lead to better implementation of projects and an improvement in overall regional development. 3. Changes in Priority Areas: With the Conservatives now in control, there may be a realignment of the priority areas for the councils. While the focus is expected to remain on the pressing issues of infrastructure, education, and public safety, other areas that resonate with the party's core ideologies may garner additional attention. Conclusion: The Conservative takeover in Suffolk's previously uncontrolled councils marks a significant shift in the county's political landscape. The event suggests an expanding presence of the party in the region, and with a clear mandate, the councils will likely witness considerable changes in governance. As the Conservatives capitalize on this newfound control, it remains to be seen how these changes will materialize and how the residents of Suffolk will benefit from these developments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose less conservation occurs happens, how will it affect more scouring of rocks occurs.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"Suppose less conservation occurs, it will lead to a higher concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere. This, in turn, will result in the production of more acid rain as a higher concentration of chemicals in the atmosphere will combine with water vapor to form acidic compounds. As a result, more acidic precipitation will fall onto the ground, increasing the scouring of rocks. The increased scouring of rocks will have a more significant effect on the second effect mentioned, which is the destruction of vegetation. The higher level of acidity in the rainwater and soil can lead to deterioration of soil quality as it washes away vital nutrients required for plant growth. This will make it challenging for vegetation to grow and thrive in the affected areas, exacerbating the destruction of vegetation. In summary, if less conservation occurs and leads to increased acid rain, it will have a more significant effect on the scouring of rocks, which in turn, will have a more substantial impact on the destruction of vegetation due to the reduced capacity for plants to grow in the affected areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Music comes in many forms; most countries have a style of their own. The US is well known for jazz  , which has gained world-wide popularity. In contrast to classical   music, which follows formal European traditions, jazz is natural and free-form. It is full of energy, expressing the moods, interests, and feelings of the people. It has a modern sound that makes people very excited. In the 1920s jazz sounded like America. And So it does today. The origins of this music are as interesting as the music itself. Jazz was produced by American blacks, who were brought to the Southern States as slaves. They were sold to plantation owners   and forced to work long hours in the cotton and tobacco fields. This work was hard and life was short. When a Negro died, his friends and relatives formed a group to carry the body to the cemetery. A band often went with them. On the way to the cemetery the band played slow and sad music. But on the way home the mood changed. _ Everybody was happy. Death had removed one of their members, but the living were glad to be alive. The band played happy music, which made everyone want to dance. It was an early form of jazz. Music has always been important in their lives. Coming mainly from West Africa, the black men who were brought to America already possessed a rich musical tradition. This music centered on religious ceremonies   in which dancing, singing, clapping and stamping   to the beat of a drum were important forms of musical expression. As these people settled in to their fields, they made up work songs. Singing made the hard work go faster. Another musical form that helped to develop jazz was the blues. Blues songs always describe something sad -- an unhappy love affair, a money problem, bad luck. To this day, the expression \\"feeling blue\\" means being sad. Question: Which of the following is true according to the text? Answer: Select from: (i) Jazz follows European traditions. (ii) Jazz always describes something sad. (iii) Jazz was first produced by black slaves. (iv) Blues made the hard work of those slaves go faster. Answer:","output":"(iii) Jazz was first produced by black slaves."},{"instruction":"I read this background article the other day: In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms.

Article: A survey suggests that people who have dropped out from high school just earn an average of 9,000 less per year than graduates. Now a new study removes a common belief why they quit. It's much more basic than flunking out . Society tends to think of high school dropouts as kids who just can't cut it. They are lazy, and perhaps not too bright. So researchers were surprised when they asked more than 450 kids who quit school about why they left. \\"The vast majority actually had passing grades and they were confident that they could have graduated from high school.\\" John Bridgeland, the executive researcher said. About one million teens leave school each year. Only about half of African-American and Hispanic students will receive a diploma , and actually all dropouts come to regret their decision. So, if failing grades don't explain why these kids quit, what does? Again, John Bridgeland: \\"The most dependable finding was that they were bored.\\" \\"They found classes uninteresting; they weren't inspired or motivated. They didn't see any direct connection between what they were learning in the classroom to their own lives, or to their career aspirations.\\" The study found that most teens who do drop out wait until they turn sixteen, which happens to be the age at which most states allow students to quit. In the U.S., only one state, New Mexico, has a law requiring teenagers to stay in high school until they graduate. Only four states: California, Tennessee, Texas and Utah, plus the District of Columbia, require school attendance until age 18, no exceptions. Jeffrey Grin, another researcher, says raising the compulsory attendance age may be one way to keep more kids in school. \\"As these dropouts look back, they realize they've made a mistake. And anything that sort of gives these people an extra push to stick it out and see it through to the end, is probably helpful measure.\\" New Hampshire may be the next state to raise its school attendance age to 18.

According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%). A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language. 82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French.  - Australian English (AuE, en-AU) is a major variety of the English language, used throughout Australia. Although English has no official status in the Constitution, Australian English is the country's \\"de facto\\" official language and is the first language of the majority of the population.  - South African English (SAfrE, SAfrEng, SAE, en-ZA) is the set of English dialects spoken by South Africans. There is considerable social and regional variation within South African English. Three variants (termed \\"The Great Trichotomy\\" by Roger Lass) are commonly identified within White South African English (as in Australian English), spoken primarily by White South Africans: \\"Cultivated\\", closely approximating England's standard Received Pronunciation and associated with the upper class; \\"General\\", a social indicator of the middle class; and \\"Broad\\", associated with the working class, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaner variety called Afrikaans English. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious \\"acrolect\\" and a more middle-ranging, mainstream \\"mesolect\\". Other varieties of South African English include Cape Flats English, originally associated with inner-city Cape Coloured speakers, and the Indian South African English of Indian South Africans. Further offshoots include the first-language English varieties spoken by Zimbabweans, Zambians, Swazilanders and Namibians.  - Thomas J. O'Connell ( 21 November 1882 -- 22 June 1969 ) was an Irish trade unionist and politician , and was leader of the Irish Labour Party from 1927 to 1932 . O'Connell was born near Knock , County Mayo . From 1902 to 1916 he worked first as a national teacher and then as a school principal . In 1926 he became general secretary of the Irish National Teachers ' Organisation . He was a member of Dáil Éireann from 1922 to 1932 , serving as leader of the Irish Labour Party in the Dáil from 1927 to 1932 . From 1929 to 1930 he was president of the Irish Labour Party and the Irish Trade Union Congress . In 1935 he founded the Educational Building Society .  - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"  - A trade union (British EnglishAustralian EnglishNew Zealand EnglishSouth African English / Caribbean English; also trades union), labour union (Canadian English), or labor union (American English) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\". This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.  - New Zealand English (NZE) is the dialect of the English language spoken by most English-speaking New Zealanders.

Caribbean English is influenced by the English-based Creole varieties spoken in the region, but they are not the same.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How might one describe the sentiment of this review? The parking is my beef with this place.  Why does a customer have to pay 12 for each time we park at the garage?  If you move in and out three times, that's 36 for parking.  Yes, my company was paying, but this was just outright stupid and I wouldn't make my company pay for this again. I've been to Phoenix twice since then, and I've avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot.  Much better place.","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as predominantly negative with a strong sense of dissatisfaction and frustration towards the parking situation at the establishment in question. The reviewer perceives the 12 parking charge as both unreasonable and excessive, and expresses annoyance when considering the potential cumulative cost incurred from multiple instances of entering and exiting the garage. Despite the fact that the reviewer's company was covering the expense, the sentiment indicates that he or she feels a responsibility to avoid imposing unnecessary financial burdens upon them. This reveals that the reviewer has a certain level of loyalty and concern for their employer's expenses, which contributes to the negative sentiment towards the establishment's parking policy. In addition, the review conveys a sense of disappointment and disapproval as the reviewer indicates a significant lack of satisfaction with the overall value offered by the establishment. This sentiment escalates as he or she mentions having been to the same location twice since their initial experience and deliberately choosing an alternative hotel, the Marriot, which is perceived to be a much better option. This comparison not only evidences the reviewer's strong dissatisfaction with the establishment in question but also emphasizes their preference for competitors that provide a more positive experience. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is largely negative, marked by frustration, disappointment, and dissatisfaction. The reviewer expresses a strong disapproval of the parking policy in place and has taken deliberate actions to avoid staying at the establishment in future, opting for a competitor that better meets their expectations and offers more value for their company's resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   If both men's farms receive the same amount of rain, lakes near which person's farms are at lower risk for developing dead zones?  Rick and Dale are both farmers that have lakes near their farm fields. Rick just began using large amounts of fertilizers because he is trying to improve his harvest significantly this year. Meanwhile, Dale has been cutting back on his fertilizer use because demand for his product has decreased recently.  Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.","output":"Based on the given paragraph, if both men's farms receive the same amount of rain, the lakes near Dale's farm are at a lower risk for developing dead zones. The explanation behind this is that the use of fertilizers can have adverse effects on nearby water sources. When chemicals from fertilizers are picked up by rainwater, they enter nearby rivers or lakes through the runoff. These chemicals, specifically the nutrients in the fertilizers, cause an excessive growth of water plants and algae in the water bodies. As a result, the increased growth leads to a high consumption of oxygen by these plants and algae, creating an oxygen-depleted zone that makes it difficult for aquatic life to survive, thus forming a \\"dead zone.\\" Rick has recently increased his usage of fertilizers to improve his harvest yield, which means that there is a high chance of more chemicals entering the nearby lake from his farm due to rainwater runoff. This increases the risk of excessive plant and algae growth, consequentially heightening the possibility of a dead zone forming in the lake near Rick’s farm. On the other hand, Dale has been reducing his use of fertilizers because of a decrease in demand for his products. Since he is using lower amounts of fertilizer, the rainwater runoff coming from his farm will contain fewer chemicals that may enter the nearby lake. This reduced amount of chemicals from Dale's farm poses a lesser risk to the lake in terms of excessive plant and algae growth, thus making it less likely for a dead zone to develop in Dale’s neighboring lake. In conclusion, the lakes near Dale's farm have a lower risk of developing dead zones because of his reduced usage of fertilizers compared to Rick, who has increased his use of fertilizers, consequently raising the risk for dead zone development in the lakes near his farm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sharon and Thom decided to go over the wood bridge instead of the scary metal bridge because the","output":"wooden bridge seemed more stable and less daunting. The metal bridge had a history of failing, leading to accidents and even fatalities in the past, while the wooden bridge was an older, more trusted structure, built using age-old techniques developed by the ancestors of the villagers. The wooden bridge, while a bit lengthy, was still secure and picturesque, nestled amidst lush green foliage and beautiful wildflowers. As Sharon and Thom stepped onto the wooden bridge, they could feel the gentle give and take of the planks beneath their feet. The bridge stretched across a crystal clear stream that flowed gently beneath it, meandering through the rocks and creating a soft yet soothing sound. Shafts of sunlight filtered down through the leafy canopy overhead, casting golden hues on the sparkling water below. The friends walked slowly, taking in the serenity of the scene before them. They breathed in the fresh air and listened to the tranquil sounds of the water rushing below. They marveled at how the bridge had stood the test of time, even against torrential rains and the powerful force of the stream during flood seasons. As they ventured further on the bridge, they noticed that carved into the handrails were intricate patterns and symbols, almost like stories from the past. The artwork depicted legends and folklore from the village – tales of the mythical creatures said to reside in the dense forest, as well as blessings from nature gods who were believed to protect the villagers from harm. Curious about the tales represented in the artwork, Sharon began to regale Thom with the stories she had heard during their visit to the village. One such story was about a woodland sprite who would appear on moonlit nights at this very bridge, sprinkling magical dust on the water to heal wounded animals that came seeking solace. As Sharon and Thom reached the middle of the bridge, the rushing water below seemed to form a melodious harmony with the rustling leaves above. It was then that they saw a shimmering figure standing at the edge of the bridge, near the other end. Startled, they paused, unsure of what to do or say. The figure seemed to glow softly, appearing to be a young girl with a halo of golden hair surrounding her face. She beckoned to them, and Sharon and Thom exchanged nervous glances before tentatively walking towards her. As they got closer, they realized that her eyes were closed, and they could hear her softly singing notes that resonated harmoniously with the sounds of the bridge. Mesmerized by the beauty of this enigmatic figure, Sharon and Thom forgot their fear as they reached out and gently touched her hands. The moment they made contact, a flood of warmth and a sense of peace passed through their bodies and souls. They felt revitalized and filled with a newfound appreciation for the beauty of nature and life. The girl opened her eyes, revealing deep pools of green that seemed to hold the wisdom of the ages within them. She smiled at Sharon and Thom before slowly fading away, leaving the two friends standing in silent wonder. As Sharon and Thom left the bridge, they were filled with a sense of awe and gratitude for the magical encounter they had experienced. They knew they would treasure this memory and carry the lessons of that day with them for the rest of their lives. As they walked back to the village, they spoke of their shared experience, and how it had reinforced their belief in the mystical and powerful connection between humans and the natural world. They vowed to share their story and the importance of the wooden bridge with others, ensuring that its rich history and the legends of the village were never forgotten. And as they walked, the soft sounds of the bridge faded behind them, but its magic remained forever etched in their hearts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others.

It is currently an out-of-print book, though the trademark is still held by Scholastic Press. Hypothesis: Candice wrote the book Amanda.","output":"Based on the given context, we can draw the following hypothesis in a detailed and long answer: From the information provided, Amanda is a novel that was written by author Candice F. Ransom. This novel is part of the Sunfire series, which consists of a total of thirty-two books. Amanda holds the distinction of being the first book in this prolific series, indicating that it potentially set the foundation for the subsequent novels' themes and character developments. Amanda was first published in 1984 by Scholastic Press, a renowned publishing company that is known for producing educational and entertaining literature for children and young adults. The publisher's involvement in this case is significant, as it shows that the book received support from a well-established, reputable publishing house, which could have helped in reaching a wider audience and securing the book's place as the introductory novel in the Sunfire series. The novel spans a total of 346 pages, making it a reasonably extensive work of fiction. Given its length, readers can surmise that Candice F. Ransom likely spent a considerable amount of time and effort researching, developing, and perfecting the storyline and the characters within Amanda. The novel's level of detail and depth could contribute to its appeal among readers who are interested in immersing themselves in a fully-realized fictional world. It is important to note that Amanda is currently an out-of-print book. This means that new copies of the novel are no longer being produced and are not available for purchase directly from the publisher or primary retailers. However, this does not necessarily eliminate the possibility of acquiring a copy, as secondhand copies may still be accessible through online marketplaces or used bookstores. Despite the book's out-of-print status, the trademark for Amanda is still held by Scholastic Press. This detail underscores the continuing legal ownership and control of the novel's intellectual property rights by the publisher. Overall, maintaining the trademark could provide Scholastic Press with the option to revisit the book at a later time, whether for reissuing purposes, adaptations, or other potential projects. In conclusion, the hypothesis that Candice F. Ransom wrote the book Amanda can be corroborated by the context provided. The novel is part of a larger series of 32 books called the Sunfire series, and Amanda serves as the opening work in this collection. Published in 1984 by Scholastic Press and containing 346 pages, Amanda holds its place in literary history as an out-of-print novel, but its trademark remains in the possession of its original publisher."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Questions: What does a person who is a gardener have? Options: - own house - contribution to society - food - ride horses - green thumb Answer:","output":"A person who is a gardener most likely has a green thumb. The term \\"green thumb\\" refers to the innate ability and knowledge to grow and care for plants successfully. While it is indeed possible that a gardener may have their own house, contribute to society, have food, or enjoy riding horses, these options are not directly related to the profession and skills of a gardener. Gardeners, whether they are professionals or hobbyists, are typically well-versed in various aspects of horticulture. They possess a deep understanding of plant biology, soil health, and the essential factors required for plants to grow and thrive. Gardeners must be knowledgeable about different types of plants, from flowers and shrubs to vegetables and trees, and understand their specific care requirements. A green thumb often involves skills in pruning, weeding, pest control, and fertilizing for plant health. Additionally, gardeners often have an aesthetic eye for designing garden layouts, selecting complementary plants for visually appealing arrangements, and shaping the overall look of a garden or landscape. In essence, having a green thumb signifies the gardener's passion and talent for cultivating plants and creating beautiful, healthy, and thriving gardens. This unique skill set enables them to contribute positively to their environment by enhancing the beauty of outdoor spaces, providing fresh produce, and improving overall plant health and biodiversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   17.8 Gonadal and Placental Hormones The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. In males, FSH stimulates sperm maturation, which is inhibited by the hormone inhibin. The steroid hormone testosterone, a type of androgen, is released in response to LH and is responsible for the maturation and maintenance of the male reproductive system, as well as the development of male secondary sex characteristics. In females, FSH promotes egg maturation and LH signals the secretion of the female sex hormones, the estrogens and progesterone. Both of these hormones are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system, as well as maintaining pregnancy. The placenta develops during early pregnancy, and secretes several hormones important for maintaining the pregnancy.   Q: The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh) produced by what gland?   Choices:  - thyroid  - testes  - adrenal  - pituitary  A: The answer is:","output":"- pituitary The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland, also known as the hypophysis, is a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain. It is considered to be the \\"master gland\\" as it plays a crucial role in regulating various hormones and processes in the body, including the reproductive system. The release of FSH and LH is triggered by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, which is another important endocrine structure responsible for maintaining a wide range of physiological processes in the body. In the reproductive system, FSH and LH act on the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females) to regulate sperm and egg maturation, as well as hormone secretion. In males, FSH stimulates sperm maturation and is inhibited by the hormone inhibin. LH, on the other hand, triggers the release of the steroid hormone testosterone, a type of androgen. Testosterone is responsible for the maturation and maintenance of the male reproductive system, as well as the development of male secondary sex characteristics. In females, FSH promotes egg maturation by stimulating the growth and development of ovarian follicles. LH, in contrast, signals the secretion of female sex hormones, the estrogens, and progesterone. Both estrogen and progesterone are vital in developing and maintaining the female reproductive system and ensuring a healthy pregnancy. The placenta, which forms during early pregnancy, also plays a crucial role in the female reproductive system by secreting several hormones that are important for maintaining pregnancy. Some of these hormones include human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which helps sustain the corpus luteum and progesterone production; estrogen, which promotes the growth of uterine tissue; and progesterone, which maintains a healthy uterine lining for implantation. In summary, the male and female reproductive system is regulated by FSH and LH, produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland in response to GnRH from the hypothalamus. This intricate hormonal interplay ensures proper functioning and maintenance of the reproductive system in both males and females."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Combine the terms with the variable b on the right side of the equation 0 * b = (3 * b) + (5 * b) Since 3 * b and 5 * b both have the same variable b, we can combine them: 0 * b = 8 * b 2. Now, let's isolate the variable b. Since 0 times any number is always 0, we can rewrite the equation as: 0 = 8 * b 3. Next, we will divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate b: 0 / 8 = (8 * b) / 8 Simplifying the equation, we get: 0 = 1 * b 0 = b The solution for b in the given equation is: b = 0"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The bill in question conflicts with the United Nations Declaration on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, dating back to December 18, 2008. This particular declaration has been widely supported by the European Union. The declaration serves as a crucial framework for addressing discrimination and violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. It calls for an end to human rights violations affecting individuals from the LGBTQ+ community - these range from the death penalty, extrajudicial killings, torture, and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment and punishment. Moreover, the United Nations emphasizes the significance of securing equal rights and protection for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This is prominently highlighted in each nation's human rights obligations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The European Union's backing for the UN Declaration on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity is an expression of its strong commitment to human rights, equality, and non-discrimination. The EU consistently strives to protect and foster the rights and dignity of every person, including LGBTQ+ individuals, to create a more inclusive and equal society. Given that the draft law under discussion contravenes these UN principles, it potentially jeopardizes the progress made in the protection of LGBTQ+ rights and strives against the core values upheld by both the UN and the EU. It undermines the shared aim of dismantling discrimination and violence while promoting the essential freedoms and rights of all individuals, regardless of their orientation or gender identity.

Vantablack is an artificial material that is known as one of the darkest substances on Earth, as it can absorb up to 99.965% of visible light. Space, as we perceive it, appears dark because it is an empty, vast expanse devoid of matter that can reflect or emit light. When an astronaut looks at space while ignoring the stars and other celestial bodies, it may appear extremely dark, close to the level of darkness of Vantablack. The darkness experienced in space originates from the absence of light-reflecting or emitting objects within the visible range. It's important to note that Vantablack is a human-made substance, and its degree of darkness is not an accurate representation of the darkness of space. However, the emptiness of space and the absence of light-reflecting objects contribute to its dark appearance, comparable to the concept of extreme darkness exemplified by Vantablack."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS:  - no;  - yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"It is essential to understand that people's preferences and opinions about height in relationships can vary, and there is no absolute rule that applies to everyone. However, I will try to provide a detailed analysis of each question. Question 1: Does height really matter for women? To some extent, height might matter for women, but several factors come into play. Generally, society seems to expect men to be taller than women in a relationship, and this notion might influence people's preferences. From an evolutionary perspective, some women may feel a sense of security and protection with a taller partner, as historically taller men have been considered stronger and better able to provide for and protect their families. Cultural factors also play a role in shaping preferences. For instance, a study conducted by the Australian National University reported that tall men are more likely to be married and have children than shorter men, suggesting that height might be important for some women. However, it should be noted that these trends might not hold true across all cultures, and individual preferences can vary significantly. In conclusion, although some women might consider height an important factor when choosing a partner, others may not be as concerned about this particular attribute. Ultimately, it comes down to what an individual finds attractive and compatible in a partner. Question 2: What height do women consider men being too tall to date? This question is subjective, as there is no universal height threshold that all women agree upon when considering a partner too tall to date. Factors such as personal preferences, height of the woman, cultural norms, and individual experiences all contribute to the determination of an ideal height for a romantic partner. Some women might find an extremely tall man attractive, while others may think it could lead to potential issues in the relationship, such as kissing and hugging difficulties, or attracting attention in public due to the couple's height difference. Additionally, a woman's own height might be a factor; a shorter woman may have different preferences than a taller one. Cultural norms also play a role, as mentioned above – in some cultures, taller men are considered more attractive, while in others, height may not be a significant factor. To sum up, the height at which women consider a man too tall to date varies greatly and relies on a combination of personal preferences, cultural norms, and individual experiences. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Would the answer to these two questions be the same? No, the answers to these questions are not the same. The first question addresses whether height matters for women in general, while the second question seeks to determine a specific height threshold at which women may consider a man too tall. The first answer concludes that height can be important for some women but not for all, due to factors such as cultural norms and personal preferences. The second answer conveys that there is no specific height threshold, as women's opinions on the \\"too tall\\" height vary from person to person."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bush admitted to a drink-driving arrest which had remained secret for two decades.      \\"I was drinking beer, yes, with John Newcombe,\\" George W told the press pack after the 1976 incident was exposed by a US television station.      Former US president George W. Bush. Credit:Reuters      The revelation that George W had been booked for driving under the influence after a night out with one of Australia's greatest tennis champions forced Newcombe into hiding until after the election.      Since then, Newcombe has never publicly revealed many of the details of what happened on that night. But that changed on Thursday evening, when Newcombe, with 26 grand-slam titles, was made an official legend of the Sports Australia Hall of Fame. ||||| John Newcombe, an Australian former tennis champion, has finally revealed the details of an infamous \\"drinking duel\\" with George W Bush that nearly cost the young Texan the presidency.      The drinking bout near the Bush family's Kennebunkport summer home in Maine, in which the two matched each other beer for beer, ended with Bush's arrest for drink-driving, which he then kept secret for 24 years.      But five days before winning his first presidential election in 2000, the story of the arrest broke on United States television, prompting Bush to confess to the travelling press pack that he had been arrested for drink-driving during his \\"party boy\\" days.      The admission forced Newcombe to flee the media in Sydney and he refused to reveal details of the incident.      But Newcombe has now broken his silence on Australian commercial radio, saying he and the future president matched each other's drinking in what became \\"a little silent game\\".      It was the Labour Day long weekend in 1976 and the two had not previously met, but were similar ages. Newcombe, 32, a world famous tennis star, had been invited to spend the weekend at the Bush family home by George H W Bush, who was then director of the CIA. The younger Bush, then a heavy drinker, was 30.      \\"We went to the local pub\\", said Newcombe, and began to drink \\"reasonable-sized mugs of beer\\".      Newcombe said the pair were accompanied by his wife Angie, as well as Bush's younger sister and Peter Roussel, then press secretary to George H.W. Bush.      \\"George was a bit of a party boy in those days,\\" he told Melbourne's SEN radio.      \\"I noticed that George was sort of eyeing me off. I put on a bit of pace and he'd keep pace with me. A little silent game was going on.      \\"After about four of these, I picked the glass up in my teeth without my hands and skulled it straight down and I said, 'What are you made of, George?' And so he had to do that.\\"      Newcombe said he then drank a beer from the wrong side of the glass: \\"I looked at him and go, 'Have you got any guts, George, or what's your story?' So he did that.\\"      The pair stumbled back to the car to drive home and Newcombe's wife offered to drive, but the future president insisted on taking the wheel.      \\"We had about three miles to drive down this road along the sea and after about a mile he got pulled over,\\" Newcombe said.      \\"The cop got out of the car and made him walk the line and back and he kind of did it alright but he was a bit cheeky when he was doing it.      \\"The cop was writing him a ticket and then Peter Roussel got out of the car, and went over to the cop and was telling him he was George Bush's son, and the cop, his name was Calvin, goes 'Oh my God, I've just booked the son of the director of the CIA, I'm in real trouble.'      \\"But he's written the ticket.\\"      Bush was fined 150 (£94) for the offence, which occurred during the future president's long years of drinking. He was known to frequently consume large quantities of beer, bourbon and B&B liquor before quitting after a wild drunken weekend in 1986 to celebrate his 40th birthday. He credited his decision to his recent religious awakening.      On the night in Nov 2000 that a Maine reporter broke the story of his arrest for drink-driving, Bush told the media: \\"I'm not proud of that. I oftentimes said that years ago I made some mistakes. I occasionally drank too much and I did on that night.\\"      Bush said he could not remember how many drinks he had had, adding: \\"It's an interesting question why [the story was broken] now, four or five days before the election.\\"      Bush went on to win the US presidency despite losing the popular vote, in the most closely contested election in US history.      Newcombe said he and Bush joked for years that \\"Calvin's going to come back to haunt you\\". When the story broke in 2000, he received a call in his Sydney office from Mr Roussel.      \\"He says 'Newk, George just rang me, and he said they found out about Calvin,'\\" he said.      \\"I just hid out. I hid. I didn't talk about it, actually, for years while he was president.\\" |||||","output":"In 1976, George W.

Here is a news article: He's a 42-year-old freshman senator, but when asked by Jonathan Karl on \\"This Week\\" if he's ready to be president, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida answered without hesitation.      \\"I do … but I think that's true for multiple other people that would want to run … I mean, I'll be 43 this month, but the other thing that perhaps people don't realize, I've served now in public office for the better part of 14 years,\\" said Rubio. \\"Most importantly, I think a president has to have a clear vision of where the country needs to go and clear ideas about how to get it there and I think we're very blessed in our party to have a number of people that fit that criteria.\\"      When asked if he was qualified to run, Rubio reiterated that the Republican Party has several qualified candidates.      \\"The question is what - whose vision is the one that our party wants to follow?\\" he said.      Rubio - who spoke to Karl on Friday in New Hampshire - said that if he decides to seek the presidency, he would not simultaneously seek re-election as a senator for the Sunshine State.      \\"I believe that if you want to be president of the United States, you run for president,\\" he said. \\"You don't run for president with some eject button in the cockpit that allows you to go on an exit ramp if it doesn't work out.\\"      The Florida senator - who was once considered a 2016 Republican front runner - has seen his star fade in recent days, according to at least one recent New Hampshire poll. But Rubio seems to take it in stride, telling ABC News that polls are not something he pays a great deal of attention to, even joking that he has been jinxed after gracing the cover of TIME magazine.      \\"It's probably the 'TIME' cover jinx, just like the 'Sports Illustrated' jinx,\\" he said. \\"If you decide to run for president, there's going to be a campaign and in that campaign, you're going to interact with voters and you're going to explain to them where you stand and - and those numbers can change one way or the other.\\"      Sen. Marco Rubio Gives Hillary Clinton an \\"F\\" as Secretary of State      During the interview with Karl, Rubio took aim at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is seen by many as the strongest Democratic candidate for president in 2016. Rubio said he was sure Clinton would highlight her time at the State Department as a positive should she seek the White House, but he offered a much more negative view of her tenure at Foggy Bottom.      \\"I'm sure she's going to go out bragging about her time in the State Department. She's also going to have to be held accountable for its failures, whether it's the failed reset with Russia or the failure in Benghazi that actually cost lives,\\" he said.      Rubio said he didn't think Clinton deserved a passing grade for her time at the State Department, saying he thought she earned an \\"F.\\"      \\"If you look at the diplomacy that was pursued in her time in the State Department, it has failed everywhere in the world,\\" Rubio said. \\"If she is going to run on her record as secretary of state, she's also going to have to answer for its massive failures,\\"      Sen. Marco Rubio Expresses Skepticism Over Ability to Reverse Changing Climate      Rubio - who expressed deep skepticism about whether man-made activity has played a role in the Earth's changing climate - told Karl he doesn't believe there is action that could be taken right now that would have an impact on what's occurring with our climate.      \\"I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it … and I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy,\\" he said.      Rubio said he didn't know of an era when the climate was stable.      \\"The fact is that these events that we're talking about are impacting us, because we built very expensive structures in Florida and other parts of the country near areas that are prone to hurricanes. We've had hurricanes in Florida forever. and the question is, what do we do about the fact that we have built expensive structures, real estate and population centers, near those vulnerable areas?\\" he asked. \\"I have no problem with taking mitigation activity.\\"      EDITOR'S NOTE: We've added a portion of the full transcript that covers Jon Karl's conversation with Sen. Rubio below about climate change.      KARL: The White House came out with a big new report on climate change and listed Florida as being right, you know, saying that - that Florida is right at the center of this, that, in fact, Miami, Tampa are two of the cities that are most threatened by climate change. So putting aside your disagreement with what to do about it, do you agree with the science on this? I mean how big…      RUBIO: Well…      KARL: - a threat is climate change?      RUBIO: Yeah, I - I don't agree with the notion that some are putting out there, including scientists, that somehow, there are actions we can take today that would actually have an impact on what's happening in our climate. Our climate is always changing. And what they have chosen to do is take a handful of decades of research and - and say that this is now evidence of a longer-term trend that's directly and almost solely attributable to manmade activity…      KARL: You don't buy…      RUBIO: I do not agree with that.      KARL: - you don't buy the science on this?

Climate is always evolving and natural disaster have always existed.      But I do believe that the fact is, that these events that we're talking about are impacting us, because we've built very expensive structures in Florida and other parts of the country near areas that are prone to hurricanes. We've had hurricanes in Florida forever.      And the - the question is, what do we do about the fact that we have built expensive structures, real estate and population centers, near those vulnerable areas?      I have no problem with taking mitigation activity. What I have a problem with is these changes to our law that somehow politicians say are going to change our weather. That's absurd.      RUBIO: - to say you are going to pass a bill that's going to change the weather is a lie and you're going to devastate our economy.      KARL: But - but let me get this straight. You do not think that human activity, the production of CO2, has caused warming to our planet?

A: Mathematicians often strive for a complete classification (or list) of a mathematical notion.  Does the answer correctly answer the question Options:  *yes.  *no.","output":"*yes. Mathematicians strive to reach a high level of certainty and finality with math concepts by following rigorous methods in the development of mathematical theories, proofs, and solutions. The level of finality they aim to achieve depends on the context of the specific problem or concept being studied. Mathematics is fundamentally built on axioms, which are basic and self-evident truths that serve as the foundation for the development of mathematical structures. Using these axioms and the rules of logic, mathematicians construct proofs that provide definite evidence of the truth or falsity of a mathematical statement or theorem. The process of proving mathematical statements is a meticulous one, ensuring that every step is logically sound and based on previously established truths. In this way, math concepts and conclusions can be considered final as they are derived from a process that minimizes error and builds upon a solid foundation. Apart from building strong proofs, mathematicians also aim to explore the generality and universality of mathematical concepts. This involves uncovering connections between seemingly disparate areas of math and discovering unifying principles that encapsulate a wide range of mathematical phenomena. By showcasing the generality of a concept, mathematicians can develop overarching theories that lend themselves to a higher level of finality and applicability. Another aspect of finality in mathematics is the notion of completeness, which is an important concept in various fields of math, such as set theory and logic. A set of axioms or a specific system is considered complete if it contains all the necessary elements to derive all true statements and exclude false ones in its respective domain. Achieving completeness in a mathematical system provides a strong sense of finality, as it offers an exhaustive framework to work with. Furthermore, mathematicians often aim for a comprehensive classification in many mathematical domains, such as in the classification of finite simple groups or in the solution of Diophantine equations. Such classifications give a structured organization and description of all the elements of interest within a specific mathematical world, providing a level of finality by characterizing the complete landscape of a given concept. However, it's important to note that the pursuit of finality in mathematics is an ongoing and evolving process. As new questions and concepts emerge, so does the need for deeper understanding and refinement of existing theories. Yet, despite the evolving nature of mathematics, the ultimate goal remains to achieve a great level of certainty and finality in the understanding and organization of mathematical concepts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\"  Question: \\"Why does it pose a problem for the working poor to get legal aid?\\" Answer: \\"They don't qualify for free legal services, so they can't file for custody or divorce because it costs too much money. They are completely cut out of the legal system, so they become stuck\\" Is this answer correct? Available options: (i). no; (ii). yes;...I think the answer is","output":"(ii). yes; the answer is correct because it highlights the primary issue faced by the working poor in accessing legal aid for divorce and custody matters.

This results in them being \\"stuck\\" and unable to navigate the civil-law system, ultimately exacerbating their already challenging circumstances.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).  - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions.  - In chemistry isomerization (also isomerisation) is the process by which one molecule is transformed into another molecule which has exactly the same atoms, but the atoms have a different arrangement e.g. A-B-C  B-A-C (these related molecules are known as isomers ). In some molecules and under some conditions, isomerization occurs spontaneously. Many isomers are equal or roughly equal in bond energy, and so exist in roughly equal amounts, provided that they can interconvert somewhat freely; that is, the energy barrier between the two isomers is not too high. When the isomerization occurs intramolecularly it is considered a rearrangement reaction.  - In chemistry, bond energy (\\"E\\") or bond enthalpy (\\"H\\") is the measure of bond strength in a chemical bond. IUPAC defines bond energy as the average value of the gas-phase bond dissociation energies (usually at a temperature of 298 K) for all bonds of the same type within the same chemical species. For example, the carbonhydrogen bond energy in methane \\"H\\"(CH) is the enthalpy change involved with breaking up one molecule of methane into a carbon atom and four hydrogen radicals, divided by 4. Tabulated bond energies are generally values of bond energies averaged over a number of selected typical chemical species containing that type of bond. Bond energy (\\"E\\") or bond enthalpy (\\"H\\") should not be confused with bond-dissociation energy. Bond energy is the average of all the bond-dissociation energies in a molecule, and will show a different value for a given bond than the bond-dissociation energy would. This is because the energy required to break a single bond in a specific molecule differs for each bond in that molecule. For example, methane has four CH bonds and the bond-dissociation energies are 435 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH), 444 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH), 444 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH) and 339 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CH). Their average, and hence the bond energy, is 414 kJ/mol, even though not a single bond required specifically 414 kJ/mol to be broken.  - Structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized. Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.  - In organic chemistry, functional groups are specific groups (moieties) of atoms or bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules. The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of. However, its relative reactivity can be modified by other functional groups nearby. The atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. Any subgroup of atoms of a compound also may be called a radical, and if a covalent bond is broken homolytically, the resulting fragment radicals are referred as free radicals. Functional groups can also be charged, e.g. in carboxylate salts (-COO), which turns the molecule into a polyatomic ion or a complex ion.  - In chemistry , photoisomerization is molecular behavior in which structural change between isomers is caused by photoexcitation . Both reversible and irreversible isomerization reactions exist . However , the word \`\` photoisomerization '' usually indicates a reversible process .  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.  - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization.  - An isomer (from Greek , isomerès; isos = \\"equal\\", méros = \\"part\\") is a molecule with the same molecular formula as another molecule, but with a different chemical structure. That is, isomers contain the same number of atoms of each element, but have different arrangements of their atoms. Isomers do not necessarily share similar properties, unless they also have the same functional groups. There are two main forms of isomerism (or ): structural isomerism (or constitutional isomerism) and stereoisomerism (or spatial isomerism).  - A chemical compound (or just compound if used in the context of chemistry) is an entity consisting of two or more atoms, at least two from different elements, which associate via chemical bonds. There are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together: molecules held together by covalent bonds, ionic compounds held together by ionic bonds, intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds, and certain complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds. Many chemical compounds have a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS): its CAS number.  - A rearrangement reaction is a broad class of organic reactions where the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule. Often a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in the same molecule. In the example below the substituent R moves from carbon atom 1 to carbon atom 2:  - A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes may occur.  - Intermolecular forces (IMFs) are the forces which mediate interaction between molecules. They also include forces of attraction or repulsion which act between molecules and other types of neighboring particles (e.g., atoms or ions). They are weak compared to the intramolecular forces  the forces which keep a molecule together. For example, the covalent bond, involving the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules. Both sets of forces are essential parts of force fields frequently used in molecular mechanics.  - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest).  - A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between atoms with opposite charges, or through the sharing of electrons as in the covalent bonds. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are \\"strong bonds\\" or \\"primary bond\\" such as metallic, covalent or ionic bonds and \\"weak bonds\\" or \\"secondary bond\\" such as Dipole-dipole interaction, the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This is without doubt Rajnikanth's worst movies ever. The first part is held in place with solid comedy from Goundamani but it progressively gets worse and worse and completely illogical. Our hero also takes a dig at Saints with the same name (Baba) through a corny and utterly lame one-liner. The first half has Rajni uttering his usual array of oneliners and style and in the second half, becomes a quasi saint after a beggar takes him through a interdimensional portal to the Himalayas where Babaji (not the famous Saints he took a dig at earlier) gives him special powers for no apparent reason (other than karma). This is really starting to get interesting now isn't it?  The rest of the movie is about him wasting his magic boons and powers and fighting off politicians and related black magic. The usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation. Oh and the black magic never worked on our hero because he just happened to have a Param Vir...er....Shakti Chakra with him. The bad guys and the usual politician villains are clichéd, overworked and in the end, completely insignificant to the plot which itself doesn't go anywhere. But despite all the flaws, it was fun to kill time with and yell Baba related one-liners during public events. Its also fun to watch others curse about this movie. AR Rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his movie through the cell phone. Thats how important he considered it. Rajni is very popular in Japan and he has included two characters (one of them is called Keiko...why not Samsung?) of Japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese may stop watching Rajni movies after seeing that. This movie was probably promotional material for Rajni entering politics but the results of the movie itself would have killed off any of his political dreams. Fun if you turn your brain off though.

When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy.

To achieve that succulent, tender, and flavor-packed result every time, one must master the art of preparing, seasoning, and basting the turkey. From removing the neck and giblets to making and placing the aromatics in the cavity and basting with an herb butter, this in-depth article covers every aspect of preparing a mouth-watering roast turkey. Step 1: Remove the Neck and Giblets Properly cleaning and preparing a turkey is the first and crucial step. Follow these straightforward instructions to start off: 1. Unwrap the turkey, and remove the plastic bag or packaging. 2. Locate the neck, which is usually tucked in one end of the cavity, and gently but firmly pull it out. Set it aside to use for making gravy or discard if desired. 3. Dig into the main cavity and pull out the bag containing the giblets (liver, heart, and gizzard). Again, these can be used in making gravy or discarded. 4. Rinse the turkey inside and out with cold water. Pat it dry with paper towels. 5. Ensure that the turkey is thoroughly cleaned and dried to allow for even cooking and a crispy skin. Step 2: Make the Aromatics for the Cavity Preparing a flavorful aromatic mixture to place in the cavity of the turkey will significantly enhance the taste of the final dish. The mixture usually contains a variety of ingredients, including fruits, vegetables, and herbs. A suitable aromatic combination may include: - 1 large onion, peeled and quartered - 2 stalks of celery, cut into thirds - 1 large carrot, cut into thirds - 1 apple, cored and quartered - A handful of fresh herbs such as parsley, rosemary, and thyme - 1 lemon, cut into quarters - 1 garlic bulb, cut in half horizontally - 1 tablespoon of olive oil - Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: 1. In a large bowl, combine all the cut fruits, vegetables, and herbs. 2. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. 3. Toss the ingredients to ensure an even coating. Step 3: Place the Aromatics in the Cavity The next step involves stuffing the cavity with the prepared aromatic mixture: 1. Carefully spoon the aromatic mixture into the cavity of the turkey. 2. Ensure that the mixture is evenly distributed, but do not overstuff. 3. Truss the turkey legs together with kitchen twine to keep the cavity closed during cooking. Step 4: Baste the Turkey with Herb Butter Basting the turkey with an herb butter promotes even cooking, resulting in a juicy and flavorsome roast. Follow these instructions to prepare the herb butter: 1. Soften 1 cup of unsalted butter in a bowl. 2. Finely chop a selection of fresh herbs (e.g., parsley, rosemary, and thyme) and add it to the butter. 3. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. 4. Mix until the herbs are well-incorporated in the butter. Basting the turkey: 1. Gently loosen the skin of the turkey breast by sliding your fingers underneath it. 2. Carefully spread a generous amount of herb butter under the skin, making sure the entire breast is covered. 3. Rub the remaining herb butter all over the outside of the turkey, ensuring an even coating for uniform browning and flavor. Conclusion Once the turkey has been prepared, it's time to roast it in the oven, basting occasionally with pan juices or additional herb butter to keep it moist. Following the principles of proper turkey preparation—removing the neck and giblets, creating and inserting aromatics, and basting with herb butter—will ensure a delectable and juicy roast turkey that will impress and delight all who taste it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The combination of the undersized DC-blocking capacitors and the typical low-impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter, which attenuates the low-frequency bass output. Similar capacitors were used in the fourth-generation iPods. The problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance (line level) loads, such as an external headphone amplifier. The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage, rather than a single capacitor-coupled output, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load.

The operating system can identify the appropriate software application required to open and work with a specific file format, such as an M3U file. An M3U (MP3 URL or Moving Picture Experts Group Audio Layer 3 Uniform Resource Locator) file is a plain-text file that specifies the locations of one or more multimedia files in a playlist format. These locations can be either local files on your computer or accessible through internet URLs. M3U files contain file paths and, sometimes, metadata about the files, such as the track's title, artist, and length. When you double-click on an M3U file, the Windows operating system analyzes the file extension and associates it with the best-suited software application installed on your computer. If you have a default media player that supports M3U files, Windows will automatically open the file using that media player. Popular media players like VLC Media Player, Winamp, or Windows Media Player can all handle M3U files. If Windows does not recognize the M3U file extension or no compatible software is installed on your system, you may receive an error message or be prompted to search for an appropriate program online. In this case, you can either download and install a compatible media player or update your existing software to include support for M3U files. In summary, the revised text states that Windows is capable of intelligently determining the proper software to open M3U files, allowing users to seamlessly interact with these types of files without having to worry about compatibility or manually selecting the correct application."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who is less likely to have lowered oxygen supply to their heart muscles? Answer:","output":"Ryan is less likely to have a lowered oxygen supply to his heart muscles. This is because during the yearly physical examination, it was discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall, while Ryan had no plaques present. Plaques in the arterial walls are deposits of fatty substances, cholesterol, cellular waste products, calcium, and other substances that can build up over time. This build-up narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through them. As a result, the blood that passes through narrowed arteries is at a lower pressure and delivers less oxygen and nutrients to the organs and tissues. When these plaques affect the arteries supplying the heart, it can lead to a condition called coronary artery disease (CAD). The build-up of plaques in these arteries can restrict blood flow to the heart muscles, ultimately reducing the amount of oxygen and nutrients that the heart receives. Since Ryan has no plaques present in his arterial walls, his blood flows more freely, allowing an adequate amount of oxygen to reach his heart muscles. This makes it less likely for Ryan to experience reduced oxygen supply to his heart muscles compared to Jake, who has a high amount of plaques present in his arterial walls."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Furthermore, the presence of diacritical marks such as the ú in \\"můrou\\" and \\"minulosti\\" or the é in \\"ošklivé\\" is typically indicative of the Czech language. 3) Grammar: Also the structure of sentence adheres to Czech grammar rules.

What medical term is used for an extreme life-threatening allergic reaction????","output":"The medical term used for an extreme life-threatening allergic reaction is \\"anaphylaxis\\" or \\"anaphylactic shock.\\" Anaphylaxis is a severe, rapid-onset, systemic allergic reaction that can involve multiple organ systems in the body. It is considered a medical emergency due to its rapid progression and potentially fatal outcomes if not treated promptly. Anaphylaxis typically occurs when a person with a severe allergy to a specific substance, known as an allergen, is exposed to that allergen. Common allergens include foods (such as peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, and eggs), medications (such as penicillin), insect stings (like bee or wasp stings), and latex. The body produces an exaggerated immune response upon the exposure to the allergen, which can lead to various symptoms. Symptoms of anaphylaxis can vary in severity and often involve multiple organ systems. They may include: 1. Skin: Hives, rashes, redness, itching, and swelling 2. Respiratory system: Difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and throat swelling 3. Cardiovascular system: Low blood pressure (hypotension), rapid or weak pulse, dizziness, lightheadedness, and shock 4. Gastrointestinal system: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain 5. Nervous system: Headache, confusion, and altered mental status 6. Others: Feeling of impending doom, nasal congestion, or runny nose Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment, and the standard first-line treatment is the injection of epinephrine (adrenaline). Epinephrine can rapidly reverse the symptoms of anaphylaxis by constricting blood vessels, relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways, and decreasing the release of additional allergic mediators. People who are at risk for anaphylaxis are often prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector (such as an EpiPen) to carry with them at all times. Following the administration of epinephrine, the patient should be taken to a healthcare facility or hospital for further evaluation and treatment, which may include supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, corticosteroids, and antihistamines. Prevention of anaphylaxis involves identifying and avoiding known allergens, working with an allergist or an immunologist to create an emergency action plan, and carrying an epinephrine auto-injector if prescribed. In some cases, allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots or tablets) may be recommended by a healthcare provider to help reduce the risk of anaphylaxis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I advised Amazon of this and per their procedure you cannot send the item back but they still refunded me the money, a stand up thing to do.

Answer: Answer:","output":"The review has a negative tone towards the product (perfume) but a positive tone towards Amazon's customer service. Step 1: Read the title and review The title of the review states \\"Perfume was horrible but Amazon made it right!\\" This indicates that the perfume itself received negative feedback, but Amazon's handling of the situation was positive. Step 2: Identify key phrases Review phrases such as \\"The bottle I received was very foul smelling and not what I ordered\\" indicate a negative tone about the product. Phrases like \\"Amazon made it right\\" and \\"they still refunded me the money, a stand-up thing to do\\" imply a positive tone towards Amazon's customer service. Step 3: Evaluate the overall sentiment The review combines both negative and positive tones targeting different aspects (product vs. customer service). However, the central focus is on the negative experience with the perfume itself — making the overall sentiment primarily negative regarding the product while holding a positive appraisal of Amazon's response.

Sample A is a strong acid; sample B is a weak acid; and sample C is not an acid. David needs to identify the content of each sample by learning about their attributes.  But I can use this background: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass.  What is an answer for this question: Which sample would have lower pH value, sample A or sample B? A:","output":"Based on the provided background information, sample A, which is a strong acid, would have a lower pH value than sample B, which is a weak acid. As the concentration of hydronium ions increases, the pH value decreases, making the solution more acidic.

Article: If you travel to a new exhibition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers, you will have chances to see some meat-eating plants. Take bladderworts, a kind of such plant, for example. They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. \\"But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!\\" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days. Some of these pitchers are large enough to hold 7.5 liters.

Although they do not eat people, as portrayed in some science fiction movies, and it is not their primary source of food, sometimes birds or other small animals may get captured by these plants accidentally.

Hence, appropriate descriptions for Sydney could include \\"vibrant,\\" \\"eloquent,\\" \\"confident,\\" \\"engaging,\\" or \\"enthusiastic.\\" While it could be natural to experience occasional boredom in some facets of life, the circumstances presented in this case go against the sentiment of boredom. Sydney, having just delivered a well-received speech, could hardly be considered bored in this situation. Consequently, stating that Sydney is \\"feeling bored\\" would not be a valid description of their emotions or actions after such a well-received accomplishment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded, \\"We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts. a good answer to this question?","output":"No, the given response about a letter to Edward Livingston in which Madison further expanded is not a sufficient answer to the question about the location of religious services that both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison attended. To answer the question in a detailed manner: Both Thomas Jefferson, the 3rd President of the United States, and James Madison, the 4th President of the United States, were pivotal figures in American history and had notable influence on the development of the United States Constitution and religious freedom. They were leading proponents of separation of church and state, which means that the religious practices of these two individuals had potential political implications. Both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison attended religious services at the United States Capitol, which served as a church and a worship space during their time in office. Throughout much of the 19th century, the Capitol's House and Senate chambers, as well as other rooms, were used for Sunday church services. Jefferson, who was a Deist and advocated for religious tolerance, attended religious services in the House of Representatives chamber at the Capitol. He maintained the tradition of attending Capitol church services during his presidency, from 1801 to 1809. His attendance was documented in historical records and memoirs of the period, reaffirming his commitment to protecting the rights of both believers and non-believers alike. As a Deist, Jefferson held a belief in God that centered on reason and natural law, rather than the direct involvement of God in the affairs of humanity. Madison, on the other hand, attended Episcopal church services in Virginia, his home state, as well as at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., during his presidency from 1809 to 1817. He was raised Episcopalian and reaffirmed his faith in some of his personal correspondences. Nonetheless, Madison was a strong advocate of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, demonstrated by his crucial role in drafting the First Amendment. In summary, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison both attended religious services at the United States Capitol during their respective presidencies. Their commitment to religious freedom and the separation of church and state meant that their personal religious practices were of significant political and historical value. Despite the differences in their religious beliefs, both Madison and Jefferson were dedicated to the protection of religious liberty and to ensuring that government did not infringe upon the rights of individuals to practice their religion or abstain from it as per their convictions."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change. Pouring the liquid into beaker T, she observes a change in the liquid.  Which beaker had a reactant poured into it?  Hint: A catalyst works by providing a lower energy pathway from reactants to products. The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier. A:","output":"Beaker T had a reactant poured into it. This is because a noticeable change in the liquid was observed in beaker T, indicating that a reaction took place. In beaker R, there was no noticeable change, so it is likely that either no reaction occurred or a catalyst was added that did not cause a visible change in the solution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: After the deaths of Charles V and du Guesclin in 1380, France lost its main leadership and overall momentum in the war. Charles VI succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority. With France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the Harelle and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace. Difficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through proxy wars, such as during the 1383-1385 Portuguese interregnum. The independence party in the Kingdom of Portugal, which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French. Question: Who was Charles VI's father? Answer:","output":"Charles VI's father was King Charles V of France, also known as Charles the Wise. He ruled from 1364 until his death in 1380. As the son of King John II and Bonne of Luxembourg, he was a member of the House of Valois and played a significant role in the Hundred Years' War against England. During his reign, he achieved several victories and regained significant territories for France. Following his death, his son, Charles VI, inherited the throne at a young age, leading to a challenging period in French history due to the internal struggles and setbacks in the ongoing war with England."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"1996\\" correctly answer the question \\"What year did the Republicans cut the LSC's budget?\\"?

Q: How often does Montana voted for a Democratic president?  A: Overall, since 1889 the state has voted for Democratic governors 60 percent of the time and Democratic presidents 40 percent of the time, with these numbers being 40/60 for Republican candidates.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Montana's voting history for Democratic presidents is best understood by examining its track record in individual presidential elections since the state was granted statehood in 1889. Throughout this period, Montana's voters have participated in 33 U.S. presidential elections, with varying political preferences at play. While the state has frequently favored Republicans, it has also demonstrated support for Democratic candidates on several occasions. Here is a more detailed examination: 1. 1892 - Grover Cleveland (Democrat): Montana voted for the eventual winning candidate, Democrat Grover Cleveland. 2. 1896 - William Jennings Bryan (Democrat): Montana backed the eventual losing candidate. 3. 1900 - William Jennings Bryan (Democrat): Once again, Montana voted for the losing candidate. 4. 1912 - Woodrow Wilson (Democrat): Montana supported the Democratic candidate, who went on to win the presidency. 5. 1916 - Woodrow Wilson (Democrat): Montana voted for the Democratic incumbent, who again emerged victorious. 6. 1932 - Franklin D. Roosevelt (Democrat): In the midst of the Great Depression, Montana backed the Democratic candidate, who subsequently won the election. 7. 1936 - Franklin D. Roosevelt (Democrat): Montana continued to support FDR, who secured re-election. 8. 1940 - Franklin D. Roosevelt (Democrat): For the third time, Montana voted for the Democratic candidate, who made history with a third term. 9. 1944 - Franklin D. Roosevelt (Democrat): Montana maintained its Democratic loyalty, as FDR secured a fourth presidential term. 10. 1948 - Harry S. Truman (Democrat): In a stunning upset, Montana backed Democrat Harry S. Truman, who went on to win the presidency. 11. 1964 - Lyndon B. Johnson (Democrat): One year after taking office following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, LBJ secured Montana's vote in addition to the national vote. 12. 1992 - Bill Clinton (Democrat): Despite losing Montana in his re-election bid four years later, Bill Clinton carried the state in the 1992 election. 13. 2020 - Joe Biden (Democrat): The most recent Democratic victory in Montana occurred when Joe Biden won the presidency in 2020. Thus, out of the 33 presidential elections held since Montana gained statehood, the state has voted for a Democratic candidate 13 times (39.4%).

First, let's add 5 * i to both sides of the equation to get rid of \\"-5 * i\\" on the right side. So we have: (-3 * i) + (5 * i) = (-5 * i) - 10 + (5 * i) Now on the left side, -3 * i + 5 * i is the same as 2 * i. And on the right side, -5 * i + 5 * i is zero. So the equation becomes: 2 * i = -10 Now we need to find the value of i. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 2: (2 * i) / 2 = -10 / 2 The left side becomes simply \\"i\\", and on the right side, we have: i = -5 So, the answer to the problem is i = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Wash and condition you hair. Section it off into 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5,08-centimeter) square-shaped sections using the handle of a rat-tail comb. Mist each section with water, then apply a moisturizing hair cream to it. Braid each section of hair. A simple mixture of castor oil and coconut or oil will work just fine for this. You can also use your favorite braiding cream instead. Buy some braiding hair that has a water wave texture. Select a thin strand, find the middle, then hold it behind your first braid, about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the root. You should have three strands: a left synthetic strand, your natural braid, then a right synthetic strand. Braid these strands together until you reach the end of your natural braid. Split the synthetic hair into three sections, then braid them together for about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). You can also simply twist the two strands into a rope braid instead. Buy a package of pre-made faux locs. Slide a crochet hook or a latch hook through the base of your braid, close to the root. Catch the top of the faux loc, then pull it back through the braid to form a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long loop.  Pre-made faux locs are strands of synthetic hair coiled into a tube. Choose faux locs that match the color of your braiding hair. Give the loop a slight twist first, then slide the hook under the braid. Use the hook to catch the rest of the faux loc. Hold the loop with your fingers, then slide the faux loc through the loop. Gently tug on the loc to tighten the knot. Unravel the top of the faux loc a little. Wrap it around the braid, letting it coil back into its natural shape. Do this for 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters), then stop. Find the bottom of your faux loc. Slid the tip of the crochet or latch hook up through the loc until it comes out the top. Scrunch the loc down the hook as needed to get it all to fit. Do not catch the braided part that includes your natural hair. Instead, catch the part that only contains the synthetic braiding hair. Gently tug down on the hook, pulling the braiding hair and the braid down through the faux look. Slip the hook off of the hair. If there are any loops of braiding hair sticking out the side of your loc, tug downward on the braiding hair. Slide the faux loc up and down the braiding hair as needed to adjust the look. The faux loc won't cover all of the braiding hair, but blend into it. Since your hair is already all braided, all you have to do is add faux locs to it. It would be easier, however, if you start from the bottom of your head, and work your way upwards.

Colonel Osborne was expected at Nuncombe Putney on the Friday, and it was Thursday evening before either Mrs. Stanbury or Priscilla was told of his coming. Emily had argued the matter with Nora, declaring that she would make the communication herself, and that she would make it when she pleased and how she pleased. \\"If Mrs. Stanbury thinks,\\" said she, \\"that I am going to be treated as a prisoner, or that I will not judge myself as to whom I may see, or whom I may not see, she is very much mistaken.\\" Nora felt that were she to give information to those ladies in opposition to her sister's wishes, she would express suspicion on her own part by doing so; and she was silent. On that same Thursday Priscilla had written her last defiant letter to her aunt,--that letter in which she had cautioned her aunt to make no further accusations without being sure of her facts. To Priscilla's imagination that coming of Lucifer in person, of which Mrs. Trevelyan had spoken, would hardly have been worse than the coming of Colonel Osborne. When, therefore, Mrs. Trevelyan declared the fact on the Thursday evening, vainly endeavouring to speak of the threatened visit in an ordinary voice, and as of an ordinary circumstance, it was as though a thunderbolt had fallen upon them.  \\"Colonel Osborne coming here!\\" said Priscilla, mindful of the Stanbury correspondence,--mindful of the evil tongues of the world.

Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass.

As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

Step 2: Evaluate each of the options based on their relevance to the given context and determine if they can be related to the process of dew formation. Option 1 (sand): Sand is not related to the process of condensation or dew formation as it is a solid material usually found on beaches, deserts, or other environments. It has no direct connection to the formation of dew. Option 2 (liquids): Liquids could potentially relate to the process of dew formation, as condensation is a transformation from a gaseous state (water vapor) into a liquid state (dew). Option 3 (fire): Fire is not directly related to the process of condensation or dew formation. Fire typically represents a source of heat, whereas the question deals with the chilling of air.

At high pressures, how are the molecules of a gas crowded? A:","output":"At high pressures, the molecules of a gas experience increased crowding due to the reduced volume they are confined in. This crowding can be explained by considering the ideal gas law and the behavior of gas molecules under pressure. The ideal gas law states: PV = nRT Where: P = pressure V = volume n = number of moles of gas R = ideal gas constant T = temperature (in Kelvin) When the pressure (P) increases, while keeping the temperature (T) and the number of moles (n) constant, the volume (V) must decrease to maintain the equality. As a result, the molecules of gas are compressed into a smaller volume, thereby increasing their density and crowding. Increased crowding of gas molecules at high pressures leads to more frequent collisions between the molecules, as well as stronger intermolecular forces. This can cause deviations from the ideal gas law, as the gas starts behaving more like a real gas. In a real gas, factors like the size of the gas molecules and the strength of the intermolecular forces become significant. In conclusion, at high pressures, the molecules of a gas become increasingly crowded due to the reduced volume they are contained in, leading to more frequent collisions and stronger intermolecular forces, thus causing the gas to deviate from ideal behavior."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I have to agree 100% with the previous reviewer.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Problem:Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : So I have been working exclusively for a smaller company, they offer me projects with payments ranging from 5,000 to 10,000. All up front. I have done this for three years. Recently I have realized that I could make more money freelancing, so with my previous employers blessing I have started working for other companies in different areas. Many people in my profession accept partial payments. I do not and I do not feel comfortable doing so as you never know who you can really trust. So anyway, I accept a job for 25,000 from a company I have never worked for before. They needed this done quickly so they offered a high number without haggling. They did not tell me \\"half up front and half later\\", they simply gave me the money which I immediately noticed was light by 12,500. I ask whats up, and they say that i will get the other half after the job is done. I say thats bullshit, and that I want all of it upfront or no deal. They take this as an insult that I dont trust them (which is true) but I just say I dont work like that. In the end I return the money and they're not using my services. I was also threatened because apparently I wasted their time or some bullshit. Now the person who set me up with them says I just burned a bridge and that I fucked up badly. Oh well, I can go back to working for my old boss, whatever.

Step 1: Understand the context - AUTHOR has been working for a smaller company for three years, always receiving full payment upfront. - AUTHOR began freelancing and accepted a job for 25,000 from a new company. - The new company provided half the payment upfront without discussing it, expecting AUTHOR to accept the other half after completing the work. - AUTHOR refused and returned the money since they don't feel comfortable accepting partial payments. Step 2: Analyze the ethical situation - AUTHOR's standard practice is to receive full payment upfront. - The new company changed the payment terms without discussing it, causing a misunderstanding. Step 3: Determine who is wrong in this situation - AUTHOR for insisting on full payment upfront and not discussing it beforehand with the new company. - NOBODY because both parties didn't communicate their expectations and requirements properly. - EVERYBODY as both parties might have acted more responsibly by discussing the payment terms upfront. - OTHER, which doesn't apply here.

Not every group is going to be appropriate to approach. Is this a group of girls commiserating over a group member's break up? Are they talking about work or is a family member sick? Listen in without seeming obvious for cues.","output":"Once you have gathered enough information and determined that the conversation topic is neutral or positive, choose the right moment to approach. Timing is essential; interrupting a deep conversation may put off the group members, so wait for lulls or shifts in discussions. Next, consider your body language—confident, open, and friendly postures can make you seem approachable and genuine. When you feel ready, approach the group with a gentle smile, and make eye contact with the girl you want to talk to, but also show acknowledgment to the rest of the group members. Instead of barging into their conversation directly, consider starting with an icebreaker or a situational comment that can draw the group's attention in a non-intrusive way. Once you’ve got their attention, introduce yourself and engage in light small talk. This will allow you to gauge the group's openness to including a new person in their conversation. It's essential to read the cues and react accordingly. If they seem hesitant or uninterested, back away gracefully. However, if they respond positively, proceed with sharing your thoughts or opinions in a respectful manner. As the conversation progresses, make sure to maintain a healthy balance between talking to the girl that caught your eye and including the rest of the group. By actively involving everyone, you show respect for the group dynamic and establish rapport with the entire group. This not only helps you blend in with the group, but it also gains their trust, making it easier for you to eventually have a more personal conversation with the girl you're interested in. Remember to actively listen, ask relevant questions, and contribute thoughtful insights while respecting the rules of conversational etiquette. Show genuine interest, but do not monopolize the conversation; instead, take the time to learn from others as well. While talking to the girl, look for common interests and shared experiences that can serve as a foundation for deeper conversations. Once you have developed a connection with the group and the girl you're interested in, gently steer the conversation to focus more on her without making it seem sudden or awkward. Share stories or experiences that relate to the topics being discussed and casually ask her open-ended questions. If she seems engaged, continue to build on the conversation and forge a stronger connection. However, if at any point she appears disinterested or uncomfortable, reorient your approach or gracefully exit the conversation, respecting her boundaries. In conclusion, when engaging with a girl in a group, it is crucial to evaluate the group dynamic, approach when appropriate, exhibit confident and open body language, engage in light small talk, maintain a healthy balance between engaging her and the group, establish rapport, and respect boundaries. By following these steps, you can successfully establish a connection with both the girl and the group, paving the way for deeper and more meaningful conversations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still  regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora.  Guess a valid title for it!

Article: Unlike the situation with the states, there is no plenary reception statute at the federal level that continued the common law and thereby granted federal courts the power to formulate legal precedent like their English predecessors. Federal courts are solely creatures of the federal Constitution and the federal Judiciary Acts. However, it is universally accepted that the Founding Fathers of the United States, by vesting \\"judicial power\\" into the Supreme Court and the inferior federal courts in Article Three of the United States Constitution, thereby vested in them the implied judicial power of common law courts to formulate persuasive precedent; this power was widely accepted, understood, and recognized by the Founding Fathers at the time the Constitution was ratified. Several legal scholars have argued that the federal judicial power to decide \\"cases or controversies\\" necessarily includes the power to decide the precedential effect of those cases and controversies. Now answer this question: What does Article Three give federal agencies?","output":"Article Three of the United States Constitution does not explicitly give powers to federal agencies. Instead, it focuses on the establishment and functioning of the judicial branch of the federal government, specifically the Supreme Court and inferior federal courts. However, by doing so, it indirectly influences the role and authority that federal agencies may have in the legal domain. The key purpose of Article Three is to define the \\"judicial power\\" of the United States, which is vested in the Supreme Court and any inferior federal courts that Congress chooses to create. In outlining the scope, jurisdiction, and guiding principles of the federal courts, Article Three creates the framework within which federal agencies must operate, especially when their actions or decisions are subject to judicial review. Though not expressly granting powers to federal agencies, Article Three does have implications for their operations. By establishing the federal judiciary as the final arbiter of legal disputes and interpretations, the Constitution ensures that federal agencies must act within the boundaries of the law and adhere to the precedents established by the judicial branch. In addition, as explained in the provided article, Article Three indirectly grants the federal courts the implied judicial power of common law courts to formulate persuasive precedent. This power permits the courts to shape the legal landscape in which federal agencies function, by interpreting laws and regulations that concern their operations and policymaking. In conclusion, while Article Three does not specifically give powers to federal agencies, it plays a critical role in defining their legal context and operating environment by establishing the federal judiciary and delineating the scope of the federal courts' powers. Through these mechanisms, Article Three influences and constrains the actions of federal agencies, ensuring they comply with the rule of law and the precedential interpretations established by federal courts."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Editor's note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He was a co-host of \\"Crossfire\\" on CNN with Robert Novak from 2002 to 2005. Paul Begala says he admired Robert Novak for his skepticism about authority, work ethic and faith in his beliefs. (CNN) -- In our innumerable debates, I delighted in calling Bob Novak \\"the finest mind of the 12th century.\\" One time, though, he scowled and growled, \\"I prefer the 15th century. Spanish Inquisition. Those were the days.\\" When I was a","output":"young pup in politics, just starting my career as a Democratic strategist, I vividly recall watching Robert Novak -- he of the piercing gaze and razor-sharp insights -- on \\"The McLaughlin Group\\" and later on \\"Crossfire.\\" I would take copious notes, trying to anticipate his attack lines and develop counterarguments that might one day be useful in my own political battles. To say I was intimidated when I first met him would be an understatement. But it didn't take long for me to recognize that beneath that gruff exterior was a man of uncommon intellect, boundless curiosity, and unwavering conviction. Over the years, as we sparred and debated, I discovered that he was also warm, funny, and deeply loyal. And I came to admire his skepticism about authority, his tireless work ethic, and his faith in the power of reason to change minds and hearts. I disagree with every word Bob ever said and swore to fight his ideas until the end of time. And yet we loved each other. Or at least I loved him, and I believe the feeling was mutual. Here's why: he embodied the true spirit of American democracy. He passionately believed in the marketplace of ideas -- in the notion that the only way our country can achieve greatness is if all sides have a chance to present their best arguments, and if we are all humble enough to listen and learn from each other. In our increasingly polarized world, where too many political pundits retreat to their respective echo chambers and lob lazy adhominems at their opponents, Bob Novak never took the easy way out. He was always curious about the other side's perspective, always eager to engage with those whose beliefs were vastly different from his own. And because of his fearlessness and intellectual honesty, he earned the respect and admiration of people he fiercely disagreed with -- myself included. One of the things I respected most about Bob was his unwavering commitment to journalistic integrity. If you doubted this for a moment, you should have seen him in the newsroom -- in reporters' huddles, at editorial meetings, on the phone with sources. He was a dogged, relentless investigator who cared deeply about getting the facts right. He often quarreled with his colleagues -- sometimes loudly -- but he always hewed to an uncompromising code of professional excellence that made him both a formidable adversary and a trusted newsman. Moreover, Bob Novak was a man of faith. In a business where cynicism often reigns supreme, he was unapologetic about his belief in a higher power, and his willingness to live a life informed by that faith. He converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1998, and ardently practiced his religion, praying the rosary regularly and attending mass daily when possible. His faith provided him with a moral compass that guided his professional and personal life, and it grounded him in a sense of humility that made him a better man and a better journalist. In the years since Bob's passing, I find myself missing our passionate debates. The gruff voice and the mischievous glint in his eye. The ability to make me laugh even as he skewered my most cherished beliefs. But what I miss most of all is the example he set -- of a man who cared deeply about our country, its institutions, and its highest ideals, and who fought every day to make America a better place. In these hyper-partisan times, we could all do well to remember the legacy of Robert Novak: the quintessential American journalist, a combative commentator, and a man of abiding faith. A man unafraid to challenge authority, expose hypocrisy, and celebrate the power of the press to inform, enlighten, and guide our nation's discourse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Telmatosaurus (meaning \\"marsh lizard\\") is a genus of basal hadrosaurid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It was a relatively small hadrosaur, approximately five meters (16 ft) long, found in what is now Romania.   - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.  - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU.  - The Late Cretaceous (100.566 Ma) is the younger of two epochs into which the Cretaceous period is divided in the geologic timescale. Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous series. The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time.  - The tibia (plural tibiae or tibias), also known as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula), and it connects the knee with the ankle bones. The tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to the fibula, and closer to the median plane or centre-line. The tibia is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of the leg, forming a type of fibrous joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the flute \\"tibia\\". It is the second largest bone in the human body next to the femur. The leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support the rest of the body.  - The femur (pl. \\"femurs\\" or \\"femora\\" ) or thigh bone, is the most proximal (closest to the hip joint) bone of the [leg] in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs. In vertebrates with four legs such as dogs and horses, the femur is found only in the hindlimbs. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee joint. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The femur is also the longest bone in the body.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Orthomerus ( meaning \`\` straight femur '' ) is a genus of duckbill dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of The Netherlands and Belgium . It is today an obscure genus , but in the past was conflated with the much better known Telmatosaurus .  - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.  - A hindlimb is a posterior limb on an animal, especially the quadrupeds. When referring to quadrupeds, the term hind leg is often instead used.  - In humans, the thigh is the area between the pelvis and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - Hadrosaurids (\\"hadrós\\", \\"stout, thick\\"), or duck-billed dinosaurs, are members of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae. This group is also known as the duck-billed dinosaurs, for the flat, duck-bill appearance of their mouths. The family, which includes ornithopods such as \\"Edmontosaurus\\" and \\"Parasaurolophus\\", was a common herbivore in the Upper Cretaceous Period of what is now Asia, Europe, Antarctica, South America and North America. Hadrosaurids are descendants of the Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous iguanodontian dinosaurs and had a similar body layout. Like the rest of the ornithischians, these animals had a predentary bone and a pubic bone which was positioned backwards in the pelvis. Hadrosaurids are divided into two principal subfamilies: the lambeosaurines (\\"Lambeosaurinae\\"), which had hollow cranial crests or tubes, and the saurolophines, identified as hadrosaurines in most pre-2010 works (\\"Saurolophinae\\" or\\" Hadrosaurinae\\"), which lacked hollow cranial crests (solid crests were present in some forms). Saurolophines tended to be bulkier than lambeosaurines. Lambeosaurines are divided into Aralosaurines, Lambeosaurines, Parasaurolophines and Tsintaosaurines, while Saurolophines include Saurolophus, Brachylophosaurines and Kritosaurines.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - The TriassicJurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, , and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. In the seas, a whole class (conodonts) and 34% of marine genera disappeared. On land, all pseudosuchians (non-ornithodiran archosaurs) other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct.  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park.  - The knee joint joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two articulations: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint). It is the largest joint in the human body. The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation. The knee joint is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis.

Reinforce sitting behavior with a clicker. Train your dog to sit or stay when the door is open. Be patient when training your dog. Keep your dog focused.\\" Article:","output":"Title: How to Teach Your Dog to Sit and Stay in Simple Steps Hello little friends! Today, we are going to learn about teaching our furry best friends, our dogs, to sit and stay when we tell them to. It's important because it helps us and our dogs stay safe and happy together. So, let's get started! 1. Look for and reward natural sitting behavior: Sometimes when you're playing with your dog or spending time with them, you might see that they sit down all by themselves. That's great! When you see them sitting, give them a treat or a pat on the head to say \\"good job!\\" This will make your dog understand that sitting is a good thing to do. 2. Begin issuing the “sit” command: Now that your dog knows that sitting is nice, we need to teach them when to do it. You can start by holding a treat near your dog's nose (not too close or they might just eat it!) and then slowly lifting the treat up while saying the word \\"sit.\\" Your dog should follow the treat and sit down. If they do, give them the treat and lots of praise! 3. Reinforce sitting behavior with a clicker: A clicker is a small tool that makes a clicking sound when you press it. You can use this sound to help your dog know when they're doing a great job at sitting. The first thing you need to do is teach your dog that the clicker means a reward is coming. You can do this by clicking the clicker and then giving your dog a treat. Do this a few times, and soon your dog will know that a click means they did something right! 4. Train your dog to sit or stay when the door is open: Sometimes, if the door to your house or yard is open, you might worry that your dog could run outside and get lost. That's why teaching them to sit or stay near the door is a great idea. Practice the \\"sit\\" or \\"stay\\" command near the door, and reward your dog if they do so. Remember to be patient, as it might take some time for your dog to learn this important skill. 5. Be patient when training your dog: Training your dog to sit and stay takes time and practice. You might need to try it a few times until your dog understands what you want them to do. That's okay! Don't get mad or upset with your dog if they don't get it right away. Just keep practicing, and soon they'll be a pro at sitting and staying. 6. Keep your dog focused: Sometimes, dogs can get distracted by things like squirrels, birds, or even yummy smells. When you're training your dog, try to find a quiet place to work with them, so they can focus on you. You can even give them a special treat that they really love, so they'll want to pay attention and learn. And that's it! By following these simple steps, you can teach your dog to sit and stay when you ask them to. Remember to be patient and keep practicing with your dog. In no time, they will be a sitting and staying superstar! Good luck, and have fun training your furry friend!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Devastated: John Halliday, pictured, had to have part of his leg amputated after doctors failed to notice the spread of a serious infection. A grandfather whose leg had to be amputated after a series of hospital blunders had been awarded £1.5m in compensation. Health and Safety consultant John Halliday, 59, is now confined to a wheelchair in the wake of failures by doctors and has been warned his life expectancy is likely to be shorter. Medics at Bradford Royal Infirmary failed to diagnose a serious infection which later spread to other parts of his body including his spine, leaving him with ‘devastating’ injuries. He has been forced to give up work and is now heavily reliant on help from carers in adapted accommodation. He has been warned a combination of earlier and more recent illnesses is likely to cut his life short. In. an out-of-court settlement, he has been awarded compensation after the. hospital admitted liability for negligence in delays in diagnosing and. treating septic arthritis which would have avoided the amputation. Mr Halliday, from Retford, Notts, said he felt he had been ‘abandoned’ by the NHS. There. had been a ‘catalogue of errors’ in his care but it was only a year. after he first fell ill that he realised mistakes had been made. He said: 'It’s unbelievable, it really. is. I’m in a wheelchair. I have carers in every day and they have to do. most things for me. I’m not able to work - and can make a cup of tea. and a sandwich and that’s about the limit nowadays. 'At first I was very angry but I’ve had to accept what’s happened and make the best of the hand I’ve been dealt. 'It is a large sum of money but it doesn’t bring back the life I had.' The father-of-two, a former. psychiatric nurse before setting up his own business, had suffered from. gout attacks for years which left him bedridden but had never needed. hospital treatment until 2008 when he began suffering serious problems. linked to his left ankle. Payout: Patient John Halliday says he felt abandoned by the NHS while receiving treatment at Bradford Royal Infirmary. He. was examined by doctors at Bradford Royal Infirmary who wrongly told. him he was suffering from cellulitis and an allergic reaction to. medication. He was given. antibiotics but did not undergo an early surgical washout of the ankle. to eradicate the infection which can damage vital cartilage. Trauma: John Halliday, from Retford, pictured before mistakes at Bradford Royal Infirmary led to him losing part of his leg due to an infection. It. was not for another 10 days that he was given the correct diagnosis of. septic arthritis which had led to toxic shock syndrome and kidney. failure. Despite the joint. being washed out four times and again two months later, the efforts. proved too late and he was told he needed a below-the-knee amputation. But before the operation could take. place, he was readmitted to the hospital in January 2009 where tests. showed the infection had spread to his lungs and spine. His leg was amputated two weeks later but his other problems continued, leaving him with severe curvature of his spine. Owing. to the back problems, he was unable to walk using a prosthetic leg and. cannot even move short distance on crutches. He suffers from severe back. pain and phantom pain in his missing leg. He. has now had to move from his home in Clayton, Bradford, where. he was a regular spectator of the city’s rugby league and football teams. and a keen fishermen, to live closer to his family in Retford,. Nottinghamshire. Surgeons who examined the case agreed if. he had kept his leg, his ability to get around would have been improved. and he would have been able to become mobile earlier, which would have. reduced his spinal problems. 'Abandoned': Mr Halliday is now confined to a wheelchair and has had his life expectancy cut short after the treatement he received at Bradford Royal Infirmary. Mealla Logue, of MPH Solicitors of Manchester, who represented Mr Halliday, said the negligence had led to ‘devastating’ injuries. A Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'We are deeply sorry for the distress Mr Halliday has experienced as a result of the care he received at our hospital. 'The care we provided fell below our usual high standards and we sincerely apologise to Mr Halliday for this.'

Now, John has to use a wheelchair, has trouble doing things by himself, and may not live as long as he could have.

Now, heat the tubing using a heat gun, lighter, or hairdryer, moving the heat source evenly along the tubing length, making sure not to overheat and damage the tubing or wire. As the tubing heats, it will shrink and wrap tightly around the metal wire, providing insulation and protection. And there you have it!

Given the question: Question: \\"Who kept Russia away from the negotiations?\\"  Context: \\"The Treaty of Hubertusburg, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, was signed on February 15, 1763, at a hunting lodge between Dresden and Leipzig. Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector. The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Frederick the Great, the King of Prussia, insisted on excluding Russia from the negotiations for the Treaty of Hubertusburg. He had previously considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony but ultimately decided against it. As a result, Russia was not involved in the negotiation process for this treaty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Back at their house by the cemetery, Paul and Chloe found Bee in her room, what Paul referred to as her sanctum sanctorum - although no one else ever got the joke, and he refused to explain the comic book reference. As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice. Big Brother sounds so mean.\\" \\"What's mean about a reality show?\\" said Paul, joking. \\"What isn't bad about a reality show?\\" countered Chloe, stepping in to defend her friend.

However, I wish to tell you how upset I have been by the way your Claims Assessor, Mr. Michael Tan, handled this claim.      When Mr. Tan first called me, he specifically told me that he believed I had been overcharged, and he would expect to pay that price for work on a double garage, rather than a single garage like mine. Mr. Tan suggested that I neither use nor recommend this contractor again. He continued to tell me it was unlikely for me to receive full payment. Never during this conversation did he mention that the reason for not receiving full payment was because of the nature of my insurance policy.      Consequently, I wrote to Mr. Lance Ashe to complain about his pricing, stating that I was very upset thinking that he could have taken advantage by overcharging a 73-year-old woman. Mr. Ashe telephoned me immediately and explained his charges in detail. He later reported back to me that Mr. Tan explained that I would not receive full payment because of the type of policy I hold, which does not cover wear and tear. This was the first time this issue had been brought to my attention, so you can imagine my surprise.     When I received Mr. Tan's letter of 2 February, this situation was explained. If this had been explained in the first place I would have accepted it and would not have questioned Mr. Ashe's charges. Instead, by telling me initially that I had been overcharged for this work, he caused a great deal of upset, not only for me but also for Mr. Ashe.

The mayor calls Taggart to his office for a private meeting and calls him \\"a hero,\\" but still forces him to leave the police. Seven years later, Taggart is living with his girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez), an aspiring actress. Taggart's private detective business is on the verge of bankruptcy when Mayor Hostetler hires him to investigate his wife, Cathleen Hostetler (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who he thinks is having an affair. Helped by his assistant, Katy Bradshaw (Alona Tal), Taggart learns that Cathleen is seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), the campaign manager of Hostetler's rival in the upcoming elections, Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). At a fundraiser for Hostetler's campaign, Cathleen reveals to Taggart that she knows he has been following her, and advises him not to trust her husband. Taggart delivers to Mayor Hostetler photos taken of Cathleen meeting with Andrews. At a film debut party, Barrow reveals that her real name is Natalia Barea, and that Yesenia was her sister.

But spending money on cranberry capsules with \\"limited potential benefit\\" for preventing urinary tract infections \\"does not seem worthwhile.\\"Nursing home residents who took cranberry capsules had as many UTIs as other residentsAmong nursing home residents, UTIs are the most commonly diagnosed infections   Questions:\\"For postmenopausal women, topical estrogen in the vagina has shown to decrease the risk of _,\\" Soper said, adding that this treatment has minimal absorption and so is safe to use.

Given the question: Given the following context:  In December 2005, the two ton Reclining Figure (1969–70) – insured for £3 million – was lifted by crane from the grounds of the Henry Moore Foundation on to a lorry and has not been recovered. Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for stealing a sculpture called Sundial (1965) and the bronze plinth of another work, also from the foundation's estate. In October 2013 Standing Figure (1950), one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park, estimated to be worth £3 million, was stolen. In 2012, the council of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets announced its plans to sell another version of Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but instead chose to \\"explore options\\" for a sale. In response to the announcement an open letter was published in The Guardian, signed by Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, by Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, by filmmaker Danny Boyle, and by artists including Jeremy Deller. The letter said that the sale \\"goes against the spirit of Henry Moore's original sale\\" of the work.  answer the following question:  What statue was nickmamed Old Flo?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Soft carpeting and rugs feel warmer than other surfaces and provide more cushioning. Using these surfaces is somewhat similar to laying on a mattress. You will most likely have an easier time falling asleep and experience less stiffness when you wake up. Sleeping on a hard surface is possible if you don’t have any other choice. It isn’t very different from sleeping on carpeting, but take extra time to prepare your bedding. Pick something that will give you a lot of cushioning, such as a quilt or sleeping back. If you don’t have anything thick enough, stack a couple of blankets together. Test your sleeping pad out to make sure it provides plenty of support for your back. In some parts of the world, people sleep on the ground using insulated mats. Tatami mats are great for repeated use, but massage mats, futons, and even yoga mats also work. You only need 1 good pillow. Choose a pillow that feels comfortable when you lay on it. Make sure it’s thin so it doesn’t lift your head too much. If it raises your head too much, it forces your neck and back out of alignment, which you will feel in the morning.  Stacking pillows isn’t recommended since it has the same effect as using a thick pillow. Stack pillows only if doing so makes you feel more comfortable while you sleep. If you ever find yourself without a good pillow, your arm doubles as one. It isn’t the most comfortable position to be in, but it works in a pinch. Once you have your base set up, complete your bed with some top layers. What you need depends on how warm you feel. Floors are often much colder than a mattress, so plan on having at least 1 warm blanket or thick comforter. Don’t underestimate sleeping bags. They are a source of warmth and comfort whether you’re out in the wilderness or at a sleepover. Now is when you bring in the thicker pillows. Identify any spots where you feel uncomfortable against the ground. The most common spots are the knees and hips. Slide the pillow underneath you for extra cushioning. Be careful not to lift your body too much. Slide the edge of the pillow underneath the part you need to cushion. Make sure your body is aligned with your head to protect your spine. Summary:","output":"The article discusses the benefits of soft carpeting and rugs for sleep, suggests various options for bedding on hard surfaces, and provides tips on choosing pillows and other materials for sleeping comfortably while maintaining proper body alignment."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to. Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited...

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: At first glance the Eurovision Song Contest may seem like any old talent show. Singers perform live on TV, the public and special juries vote, and at the end of the night a star is born. But don't call this \\"X Factor\\" or \\"American Idol\\". This is reality TV on steroids. Every year around 40 nations from Spain to Azerbaijan field a musical act, each singing an original song in front of a huge television audience. As part of the European festival of kitsch, some contestants sashay across the stage in barely-there dresses, and shriek into wind machines with the force of hurricanes. Pyrotechnics, fire, and massive LED screens are de rigeur. It's a big draw. In 2013 more than 180 million viewers in 45 countries tuned in to the action. This year's final takes place on May 10 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Although officials describe Eurovision as a non-political event meant to unite Europe through song, politics inevitably colors the voting and the performances. William Lee Adams, a Eurovision expert and the editor-in-chief of Wiwibloggs.com, the popular Eurovision website, has been in Denmark for the buildup since late April. \\"Eurovision is about music, but it's also about identity and nation branding,\\" he says. \\"The artists and their songs become symbols of the countries they represent.\\" This year is no different. Tensions over Crimea are already coloring the perception of acts from Russia and Ukraine. During the semi-finals on May 6, some of the audience inside Copenhagen's B&W Hallerne booed the Russian act, a pair of 17-year-old twins called The Tolmachevy Sisters. \\"Months of frustration over Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and Putin's anti-LGBT laws have left Europeans angry,\\" Adams says. \\"The booing was a release, a statement of solidarity with Ukraine and Russia's sexual minorities.\\" It doesn't help that Russia's love song features lyrics that some see as hinting at a border incursion: \\"...living on the edge, closer to the crime, cross the line, one step at a time...maybe there's a day you'll be mine.\\" In the past, Russia has relied on support from voters in the former Soviet bloc. Those votes seem less certain this year. Russia's loss could be Ukraine's gain. Mariya Yaremchuk, this year's Ukrainian act, will sing a song about love called \\"Tick-Tock.\\" Her act features a man running inside a giant hamster wheel. The act is not explicitly political, but in press conferences Yaremchuk has stressed that her goal is to show that art is stronger than politics, and that music lasts longer than warring politicians. It's not all about Russia and Ukraine. During the semi-finals, the act from Poland featured women in traditional dress churning butter and washing clothes as a woman rapped about Slavic women: \\"Cream and butter taste so good /We will prepare for you delicious food/ Our beauty is famous all over the world/ You gotta see it for yourself and then you will know.\\" \\"Poland, one of Eastern Europe's economic success stories, is celebrating its 10th anniversary in the European Union,\\" Adams says. \\"Their song is a brilliant parody of Polish stereotypes, and a rebuke to all those who view Poland as backwards and behind-the-times.\\" In the past officials have disqualified songs with explicit political messages. In 2009, the Republic of Georgia was forced to pull its entry \\"We Don't Wanna Put In.\\" It was a clear poke at Russia's President Vladimir Putin in the wake of the 2008 South Ossetia War. Creative license allows other songs with political messages to slip through. In 2011 the Portuguese entry, which translated as \\"The Struggle is the Joy,\\" was a call for Portuguese to fight against the government's planned austerity measures. It became an anthem of protest during the financial crisis. Political leaders, particularly those in the East, see the Eurovision results as a matter of international standing. Last year, when Azerbaijan failed to give any points to its political ally Russia, the Azeri president ordered a vote recount and the foreign ministers of two countries convened a meeting in Moscow. Riding a wave of sympathy, Ukraine has emerged as one of the bookies favorites to win this year. That won't sit well with authorities in Moscow. Nor will the reality that televoters in Crimea may still be counted as Ukrainian by their mobile phone companies. \\"When the points are counted and the hair extensions come off, one government is going to be very disappointed,\\" Adams says. \\"This isn't just a song contest. It's a battle in the war.\\" Opinion: The soft politics of Eurovision. Highlights:","output":"1. The Eurovision Song Contest is a big talent show where people from around 40 countries sing and compete. 2. Many people watch this show on TV, and this year's final will be in Copenhagen, Denmark. 3. Even though the Eurovision contest is about music, sometimes politics can influence the voting. 4. This year, acts from Russia and Ukraine are noticed because of tension between these countries. 5. The songs sometimes have hidden political messages, and sometimes politicians pay attention to the results of the contest."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Questions surround UC Berkeley chancellor and personal trainer In this Nov. 27, 2012 file photo, UC Berkeley chancellor Nicholas Dirks speaks to students, staff and alumni at a ceremony welcoming Dirks to the campus in Berkeley. In this Nov. 27, 2012 file photo, UC Berkeley chancellor Nicholas... Even as UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks has been put on the defensive over his household budget and handling of sexual harassment claims against professors and other campus employees, he has being dogged by an unusual investigation involving the personal trainer he and his wife befriended at the university. The case stems from a whistle-blower complaint against Devin Wicks, a trainer at the Cal Recreational Sports Facility who has regularly worked out with Dirks and his wife, history Associate Professor Janaki Bakhle. Wicks even traveled as Bakhle’s guest on a two-week trip in January to her native India, paid for by the Cal Alumni Association. Dirks also received an annual membership at the Cal Recreational Sports Facility valued at 420 from Wicks’ boss — though after questions were raised about the perk, the chancellor paid for his use of the rec center. Wicks, a 70,000-a-year campus employee, has been on paid administrative leave since April, according to UC sources. That was around the time a whistle-blower made an issue about his ties to Dirks and Bakhle. Dianne Klein, spokeswoman for UC President Janet Napolitano, declined to comment on why Wicks was on leave, saying the university could not talk about ongoing investigations. However, after sources confirmed key elements of the inquiry, Dirks spoke to us at length. While saying he was barred from discussing personnel matters, he insisted that he and his wife have acted properly. The whistle-blower complaint came from a former colleague of Wicks’ who had been fired for alleged embezzlement, sources told us. The complaint raised questions about the personal trainer’s relationship with the chancellor and his wife, including whether all the time he spent working out with them and traveling with her to India was on the campus’ dime. According to Dirks, Bakhle invited Wicks along on the trip because she was allowed to bring a guest and he was swamped with work. Wicks’ boss said the trainer used his vacation time for the Jan. 2-16 trip. Wicks did not return our calls seeking comment. Dirks called Wicks one of the couple’s “oldest and dearest friends” at the university. The chancellor said he and Wicks have worked out together regularly since they met at a holiday party soon after Dirks arrived at UC Berkeley in 2013. Wicks and Bakhle spend hours running together, as much as 20 miles at a time, and have run in charity races together, Dirks said. Mike Weinberger, who retired as the director of recreational sports at UC Berkeley in February, called Wicks an “incredibly valuable person committed to serving the university, and an incredible fitness director.” Weinberger said it had been his decision to give Dirks a free club membership and to allow Wicks to train with him, “spending as much time as he needed, as reasonably requested by the chancellor.” “I was thrilled the chancellor would want to spend time in my building and learn about recreational sports, and actually see how many students we serve,” Weinberger said. He said recreational sports compete with organized athletics for funding, and because “they have all the political clout ... this seemed a very small favor to grant to have a key administrator in our building understanding our services.” Dirks is dealing with plenty of issues at UC Berkeley. There’s the string of sexual harassment cases, which prompted a stern warning from Napolitano that the campus do better. Last month, we reported that UC Berkeley has spent more than 1 million sprucing up University House, the chancellor’s official residence, including 700,000 for a security fence and 90,000 for new rugs. The house’s former manager, Alice McNeil, complained that she had been pushed out of her job after doing chores for Dirks and Bakhle and resisting the couple’s attempts to avoid reporting the value of those hours to the Internal Revenue Service. The assertions are being reviewed by Napolitano’s office, though it wasn’t immediately clear whether a formal investigation has been opened.

Conservative Answer:","output":"Title: Echoes of the Past Genre: Drama, Coming-of-Age, Political Plot: The story takes place in the late 1960s, in the small, conservative Midwestern town of Havenwood, where the Taylor family has been a prominent fixture for generations. Inez Taylor, a bright and determined 16-year-old, is the only child of William and Meredith Taylor. William, a lawyer, is an active member of the local Republican Party and has announced his candidacy to be Havenwood's mayor in the upcoming election. Meredith, a homemaker and town socialite, is also involved in community politics, championing conservative values and hosting fundraisers to support local Republican candidates. Inez, however, is less enthusiastic about her parents' politics and aspires to break free from their traditional expectations whenever possible. A talented writer and rebel at heart, Inez spends her free time working on the school newspaper, where she pens investigative and thought-provoking articles. As news of her father's mayoral candidacy spreads, Inez is tasked by her school newspaper editor to cover the upcoming election and her family's growing prominence within it. She decides to use this opportunity to explore and question the motives behind her parents' political affiliation. This assignment sparks an ongoing conversation between Inez and her parents, challenging their held beliefs and motives behind their conservative values. While researching for her article, Inez discovers that her paternal grandmother was a suffragette and labor rights activist, who defied society's expectations of women in her time. Inez finds inspiration in her grandmother's story and begins to explore the nuances of politics and societal expectations from different generations. Overwhelmed with the pressure of her father's campaign, Inez's parents become consumed with maintaining the perfect family image and growing more conservative in the public eye. Inez, however, continues to broaden her horizons, finding solace in her writings, and befriending a group of young progressive activists in a neighboring town that inspires her to reconsider her parents' political beliefs. Inez's newfound convictions put her in direct conflict with her father, and their relationship grows increasingly strained as Election Day approaches. The night before the election, Inez publishes a controversial article in the school newspaper, disclosing a scandal involving a local Republican official that her father had been trying to cover up. The fallout threatens William's chances of winning the mayoral race, and he disowns his daughter publicly. The election does not go in William's favor, and the town is swept with political upheaval as progressive ideas begin to take hold. Inez's bravery in spotlighting the truth leads her to receive a prestigious journalism scholarship from a liberal arts college in New York City. In the aftermath of the election, Inez's parents have a moment of reconciliation, as her actions force them to reassess their own values and confront their held prejudices. The movie ends with Inez leaving Havenwood to attend college in New York City as her parents watch from a distance, holding out hope for a future where they can reconcile their political differences and rebuild their fractured family."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

According to the Russian Football Union, clubs from the cities of Simferopol, Sevastopol, and Yalta will be playing in the second division south, which is a third-tier Russian league. Since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in February, it has registered five new clubs in the region.

Additionally, Russian organizers for the 2018 World Cup have mentioned that Crimea may be designated as a potential location for teams' training bases during the tournament. This move by Russia to integrate Crimean clubs into their league system can be seen as a further attempt to solidify its control over the annexed region. With this decision, Russia is likely trying to demonstrate that it is fully committed to incorporating Crimea into its domain, despite the ongoing tensions and disagreements with Ukraine. By calling on FIFA and UEFA to intervene, Ukraine is making it clear that it is not accepting Russia's control over the peninsula and is seeking international support to challenge this move. If FIFA and UEFA were to take action against Russia's incorporation of Crimean clubs, this could escalate tensions between Russia and the international sports community, possibly affecting Russia's hosting of the 2018 World Cup. Given the precedent set by the suspension of Russia from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) due to doping scandals in 2015, there is a possibility that similar action could be taken in the realm of football. In conclusion, the integration of Crimean football clubs into the Russian league system is a move that further emphasizes Russia's grip on the disputed territory and has the potential to create more tension between Russia and Ukraine. The Ukrainian Football Federation's call for FIFA and UEFA intervention signifies that the conflict surrounding Crimea is extending into the realm of sports. With Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup and considering Crimea as a potential location for teams' training bases, it remains to be seen how this situation will unfold and what actions the international sports community will take in response to these developments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor. Axing thousands of soldiers may have put the country at 'significant risk', the Government's spending watchdog has revealed in a blistering report published today. The National Audit Office said the decision to cut the army's regular forces from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2018, while ramping up the number of reservists, was taken without testing whether it could work. It also revealed the plan was running up to six years behind schedule - leaving the army dangerously short of soldiers. The report said the cuts may 'significantly affect the Army's ability to achieve its objectives'. David Cameron defended the Government's army cuts at Prime Minister's Questions today. The Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (second right) said the strength of the army reserve was growing for the first time in nearly 20 years. The former head of the Army Lord Dannatt said even if the goal of increasing reservist numbers is met by 2018, there will be at least three years before then when the Army is under strength. He warned that this could leave the country at risk. He said: 'If it stays relatively quiet and we are not committed anywhere then the risk will not materialise, but if something happens, the strategic shocks happen, and we are terribly bad about spotting them, then we could be embarrassed and we could be in some difficulty.' Audit office chief Amyas Morse added: 'Army 2020 requires an overall reduction in the size of the Army and a fundamental change to its composition, with a significant reduction in the number of regulars and a substantial increase in the number of trained reserves. 'Military judgment played an important role in decisions but committing to moving towards an Army structure with fewer regular soldiers and an increased number of reserves within the planned timescale should have been subject to more rigorous testing of feasibility. 'The Department and Army must get a better understanding of significant risks to Army 2020.' Ministers said the overhaul of the army was needed to save cash - helping the Ministry of Defence save £10.6billion over 10 years. But the National Audit Office said it could actually end up costing taxpayers more. Audit office chief Amyas Morse said: 'The planned timescale should have been subject to more rigorous testing of feasibility.' He added that the risk of a shortfall in the recruitment of new reserves could 'up the pressure on regular units'. Labour's Public Accounts Committee chair Margaret Hodge said she was 'astounded' that despite the military cuts the cost of army to the taxpayer may actually go up. Margaret Hodge, chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, added: 'The Ministry of Defence focused heavily on cutting costs rather than on recruiting, training and integrating a substantially increased number of reserves, something the Army is already failing to do.' She added: 'Even after all this, I am astounded to find that reducing the size of the Army will not alone deliver the financial savings required for the MoD budget. 'Unbelievably, it may even mean increased costs to the Treasury if the reservists are deployed.' The Army 2020 re-structuring programme forms part of the package of defence cuts originally set out in the Coalition's 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. It will see the regular Army reduced to its lowest level since the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said the restructuring plans were 'in danger of collapse'. He said: 'This devastating report points to a litany of errors and serious failings at the Ministry of Defence under David Cameron. 'Defence ministers were warned that these plans would not work unless they were properly tested and monitored. 'They were told that front-loading cuts to the Army and back-ending recruitment to the reserves would leave the Armed Forces under strength. They didn't listen and now they're in a complete mess.' Chief of the General Staff General Sir Peter Wall (left) defended the 'Army 2020' plan to overhaul the service. He said the plan 'will endure' the test of time. General Sir Peter Wall, Chief of the General Staff, said: 'The NAO report fails to capture the nature of the austerity we faced at the time these decisions were made. 'The Army has designed a novel and imaginative structure which best meets the challenges we are likely to face within the resources made available. 'Thankfully, most of the structural change for our new model, which we call Army 2020, is now behind us. 'We are recruiting regular and reserve soldiers for this new Army avidly. I am confident that, having made such significant changes, the Army 2020 model will endure.' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The MoD has always been clear that the numbers in the Reserves would fall before they increased, but we have now seen the trained strength of the Reserves climb for the first time in nearly 20 years.' Asked about the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said the Government inherited a reserve that had been 'under-resourced and undervalued for years'. 'We now have a five-year programme for building them up. 'That programme is under way, it is gathering pace. What we are going to see is the strongest possible professional Army with all of the best equipment they could have, and a very strong reserve force backing up, making sure we can meet all of the obligations we set out in the Strategic Defence Review.'

What takes roughly 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds?","output":"The event that takes roughly 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds is called a sidereal day. A sidereal day is the time it takes for the Earth to complete one full rotation on its axis relative to the fixed background stars. This is different from a solar day, which is the time it takes for the Earth to rotate relative to the position of the Sun. The reason for the difference in the length of a sidereal and solar day lies in the way the Earth moves. The Earth not only rotates on its axis but also revolves around the Sun. As the Earth moves along its orbital path around the Sun, its position relative to the background stars changes. Therefore, to complete a full rotation relative to the stars, the Earth has to cover a little bit more than one full rotation with respect to the Sun. To provide a more in-depth understanding, let us assume that the Earth is stationary in its orbit around the Sun. In this case, the Earth's rotation would be the same for both the sidereal and solar day, as there would be no positional shift relative to the background stars. However, in reality, the Earth is constantly moving in its orbit. Consequently, during the time it takes for the Earth to complete a full 360-degree rotation on its axis (which is a sidereal day), it has moved a little bit along its orbital path. So, for the Earth to \\"catch up\\" to the Sun's position again (sunrise to sunrise, for example), it needs to rotate a little bit more than 360 degrees. Thus, it takes about 4 minutes longer for a solar day compared to a sidereal day. In summary, a sidereal day is the time required for the Earth to complete one full rotation on its axis relative to the fixed background stars and lasts for approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds. This is slightly shorter than the solar day, which takes 24 hours to complete, due to the Earth's movement along its orbit around the Sun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is the nation that, since its independence, has striven to bring democracy, prosperity, and peace to the entire world, for the good of all mankind. There are times, however, when one cannot help but wish that the American's would just stay on their side of the Atlantic.  This 'movie' (and I use that word with some reservations) evokes these feelings with an intense purity. This vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin, a freakish jewel thief who was created by attaching the severed head of Marlon Wayan onto the body of a two foot-high dwarf. After inadvertently dropping a large diamond into the handbag of Vanessa, a career-woman who is reluctant to have children, Calvin realises that in order to recover the diamond he must ingratiate himself with her. So, as any normal man would, Calvin dresses himself up as a 2 year-old and parks himself upon the poor woman's doorstep, where he is discovered by Darryl, the broody husband of Vanessa.  Darryl incongruously falls for Calvin's disguise despite the fact that the 'baby' has a full set of teeth, stubble, a tattoo, a knife-scar, and the sex-drive of a 16-year-old. Even more absurdly, Vanessa doesn't see past Calvin's baby-wear either and actually attempts to breastfeed the diminutive pervert. This wretched assault upon the soul of mankind attempts, and fails, to find humour in rape, scatology, sexual assault, and paedophilia, however, in a dishonest attempt to transform itself into a piece of 'family-entertainment' the Wayan brothers stir in a sickening amount of sentiment and flawed morality.  The brothers dim attempt a Freudian rehabilitation of their thieving rapist by revealing that he \\"had a bad father\\". Repeatedly hitting Darryl in the crotch enables Calvin to develop the loving father-son relationship that both he and Darryl have always wished for. As if this wasn't ridiculous enough, Calvin's attempts to sexually assault Vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to indulge herself with a successful career, and that instead she should spend her life playing the role of the housebound little-woman, who spends her time alternatively squeezing out babies and cooking for her husband.  In this movie the Wayan brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clichéd sentimentality that has infected much of Hollywood's recent body of work. Additionally, they are endemic of the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming African-American humour into a poor and wretched shadow of itself that over-indulges in fart-jokes and crude sexual gags. By rights these two should be legally barred from picking up anything even remotely resembling a camera ever again.

The propaganda bureau is involved in deciding what pieces of information are allowed for public consumption, and in this case, they have kept this particular issue away from the state-controlled media. So, the answer to the question is that the AP is not being censored by an independent press or individual journalists but rather by the state-controlled media organizations under the directives of the propaganda bureau.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Who spies on the aviation tycoon's daughter?, using the article: Mike Regan is a self-made aviation tycoon who lives in a state-of-the-art smart house full of modern technology with his wife Rose and 17-year-old daughter Kaitlyn. Mike's company is developing an app called \\"Omni Jet\\" which will increase business while the company raises much-needed financial capital with a stock offering. However, it requires U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval. At the company, Mike meets Ed Porter, a 28-year-old information technology consultant and calls him to fix his home's Wi-Fi signal, which his daughter complains is slow. Porter also upgrades the Global Positioning System in Mike's car and claims that he also worked at the National Security Agency and had taken part in a military exercise in Kandahar. Porter meets Kaitlyn and starts a relationship with her through social media, but Mike fires him after Kaitlyn invites Porter into the house; this ends his promising career at the company. Devastated, Porter begins to remotely access Mike's private data and his house as he covertly monitors them through the security cameras and devices all over the house. He also spies on Kaitlyn and secretly records her masturbating in the shower. Porter sends fake emails to Mike's clients and the SEC, threatening the company's survival. He also takes full control of the house's technology, which leaves the family terrified. He uses a spoof email to send Rose fake mammogram results, saying that she tested positive for breast cancer. Rose is extremely distressed, but her test results were actually negative according to her attending physician. After Mike becomes aware that Porter has done this, he attacks Porter and threatens to kill him if he does not stay away from his family., what would be the answer ?

The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, \\"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\\" Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \\"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\\"As preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard.

You carve out a saddle notch in the logs for the logs to fit within one another. In the construction of a log cabin, a saddle notch is used to fit and connect logs on top of one another. This involves carving a semi-circular or U-shaped groove in the logs so that they interlock snugly when placed on top of each other. This method provides stability, structural support, and prevents air from seeping through the gaps between the logs. Option (b) is incorrect because there is no such thing as a \\"paddle notch\\" in the context of log cabin construction.

Apple makes phones, computers, and other electronics that many people around the world like and use. You might have seen the little apple with a bite taken at the back of some phones and tablets - that's their logo! In Ireland, Apple found a special secret place called a \\"tax haven.\\" It's a bit like in pirate stories when they find a hidden treasure island. What's a tax haven, you ask? Well, when grown-ups work or have a business, they need to give a part of the money they make to the government. This is called a tax. Sometimes, they don't want to give away too much money, so they look for places where they can pay less tax. A tax haven is like a magical land where people and companies can pay lower taxes than they would have to in other countries. In Ireland, Apple found a charming place where they could keep more of their treasure, just like a pirate! By having their business there, Apple didn't have to give as much money to the government in taxes. Now, you might think that was a smart move by Apple, but not everyone was happy about it. Some people thought it wasn't fair. They believed that Apple should pay more taxes just like everybody else, because when big companies don’t pay enough taxes, it can hurt the government and other people who need that money for important things, like schools, hospitals, and parks. Apple’s Irish tax haven became very famous, and one day, a lady called Fortune came to visit the tax haven. Fortune is like a powerful fairy who can bring luck, wealth, and happiness to people. Fortune thought about what Apple was doing, and she decided to teach Apple a lesson. Soon after Fortune arrived, Apple had some problems. The big bosses in Europe said Apple must pay more taxes, just like all the other companies. Apple didn't want to lose their Irish tax haven, but Fortune showed them that paying their fair share of taxes would help everyone. Slowly, Apple started to change. They began to be more open with the government and shared how much money they made. They started to pay more taxes, just like the other big companies. People applauded Apple for doing the right thing. The story of Apple's Irish tax haven reminds us all that even though finding a magical place to keep more of your treasure may sound like a good idea, it isn't always fair for everyone. Sharing our treasure and paying our fair share can help make the world a better place. And so, we learn that even the biggest and most powerful companies, just like Apple, must listen when Fortune comes to visit and shares her wisdom. And with that, they all could live happily ever after. The end."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Information:  - James Longstreet (January 8, 1821January 2, 1904) was one of the foremost Confederate generals of the American Civil War and the principal subordinate to General Robert E. Lee, who called him his \\"Old War Horse.\\" He served under Lee as a corps commander for many of the famous battles fought by the Army of Northern Virginia in the Eastern Theater, but also with Gen. Braxton Bragg in the Army of Tennessee in the Western Theater. Biographer and historian Jeffry D. Wert wrote that \\"Longstreet ... was the finest corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia; in fact, he was arguably the best corps commander in the conflict on either side.\\"  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - Suffolk is an East Anglian county of historic origin in England. It has borders with Norfolk to the north, Cambridgeshire to the west and Essex to the south. The North Sea lies to the east. The county town is Ipswich; other important towns include Lowestoft, Bury St Edmunds, Newmarket and Felixstowe, one of the largest container ports in Europe.  - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history.  - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.  - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Jeffry D. Wert (born May 8, 1946) is an American historian and author specializing in the American Civil War. He has written several books on the subject, which have been published in multiple languages and countries.  - The Army of Northern Virginia was the primary military force of the Confederate States of America in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War, as well as the primary command structure of the Department of Northern Virginia.

As of the 2014 census, the estimated population was 86,806 It is the largest city in Virginia by area as well as the 14th largest in the country.  - Robert Edward Lee (January 19, 1807  October 12, 1870) was an American general known for commanding the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War from 1862 until his surrender in 1865. The son of Revolutionary War officer Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee III, Lee was a top graduate of the United States Military Academy and an exceptional officer and military engineer in the United States Army for 32 years. During this time, he served throughout the United States, distinguished himself during the MexicanAmerican War, and served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy.  - The Battle of Suffolk at the Norfleet House Battery took place from April 13 to April 15 , 1863 , in Suffolk , Virginia , as part of Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet 's Tidewater operations during the American Civil War . In cooperation with Major General D. H. Hill 's advance on Washington , North Carolina , Longstreet with divisions under Major Generals John Bell Hood and George Pickett besieged the Union garrison at Suffolk commanded by Brigadier General John J. Peck . The Union works were formidable and manned by 25,000 men , opposed to Longstreet 's 20,000 . On April 13 , the Confederate troops pushed their left flank to the Nansemond River and constructed a battery on Hill 's Point , which closed off the garrison to Union shipping . On April 14 , Union gunboats attempted to run the batteries at the Norfleet House slightly upstream , but the USS Mount Washington was crippled . The Federals , at the same time , constructed batteries to command the Confederate works at Norfleet House . On April 15 , these batteries were unmasked and opened fire , driving the Confederates out of this important position .  - The Army of Tennessee was the principal Confederate army operating between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River during the American Civil War. It was formed in late 1862 and fought until the end of the war in 1865, participating in most of the significant battles in the Western Theater. It should not be confused with the Union Army of the Tennessee, named after the Tennessee River.  - The Confederate States, officially the Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized breakaway country of 11 secessionist slave states existing from 1861 to 1865.

Threats of secession can also be a strategy for achieving more limited goals.  - Braxton Bragg (March 22, 1817  September 27, 1876) was a career United States Army officer, and then a general in the Confederate States Armya principal commander in the Western Theater of the American Civil War and later the military advisor to the Confederate President Jefferson Davis.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows.

More Advice, Less Consent THE SENATE confirmation process is often viewed in terms of gladiatorial combat: Is the nomination \\"in trouble\\"? Will the nominee be roughed up? Will the opposing party get a scalp? A rousing confirmation battle can be fun to watch -- as, no doubt, some found the proceedings in the Colosseum -- but that really shouldn't be the point. Confirmation hearings offer an opportunity for nominees to lay out, to the extent possible, their views about the policy and managerial challenges they will confront, and for lawmakers to lay down markers on issues that matter to them. This is true even -- maybe even especially -- when the Senate is controlled by the same party as the White House. After all, the Constitution contemplates the advice of the Senate as well as its consent. The process did not start well last week. The hearing on former senator Thomas A. Daschle's nomination as secretary of health and human services was more lovefest than serious discussion of complex policy issues. Nonetheless, Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), the committee's ranking Republican, secured Mr. Daschle's pledge to try to use the regular legislative process to accomplish health-care reform rather than short-circuiting normal Senate rules by folding the measure into what's known as \\"reconciliation.\\" The hearings for the nominee for labor secretary, Rep. Hilda L. Solis (D-Calif.), were even more disappointing. On numerous issues -- so-called \\"card check\\" legislation for union organizing, a Bush-era regulation on overtime pay, an executive order allowing nonunionized companies to obtain federal contracts, state right-to-work laws -- Ms. Solis offered variations on: \\"That's something that I think I'm not prepared to give you a complete answer on at this time.\\" This week's confirmation calendar is crowded with a dozen hearings, including for Secretary of State-designate Hillary Rodham Clinton, Attorney General-designate Eric H. Holder Jr. and Education Secretary-designate Arne Duncan. There will be understandable limits to what Ms. Clinton can say, for example, about the situation in Gaza. But it would be helpful for the committee to probe, among other areas, how Ms. Clinton plans to navigate any conflicts between her role as secretary of state and her husband's global foundation; in particular, the committee should study whether the promised disclosure and review of Mr. Clinton's activities could be strengthened. Mr. Duncan has been hailed as a consensus candidate because his selection pleased people who hold starkly different ideas about how to improve schools. So what does he intend for the landmark No Child Left Behind law? Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) has raised legitimate, significant questions about Mr. Holder's nomination: Does his role in the pardon of financier Marc Rich or other matters give cause for concern about his ability to \\"maintain his independence from the president,\\" as Mr. Specter put it. Likewise, the concerns expressed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) about CIA Director-designate Leon Panetta's lack of experience in the intelligence field are eminently reasonable. Mr. Panetta is a knowledgeable and skilled public servant, but it is fair to ask how he proposes to compensate for the fact that this is not his area of expertise. Except in extraordinary cases, a president is entitled to the Cabinet secretaries of his choice. But the Senate is entitled -- in fact, it is obligated -- to ask probing questions, and to expect, to the maximum possible extent, answers that go beyond, \\"I'll get back to you on that.\\" What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the importance of the Senate confirmation process in the United States and urges Senators to ask insightful and probing questions during confirmation hearings. The article makes the case that the Senate's constitutional role is to provide advice and consent, and emphasizes the need for nominees to address policy and managerial challenges they will face when taking office. It criticizes the hearings for Thomas A. Daschle (Secretary of Health and Human Services) and Hilda L. Solis (Labor Secretary), suggesting they were less than substantive and informative. The article also recommends areas of inquiry for upcoming hearings on the appointments of Hillary Rodham Clinton (Secretary of State), Eric H. Holder Jr. (Attorney General), and Arne Duncan (Education Secretary). In particular, it encourages Senators to explore potential conflicts between Clinton's role and her husband's global foundation, Duncan's plans for the No Child Left Behind law, and Holder's ability to maintain independence from the president. In short, the article highlights the responsibility of the Senate in the confirmation process to ask meaningful questions and nominees to provide detailed, informative answers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Between the two directors Richard Pearce and Karel Kachyňa, Karel Kachyňa is considered more politically motivated in his filmmaking career. Karel Kachyňa (1924-2004) was a Czechoslovakian director whose work primarily focused on exploring social and political themes. Born in Czechoslovakia, he began his filmmaking career in the 1950s and continued working till the early 21st century. Kachyňa's politically charged filmography was heavily influenced by his country's socio-political landscape during his lifetime, including the events surrounding the Prague Spring and the Soviet Invasion. Kachyňa's work often showcased the psychological, moral, and ethical dilemmas faced by individuals in the various sociopolitical contexts. His films were especially sensitive to the impact of political systems on human lives and minds. Significant titles in his repertoire include The Hope (1963), The Long Journey (1967), The Ear (1970), and Little Shepherd Boy from the Valley (1983). These films, though varied in subject matter and approach, had an underlying political subtext exploring the limitations imposed by the socialist regime in Czechoslovakia and its effects on personal freedom. The Hope (1963) is one of the most acclaimed films by Kachyňa, which explored the experiences of a Communist party member disillusioned with the regime and the internal conflicts he faces. The Ear (1970), a thriller set against the backdrop of the Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia, elaborates on the notion of privacy and political paranoia caused by an oppressive government. Kachyňa's work faced various levels of censorship and encountered challenges in distribution due to their political content. Many of his films were banned or restricted in Czechoslovakia. Despite such challenges and limitations, Kachyňa persevered in exploring political themes deeply ingrained in his films. Richard Pearce, on the other hand, is an American director, primarily known for his work in film and television. Pearce's work revolves around a diverse range of themes, from political tension to romantic relationships. Though some of his films do address sociopolitical issues, he was not as overtly and consistently politically motivated as Karel Kachyňa. Richard Pearce's notable films include Heartland (1979), which delves into the harsh realities of life in rural America, and The Long Walk Home (1990), addressing racial segregation and the Civil Rights Movement in the United States in the 1950s. The latter can be seen as a politically relevant film, but his filmography as a whole demonstrates a broader interest in human stories rather than solely focusing on political themes. In conclusion, while both Karel Kachyňa and Richard Pearce have made notable contributions to cinema, Karel Kachyňa stands out as the more politically motivated director between the two. His filmography reflects a staunch commitment to capturing and exploring the social and political complexities of his time and provides a critical perspective on the political landscape in Czechoslovakia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He needs to determine the properties of these samples.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would new surfaces be exposed or stay covered in sample A?  Hint: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions.

Step 4: Determine if there is neutrality between the sentences. - The subjects are different (two men vs. orange rescue boat). - The actions are different (getting off vs. rushing across the water). - Though both sentences mention something orange, this does not establish a clear agreement or disagreement. Based on my analysis, I conclude that the relationship between sentence_A and sentence_B is neutral.

It was also adopted by the kings of Shirvan (a historical Iranian region in Transcaucasia) namely the Shirvanshahs, the rulers and offspring of the Ottoman Empire (in that context spelled as \\"eh\\"), Mughal emperors of the Indian Subcontinent, the Bengal Sultanate, as well as in Georgia and Afghanistan. In Iran (Persia and Greater Persia) the title was continuously used; rather than King in the European sense, each Persian ruler regarded himself as the \\"Šhanšh\\" (King of Kings) or Emperor of the Persian Empire.  - Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (; 27 October 1919  27 July 1980), known as Mohammad Reza Shah, was the Shah of Iran from 16 September 1941 until his overthrow by the Iranian Revolution on 11 February 1979. He took the title Shhanshh (\\"Emperor\\" or \\"King of Kings\\") on 26 October 1967. He was the second and last monarch of the House of Pahlavi of the Iranian monarchy. Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi held several other titles, including that of rymehr (Light of the Aryans) and Bozorg Arteshtrn (Head of the Warriors). His dream of the Great Civilization in Iran led to a rapid industrial and military expansion as well as economic and social reforms.   - The Iranian Revolution (also known as the Islamic Revolution or the 1979 Revolution;) refers to events involving the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty under Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, who was supported by the United States and its eventual replacement with an Islamic republic under the Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution, supported by various leftist and Islamist organizations and Iranian student movements.  - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire.

Deputy Fuchs The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: \\"Fuchs' Redemption\\" Genre: Action, Western, Thriller Plot: In the late 1800s, in a small Western frontier town called Redstone Gulch, Deputy Erwin Fuchs is known as a brave and honorable lawman who has been fighting crime and injustice for years. He has faced many dangerous outlaws and helped bring peace to the town. However, a terrible secret lies within his past -- one that haunts him every day. Redstone Gulch is suddenly plagued by a notorious outlaw gang led by Deacon \\"Black Jack\\" Rourke. This ruthless gang causes chaos and fear throughout the town, with a specific penchant for kidnapping young women to be sold in the criminal underground. Rourke’s heinous actions have left numerous families devasted and searching for their lost loved ones. Deputy Fuchs becomes personally invested when Sarah, the daughter of his closest friend and fellow lawman Sheriff Hiram Mitchell, gets kidnapped by Rourke's gang. Desperate to save her life and the lives of the other kidnapped women, he sets off on a dangerous mission to save them all from the clutches of the outlaws. Aided by a group of dedicated townspeople, Fuchs begins his mission, fueled by the urgency to seek redemption for his past sins. As they get closer to Rourke's hideout, the group encounters several obstacles -- deadly traps, hostile terrain, and deceitful townspeople who secretly support the gang's operations. Each challenge tests their resolve and loyalty to each other. The underlying tension between Deputy Fuchs and Sheriff Mitchell is slowly revealed as the source of Fuchs' guilt -- a failed rescue mission years ago led to the death of Mitchell's wife. When the group finally reaches the secluded hideout, a tense standoff between Deputy Fuchs, his group, and Black Jack Rourke's gang ensues. Rourke, seeing an opportunity to make a final deal, offers Fuchs the chance to save only Sarah in exchange for leaving quietly. However, Fuchs' unwavering loyalty to the town and commitment to saving the kidnapped women leaves him no choice but to refuse. Enraged by Fuchs' decision, Rourke initiates an intense gunfight that envelops the hideout. The bravery and tactical prowess of Deputy Fuchs and his group prevail, pushing Rourke's gang against the ropes. As casualties mount on both sides, Fuchs faces off against Rourke in a climactic duel that will determine the fate of the kidnapped women. In a thrilling display of skill and determination, Fuchs finally confronts and defeats Rourke, effectively dismantling the outlaw gang and rescuing the kidnapped women. With the women freed, Fuchs, Sarah, and the group return to Redstone Gulch as heroes. Realizing the stark similarities between the failed rescue mission years ago and the successful rescue of the kidnapped women, Sheriff Mitchell finally forgives Deputy Fuchs for their shared past tragedy. This forgiveness and Fuchs' actions open a path to redemption for the once-troubled lawman. In the end, the story of Deputy Fuchs' triumph over Black Jack Rourke's gang becomes a legend in Redstone Gulch and surrounding territories. The town, now safe from the clutches of the outlaws, can finally begin to rebuild and heal. Fuchs' redemption not only serves as a testament to the power of forgiveness but also as a symbol of the unbreakable bond between the lawman and the people he vowed to protect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: Donald Graham was taking a big risk by hiring Downie and breaking with the paper's traditional market. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Based on the information provided in the first sentence, it can be inferred that the second sentence is likely true, but with some further context and analysis. In the first sentence, it is stated that Donald Graham took over as publisher and selected Downie as the editor to help steer the paper in a new direction, away from the Georgetown elites (presumably the paper's traditional market) and towards the masses. This change in direction also implies a shift from national competition to focus on suburban dailies. The second sentence claims that Donald Graham was taking a big risk by hiring Downie and breaking with the paper's traditional market. This statement can be considered true in the context that any significant change in direction for a company or publication would inherently carry some level of risk. By shifting focus away from the paper's traditional market, which was likely well-established and catered to a certain group of readers (i.e., Georgetown elites), they run the risk of alienating their existing reader base, potentially causing financial or reputational damage. Moreover, pivoting the paper's focus towards the masses and suburban dailies means facing new and potentially unknown competitors, requiring adjustments in their content strategy and potentially influencing their advertising relationships. Furthermore, as the audience transitions from the elite to the masses, there may be changes needed in editorial style, topics covered, and overall tone to better cater to the new target audience, which can also be risky. However, it is important to note that there is no guarantee that the risk is necessarily negative – the change in direction could lead to positive outcomes, including expanding their readership, increasing revenue, and becoming a relevant and influential paper for a broader audience. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the first sentence, it can be inferred that the second sentence is likely true, as any substantial shift in direction for a publication inherently involves risks, particularly when it involves breaking from a well-established traditional market."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Yeon-Hee  for the following movie plot:  Korean gangster Han Ki-Chul (Lee Beom-soo) is put in charge by his Big Boss of looking after Lim Aryong (Shu Qi) who comes from Hong Kong.

Premise: \\"Bush was asked no questions about education and only one about welfare.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Instructed earlier by Bush's handlers, some questions were left off the table.\\"?","output":"This premise states that during a particular event, former President George W. Bush was asked no questions about education and only one question about welfare. If this premise is true, it implies that the discussion and focus of the event did not center around these topics. However, when examining whether the premise entails the hypothesis \\"Instructed earlier by Bush's handlers, some questions were left off the table,\\" we must consider several factors: 1. Relationship between the premise and hypothesis: The hypothesis suggests that there was prior instruction from Bush's handlers to exclude specific questions from being asked, which might account for the lack of questions about education and the limited discussion of welfare. The premise itself does not confirm or refute the hypothesis, as it only describes what occurred (i.e., no questions about education and only one about welfare) without providing details on the reasons behind it. 2. Possibility of alternative explanations: There could be other plausible explanations for the lack of education and welfare questions. For example, the event may have had a different focus, which led participants to ask questions on other subjects. Alternatively, the questions may have been selected based on the interests of the audience, which may not have considered these topics as relevant or important for the event. 3. The role of assumptions and constraints: To infer that the hypothesis is true solely based on the premise provided would require making several assumptions. We would have to assume that Bush's handlers had control over the questions asked during the event, instructed people to avoid certain topics, and that their instructions were followed. Additionally, we would need to believe that education and welfare were deliberately left off the table as a result of these instructions and not due to any other reason. In conclusion, if the premise is true, it does not directly entail the hypothesis that Bush's handlers instructed some questions to be left off the table. The absence of education-related questions and the limited number of welfare-related questions only serves as one piece of information about the event. To connect the premise to the hypothesis, additional supporting evidence or context would be needed, as well as eliminating alternative explanations for the observed result. Evaluating the validity of the hypothesis involves examining other factors, such as the event's context, possible alternative explanations, and the presence or absence of additional evidence to support the claim."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a tube that transfers food to the organs of digestion. In large bilaterians, the gastrointestinal tract generally also has an exit, the anus, by which the animal disposes of feces (solid wastes). Some small bilaterians have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means (for example, through the mouth). The human gastrointestinal tract consists of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, and is divided into the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts. The GI tract includes all structures between the mouth and the anus, forming a continuous passageway that includes the main organs of digestion, namely, the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. However, the complete human digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver and gallbladder). The tract may also be divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut, reflecting the embryological origin of each segment. The whole human GI tract is about nine metres (30 feet) long at autopsy. It is considerably shorter in the living body because the intestines, which are tubes of smooth muscle tissue, maintain constant muscle tone in a halfway-tense state but can relax in spots to allow for local distention and peristalsis. Question: is the liver part of the gi system?","output":"Yes, the liver is considered a part of the gastrointestinal (GI) system, although it is not a part of the GI tract itself. The GI system includes both the gastrointestinal tract and the accessory organs of digestion, which aid in the process of breaking down and digesting food. The liver, along with other accessory organs such as the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, and gallbladder, plays a crucial role in the overall digestion process. The liver, specifically, has multiple roles that contribute to the proper functioning of the GI system. Some of its essential functions in digestion include: 1. Bile production: The liver produces bile, a greenish-yellow fluid that aids in the emulsification, digestion, and absorption of fats in the small intestine. Bile helps break down large fat globules into smaller droplets, making it easier for lipase enzymes to digest them. 2. Metabolism of nutrients: The liver processes the nutrients absorbed by the intestines during digestion. It converts these nutrients into forms that can be used by the body or stored for later use. For example, it converts glucose into glycogen for storage, breaks down amino acids for energy or synthesis of new proteins, and metabolizes fats for energy. 3. Detoxification: The liver helps detoxify harmful substances, including drugs and alcohol, ingested through the GI system. It breaks down these toxins into less harmful compounds that can be excreted by the body. 4. Storage of vitamins and minerals: The liver stores essential vitamins and minerals such as vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, and copper. These nutrients are released into the bloodstream when required by the body. In conclusion, while the liver is not part of the gastrointestinal tract (the continuous passageway from the mouth to the anus), it is an accessory organ of digestion and plays a vital role in the gastrointestinal system's overall function."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself.

Answer:","output":"No. While Brazil has indeed won the World Cup five times and has participated in every tournament, the question asked is about Spanish-speaking countries. Brazil's official language is Portuguese, not Spanish. To find the most World Cup titles among Spanish-speaking countries, we need to look at other countries. Step 1: I will check the list of Spanish-speaking countries with World Cup titles. Step 2: I will then compare the number of titles among those countries. Step 3: I will identify the country with the most titles. Upon checking, Argentina and Uruguay are Spanish-speaking countries that have won the World Cup multiple times. Argentina has won it twice (in 1978 and 1986), and Uruguay has also won it twice (in 1930 and 1950).  Answer: Since Argentina and Uruguay both have two World Cup titles, they are the Spanish-speaking countries with the most World Cup titles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the night of May 1, 2011, United States Special Forces launched a raid to kill or capture al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, deep inside Pakistani territory, in a compound within the garrison town of Abbottabad. Following the event, the Pakistani government set up a Commission to establish how US forces could have violated Pakistani sovereignty without repercussions, and how Bin Laden, the world's most wanted man, came to reside secretly in Pakistan for so long.      The report you are reading, looking at the second of these aspects, is drawn from witness testimony and the Commission's own investigations, obtained exclusively by Al Jazeera.      Osama bin Laden, the former al-Qaeda chief and once the world's most wanted man, lived in Pakistan for nine years, staying in at least six different locations. While maintaining a very low profile, he evaded detection thanks to multiple failures of the Pakistani civil and military establishments, the Abbottabad Commission report shows.      Through the testimony of Bin Laden's wives, the wife of one of his couriers, intelligence officials and various others who came in contact with the family and its support network, the commission was able to piece together an image of what life on the run was like for the Bin Ladens and their Pakistani guards.      The story starts in early 2002, when Osama bin Laden was suspected to have entered Pakistan's northwestern areas, having narrowly evaded capture by the United States in the Battle of Tora Bora in Afghanistan in December 2001. It is unclear where he initially stayed, but intelligence officials say they believe he spent time in both the South Waziristan and Bajaur tribal areas.      The trail picks up in mid-2002, when Maryam, the wife of Ibrahim al-Kuwaiti, a trusted Bin Laden guard and courier, confirms that she travelled with a tall, \\"clean-shaven Arab\\" from the northwestern city of Peshawar to the Swat Valley. Swat was home to Kuwaiti and his brother, Abrar. Both Pakistanis acted as Bin Laden's couriers and guards throughout his stay in Pakistan. They were also associates of Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks against the United States, who is thought to have recruited them into al-Qaeda.      It was in Swat that Bin Laden was reunited with one of his baby daughters and his third wife, Amal Ahmad Abdul Fattah al-Sadah, a 29-year-old Yemeni. When Bin Laden joined Maryam, Ibrahim and Amal, he was accompanied by two other men: one a driver, the other wearing a police uniform. The identities of these men remain unknown.      A close shave      The group lived in Swat for between six and eight months, during which time \\"the tall Arab\\" did not mix with the couriers' families. It was during this time that Amal, Bin Laden's wife, became pregnant, and that Abrar al-Kuwaiti married a Pakistani from Kohat, named Bushra, who joined the group.      While the groups' activities outside the house were described as being limited, Maryam did testify that, on one occasion, when they were visiting a nearby bazaar, their car, with Bin Laden inside, was stopped for speeding by a traffic policeman. Ibrahim, however, \\"quickly settled the matter\\", according to the report, and the world's most wanted man continued on his way.      In early 2003, Osama bin Laden was visited by Khalid Sheikh Mohammad. Mohammad, travelling under the alias \\"Hafeez\\", was accompanied by his wife and seven children, and stayed with the group in Swat for two weeks. A month later, in March 2003, while watching Al Jazeera, they saw that Mohammad had been arrested in Rawalpindi in a joint CIA-ISI operation.      The news jolted Bin Laden, and three days later, accompanied by the brothers Ibrahim and Abrar, he left Swat. Two days after that, Ibrahim returned to pick up their wives and children, bringing them to Peshawar. Here they separated, with Amal staying on in Peshawar and Maryam and Bushra travelling on to Kohat, where they stayed in separate houses. The whereabouts of Bin Laden at this point remain unknown.      Over a period of time, an effective intelligence agency should have been able to contact, infiltrate or co-opt [OBL's support network], and to develop a whole case load of information. Apparently, this was not the case. Abbottabad Commission report,      About three months later, Maryam and Bushra travelled to a house in the outskirts of the town of Haripur, about 35km south of Abbottabad, where they found Osama bin Laden and his wife Amal, with the brothers Ibrahim and Abrar. Also in the house were Bin Laden's second wife Siham Sabar - a Saudi national known locally as \\"Sharifa\\", her son Khalid bin Laden, and two other Bin Laden daughters - Sumayya and Mariam, both adults in their early 20s.      Evasion tactics      The two-storey house, in the Naseem Town area, is described as being spacious, with three bedrooms and a lawn. The group stayed here for almost two years, during which time Amal twice gave birth to children. The children were delivered at a local clinic, but Amal never stayed the night there, and all conversation with the doctors was handled by Abrar al-Kuwaiti and his wife Bushra, who told the doctors that Amal was deaf and dumb.      In Haripur, the men never used mobile phones to make calls. Instead, they would travel to Peshawar, 150km away, or Rawalpindi, a distance of 65km, to make phone calls from Public Call Offices (PCOs). They watched Al Jazeera via a satellite dish, according to Maryam. No \\"guests\\" ever visited the men during that time, although Maryam said Ibrahim's mother visited at least once.      The brothers, paid Rs9,000 a month (about 150 at the time) by Bin Laden, as well as some \\"additional money\\" and gifts \\"from time to time\\", seldom spent a night away from him.      While in Haripur, however, Bin Laden was already planning his next move. In July 2004, land for the construction of a new house was purchased in Abbottabad, an army garrison town located about 85km north of the Pakistani capital Islamabad. Construction began in August 2004 on a two-storey structure, custom-built with walls as high as 18ft in some places. The building was completed in 2005.      In August 2005, the group moved to the newly constructed house. Abrar and Ibrahim took their families there first, with Bin Laden and his family following soon after. The brothers posed as businessmen, purchasing the land under a false identity (Abrar posed as one \\"Muhammad Arshad\\", and his brother was known as \\"Tariq Khan\\"). They fled the tribal areas, their story goes, as a result of a family feud - and this is the reason they gave for the high walls and isolation of the residents from their neighbours.      In October 2005, the northeast of Pakistan was hit by a devastating earthquake, the effects of which were felt in Abbottabad. The event had two positive repercussions for the group: first, under the guise of repairing the house, they were able to add an additional, unauthorised, storey to the structure; and second, the earthquake resulted in an influx of Pashtun migrants to the town, fleeing the destruction behind them, allowing the group to better blend in among the flood of non-native Abbottabad residents.      To the locals, the house came to be known as \\"Waziristan House\\", or, to others, simply \\"The Big House\\".      Life with 'Miskeen Baba'      Life in \\"Waziristan House\\" was kept strictly private. The brothers had utility companies install four separate meters for electricity and natural gas respectively, in an apparent attempt to ensure that none of the meters showed an excessive amount of activity, betraying the true number of residents. These were procured under the false identities of \\"Muhammad Arshad\\" and \\"Sahib Khan\\".      Abrar and Ibrahim saw to the procurement of food and provisions. Khalid, Bin Laden's son, looked after plumbing and other maintenance services. There was, accordingly, seldom any contact with the outside world. On occasion, a local named Shamraiz, who lived in a house opposite the compound, would do odd jobs in the compound's garden for Rs350/day (less than 5). He also reportedly sold a cow to the group, which was subsequently looked after by Khalid.      Ibrahim and Abrar were the only people to regularly leave the compound to interact with the community. They would \\"regularly\\" offer their prayers in the local mosque, according to Shamraiz, and \\"their conduct was polite and kind\\".      The group lived, according to the testimony of the wives, \\"extremely frugally\\". Bin Laden himself, before moving to Abbottabad, reportedly owned only three pairs of shalwar kameez (local Pakistani dress) for summer, and three pairs for winter - in addition to a single black jacket, and two sweaters.      He also owned \\"a cowboy hat\\", which he wore when he moved around the compound to avoid detection from above. Bin Laden, who reportedly suffered from various ailments, particularly in his kidneys and possibly his heart, would sometimes complain of sluggishness, and, on those occasions, he would eat some chocolate and/or an apple, according to the commission's findings. There is no evidence to suggest he was ever visited by a doctor, and he almost certainly never left the compound.      Bin Laden's children lived \\"extremely regimented and secluded lives\\", according to the Commission's report. He saw to the religious education of his grandchildren personally, and even supervised their playtime. Part of those playtime activities were competitions in cultivating vegetables in the compound's garden, with \\"simple prizes\\" for the best tended plants.      The Bin Laden family's women also lived very secluded lives, and, according to one account, began observing the veil from the age of three. Maryam, Ibrahim's wife, went as far as to suggest that they even observed purdah - an Urdu term implying seclusion - from men on television.      Khairiyyah Sabar, a 61-year-old Saudi national and Bin Laden's first wife, joined the group just three months before the US raid, having spent the eight years between 2002 and 2010 in detention in Iran. She never mixed with the couriers' families.      The couriers' families, meanwhile, had slightly more freedom. While their children, too, did not go to school and were instructed by their fathers, they were also allowed to leave the compound from time to time. According to local journalists interviewed by the commission, a number of local children said they had played cricket with the children.      The families of Ibrahim and Abrar were, however, kept almost entirely separate from Bin Laden's family, with some exceptions among the children. Even the women would only socially interact with each other for about 15 minutes every month.      One incident, as described by Maryam, stands out as being illustrative of the deliberately maintained disconnect. Rahma, the nine-year-old daughter of Maryam and Ibrahim, once asked her father why \\"the uncle who lives upstairs\\" in the main house, meaning Bin Laden, never left the house to go to the bazaar. Ibrahim told her it was because the man was too poor to buy anything. From that day onwards, Rahma referred to the man as \\"Miskeen Baba\\" [literally: Poor Uncle].      On one occasion, Rahma accidentally happened upon \\"Miskeen Baba\\" while receiving lessons from Sumayya, one of Bin Laden's daughters, and greeted him. From that day, she was banned from the main house.      Unlike in Haripur, in the Abbottabad compound, the women did have access to television. One day, approximately in January 2011, Rahma saw a picture of Bin Laden while watching Al Jazeera, and immediately recognised him as her \\"Miskeen Baba\\" from the main house. The incident troubled Ibrahim greatly, who was upset with his daughter and immediately banned all the women of his household from watching television. The incident also resulted in a complete block on any interaction between the Bin Laden and al-Kuwaiti families.      It was only then, almost nine years after first seeing him, that Maryam realised that the tall Arab she had met in the Swat Valley and had lived with for years was Osama bin Laden. According to her testimony, no-one other than Bin Laden's own family, Ibrahim, Abrar - and now herself - knew his true identity.      'Complete collapse of governance'      Lt-Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, then Director-General of Pakistan's premier Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, testified before the commission, saying that ISI analysis indicated that, while in Pakistan, Bin Laden \\"was to a degree actively planning al-Qaeda's future operations\\". Evidence suggests that, while he had cut off personal contact with other al-Qaeda operatives following the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammad in 2003, he was still electronically in communication with them.      It was, ultimately, this electronic communication, carried out through his couriers, which led to his downfall, when US intelligence services obtained phone numbers of public phone boxes used by the al-Kuwaiti brothers, and were able to track them.      The Pakistani Army Board of Inquiry brought to investigate Bin Laden's killing concluded that the al-Qaeda chief was able to escape detection in Abbottabad \\"due to the phased construction and occupation of the compound, the extremely low profile that was maintained, including very low technical signatures that might have indicated the presence of a High Value Target (HVT) [and] the clever selection of the OBL compound in an area few might suspect an HVT would choose to reside in\\", according to the Commission's report.      Either OBL was extremely fortunate to not run into anyone committed to doing his job honestly, or there was a complete collapse of local governance. Abbottabad Commission report,      Moreover, the board and the commission both found that a mixture of negligence and incompetence shown by several government departments - including the Revenue Department, the local Cantonment board, the local police, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), local utility providers and the Excise & Taxation Department - allowed Bin Laden to escape detection, despite multiple times at which officials in said departments had cause to investigate the house and its inhabitants.      In one particularly telling section of the report, the Commission summarises the situation: \\"Either OBL was extremely fortunate to not run into anyone [c]ommitted to doing his job honestly, or there was a complete collapse of local governance.\\"      As for his support network in Pakistan, the Commission concluded that, while he may have maintained a small and dedicated group of people who were helping him, the fact that he had been in the country for nine years left no excuse for the country's intelligence services to have made no progress in tracking him.      \\"Over a period of time,\\" the report reads, \\"an effective intelligence agency should have been able to contact, infiltrate or co-opt [his support network], and to develop a whole case load of information.      \\"Apparently, this was not the case.\\"      Follow Asad Hashim on Twitter: @AsadHashim ||||| Al Jazeera releases Pakistan’s suppressed report into the killing of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden.      On the night of May 1, 2011, US Special Forces launched a raid deep into Pakistani territory to capture or kill al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.      Pakistan’s military and political leaders were furious, and set up a Commission to examine both “how the US was able to execute a hostile military mission which lasted around three hours deep inside Pakistan”.      Later, the Pakistani government blocked the release of the report they had commissioned.      But our exclusive project reveals the full report for the first time, includes exclusive videos, and in-depth coverage. ||||| The Abbottabad Commission was charged with ascertaining the facts of what happened on the night of May 1, 2011, when the United States unilaterally launched a raid to capture or kill al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden in northern Pakistan.      While all previous accounts released to the public have been the stories of SEAL team members, or sourced mainly through Washington's squad of analysts from the CIA and similar agencies, the Commission pieced together testimony from local and provincial officials, police and security personnel - and, indeed, captured members of Bin Laden’s family themselves - to tell the story of that warm May night through the eyes of those who found themselves in the targeting crosshairs.      This is that account.      It is ten minutes past eleven in the evening. Amal Ahmad Abdul Fattah al-Sadah, a 29-year-old Yemeni woman, sits with her three-year-old child, Hussain, in a second-floor bedroom. Near to her is her husband, Osama bin Laden. About 250km away, at a US airbase in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, the rotor blades of two stealth Black Hawk helicopters begin to turn.      The Black Hawks, coated with special radar-evading paint and panels, as well as noise suppression devices, fly low and fast, entering Pakistani airspace in the Khyber tribal area between 11:15pm and 11:30pm. They are closely followed by two other helicopters, mostly likely Chinooks. All four fly along the route of the River Kabul, above Chakdarra to Kala Dhaka, where one touches down, ready to provide refuelling and additional support to the Navy SEALs now en route to their target in Abbottabad.      In the skies on the Afghan side of the border, US aircraft maintain a Combat Air Patrol (CAP) and an AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) presence, in order to respond swiftly to any Pakistani military response to the raid.      There is none.      The Pakistan Air Force's (PAF) radar is on \\"peacetime deployment\\", and low-level coverage is sparse on the western border. PAF controllers at Air Defence Command in Chaklala track the US CAP and AWACS in Afghan airspace, but log the activity as routine.      Approximately an hour and ten minutes after leaving Jalalabad, the US helicopters arrive at the compound in Abbottabad's Nawan Sheher neighbourhood. Navy SEALs rappel down ropes to the street below. Some head towards the residential buildings, while others, including Urdu and Pashto speakers, form a cordon around the compound to keep locals away.      Having unloaded its soldiers, one of the Black Hawks develops a fault, or encounters unexpected wind or temperature conditions. It crash lands - or \\"settles with power\\" - on the compound area, around ten minutes after the operation begins. It is forty minutes past midnight.      They hit the annexe first.      The storming of the compound      In their cramped rooms on the second floor, Bin Laden and Sadah hear what they initially think is the sound of a storm outside. They go to the balcony to see what is happening, but the night of May 1 is a moonless one, and it is pitch dark.      Sadah, Bin Laden's third wife, reaches to switch on a light, but her husband says \\"No!\\" He calls to his son, Khalid, who is in a first-floor bedroom. Sadah goes to see to her five children. When she returns upstairs moments later, Bin Laden has been joined by two of his daughters, Mariam, 21, and Sumayya, 20. They are reciting the Kalma - the Muslim declaration of faith - and verses from the Holy Quran.      Osama bin Laden tells his family that US helicopters have arrived and that they should all leave his room immediately.      In the annexe, meanwhile, Ibrahim al-Kuwaiti, a Pakistani bodyguard and courier for Bin Laden, is asleep with his wife, Maryam, and their children. They are awoken by a loud noise. As he attempts to calm his children, Kuwaiti receives a phone call. He asks if it is his brother, Abrar - also a guard and courier - who lives with his family in the main house. He gets no response.      \\"Abrar, I cannot hear you. I am coming,\\" he says into the phone, according to his wife.      There is a knock on the door.      \\"Is that you, Abrar?\\" he asks, opening the door.      A bullet hits him through the window, and he falls to the floor. As he falls, his feet hit the door, shutting it.      Maryam is shot in the right shoulder, and falls to the floor. Her children rush to her, and she can hear soldiers outside, shouting at her to open the door.      \\"You have killed my husband, and now only my children and I are in the room,\\" she tells them. In Arabic, a soldier demands that she open the door. She complies, and is told to sit on the stairs outside the building with her children, where two soldiers keep guard over them.      Back in the main building, some of Bin Laden's family members refuse to leave him, as ordered. His daughter, Mariam, goes out on the balcony with her children to see what is happening outside. Bin Laden reaches for his weapon.      That's when they hear the sound of an explosion - whether it is the helicopter crashing or charges being used to blast through a door is unclear. They hear soldiers on the roof, and footsteps on the stairs. Sadah sees a US soldier, on the landing outside the bedroom, aiming his weapon at Bin Laden. A red laser dot appears on his body, and she throws herself at the soldier.      He screams \\"No! No!\\" and shoots her in the knee. More shots follow.      As she lies injured on the bed, she recalls hearing the soldiers asking Sumayya and Mariam the name of the man they just killed.      Sumayya says she grappled with a US soldier. She did not see her father fall, but did see his body on the floor.      She testifies that he was hit in the forehead, and his face was \\"clear\\" and recognisable. According to her, \\"blood flowed backwards over his head\\". After asking both her and her sister Mariam to confirm Bin Laden's identity, they are told to stand in a corner, and later led out of the room.      \\"Sharifa\\" Siham Sabar, Bin Laden's second of three wives, was in her room on the second floor with her son, Khalid, for the initial part of the raid. She saw Khalid rush with his weapon to his father's aid when he realised that US forces were raiding the compound. She was with Khairiyyah, Bin Laden's eldest wife, when they were detained by US forces shortly afterwards.      When the soldiers forced their way in, Khairiyyah said that one of them \\"looked as if he had seen a witch!\\" The women and their rooms were searched, and then led downstairs by the soldiers.      That was when Sabar saw the body of her son, Khalid, lying in a pool of blood on the staircase. They also came across the bodies of Abrar al-Kuwaiti, the courier, and his Pakistani wife, Bushra.      Sabar knelt down to kiss her dead son's forehead as she passed.      The dust settles      According to the Commission's findings, by 1:06am, the US operation in Abbottabad was over, and US forces left the compound in a stealth Black Hawk and a Chinook helicopter, simultaneously destroying the downed stealth Black Hawk with planted explosives. The operation lasted approximately 36 minutes.      The first Chinook left Pakistani airspace at approximately 2:16am, with the support Chinook and remaining stealth Black Hawk following ten minutes later, at 2:26am. US forces were in Pakistani airspace and territory for a little more than three hours.      The Pakistani security and military response to the raid, according to the Commission, amounted to a \\"collective failure\\". Not only was the country's airspace compromised without the immediate knowledge of the military, but there was also \\"a grave dereliction of duty\\" on the part of the civil security establishment - that is, the police and civilian administration.      Police Constable Nazar Mohammad, on patrol in the compound's neighbourhood in Abbottabad, was one of the first to reach the scene, arriving shortly after the Black Hawk explosion at 1:06am.      He saw flames and smoke billowing from the compound, and alerted the local police station. At about the same time, army officials from the Quick Response Force (QRF) of the 19th Frontier Force Regiment arrived on the scene, along with other police officials. The police were relegated to forming a cordon around the scene, with the army and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) taking ownership of the site. The commission refers to the conduct of the police as being like \\"spectator[s]\\". Senior police officials, including a Deputy Inspector General (DIG), later arrived, and were allowed access to the interior of the house, testifying that they saw four dead bodies in the main house - presumably those of Khalid bin Laden, Ibrahim al-Kuwaiti, Abrar al-Kuwaiti and Bushra, Abrar's wife.      They were then all asked to leave the premises by the commandant of the nearby Pakistan Military Academy, who had established de facto control over the crime scene.      According to the DIG, Khairiyyah, Bin Laden's eldest wife, angrily said to him in broken English: \\"Now you come, when everything over!\\"      The commander of the military's QRF received information about the raid at 12:40am, when US forces were still inside the compound. By the time he, along with his commanding officer, arrived at the scene at about 1:20am, however, the Black Hawk had just been destroyed and US forces had left. The commandant of the PMA, who is also the army garrison commander in Abbottabad, arrived at 1:40am. Rescue crews were ordered to put out the flames and see to people's injuries, and all remaining inhabitants of the compound were taken into ISI custody.      By this time, it had become clear that a major operation had just taken place. Superior officers in the military were informed, and at about 2:00am, Major-General Ashfaq Nadeem, the Director-General of Military Operations (DGMO) called General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff.      Kayani then rang the Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman at 2:07am - two hours and 47 minutes after the initial incursion - to inform him that Pakistani airspace had been violated, asking him to \\"shoot down the intruding helicopters\\", according to the DGMO's testimony. Pakistani news media by now were already reporting \\"a helicopter crash\\" in Abbottabad.      It took an additional 43 minutes for the Pakistani Air Force to scramble F-16s from its Mushaf Air Base (in Sarghoda, about 240km away). This was approximately three and a half hours after the initial incursion.      It is also approximately 24 minutes after the last US helicopter had left Pakistani airspace.      General Kayani then spoke with then-Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and the Foreign Secretary, apprising them of events.      It was not until 5:00am that Admiral Michael Mullen, the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) called General Kayani, explaining what had happened. Significantly, that is the only phone call made between US and Pakistan authorities, and it occurs between two senior military officers.      General Kayani then waited a further hour and 45 minutes to make his final phone call of the night, at 6:45am.      And who is that phone call to? Who is the last person in the Pakistani government command structure to know about the raid?      President Asif Ali Zardari.

The report, obtained exclusively by Al Jazeera's Investigative Unit, also outlines how \\"routine\\" incompetence at every level of civil governance structure allowed the once world's most wanted man to move to six different locations within the country.      The report of the Abbottabad Commission, formed in June 2011 to probe the circumstances around the killing of Bin Laden by US forces in a unilateral raid on the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, draws on testimony from more than 200 witnesses, including members of Bin Laden's family, Pakistan's then spy chief, senior ministers in the government and officials at every level of the military, bureaucracy and security services.      It was released by the Al Jazeera Investigative Unit on Monday, after being suppressed by the Pakistani government.      It comes on the heels of a report by AP news agency revealing that top US special operations commander, Adm William McRaven, ordered military files about the Navy SEAL raid on Bin Laden's hideout to be purged from Defense Department computers and sent to the CIA, where they could be more easily shielded from ever being made public.      Following the US operation to kill Bin Laden in May 2011, which was avowedly conducted without the Pakistani government or military's knowledge, the Commission was set up to examine both \\"how the US was able to execute a hostile military mission which lasted around three hours deep inside Pakistan\\", and how Pakistan's \\"intelligence establishment apparently had no idea that an international fugitive of the renown or notoriety of [Osama bin Laden] was residing in [Abbottabad]\\".      The Abbottabad Commission was charged with establishing if the failures of the Pakistani government and military were due to incompetence or complicity, and was given overarching investigative powers.      The Commission's 336-page report is scathing, holding both the government and the military responsible for \\"gross incompetence\\" leading to \\"collective failures\\" that allowed both Bin Laden to escape detection, and the United States to perpetrate \\"an act of war\\".      Moreover, through the testimony of Bin Laden's family members, intelligence officials and the wife of one of his couriers, the Commission was able to piece together a richly detailed image of Bin Laden's life on the run from authorities, including details on the secluded life that he and his family led in Abbottabad and elsewhere.      It found that Bin Laden entered Pakistan in mid-2002, after narrowly escaping capture in the Battle of Tora Bora in Afghanistan in December 2001. Intelligence officials say he stayed briefly in the South Waziristan and Bajaur tribal areas of Pakistan, before moving to the northern Swat Valley to stay with his guards, Ibrahim and Abrar al-Kuwaiti, for several months.      While in Swat, Bin Laden reportedly met with Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks against the United States, in early 2003. A month later, Mohammad was captured in Rawalpindi in a joint US-Pakistani operation, and Bin Laden fled Swat.      Bin Laden turned up next in the town of Haripur, in northern Pakistan, where he stayed for two years in a rented house with two of his wives and several of his children and grandchildren.      In August 2005, they all moved to a custom-built compound in Abbottabad, a military garrison town located about 85km away from the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. He stayed there for six years, until he was killed in the US operation in May 2011.      'Culpable negligence'      According to the Commission's investigations, Pakistan's intelligence establishment had \\"closed the book\\" on Bin Laden by 2005, and was no longer actively pursuing intelligence that could lead to his capture.      This [was] a case of nothing less than a collective and sustained dereliction of duty by the political, military and intelligence leadership of the country. Abbottabad Commission report      Moreover, it found that there had been a complete collapse of governance and law enforcement - a situation it termed \\"Government Implosion Syndrome\\", both in the lack of intelligence on Bin Laden's nine-year residence in Pakistan, and in the response to the US raid that killed him. It finds that \\"culpable negligence and incompetence at almost all levels of government can more or less be conclusively established\\".      On the presence of a CIA support network to help track down Bin Laden in Pakistan without the Pakistani establishment’s knowledge, the Commission determined that \\"this [was] a case of nothing less than a collective and sustained dereliction of duty by the political, military and intelligence leadership of the country\\".      It also found that the US violation of Pakistani sovereignty, in carrying out the raid unilaterally, had been allowed to happen due to inaccurate and outdated threat assessment within the country’s defence and strategic policy establishments.      \\"It is official or unofficial defence policy not to attempt to defend the country if threatened or even attacked by a military superpower like the US?\\" the Commission asked of several top military officers.      Military officers, including the chief of the country's air force, testified that Pakistan's low-level radar was on \\"peacetime deployment\\", and hence not active on the border with Afghanistan, when the raid occurred.      The report concludes that unless there are major changes to Pakistan's defence strategy, it remains vulnerable to a repeat of such an airborne raid.      The Commission found that the country's \\"political, military intelligence and bureaucratic leadership cannot be absolved of their responsibility for the state of governance, policy planning and policy implementation that eventually rendered this national failure almost inevitable\\", and calls on key national leaders to formally apologise to the country for \\"their dereliction of duty\\".      Perhaps aware of the implications of its findings, the Commission noted that it had \\"apprehensions that the Commission's report would be ignored, or even suppressed\\", and urged the government to release it to the public.      It did not do so. The report was buried by the government and never released.      Al Jazeera's Investigative Unit obtained a copy of the Commission's report, and has now released it, in full, along with accompanying coverage to help unpick the details, and implications of its findings.      Al Jazeera has received credible reports that its domain (www.aljazeera.com) was blocked for users in Pakistan shortly after it released the Bin Laden Files at 15:00 GMT.

Record numbers of accidents are being caused by drivers illegally speaking or texting on hand-held mobile phones. Crashes in which mobiles have been a contributory factor have soared by 21 per cent in just three years. In the year to 2013 alone, fatalities in which mobiles played a part rose by five – from 17 to 22, an increase of nearly a third (29.4 per cent). Record numbers of accidents are being caused by drivers illegally speaking or texting on hand-held mobile phones (file picture) Accidents involving mobiles rose from 378 in 2012 to a high of 422 last year – up 11.6 per cent. The rise bucks the trend of a drop in the overall accident rate, prompting demands from the RAC for a crackdown on texting or making hand-held calls at the wheel. RAC chief engineer David Bizley said the trend of rising numbers of accidents involving mobile phones being used at the wheel will only be reversed when it becomes ‘as unacceptable as drink-driving’. He said: ‘We are ... calling on the police to enforce the current laws on the use of hand-held phones while driving more effectively. ‘This must be supported by a high-profile, government-funded road safety campaign that makes using a hand-held mobile phone at the wheel as socially unacceptable as drink driving. Mr Bizley said: ‘A report by the Transport Research Laboratory in June this year demonstrated that talking on a hand-held phone while driving causes a 46 per cent reduction in reaction speeds, compared to 13 per cent for drivers drinking to the legal limit. This is extremely compelling and puts into perspective the dangers of using a phone while driving.’ He added: ‘We feel there is currently a high level of acceptability which is something both this government, and the next administration that takes over in May 2015, needs to address as a matter of urgency if we are to prevent the number of accidents continuing to rise.’ Motorists caught using a mobile behind the wheel can be punished with three penalty points and a £100 fine. The figures come from the Department for Transport’s analysis of contributing factors to accidents. The number where a mobile was used by the driver rose from 349 in 2010 to 422 in 2013 – up 21 per cent. The RAC Report on Motoring 2014 found that more than a third (34 per cent) of drivers say they worry about other motorists being distracted by their hand-held mobile phones while behind the wheel. Their report also found three quarters  of motorists report regularly observing other people chatting on their hand-held mobile phones while driving. However, just eight per cent of motorists admit to doing it themselves, says the RAC report: ‘This suggests that the underlying issue is the social acceptability of using a mobile phone at the wheel’. Using a hand-held mobile at the wheel has been illegal for a decade and is punishable with three penalty points and a £100 fine. Ministers say they are considering increasing penalties further.

Translate to English","output":"We need to consider how we can design the controls and regulations in this area in such a way that the protection of citizens is also guaranteed. In order to develop comprehensive and effective controls and regulations that ensure the protection of citizens, there are several key factors to take into consideration: 1. Thoroughly understand the area of concern: It's crucial to gain a deep understanding of the specific area or industry that the regulations and controls are being designed for. This includes being familiar with the potential risks and opportunities, the stakeholders involved, and the overall workings of the sector. 2. Develop a clear set of objectives: The legislation should have specific goals that it aims to achieve, such as promoting transparency, ensuring public safety, or protecting the environment. By clearly defining the objectives, the regulatory framework will be more focused and efficient in achieving desired outcomes. 3. Engage with stakeholders: Engaging with all relevant stakeholders, including citizens, businesses, and governmental agencies, is key to developing well-informed regulations. This collaborative approach allows for diverse perspectives to be taken into account, which generally results in more effective and comprehensive legislation. 4. Ensure flexibility: As technologies and industries evolve, it's important that the regulatory framework can adapt and remain relevant. Flexibility can be built into the regulations by allowing for periodic reviews or including provisions for future adjustments, should the need arise. 5. Promote transparency: Regulations should be transparent in order to build public trust and ensure compliance. This can be achieved by effectively communicating the legislation to the public, making the rationale behind the regulation clear, and providing guidance on how to comply with the rules. 6. Establish monitoring and enforcement mechanisms: In order to ensure that the regulations are being followed and the protection of citizens is being upheld, it's important to have robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms in place. This may involve regular inspections, audits, or reporting requirements, as well as clear consequences for non-compliance. 7. Continually assess and improve: Lastly, it's imperative to continually evaluate the effectiveness of the regulatory framework in achieving its objectives. This allows for potential issues to be addressed and improvements to be made, ensuring that the protection of citizens remains at the forefront of the regulations. In conclusion, designing controls and regulations that effectively protect citizens involves a comprehensive and collaborative approach that takes into account the goals of the legislation, the input of stakeholders, and the evolving nature of the industry. By focusing on these factors, we can create a regulatory framework that promotes safety, transparency, and overall wellbeing for all citizens."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Lawyer Dolores Troiani, who represented accuser Andrea Constand, walks outside the Montgomery County Courthouse after Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial, Saturday, June 17, 2017, in Norristown, Pa. Cosby's... (Associated Press)      NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Bill Cosby, the comedian once known as \\"America's Dad\\" for his TV role as paternal Dr. Cliff Huxtable, is declaring victory this Father's Day after a jury deliberated 52 hours without reaching consensus on charges he drugged and molested a woman in 2004.      No one from Cosby's real or TV families was in court Saturday when the case ended in a mistrial. Instead, Cosby emerged from the courthouse with his publicity team, which read a statement from his wife that accused the judge likely to retry him of arrogance and collusion with prosecutors.      District Attorney Kevin Steele vowed to try the 79-year-old Cosby a second time, saying accuser Andrea Constand supported the decision.      \\"She has shown such courage through this, and we are in awe of what she has done,\\" Steele said. \\"She's entitled to a verdict in this case.\\"      Cosby's team declared victory, however temporary.      By sowing doubt among one or more jurors, Cosby's lawyers managed to overcome two years of unrelenting bad publicity for their client after the public release of his damaging testimony about drugs and sex, as well as a barrage of accusations from 60 women who came forward to accuse him of sexual assault.      Constand, now 44, told jurors Cosby gave her pills that made her woozy and then penetrated her with his fingers as she lay paralyzed on a couch, unable to tell him to stop. The 2004 encounter at Cosby's suburban Philadelphia estate was the only one to result in criminal charges.      Constand, who worked at Cosby's alma mater, Temple University, is ready to go to trial again.      \\"She's a very spiritual woman, she believes things happen for a purpose, and I think the purpose is ... it should encourage other women to come forward and have their day in court,\\" said her lawyer, Dolores Troiani.      Troiani acknowledged the difficulty of the case, given the passage of time and the impact of the alleged drugging on Constand's ability to recall details.      The jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on any of the three counts against the comedian, ending the trial without a verdict after a long week of deliberations.      Cosby's team immediately went on the attack.      Camille Cosby, the entertainer's wife of 53 years, slammed prosecutors for bringing the case to court, calling Steele \\"heinously and exploitively ambitious.\\" She also criticized the judge, the accuser's lawyers and the media.      \\"How do I describe the judge? Overtly arrogant, collaborating with the district attorney,\\" she said in her statement, which was tweeted by her husband and read by an associate of the public relations firm representing Cosby.      Cosby himself didn't comment.      He remained stoic as the judge declared a mistrial, but his spokesman Andrew Wyatt declared the star's \\"power is back. It has been restored.\\"      That seemed debatable.      Cosby's career and good-guy image were already in tatters by the time his chief accuser took the witness stand, and the prosecution's decision to pursue a second trial keeps him in legal limbo.      Cosby had broken barriers as the first black actor to star in a network show, \\"I Spy,\\" in the 1960s and, two decades later, created the top-ranked \\"Cosby Show.\\" He also found success with his \\"Fat Albert\\" animated TV show and starred in commercials for Jell-O pudding.      But it was Cosby's reputation as a public moralist who urged young people to pull up their saggy pants and start acting responsibly that prompted a federal judge to unseal portions of an explosive deposition he gave more than a decade ago as part of Constand's civil lawsuit against him.      Under questioning from her lawyer, Cosby acknowledged that he had obtained several prescriptions for quaaludes in the 1970s for the purpose of offering the powerful sedative to women he wanted to have sex with.      Cosby also said he gave Constand three half-tablets of the cold and allergy medicine Benadryl to help her relax before what he insisted was a consensual sexual encounter at his home. Prosecutors suggested he drugged her with something stronger.      The jurors clearly struggled with their verdict, telling Judge Steven O'Neill on Thursday they were at impasse. O'Neill instructed them to keep working toward a unanimous decision. On Saturday, they came back and told him they were hopelessly deadlocked.      The judge sought to comfort the jurors, at least one of whom fought back tears, calling their epic deliberation \\"one of the more courageous acts, one of the more selfless acts that I've seen in the justice system. ... I feel bad for all of you, I really do.\\"      He reminded prosecutors and the defense that \\"a mistrial is neither vindication nor victory for anybody.\\"      It wasn't immediately known how many jurors wanted to convict and how many wanted to acquit. None of the jurors commented after the trial ended and they headed home to the Pittsburgh area, some 300 miles (480 kilometers) from the courthouse outside Philadelphia.      Former federal prosecutor David Weinstein said Cosby's celebrity almost certainly played a role in the jury's deliberations, perhaps to convince \\"two or three jurors that it's impossible to convict Dr. Huxtable, to convict Fat Albert ... that he couldn't have done this horrible thing.\\"      ___      The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission. Constand has done so.      ___      For more on Cosby, including trial updates, historical photos, videos and an audio series exploring the case, visit http://www.apnews.com/tag/CosbyonTrial. ||||| Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter      NORRISTOWN, Pa. (CBSMiami/AP) — Although Bill Cosby’s sexual assault case in Pennsylvania ended in a mistrial, the comedian’s civil lawyers still are fighting lawsuits against him by 10 women around the country.      Currently, seven women have defamation suits pending in Massachusetts, while three more have defamation or sexual battery suits pending in California. Cosby has denied any wrongdoing.      The criminal case against Cosby partly stems from the accuser’s related lawsuit. Prosecutors reopened a criminal investigation and filed charges in 2015 after Cosby’s deposition in the woman’s 2005 lawsuit was unsealed, and they realized the 12-year statute of limitations for felony sexual assault had not yet expired.      A recap of the pending civil cases:      CALIFORNIA      Cosby is being sued in Los Angeles by Judy Huth, who accuses the comedian of forcing her to perform a sex act on him in a bedroom of the Playboy Mansion around 1974, when she was 15. A trial date may be set later this month for the sexual battery case. Cosby has given a sealed deposition in the case. Huth’s lawyer, Gloria Allred, says the scheduling of a second deposition was on hold because of the criminal trial.      Chloe Goins, a former model who claims Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008, is also suing the comedian on sexual battery and other claims. Prosecutors rejected filing a case against Cosby based on Goins’ allegations, which they said investigators could not corroborate. A judge recently denied Cosby’s motion to dismiss the case, and a trial has been scheduled for June 2018.      The comedian also faces a defamation lawsuit by model Janice Dickinson, who claims Cosby drugged and raped her in Lake Tahoe, California, in 1982. Cosby is appealing a ruling allowing Dickinson’s case to proceed.      MASSACHUSETTS      Seven women are suing Cosby for defamation in separate lawsuits pending in Massachusetts, where Cosby has a home in Shelburne Falls. They say he sexually abused them decades ago and then defamed them after they went public by having his agents deny the claims and brand them liars.      An eighth woman withdrew her lawsuit. And a federal judge dismissed a ninth accuser’s case, finding her complaint inadequate.      The remaining plaintiffs are Tamara Green, Therese Serignese, Linda Traitz, Louisa Moritz, Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis and Angela Leslie. Cosby is seeking to have their cases dismissed. Serignese and Bowman attended the criminal trial near Philadelphia.      (TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

Concurrently, David is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck. In 1965, a young Mossad agent Rachel Singer on her first field assignment arrives in East Berlin to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz and Stefan Gold. Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel—infamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War II—and bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as a married couple from Argentina and Rachel becomes a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. At a doctor appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in an ambulance. They attempt to leave by train, but Vogel awakens and sounds the horn of the van where he is being held, alerting guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to save the compromised Rachel. The agents have no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction., what would be the answer ?

I had the #1 (Steak and Cheese Whiz) and it was delicious. I got fries and a drink as well and my total came out to ~10. The portions are quite large and they give you a hefty serving of meat in the sandwich.   Be careful when eating because these sandwiches are literally dripping with cheese.

At what point exactly does a good movie go bad? When does a movie go from \\"watchable\\" to \\"where's that &^@_+#!* OFF switch\\"? Thank goodness for DVDs, like this one, that can be borrowed from the library - for free! Likewise, thank goodness for the \\"fast forward\\" switch on the DVD player.

At one point (I've forgotten exactly when because now it's all just a blur), our \\"hero,\\" Luke Wilson starts running through traffic; I think he was looking for a cab. It was at that point when I gave up, realizing I couldn't care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck. The last time the movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson climbs out of the dumpster, hair dryer in hand, and first meets the \\"heroine,\\" Uma Thurman. That scene ended with the purse-snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far, far above the departing Luke and Uma.

Movie title: Vantage Point Movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising? In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself. Want to know how often the exercisers experienced “adverse events”? (Hint: often!) Wondering just what the structured exercise program involved? (Hint: more than walking!) Let’s dig into the details! At the end of this post, I’ll share my list of key take-home points for older adults and family caregivers. Who were the study volunteers? Whenever you read about a research study, it’s important to understand how the study volunteers compare to the older adults in *your* life. One of... When the LIFE study was over, who walked better?

The passage primarily focuses on the physical sensations experienced by Kyra, and her actions that imply she was feeling hungry. It mentions that she ate all of the food on her plate and drank a couple of sodas. Although her actions could suggest that she needed to replenish her energy, there is no explicit information about her blood sugar levels. However, we can infer some possibilities based on her mentioned behavior. Blood sugar levels can affect our hunger and energy levels; when they get too low, we might feel hungry, faint, or even have difficulty concentrating. Kyra's state of being famished might suggest that her blood sugar level could be low. On the other hand, eating a lot of food and consuming sodas, especially if they contain sugar, could cause her blood sugar levels to increase, which might suggest an average or even high level. In conclusion, although the passage doesn't provide enough information to accurately determine the narrator's blood sugar level, we can infer that it could be anything between low, average, or high, based on the context presented.

In the decades preceding World War I, this stretch of coast became famous for its wildfowling; locals were looking for food, but some more affluent visitors hunted to collect rare birds; Norfolk's first barred warbler was shot on the point in 1884. In 1901, the Blakeney and Cley Wild Bird Protection Society created a bird sanctuary and appointed as its \\"watcher\\", Bob Pinchen, the first of only six men, up to 2012, to hold that post.In 1910, the owner of the Point, Augustus Cholmondeley Gough-Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe, leased the land to University College London (UCL), who also purchased the Old Lifeboat House at the end of the spit. When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility of development. In 1912, a public appeal initiated by Charles Rothschild and organised by UCL Professor Francis Wall Oliver and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust. UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913, where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point. The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre. Despite formal protection, the tern colony was not fenced off until the 1960s.The Point was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1954, along with the adjacent Cley Marshes reserve, and subsumed into the newly created 7,700-hectare (19,000-acre) North Norfolk Coast SSSI in 1986. The larger area is now additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, IUCN category IV (habitat/species management area) and is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Article: If you remove the things that make it easy for you to start smoking again, you might be less likely to give in to your cravings. Here's what you should do:  Get rid of any lighters, matches, roach clips, bongs, or containers. Empty out all of your pockets to make sure you didn't miss anything. Flush any remaining weed down the toilet, so you can't simply dig it out of the trash later. Destroy all of your supplies. Or, if you can't render them useless, throw them into a disgusting dumpster so you're not tempted to climb in and get them. (You might want to wrap them in a discreet trash bag first, though.) Get rid of anything that even makes you want to smoke pot, whether it's your favorite video game or a poster in your room. This may sound extreme, but removing your triggers can help you beat your habit. If you have a dealer, take his number and other contact information out of your phone. Tell trustworthy friends and family members what you're doing, and ask for their support in quitting. You'll probably find that they're thrilled to see you quit and support you however they can.  This is especially important if you want to remain close to people who are active smokers. Tell them that you're not trying to get them to quit, but you'd appreciate it if they don't pressure you into using. If you get no support from anyone or if they try to get you to \\"join in\\", consider whether that person really belongs in your life if he/she can't respect your choices and requests. You may even have to avoid the friends that you smoke with for a while. If your entire social life with your friends consisted of getting high together, then you'll have to find a new social network. This may sound harsh, but that's the way it goes. The good news is it's temporary: marijuana withdrawal begins 1 day after you quit cold turkey, hits a peak after 2 or 3 days, and eventually levels off after 1 or 2 weeks. You might not experience any or all of them, but it's important to have a plan in place for what you'll do about them instead of going back to pot. The bad news is, there are symptoms. Here are some of the symptoms you may experience:   Sleeplessness: Try to avoid caffeine for the first few days, and hit the hay as soon as you're tired in the evening. Decreased appetite: You might feel nauseated at first.  Try to eat bland foods that are easy on the stomach, such as bananas, rice, toast, oatmeal and apples.  Irritability: As you experience the mood swings that accompany withdrawal, you might find yourself quick to anger or prone to crying. Plan for these ahead of time, and when they happen try to take a step back and acknowledge what's happening. Tell yourself, \\"This isn't me, and this isn't the situation.  It's the withdrawal.\\"  Repeat it as often as you need to.  Anxiety: Feeling on-edge or generally out of sorts is a common symptom of withdrawal that can come with quitting any drug.  When you have a spare minute, close your eyes, breathe deeply, and remember that withdrawal is only temporary. Increased body temperature: you may feel hotter than normal and may start sweating from time to time. Instead of using, devote your new free time to a hobby or sport.  Try to make it something you can do as quickly and easily as lighting up — such as playing guitar or going for a run — and turn to it whenever you're tempted. If you're feeling too bored or depressed to do this, watch a movie that makes you smile or spend some time with a good friend who is not a user. Here are some other things to try:  Taking long walks Talking to an old friend on the phone Swimming Cooking Reading. For example, newspapers, light novels, comic books, adventure stories, juicy biographies. In addition to finding a new hobby, you should switch up your routine so that you don't start missing pot so badly during the time that you usually spent getting high. Here are some things you can do:  Change your morning routine. Try getting up a little earlier or later, having something different for breakfast, or showering at a different time. Change your work or school routine. Go to work or school by a different route, sit in a different seat if you can, and eat something different for lunch. Change your study routine. If you normally study in your bedroom (which leads to smoking pot), mix it up and study at a coffee shop or a library. Don't start eating less just to change up your routine, though. You may find that you're less hungry, but you should try to eat the same amount to stay healthy. You will have an urge, or a craving to smoke, pretty often, and it's important to know how to react to these if you really want to quit. Here are some things you can do to avoid giving in to the craving for pot:  Avoid your trigger locations. Don't go to the places that make you want to smoke, whether its your friend's basement or the sop under your high school bleachers. Flee the scene. Wherever you find yourself when you get an urge, get out as soon as you can. Changing your environment as quickly as you can is your best bet. Breathe deeply. Take a deep breath through your mouth and hold the air in your lungs for 5-7 seconds until you feel more calm. Breathe it out through puckered lips, and repeat these steps until the feeling passes. Put something else in your mouth. Finding a substitute for your craving -- as long as it's not alcohol or another drug -- can help curb it. Try sugarless gum, sugarless candy, a diet drink, toothpicks, a pen or pencil, or even a straw. Drink water. Staying hydrated will keep you healthy and will help you battle your urges. The worst of the withdrawal should be over in a week or two, and we've all heard that saying about how it takes three weeks to make or break a habit.  By the time a month's passed, urges should be much less frequent. It might seem like an eternity while you're dealing with it, but try to remember that it's not that long. Plan a small celebration a month from your quit date. Having a milestone to look forward to can help you stay on-track, and you can use it as an excuse for a small reward like a night out or a present to yourself. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: To quit smoking marijuana, start by removing all triggers and items associated with smoking, such as lighters, bongs, and posters. Inform trustworthy friends and family of your plan to quit, and ask for their support. Anticipate withdrawal symptoms like sleeplessness, decreased appetite, irritability, and anxiety, and have a plan in place to cope with them. Find new hobbies and activities to fill the time you used to spend smoking, and change your routine to minimize cravings. When cravings do occur, try deep breathing, avoiding trigger locations, or using an oral substitute like gum or a straw. Remember that withdrawal symptoms should lessen after a few weeks, and plan a small celebration a month after quitting to mark your progress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Its gravitational center is located somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. The Local Group covers a diameter of (about 10 meters) and has a binary (dumbbell) distribution. The group itself is a part of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which in turn may be a part of the Laniakea Supercluster.  - The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth. It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda.  - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant.  - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names.  - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.  - A dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is a term in astronomy applied to low luminosity galaxies that are companions to the Milky Way and to the similar systems that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). While similar to dwarf elliptical galaxies in appearance and properties such as little to no gas or dust or recent star formation, they are approximately spheroidal in shape, generally lower luminosity, and are recognized only as satellite galaxies in the Local Group.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth.

Andromeda V was discovered by Armandroff et al . and published in 1998 after their analysis of the digitized version of the second Palomar Sky Survey . The metallicity of Andromeda V is above the average metallicity to luminosity ratio of the Local Group 's dwarf galaxies .  - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy  a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.

Premise: \\"So in the real economy, as in the parable, productivity growth in one sector seems to have led to job gains in the other.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Jobs can be created by gains in another economic sector.\\" true?","output":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"Jobs can be created by gains in another economic sector,\\" based on the provided premise, let us examine the information and reasoning step by step. Step 1: Understand the Premise The premise states that \\"in the real economy, as in the parable, productivity growth in one sector seems to have led to job gains in the other.\\" This suggests that an increase in productivity in one economic sector may result in the creation of job opportunities in another sector. Step 2: Relate the Premise to the Hypothesis The premise offers an example of a situation in which an increase in productivity in one sector seems to have resulted in job gains in another sector. Therefore, it provides evidence that supports the idea behind the hypothesis. Step 3: Analyze Context and Assumptions While the premise provides evidence supporting the idea that jobs can be created by gains in another economic sector, it is also important to acknowledge potential assumptions and context. For example, the premise may imply a correlation between productivity growth and job gains, but it does not necessarily prove causation. It may be possible that other factors or a series of events contribute to job creation in different sectors. Step 4: Conclusion Based on the premise, it appears that the hypothesis \\"Jobs can be created by gains in another economic sector\\" is likely to be true. The premise demonstrates that productivity growth in one sector can lead to job gains in another sector, which supports the hypothesis. However, as mentioned earlier, it is important to consider potential assumptions and the context in which the premise is set to ensure a more accurate evaluation of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The key to staying warm while maintaining your fashion sense is the art of layering. This article will provide guidance on how to incorporate various fabrics and garments to create a cozy and stylish ensemble for any occasion. Step 1: Set the foundation with a reliable base layer Your base layer is the foundation of your winter wardrobe. It should consist of lightweight fabrics that are moisture-wicking and provide insulation. Materials like polyester, silk, or wool can help to regulate your body temperature while keeping you warm. Step 2: Choose the right shirt to top your base layer Once you have your base layer, it's time to choose a shirt that can be easily removed, allowing you to adjust your body temperature as needed. Opt for fabrics, such as fleece, wool, or flannel, that can help you stay warm. A stylish option is to incorporate plaid flannel shirts, which can be dressed up or down and serve as a versatile choice for work and other social settings.  Step 3: Go for heavyweight pants for extra warmth To keep your legs warm, go for heavy pants like jeans or corduroys. Both can provide insulation while being fashionable. Pairing your shirt with dark-wash jeans or colored corduroys creates a stylish look, suitable for a casual outing or a day at the office. Step 4: Add a layer to your top half with a sweatshirt or cardigan Throw on a sweatshirt over your shirt for a laid-back, casual vibe. Hoodies or crewneck sweatshirts in neutral or earthy tones can complement various outfit combinations and keep you warm and comfortable.  For a more polished look, wear a cardigan over your shirt. Cardigans are a lightweight layering option that can be perfect for work or school. You can choose from a variety of styles, materials, and patterns, ensuring that you keep your professional demeanor while staying warm. Step 5: Embrace the warmth and femininity of a dress To create a warm and feminine look, consider wearing a dress layered over your base layer.

Pairing the dress with tights or leggings and knee-high boots can complete your chic and cozy winter ensemble. Conclusion Layering is the key to surviving and thriving during the winter months.

Artist: As an artist, Nezha Chekrouni could be a painter, musician, actor, dancer, or any other individual involved in creative or performing arts. In this context, the named individual would be known for their unique talents and artistic contributions. For example, famous artists include Frida Kahlo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Ludwig van Beethoven. 2.

Athletes usually perform individually or as part of a team, with a focus on improving their skills, setting records, and winning competitions. Famous athletes include Usain Bolt, Serena Williams, and Lionel Messi. 3. Office Holder: In the context of an office holder, Nezha Chekrouni would be an individual who holds a position of authority or responsibility within a government or organization.

My arts education at Pratt Institute has helped me develop a firm foundation in the arts.The courses I have completed at Pratt,along with my study abroad in Paris,has prepared me well for a position in arts education.I have always enjoyed a passion for the arts but my undergraduate  education has taken my interest to a whole new level.I not only enjoy doing art but I find myself even more enthusiastic when I have the opportunity to teach what I have learned. For the past two summers I have worked directly with children at CityArts.These experiences were amazing since my responsibilities included planning and directing major projects that were planned for the summer program that goes on each year for local children interested in the arts.I was given a concept at the beginning of each summer and I had complete control of how the projects were to be completed.The children were the creative force and often were the inspiration for the artwork that was eventually presented to the public.

Proper nouns: Names of people, places, nationalities, and languages need to be capitalized. 3. Titles of works or names of institutions: Titles of books, movies, albums, different organization and institution names, need to be capitalized. 4. First-person singular pronoun ‘I’: It's always capitalized, no matter where it's located within a sentence. 5.

Since the 1960s, a common trend in science studies (the study of the sociology and history of science) has been to emphasize the \\"human component\\" of scientific knowledge, and to de-emphasize the view that scientific data are self-evident, value-free, and context-free. The field of Science and Technology Studies, an area that overlaps and often informs historical studies of science, focuses on the social context of science in both contemporary and historical periods. What was the most popular method in the 1960s regarding science studies?","output":"According to the text, the most popular method in the 1960s regarding science studies was to emphasize the \\"human component\\" of scientific knowledge. This amounted to focusing on the role and impact of human involvement in the production and construction of scientific understanding. This method also involved a de-emphasis on the view that scientific data are self-evident, value-free, and context-free."},{"instruction":"Options are: A. get to the movie. B. get a new GPS.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what may change the structure of a nucleotide?\\" is \\"adding heat\\", given that  mutagenic chemicals may change the structure of a nucleotide? Choose your answer from:  (a). Yes.  (b). No. Answer:","output":"(b). No. Adding heat alone may not necessarily change the structure of a nucleotide. While heat can cause DNA denaturation, this process typically separates the two strands of the DNA double helix without changing the individual nucleotide structure. Mutagenic chemicals, on the other hand, can alter the structure of a nucleotide directly, which may lead to mutations. It is essential to emphasize that nucleotide changes can occur due to various factors such as chemical mutagens, radiation, errors during DNA replication, and repair processes. Hence, while adding heat might alter the DNA structure, it is not a definitive cause for a direct change in the nucleotide structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How did he feel when he saw her ?","output":"The article does not provide explicit details on how he felt when he saw her pointing a gun with a laser pointer at his chest. However, it is reasonable to infer that he was perhaps alarmed, frightened, or shocked. Seeing someone pointing a gun at oneself, even if it later turns out to be filled with BBs instead of bullets, is a threatening and dangerous situation that can evoke a strong fear response. From a psychological perspective, events like these usually evoke the body's fight-or-flight response. This is our body's primal, automatic, inbuilt response that prepares the body to fight or flee from perceived harm or threat to survival. Given that the man chose to \\"flee the premises,\\" we might deduce that his initial reaction was one of intense fear, leading him to choose flight over fight for his survival. Moreover, the fact that he ran away from the premises suggests he perceived the threat as genuine. He may have experienced immediate stress, possibly accompanied by a surge of adrenaline leading to increased heart rate, rapid breathing, and heightened senses - all physiological changes aimed at preserving his life by either preparing him to confront the danger or escape from it.  Beyond fear and stress, he might also have felt confusion or disbelief, especially if he had no expectation or inkling of this threat, making the situation an unexpected and shocking encounter.   However, it's essential to note that without explicit descriptions of his feelings or reactions from the article, any assumptions about his emotions are purely an educated guess based on typical human responses to threatening situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Severin Bijelić (10 February 1921 – 28 July 1972) was a Serbian actor. He appeared in 77 films and television shows between 1949 and 1972. He starred in the 1967 film \\"The Rats Woke Up\\", which won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival. Hypothesis: Severin Bijelić died in 2018.","output":"No, we can't draw that hypothesis from the given context.  The context clearly states that Severin Bijelić, a Serbian actor, was born on 10 February 1921 and died on 28 July 1972. Therefore, it is factually incorrect to hypothesize that Bijelić died in 2018 based on the presented information. He was active in his career as an actor from 1949 until his death in 1972, appearing in 77 films and television shows, a fact emphasising his prolific work in the acting industry. The context also highlights one of his notable works, the 1967 film \\"The Rats Woke Up\\", for which the director won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival. This draws attention to the quality of Severin Bijelić's films and his contribution to successful projects. Yet, it does not provide any basis to make a hypothesis related to his death occurring in 2018. Moreover, a hypothesis usually involves some level of uncertainty or is based on a series of deductions or assumptions. In this case, the date of Severin Bijelić's death is a concrete fact directly provided in the context, leaving no room for alternate hypotheses based on the same fact. Therefore, based on the given context, the proposed hypothesis of Severin Bijelić dying in 2018 is incorrect. Instead, the valid assertion or fact is that he died on 28 July 1972.

Ann Moore introduced the idea of a baby carrier to American people nearly 50 years ago. Ann spent two years in Africa in the early 1960s. She worked as a nurse there. Ann saw babies wrapped in bright cloth tied to their mothers' backs. The babies snuggled   close to their mothers, and the mothers could use their hands to do other things. In 1964, Ann had her own baby. She tried making a carrier like the one African mothers used. The carrier was like a backpack. Everywhere Ann went with her baby in the carrier, people asked, \\"Where can I buy one?\\" In 1965, Ann and her mother began to sell handmade carriers. Ann received a patent   for the baby carrier in 1969. By that time, the baby carrier had leg holes and straps   that could be made longer or shorter. It could also be worn on the back or front. By 1979, the baby carriers were made in a factory. These baby carriers cost less to make and more than 25,000 were sold every month. When Ann made her first baby carrier, she just wanted to keep her baby close and still have her hands free to do other things. Now all over the world babies ride in baby carriers, close to their parents, safe and happy. ,.

The Cowboys grabbed a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tony Romo to wide receiver Dez Bryant, followed by running back DeMarco Murray rushing for a 4-yard touchdown. The latter score occurred after a fumble by Broncos' wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos later got on the scoreboard, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 4-yard shovel pass to tight end Julius Thomas for a touchdown. Early in the second quarter, a 43-yard field goal by placekicker Dan Bailey gave the Cowboys a 17-7 lead. The Broncos then reeled off 21 unanswered points, with Manning adding two more touchdown passes &#8212; a 2-yarder to Decker and a 9-yarder to Thomas, followed by Manning rushing for a 1-yard touchdown on a bootleg play. A 48-yard field goal by Bailey at the end of the first half narrowed the Broncos' lead to 28-20. In the second half, the Broncos added to their lead midway through the third quarter, with Manning connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker. However, the Cowboys subsequently began chipping away at the Broncos' lead, with Romo connecting on an 82-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrance Williams. A 48-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos a 38-27 lead, but the Cowboys further narrowed the Broncos' lead, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Bryant (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt). Following an intercepted Broncos' pass,  the Cowboys subsequently re-claimed the lead early in the fourth quarter, with Romo throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten, coupled with a two-point pass from Romo to Williams. The Broncos tied the game at 41-41 on their next possession, with a 50-yard field goal by Prater.  As the shootout continued, on the Cowboys' next possession, Romo connected on a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cole Beasley to give the Cowboys a 48-41 lead with 7:19 remaining in the fourth quarter. Manning subsequently led the Broncos on a 9-play, 73-yard drive, which culminated with running back Knowshon Moreno rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to tie the game at 48-48 with 2:24 remaining in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Cowboys' next possession, as the Cowboys were attempting a game-winning drive, Romo was intercepted by Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan at the Cowboys' 24-yard line just before the two-minute warning. On the fourth play of the Broncos' final possession, the Broncos were facing a 3rd-and-1 at the Cowboys' 2-yard line, after the Cowboys had exhausted two of their three team timeouts. Moreno earned a crucial first down after Manning implored him to go down before reaching the goal line instead of scoring a touchdown, which forced the Cowboys to burn their final timeout with 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter. After three kneel-downs by Manning, Prater nailed the game-winning 28-yard field goal as time expired. With the narrow loss, the Cowboys moved to 2-3, and dropped to second place in the division.

Please add spaces between words: FordownloadingfullCDandDVDimagestheuseofbittorrentorjigdoisrecommended.","output":"For downloading full CD and DVD images, the use of BitTorrent or Jigdo is recommended. In this provided sentence, a person is recommending to use BitTorrent or Jigdo for downloading full CD and DVD images. Let me break down the sentence and throw some light on the concepts mentioned for better understanding. 1. Downloading full CD and DVD images: CDs and DVDs consist of several data files that might include music tracks, videos, software applications, and operating systems. An image (or ISO) is an exact digital copy of the data originally stored on the CD or DVD. By downloading these images, the user can create a new CD or DVD, with the same contents, or can mount them as virtual drives to access the data without needing a physical disc. 2. BitTorrent: BitTorrent is a widely used peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol. It is designed to distribute large files over the internet effectively. Instead of downloading files from a central server, users download pieces of the file from several sources, which are called \\"peers.\\" As a user downloads the desired file, they become a part of the distribution network and subsequently share their downloaded file parts with other peers, called \\"seeding.\\" Seeding is essential to maintain the health and efficiency of the torrent community. By distributing the load among multiple users, the downloading process becomes faster and more efficient. This method proves to be especially helpful for downloading large files, like those of full CD and DVD images. 3. Jigdo: Jigdo (short for Jigsaw Download) is another powerful tool specially designed to aid in the distribution and download of large files such as CD/DVD images. Unlike BitTorrent, Jigdo downloads a single large file by using several smaller files and a piece-list of those files. The smaller files are usually stored on multiple, widely-distributed web servers. Jigdo client software downloads all the smaller parts and then assembles them coherently to create the final large file. This enhances the overall efficiency for downloading these files and reduces the server load. Jigdo is considered a suitable alternative to BitTorrent. In conclusion, the recommendation to use BitTorrent or Jigdo for downloading full CD and DVD images is based on their efficiency in managing the distribution and download of large files. Using these methods will make the downloading process faster and will also contribute to reducing server load, ensuring a smooth experience for the user."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],z={key:0},D={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
