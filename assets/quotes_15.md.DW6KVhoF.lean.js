We need to prove that the circle forms equal angles with the line at these points of intersection. 2. **Define the points of intersection and draw tangents:**    Let's denote the points of intersection between the circle and the line as (A) and (B). According to the definition of the angle between a line (tangent) and a circle, at each intersection point (A) and (B), draw tangents to the circle. Let these tangents be denoted as line segments (t_A) at (A) and (t_B) at (B). 3. **Utilize the fact about tangents from a common external point:**    Each tangent from a common external point to a circle has equal lengths. This property implies that the lengths of the tangents (t_A) and (t_B) are equal if they are drawn from points (A) and (B), respectively. 4. **Identify the key geometric properties:**    Since (t_A) and (t_B) are tangents to the circle at the points (A) and (B), they form right angles with the radii drawn to the points of tangency. That is,    [    t_A perp OA quad text{and} quad t_B perp OB    ]    where (O) is the center of the circle. 5. **Form an isosceles triangle:**    By considering the segment of the line that intersects the circle as the base, and the points of tangency forming the legs, you create an isosceles triangle. Therefore, since the tangents (t_A) and (t_B) are equal, and radii are equal, the triangles ( triangle OAC) and ( triangle OBC) are isosceles with (OA = OB). 6. **Prove angles at the base of isosceles triangle are equal:**    In (triangle OAC) and (triangle OBC), since they are both isosceles triangles, it follows from the properties of isosceles triangles (base angles are equal) that:    [    angle OAC = angle OBC    ] 7. **Conclude that the angles between the line and the circle are equal:**    Therefore, the angles formed between the line and the tangents at points (A) and (B), (angle t_AA) and (angle t_BB) are equal due to the equal base angles of the isosceles triangles. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Thus, a circle intersecting a line at two points forms equal angles with the line at these points of intersection.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the ellipse dfrac{x^2}{a^2} + dfrac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > b > 0) has an eccentricity of dfrac{1}{2}, and a circle centered at the origin with the ellipse's minor axis as its radius is tangent to the line x  y + sqrt{6} = 0.

The Markov inequality provides an upper bound on the probability of a random variable taking a value not less than a positive number, explaining the relationship between the tail probability of a random variable and its mean. When X is a nonnegative discrete random variable, the proof of the Markov inequality is as follows:   Let the distribution of X be P(X=x_{i})=p_{i}, i=1,2,cdots,n, where {p}_{i}∈(0,+∞), {x}_{i}∈[0,+∞) (i=1,2,⋯,n), sum_{i=1}^{n}{{p}_{i}}=1, then for any varepsilon  gt 0, Pleft(Xgeqslant varepsilon right)=sum_{{x}_{i}≥ε}{{p}_{i}}≤sum_{{x}_{i}≥ε}{frac{{x}_{i}}{ε}{p}_{i}}=frac{1}{ε}sum_{{x}_{i}≥ε}{{x}_{i}{p}_{i}≤frac{1}{ε}sum_{i=1}^{n}{{x}_{i}{p}_{i}=frac{E(X)}{ε}}}, where the symbol sum_{{x}_{i}≥ε}{{A}_{i}} represents the sum of all A_{i} corresponding to the indices i that satisfy x_{i}geqslant varepsilon.

Consider the non-negative discrete random variable left[X-Eleft(Xright)right]^{2} and a positive number varepsilon^{2}. 2. Applying the Markov inequality, we get:    [    P(|X-E(X)|geqvarepsilon) = Pleft(left[X-E(X)right]^{2}geqvarepsilon^{2}right) leq frac{Eleft(left[X-E(X)right]^{2}right)}{varepsilon^{2}}    ] 3. Since Eleft(left[X-E(X)right]^{2}right) = D(X), we have:    [    P(|X-E(X)|geqvarepsilon) leq frac{D(X)}{varepsilon^{2}}    ] 4. Thus, the Chebyshev inequality is proven for a discrete random variable. **Method 2:** 1. Let the distribution of X be P(X=x_{i})=p_{i}, for i=1, 2, cdots, n, where p_{i} > 0, x_{i} geq 0, and sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}=1. 2. Let mu = E(X).

Since the sum over all i where |x_{i}-mu|geqvarepsilon is less than or equal to the sum over all i, we get:    [    frac{1}{varepsilon^{2}}sum_{|x_{i}-mu|geqvarepsilon}(x_{i}-mu)^{2}p_{i} leq frac{1}{varepsilon^{2}}sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-mu)^{2}p_{i} = frac{D(X)}{varepsilon^{2}}    ] 5. Therefore, the Chebyshev inequality holds for a discrete random variable.  Part 2: Application to the Pharmaceutical Company's Claim 1. Let X be the number of patients cured out of 100. Assuming the efficacy rate of 80% is true, X follows a binomial distribution B(100, 0.8). 2. The expected number of patients cured, E(X) = 100 times 0.8 = 80. 3. The variance, D(X) = 100 times 0.8 times (1-0.8) = 16. 4. Applying the Chebyshev inequality to find the probability that the number of patients cured does not exceed 60:    [    P(X leq 60) leq P(|X-80|geq 20) leq frac{D(X)}{20^{2}} = frac{16}{400} = 0.04    ] 5. The probability that no more than 60 patients are cured is at most 0.04. This low probability suggests that the company's claim of an 80% efficacy rate is questionable.

Let ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) be three lines in space, where each pair of lines lies in different planes (skew lines). 2. Choose an arbitrary point ( A ) on line ( a ). 3. Define a plane ( beta ) that passes through point ( A ) and intersects line ( b ). 4. Since lines ( a ) and ( b ) are not parallel and lie in different planes, plane ( beta ) is unique for this choice of line ( b ) through point ( A ). 5. The intersection of plane ( beta ) with line ( c ) is at some point ( C ). The existence of this intersection means that plane ( beta ) can only intersect line ( c ) once unless ( c ) is parallel to ( b ), which is not the case. 6. Hence, there is a unique point ( C ) in the plane ( beta ) that intersects line ( c ) such that the line segment ( AC ) connects point ( A ) on line ( a ) with point ( C ) on line ( c ). 7. Since ( AC ) lies in the plane ( beta ) and intersects both ( a ) and ( c ), the condition ( AC parallel b ) can hold. 8. Consider point ( B ) on line ( b ) where line ( AC ) intersects line ( b ). This ( B ) exists because the plane ( beta ) must intersect line ( b ), given ( b ) is defined in ( beta ). 9. Therefore, the line( AC ) intersects lines ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). 10.

Number 16 can be factorized as 16 = 2^4, and has (4+1)=5 positive divisors: {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}. Each of these pairs is: - (1,16) and (16,1) which give roots (r, s) = (-3, 12) and (12, -3), - (2,8) and (8,2) which give roots (r, s) = (-2, 4) and (4, -2), - (4,4) which gives roots (r,s) = (0,0). Thus, we have 6 unique pairs, and since r+s must be negative or zero (since a should be non-positive), these are ordered pairs.

Testing for simple roots like y=1, we find: 1^3 - 1^2 - 1 + 1 = 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 = 0. Thus, y=1 is a root. This suggests that (y-1) is a factor. Use polynomial division to divide y^3 - y^2 - y + 1 by y-1: y^3 - y^2 - y + 1 = (y-1)(y^2 + 1). Since y^2 + 1 is a basic quadratic that doesn't factor further over the real numbers (it factors into (y+i)(y-i) over the complex numbers), we have: y^3 - y^2 - y + 1 = (y-1)(y^2+1).

Given that the car starts 3 hours after the bus and arrives 20 minutes (or frac{1}{3} hour) later than the bus, we can set up the following equation to represent their travel times: [ frac{80}{x} = frac{80}{3x} + 3 - frac{1}{3} ] Solving this equation step by step: [ begin{align*} frac{80}{x} &= frac{80}{3x} + frac{8}{3} frac{80}{x} - frac{80}{3x} &= frac{8}{3} frac{240 - 80}{3x} &= frac{8}{3} frac{160}{3x} &= frac{8}{3} 160 &= 8x x &= 20 end{align*} ] After solving the equation, we find that x = 20 kilometers per hour, which is a valid solution that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

First, consider the line segments A_1B_1, B_1C_1, and C_1A_1. Since A_1, B_1 and C_1 are the circumcenters of the triangles CAQ, ABQ, and BCQ, these line segments are the perpendicular bisectors of the sides AQ, BQ, and CQ in these smaller triangles. 5. Therefore, the angles of the triangle A_1B_1C_1 will relate to the angles of the triangle ABC. For example, observe:    [    angle B_1 A_1 C_1 = 180^circ - angle AQ C = angle A.    ]    This is because angle AQ C is a complementary angle with angle A_1 B_1 C_1 and angle A in triangle ABC. 6.

If we consider the usual speed of the train to be 1 (full speed), then the reduced speed is 6/7 of that: Reduced speed = 6/7 * usual speed Since the train is moving slower, it will take longer to complete the journey. The time taken at reduced speed is inversely proportional to the speed of the train. So, we can set up a proportion to find the new time taken: Usual time / Reduced time = Reduced speed / Usual speed Substituting the values we have: 89.99999999999996 minutes / Reduced time = (6/7) / 1 Now, let's solve for the Reduced time: Reduced time = 89.99999999999996 minutes * (7/6) Reduced time = 104.99999999999994 minutes The train is late by the difference between the Reduced time and the Usual time: Late time = Reduced time - Usual time Late time = 104.99999999999994 minutes - 89.99999999999996 minutes Late time = 15 minutes So, the train is late by boxed{15}  minutes."},{"instruction":"Let ( S = {1, 2, cdots, 2005} ).

We can construct a set (A_0) such that (A_0 subseteq S) and (|A_0| = 15) with the numbers in (A_0) being squares of distinct primes. Specifically,     [    A_0 = {1, 2^2, 3^2, 5^2, ldots, 41^2, 43^2}    ]    Here, each element in (A_0) is pairwise coprime (since they are squares of distinct primes), but none of them is a prime number. 2. **Implication**:     From the above, we see that if we have only 15 pairwise coprime numbers, we can choose them in such a way that none of them is a prime number. Therefore, we must have (n geq 16). 3. **Proof for (n = 16)**:    Now, we need to show that for any subset (A subseteq S) with (|A| = 16) containing pairwise coprime numbers, there must be at least one prime number in (A).    **Assumption**:    Assume ( A ) contains no prime number. Let ( A = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{16}} ) with ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_{16} ).    **Case 1**: When (1 notin A)    - Since ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{16} ) are all composite numbers and pairwise coprime, each (a_i) must be divisible by at least one distinct prime factor.    - Let ( p_i ) be the smallest prime factor of ( a_i ). Clearly, ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{16} ) would be 16 distinct prime numbers.    - We know that (2 < 3 < 5 < cdots < 47 < 53). Thus,       [      a_1 geq p_1^2 geq 2^2 = 4, quad a_2 geq p_2^2 geq 3^2 = 9, quad ldots, quad a_{15} geq p_{15}^2 geq 47^2 = 2209      ]      This implies (a_{15} > 2005), which is a contradiction since all (a_i in S leq 2005).    **Case 2**: When (1 in A)        - Let (a_{16} = 1) (as 1 is pairwise coprime with all other numbers).    - Then the other 15 numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{15}) would be coprime and composite.    - Following the same logic as in Case 1 and noting that we need 15 distinct primes for these 15 composites:      [      a_1 geq p_1^2 geq 2^2 = 4, quad a_2 geq p_2^2 geq 3^2 = 9, quad ldots, quad a_{14} geq p_{14}^2 geq 43^2 = 1849      ]      Again leading to contradictions, as previously shown.    Since both cases yield a contradiction, our assumption must be false. Thus, any subset (A subseteq S) with 16 pairwise coprime numbers must contain at least one prime number. **Conclusion**: The smallest value (n) such that any subset of (S) with (n) pairwise coprime numbers includes at least one prime number is 16.

The midpoint M of segment AB is Mleft(frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}, frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}right). Since the center of C is at C(-4,a) with radius r = 4, the distance from C to AB should be |CM| = sqrt{16 - 11} = sqrt{5}. Given that there is a unique point P(x,2x) on line l: y = 2x satisfying overrightarrow{PA} + overrightarrow{PB} = overrightarrow{OC}, we can write the following vector equation: (x_{1}-x,y_{1}-2x)+(x_{2}-x,y_{2}-2x)=(-4,a). From the equation, we derive the system of equations: begin{cases} x_{1} + x_{2} - 2x = -4  y_{1} + y_{2} - 4x = a end{cases} This simplifies to: begin{cases} frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} = x - 2  frac{y_{1} + y_{2}}{2} = 2x - frac{a}{2} end{cases} So, the midpoint M is now at M(x-2, 2x - frac{a}{2}).

Upon expanding and rearranging, we get the quadratic equation in terms of x: 5x^{2} + (4 - 2a)x + frac{a^{2}}{4} - 1 = 0. Since there is exactly one such point P on l, the discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation must be zero: (4-2a)^{2} - 20left( frac{a^{2}}{4} - 1right) = 0. Solving this equation gives us two possible values for a: a^{2} + 16a - 36 = 0. The solutions to this quadratic equation are a = 2 or a = -18. Having one point P implies that line l is tangent to the circle at P; thus the line through C that is perpendicular to l goes through P. As the slope of l is 2, and since perpendicular slopes are negative reciprocals, the perpendicular has slope -frac{1}{2}. Since C has coordinates (-4,a), this perpendicular is described by the line through C with slope -frac{1}{2}. The line l: y = 2x being tangent to the circle means that it can touch the circle at only one point. The distance from the center of the circle to l is equal to the radius. We could analyze the two values of a found: - For a = 2, when substituting into the equation of line l, we get y = 2x, and so point C has coordinates (-4, 2); this point is not on line l, thus this value cannot correspond to a tangent from C to l. - For a = -18, the center of circle C is (-4, -18) which means that the line with slope -frac{1}{2} will intersect line l in exactly one point because their slopes are indeed negative reciprocals.

More accurate calculation is needed. 4. **Probability Calculation using Position Stones**:        - Scale the problem:      [      text{River Width} = 1, quad text{Jumplength} = 0.01      ]        - After ( n ) throws, suppose positions are ( 0 < x_1 < x_2 < cdots < x_n < 1 ).        - Probability that we cannot cross the river:      [      P(n) = sum_{i=1}^{infty} (-1)^{i-1} binom{n+1}{i} max(1 - ir, 0)^n      ]        - Expected number of stones:      [      sum_{n=0}^{infty} P(n) = sum_{i=1}^{infty} (-1)^{i-1} sum_{n=0}^{infty} binom{n+1}{i} max(1 - ir, 0)^n      ]            Here, let ( x = max(1 - ir, 0) ):      [      sum_{n=0}^{infty} binom{n+1}{i} x^n = frac{x^{i-1}}{(1 - x)^{i+1}}      ]        - Summing:      [      sum_{i=1}^{lfloor 1/r rfloor} (-1)^{i-1} frac{(1 - ir)^{i-1}}{(ir)^{i+1}}      ] 5. **Final Calculation using Code**:        Code calculates the sum to approximate stones needed:        \`\`\`cpp    #include <bits/stdc++.h>    using namespace std;    typedef long double ld;    int main() {        ld sum = 0, r = 0.01;        for (int i = 1; ; ++i) {            ld x = 1 - r * i;            if (x <= 0) break;            ld ex = pow(x / (1 - x), i - 1) / (1 - x) / (1 - x);            sum = (i & 1) ? sum + ex : sum - ex;        }        cout << fixed << setprecision(8) << sum;    }    \`\`\` 6. **Approximation**:        The executed code yields an expected number of stones:    [    approx 712.811    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{712.811} ]"},{"instruction":"James gets paid a certain amount per mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste.

This implies a central symmetry with respect to ( K ) (the midpoint of ( BB' )). 3. **Consequence of central symmetry**:     - With ( C ) transitioning to ( C'' ) through the rotations, the triangle ( CCC'' ) forms an equilateral triangle because both ( C'' ) and ( C' ) are symmetrically positioned with respect to ( C ) and ( K ). 4. **Analyzing triangle ( KCC' )**:     - Since ( K ) is the midpoint of ( B' B ), and the transformations maintain equal distribution, both ( C' ) and ( C'' ) relate symmetrically by equal distances.     - Thus, triangle ( CC'C'' ) is an equilateral triangle. 5. **Angle calculation**:     - Given ( K ) is the midpoint of ( C' C'' ), the segment ( C K ) is perpendicular to ( C' K ).     - Therefore, the angle ( C' CK ) is ( 30^circ ).

The weight of the non-water content in 25 kg of fresh grapes is: 10% of 25 kg = 0.10 * 25 kg = 2.5 kg This 2.5 kg is the weight of the solids (sugars, fibers, vitamins, minerals, etc.) that will remain after drying the grapes.

Since we are subtracting 1203, we know that the last two digits of the result will be 8 - 3 = 5 and (A - 0) = A. So the result will look like 27A5. Now, let's set up the inequality with the result of the subtraction: 27A5 > 1022 To find the minimum value for A, we need to ensure that 27A5 is just greater than 1022. The thousands digit in 1022 is 1, and in 27A5 it is 2, so we are already greater by at least 1000. We need to find the smallest A such that the number is still greater than 1022. The hundreds digit in 1022 is 0, and in 27A5 it is 7, so no matter what A is, 27A5 will be greater than 1022 because 2700 is already greater than 1022.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Initial Assumptions:**    - Consider a surjective function ( f: mathbf{Z}_{+} to mathbf{Z}_{+} ).    - For any two elements ( x, y in mathbf{Z}_{+} ) such that ( x < y ), the set ( {x, y} ) is not sum-free if and only if ( y = 2x ). 2. **Factor Property:**    - For any ( x in mathbf{Z}_{+} ), we assume:      [      f(2x) = 2f(x)      ]    - This needs to be true for any ( x ) to follow our assumptions.  3. **Functional Form of ( f ):**    - Assume:      [      f(x) = 2^{k}a      ]      where ( a ) is an odd positive integer and ( k in mathbf{Z}_{+} ). We check the validity of this assumption in the context of our problem. 4. **Uniqueness and Surjectivity:**    - Consider any non-negative integer ( i ) and choose ( x_{i} in mathbf{Z}_{+} ) satisfying:      [      f(x_i) = 2^i a      ]      Since ( f ) is surjective, such ( x_i ) must exist for all ( i ). 5. **Sum-free Property Verification:**    - If ( {x_i, x_{i+1}} ) is a sum-free set, then:      [      f({x_i, x_{i+1}}) = {2^i a, 2^{i+1} a}      ]      If ( {x_i, x_{i+1}} ) is not sum-free, there must be elements such that one element is double the other.

Since ( 7^{2^i} - 1 ) is of the form ( (7-1)(7^{2^i-1} + 7^{2^i-2} + cdots + 1) ), and 6 is not of the form ( 4k+3 ), the factorization of ( a_i ) will not include any primes of the form ( 4k+3 ) with an odd exponent.

Hence, there is a contradiction. 4. **Analyzing Leading Terms Coefficient:**    Let's consider the coefficients of the leading terms:    [    x^n equiv g(x)h(x) pmod{4}    ]    Expanding and reducing modulo 4, we have:    [    g(x)h(x) equiv x^r x^{n-r} = x^n pmod{4}     ]    which is consistent, but we need to check the other coefficients as well. 5. **Analyzing Degree:**    Next, compare the coefficient of (x^{r-1}) once we expand ( g(x) h(x) ):    [    g(x) h(x) =  x^n + 2 sum_{k=0}^{n}{(b_k c_{n-1-k})x^{k+n-1-k+1}}  = x^n+ 4 x^{n-1} +cdots    ] 6. **Comparing Non-Leading Terms:**    Simplifying, we realize that for (r = n-r), implies (2r=n):    [    b_1+c_1 equiv 0 pmod{2}    ]    It yields:    [    x^ {r-1} +8(c_{r-1}+b_{r-1})     ] 7. **Checking Coefficients Modulo 8:**    Finally, consider the coefficients of middle terms:    [    4(b_1c_0+c_1b_0) =4 left( b_1+c_1 right) equiv 0 pmod{8}    ]    Thus, this inconsistency in the coefficients shows contradiction here. 8. **Conclusion:**    Since ( P(x) ) cannot be factored in such manner without introducing contradictions, the polynomial:    [    x^n + 4x^{n-1} + 4x^{n-2} + cdots + 4x + 4    ]    is irreducible over the integers.

Since one dollar bills contribute 1x dollars and two dollar bills contribute 2y dollars, we have: [1x + 2y = 66] Now, we solve this system of equations step by step. **Step 1:** Solve the first equation for x: [x = 49 - y] **Step 2:** Substitute x = 49 - y into the second equation: [1(49 - y) + 2y = 66] **Step 3:** Simplify and solve for y: [49 - y + 2y = 66 implies y = 66 - 49 = 17] So, we have found that y, the number of two dollar bills, is 17. **Step 4:** To find the number of one dollar bills (x), substitute y = 17 back into the equation x = 49 - y: [x = 49 - 17] **Step 5:** Calculate x: [x = 32] Therefore, James has boxed{32} one dollar bills in his piggy bank."},{"instruction":"Calculate: 4sin 60^{circ}|1sqrt{3}|+(frac{1}{3})^{1}+sqrt[3]{{27}}.","output":"To solve the given expression step-by-step, we start with the original expression and break it down: [4sin 60^{circ}-|1-sqrt{3}|+left(frac{1}{3}right)^{-1}+sqrt[3]{-27}] First, we calculate each term individually: 1.

To find the new average daily production, we divide the new total production by the new number of days: New average daily production = Total production including today / (n+1) days New average daily production = 495 units / 9 days New average daily production = 55 units/day So, the new average daily production is boxed{55}  units per day."},{"instruction":"The number of distinct ordered pairs (x,y) where x and y have positive integral values satisfying the equation x^4y^4  8x^2y^2 + 12 = 0 is: A) 0 B) 2 C) 3 D) 4","output":"1. **Rewrite the equation**:    ( x^4y^4 - 8x^2y^2 + 12 = 0 ) becomes, with (a = (xy)^2),    [    a^2 - 8a + 12 = 0    ] 2. **Factorize the quadratic equation**:    [    a^2 - 8a + 12 = (a - 6)(a - 2) = 0    ]    Therefore, (a = 6) or (a = 2). 3. **Solve for (xy)**: Given (a = (xy)^2), the solutions are (xy = sqrt{6}), (xy = -sqrt{6}), (xy = sqrt{2}), and (xy = -sqrt{2}).

At this point, the decimal starts repeating because the remainder repeats. Hence, frac{14}{360} = frac{7}{180} = 0.overline{038}. Next, to find the 205th digit, we first determine which digit in the repeating cycle it corresponds to.  - Subtract 1 from 205 to account for the initial zero before the decimal point, which gives 204. - Since the repeating cycle is “038” (3 digits long), compute 204 mod 3.

The cube root of 8x+3y being 5 translates to: [ sqrt[3]{8x+3y} = 5 ] Cubing both sides to remove the cube root gives: [ 8x + 3y = 125 ] Now, we have a system of equations: [ left{ begin{array}{l} 2x + 7y = 35  8x + 3y = 125 end{array} right. ] Solving this system of equations, we proceed as follows: - Multiply the first equation by 4 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal: [ 8x + 28y = 140 ] - Now subtract the second given equation from this new equation to eliminate x: [ (8x + 28y) - (8x + 3y) = 140 - 125 ] [ 25y = 15 ] [ y = frac{15}{25} = frac{3}{5} ] - Substitute y = frac{3}{5} into one of the original equations to find x: [ 2x + 7left(frac{3}{5}right) = 35 ] [ 2x + frac{21}{5} = 35 ] [ 2x = 35 - frac{21}{5} ] [ 2x = frac{175}{5} - frac{21}{5} ] [ 2x = frac{154}{5} ] [ x = frac{77}{5} ] Therefore, we have found: [ x = frac{77}{5}, quad y = frac{3}{5} ] Adding x and y together gives: [ x + y = frac{77}{5} + frac{3}{5} = frac{80}{5} = 16 ] Finally, the square root of x + y is: [ sqrt{x + y} = sqrt{16} = pm 4 ] Hence, the answer is: boxed{pm 4}."},{"instruction":"Show that there exists a number ( a ) such that ( log_{2} x + log_{3} x = log_{a} x ) holds for all positive ( x ).","output":"1. To demonstrate that there is a number ( a ) such that ( log_{2} x + log_{3} x = log_{a} x ) holds for every positive ( x ), we start by applying the change of base formula for logarithms:    [    log_{b} x = frac{log_{c} x}{log_{c} b}    ] 2. Using this change of base formula, we can express ( log_{2} x ) and ( log_{3} x ) in terms of base-10 logarithms (common logarithms):    [    log_{2} x = frac{log_{10} x}{log_{10} 2}    ]    [    log_{3} x = frac{log_{10} x}{log_{10} 3}    ] 3.

Combine the two terms on the right-hand side:    [    frac{log_{10} x}{log_{10} 2} + frac{log_{10} x}{log_{10} 3} = log_{10} x left( frac{1}{log_{10} 2} + frac{1}{log_{10} 3} right)    ] 5. According to the theorem reference, any common logarithmic form of the target equation will not matter, so simplifying further we get:    [    log_{10} x left( frac{1}{log_{10} 2} + frac{1}{log_{10} 3} right) = log_{a} x    ] 6. To resolve for ( a ), coefficient directly correlates logarithmically. So assume equality;    Now consider according to inverse property:    [    frac{1}{log_{10} 2} + frac{1}{log_{10} 3} = frac{1}{log_{10} a}    ]    Taking the reciprocals of both sides:     [    log_{10} a = frac{log_{10} 2 cdot log_{10} 3}{log_{10} 2 + log_{10} 3}    ] 7.

Prove that ( d ) is a multiple of 6.","output":"1. Recall the problem statement: We need to show that if (a, a+d, a+2d) are all prime numbers larger than 3, then (d) is a multiple of 6. 2. **Observation on Prime Numbers Larger than 3**:    - Prime numbers larger than 3 can be represented in the form (6k+1) or (6k+5) (i.e., 1 or 5 modulo 6). This is because any integer (n) can be written as (6k + r) where (r in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}), and only (r = 1) or (r = 5) yields primes larger than 3. 3. **Even Nature of (d)**:    - For (a, a+d, a+2d) to all be primes larger than 3, the difference (d) must be even. If (d) were odd, then two consecutive numbers (a) and (a+d) would differ by an odd number, resulting in one of them being even, which cannot be prime except for 2.    Therefore, (d) is necessarily even. Let (d = 2k) for some integer (k). 4. **Modulo 6 Analysis**:    - Consider the numbers (a, a+d, a+2d). Each of these must fit the form (6m+1) or (6m+5). We have three cases to consider based on the possible forms of (a mod 6). 5. **Case Work**:    - **Case 1**: (a equiv 1 pmod{6})      - If (a equiv 1 pmod{6}), then:        [        a = 6m + 1        ]      - Then (a + d = 6m + 1 + d) should also be a prime number:        [        a + d = 6m + 1 + 2k        ]      - Similarly, (a + 2d = 6m + 1 + 4k) should also be a prime number:        [        a + 2d = 6m + 1 + 4k        ]      - Since both (a+d) and (a+2d) must also be of the form (6n+1) or (6n+5), the shift must preserve these positions in the modulo 6 system.    - **Case 2**: (a equiv 5 pmod{6})      - If (a equiv 5 pmod{6}), then:        [        a = 6m + 5        ]      - Then (a + d = 6m + 5 + 2k) should also be a prime number:        [        a + d = 6m + 5 + 2k        ]      - Similarly, (a + 2d = 6m + 5 + 4k) should also be a prime number:        [        a + 2d = 6m + 5 + 4k        ]      - As in Case 1, the shift must preserve primes fitting the (6k + 1) or (6k + 5) form. 6. **Conclusion**:    - In both cases, for (a + d) and (a + 2d) to remain primes and fit into the necessary forms, (d) must be such that it allows transitions between primes in these modular forms. This leads to the necessity for (d) to be divisible by 6 directly.    - Therefore, (d) must be a multiple of 6 to maintain these conditions across all forms.

The total number of points scored by all participants in the tournament is ( xy + 8 ). This number is equal to the total number of games played in the tournament. 1. The total number of games can also be calculated using combinations, since each participant played a game with every other participant exactly once. Hence, the number of games is given by: [ binom{x+2}{2} = frac{(x+2)(x+1)}{2} ] 2. Therefore, we set up the equation: [ xy + 8 = frac{(x+2)(x+1)}{2} ] 3.

Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving ( y ): [ x^2 + 3x + 2 - 2xy = 16 ] 6. Rearranging further, we obtain: [ x^2 + 3x + 2 - 16 = 2xy ] 7. Simplifying, we get: [ x^2 + 3x - 14 = 2xy ] 8.

We need to demonstrate that if each edge of an octahedron (a polyhedron with 8 faces) is colored arbitrarily in red or green, then there exists a triangular face of the octahedron where all the edges are the same color. 1. **Establish the Fundamentals**: Each vertex of the octahedron represents a person, and each edge represents an acquaintance.  2. **Vertex Degree and Edge Coloring**: Each vertex (person) is connected to every other vertex, leading to 5 edges incident at each vertex. We seek to show that among these edges, at least three edges must have the same color due to the Pigeonhole Principle. 3. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**: By the Pigeonhole Principle, among the 5 edges incident to a vertex, at least 3 must be the same color (say, green). 4. **Configuration Analysis**: Consider three edges of the same color (we assume green) from a single vertex, forming a triangle.     a. **Case 1**: If any two endpoints of these 3 green edges are also connected by a green edge, then the three green edges (those beginning at the common vertex and the edge connecting their endpoints) form a monochromatic green triangle.          b. **Case 2**: If no two endpoints of the 3 green edges are connected by a green edge, then the edges connecting these endpoints must all be red (the opposite color). This too forms a necessary configuration:              - Since each of these edges is red, and each connects endpoints of the green edges, they form a monochromatic red triangle. # Conclusion: Therefore, in any arbitrary coloring of the edges of an octahedron, there will always exist at least one monochromatic triangle. Thus, either: - There exists three people (vertices) connecting via edges (acquaintances) all in one color implying mutual acquaintance, or  - There exists three people with all edges of contrasting color, meaning none of them are acquainted. The solution to the problem concludes that either three people are all mutual friends or none of them knows each other. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given the inequality system about x: left{begin{array}{l}{x＞2a3}{2x≥3(x2)+5}end{array}right. has exactly three integer solutions, then the range of a is ____.","output":"To solve the given inequality system about x, we have two inequalities: 1. x > 2a - 3 2. 2x geq 3(x - 2) + 5 Let's solve each inequality step-by-step: **For the second inequality:** Starting with 2x geq 3(x - 2) + 5, we simplify and solve for x: begin{align*} 2x &geq 3x - 6 + 5  2x - 3x &geq -1  -x &geq -1  x &leq 1 end{align*} Given that the inequality system has exactly three integer solutions, and considering the inequality x leq 1, the possible integer solutions are 1, 0, and -1. **For the first inequality:** Given x > 2a - 3, and knowing the integer solutions are 1, 0, and -1, we substitute x = -1 (the smallest value) into the first inequality to find the lower bound for a: begin{align*} -1 &> 2a - 3  2 &> 2a  1 &> a end{align*} Substituting x = 0 (the next integer solution) into the first inequality to find an inequality for a: begin{align*} 0 &> 2a - 3  3 &> 2a  frac{3}{2} &> a end{align*} Finally, substituting x = 1 (the largest integer solution) into the first inequality to ensure it still satisfies the condition for a: begin{align*} 1 &> 2a - 3  4 &> 2a  2 &> a end{align*} Since -1 is the smallest integer solution, we use it to find the lower bound for a: begin{align*} -1 &> 2a - 3  2 &> 2a  1 &> a end{align*} Rearranging for a, we get: begin{align*} -2 &leq 2a - 3 < -1  1 &leq 2a < 2  frac{1}{2} &leq a < 1 end{align*} Therefore, the range of a for which the given inequality system has exactly three integer solutions is boxed{frac{1}{2} leq a < 1}."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = a{{e}^{x}}+2x1.

Let one of these antiquadratics be ( a ) which is not less than half of the given number, i.e., not less than ( 200...003 ) (2023 zeros). 1. First, note that the only digits a perfect square can end with are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. Therefore, a number ending in 2 or 3 cannot be a perfect square. 2. Since ( a ) should be an antiquadratic, the number ( overline{a_k a_{k-1} ldots a_1} ) when reversed and has ( k ) digits needs to be a perfect square. Given ( a geq 200...003 ):    - ( a ) must begin with 4 and be not less than 400...001 (2022 zeros). 3. The second number in the sum must be a smaller antiquadratic. Since this number is much smaller compared to ( 400...005 ), it must conform to being a single-digit perfect square when reversed:    - Hence, the only possible single-digit perfect squares are 1 and 4. 4. If the second number is 1 (a single-digit antiquadratic that, when reversed, is also a perfect square), then:    - We need ( a = 400...004 ) (2023 zeros after 4).

Since n=r=5, we have: [A_{5}^{5} = frac{5!}{(5-5)!} = frac{5!}{0!} = frac{5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1}{1} = 120] Next, we focus on the condition that the first 3 digits must be in decreasing order and the last 3 digits must be in increasing order. For this to happen, the middle digit of the five-digit number must be 1, as it is the smallest digit and allows the other digits to be arranged as required around it. With 1 fixed in the middle, we have four digits left (2, 3, 4, and 5) to arrange. We need to choose 2 digits out of these 4 to be in the first two positions in decreasing order, and the remaining 2 digits will automatically be in the last two positions in increasing order. The number of ways to choose 2 digits out of 4 is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n=4 and r=2: [C_{4}^{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6] Therefore, there are 6 ways to choose the digits for the first two and last two positions given the condition.

To approach this problem, let's consider the geometric interpretation. We need to find the point on the curve y = -x^2 + 3 ln x that is closest to the line described by the equation y = x + 2. This minimum distance will correspond to the minimum value of our expression. Let (a, b) be the point of tangency on the curve y = -x^2 + 3 ln x with the parallel line to y = x + 2. Since a > 0 (as the domain of ln x is x > 0), the slope of the line tangent to the curve at point (a, b) will be the same as the slope of the line y = x + 2, which is 1. The derivative of y = -x^2 + 3 ln x is:  y' = -2x + frac{3}{x}.  Setting the derivative equal to the slope of the tangent line (1) gives us:  -2a + frac{3}{a} = 1.  Solving this for a, we disregard the negative solution a = -frac{3}{2}, as it doesn't fit the condition a > 0. We are left with a = 1. Therefore, the tangency point on the curve is (1, -1^2 + 3 ln 1) = (1, -1).

Now, to find the minimum value of the expression (a - x)^2 + (a + 2 - y)^2, we essentially need the square of the distance we just calculated, because the expression can be interpreted as the square of the distance from any point (x, y) to the point (a, a + 2).

The angle ( angle X A L ) can be expressed using properties of tangents and triangle angles.        - Since ( X Y ) is tangent at ( A ), the angle ( angle X A B ) is equal to the angle ( angle A C B ), due to the property of the tangent making an angle with a chord equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment. 5. **Using Angle Addition Property**:    Let’s deduce ( angle X A L ):    [    angle X A L = angle X A B + angle B A L.    ] 6. **Using External Angle Theorem**:    Using the external angle theorem of triangle ( A B C ):    [    angle B A L = angle A C B + angle C A L.    ] 7. **Combining Angles**:    Substitute ( angle B A L ) in our earlier expression:    [    angle X A L = angle A C B + (angle A C B + angle C A L)    ]    Simplified, we get:    [    angle X A L = angle A C B + angle A C B + angle C A L = 2angle A C B + angle C A L.    ]    Since ( angle B L A ) is symmetrical due to ( A ) and ( L ), therefore:    [    angle X A L = angle B L A.    ] 8. **Conclusion**:    This established angle equality implies that the circumcircle of triangle ( P L Q ) is tangent to line ( B C ), preserving the tangency by symmetry properties and angle identities.

Since there are 51 other cards (excluding the card itself), and 25 of those are black, the probability that the next card is black is dfrac{25}{51}. 2. **Calculate Expected Value for Each Black Card:** The expected value for each black card to form a pair with the card to its right can be calculated by considering the two possibilities:    - The card to the right is black, which happens with a probability of dfrac{25}{51}, contributing 1 to the count of black pairs.    - The card to the right is red, which happens with a probability of dfrac{26}{51}, contributing 0 to the count of black pairs.    Therefore, the expected value for each black card is dfrac{25}{51}(1) + dfrac{26}{51}(0) = dfrac{25}{51}. 3. **Calculate Total Expected Value:** Since there are 26 black cards, and each has an expected value of dfrac{25}{51} for forming a pair with the card to its right, the total expected value for the number of pairs of adjacent black cards is:    [    26 times left(dfrac{25}{51}right) = dfrac{26 times 25}{51} = dfrac{650}{51}    ] Therefore, the expected number of pairs of adjacent cards which are both black is boxed{dfrac{650}{51}}."},{"instruction":"Let n be the smallest nonprime integer greater than 1 with no prime factor less than 15.

If a positive integer ( n ) can be uniquely represented as the sum of an odd number of distinct elements from ( S ), then ( n ) is called clean. Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers that are not clean.","output":"# Problem Let ( S ) be a non-empty set of positive integers. If a positive integer ( n ) can be uniquely represented as the sum of an odd number of distinct elements from ( S ), then it is called \\"pure\\". Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers that are not pure. 1. **Definition of Pure and Odd Representation:**        Let us define an integer's \\"odd\\" or \\"even\\" representation as a sum of an odd or even number of distinct elements from ( S ). 2. **Assume the Conclusion is False:**    Suppose there are only a finite number of positive integers that are not pure. Therefore, there exists a positive integer ( N ) such that every positive integer ( n ) where ( n > N ) has exactly one odd representation. 3. **Property 1: Unique Representations:**    Every positive integer ( n ) has at most one odd representation and at most one even representation.        - **Proof of Property 1:**      Since ( S ) is infinite, there exists an element ( x in S ) such that ( x > max {n, N} ). Thus, the integer ( n + x ) must be pure, and ( x ) will not appear in any even representation of ( n ). If ( n ) were to have more than one even representation, then ( n+x ) would have more than one odd representation, creating a contradiction. Consequently, ( n ) can have at most one even representation.     4. **Existence of Elements Greater than ( x ) in ( S ):**        Similarly, if there are two distinct elements ( y, z in S ) such that ( y, z > max {n, N} ), and if ( n ) had more than one odd representation, then ( n+y+z ) obtained by adding ( y ) and ( z ) to both representations would necessarily create more than one odd representation for ( n+y+z ), which contradicts our earlier assumption. 5. **Property 2: Representation Involving ( s in S ):**    For a fixed ( s in S ), if a positive integer ( n (n > N) ) doesn't have an even representation, then for all integer ( a ), ( n+2as ) has an odd representation that includes ( s ).    - **Proof of Property 2:**      We need only show the following principle: if ( n ) lacks an even representation excluding ( s ), then ( n+2s ) includes ( s ). This claim follows from Property 1, as such ( n ) has no even representation excluding ( s ). When ( s ) is added, the resulting ( n+2s ) necessarily includes ( s ) in its unique odd representation. 6. **Property 3: Large Enough Integers:**    Any sufficiently large integer has an even representation.    - **Proof of Property 3:**      If we fix any ( s in S ), consider the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 2s} ). According to Property 2, within the set:      [      mathbf{Z}_r = {r + 2as mid a in mathbf{Z}, a geqslant 0},      ]      each element ( r ) must have an even representation for sufficiently large numbers. This holds across ( mathbf{Z} ), implying all integers in ( mathbf{Z}_+ ) eventually have even representations. 7. **Property 4: Pure Representations for Elements in ( S ):**    For any two elements ( s, t in S ) with ( N < s < t ), the even representation of ( t ) includes ( s ).    - **Proof of Property 4:**      Assume the conclusion does not hold. Then for integer ( s + t ), two different odd representations exist: one by adding ( t ) to an even representation of ( s ) and another from an even representation of ( t ). These would contradict each other as the odd representations are supposed to be unique by properties of unique representation established earlier. 8. **Establishing Contradictions:**    Begin by arranging ( s_1 < s_2 < ldots ) within ( S ). And fix ( k ) such that ( s_k > N ). Using these contradictions and logical deductions from properties, if for any positive integer ( j_0 > k ), ( sigma_{j_0} > 2sigma_{k-1} ), and ensuring      [      s_{j+1} geq frac{sigma_j}{2}.      ]    Any repeated element ( s_p ) coherently demonstrates that if ( 2s_p > s_1 + s_2 + ldots + s_{p-1} ), ( tau ) (odd representation) includes some number greater than ( s_{p-1} ), there exists large enough integers that are always pure only once, thereby contradicting fundamentally proving large infinite integers not purely representing. # Conclusion: It follows from properties and contradictions established consistently that there indeed exist infinitely many integers that are not pure.

This product generally results in a rotation centered at some point (O), which can be determined given point (M) and lines (l_2, l_3, ldots, l_n).      - Thus, for odd (n), the problem has a unique solution unless the rotation is a parallel shift or the identity transformation, where it is either unsolvable or indeterminate with infinite solutions.    - For even (n): The task reduces to finding the fixed point of a product of an odd number of reflections. This product generally results in a glide reflection having no fixed points. Hence, the problem is generally unsolvable. However, if the glide reflection is a reflection about a line, there are infinite solutions lying on that line.  Part b: To construct an n-gon (A_1A_2ldots A_n) where the angle (alpha) at (A_1) is given, the bisector of (angle A_1) passes through (M), and the bisectors of (angle A_2, angle A_3, ldots, angle A_n) coincide with (l_2, l_3, ldots, l_n): 1. **Assume the solution exists**: Suppose we have already constructed the n-gon as described (refer to illustration 151 in the provided image). 2. **Symmetry and Rotation**:    - Rotation by (180^circ) about point (M) transforms (A_nA_1) to (A_1A_2).    - Reflection about line (l_2) transforms (A_1A_2) to (A_2A_3), and this process continues through the other lines. 3. **Fixed Line Analysis**:    - Considering all symmetries together: The overall transformation is a product of symmetries relative to lines (l_2, l_3, ldots, l_n) and rotation about (M).    - For even (n), this transformation can have a unique fixed line (axis of the glide reflection), providing a unique solution. If it results in symmetry about a line, the problem has infinite solutions along that line.    - For odd (n), this results in a product that typically yields a rotation; hence, the problem does not have consistent solutions unless the rotations align.  Conclusion: Part a: 1. If (n) is odd, the problem has a unique result generally or no solution if it results in a parallel shift or identity transformation. 2. If (n) is even, the solution is generally unsolvable except for cases where specific alignments provide definite or infinite solutions along specific lines. Part b: 1. If (n) is even, the problem has a unique result generally or infinite outcomes along a line. 2. If (n) is odd, the task results in rotation making it unsolvable unless special alignments arise. Thus, summarizing: - Part a: The unique solution when (n) is odd, generally. - Part b: The unique solution when (n) is even or possibly infinite along specific lines.

This means that overrightarrow{a} // overrightarrow{b} does not lead to overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = |overrightarrow{a}| |overrightarrow{b}|. Therefore, \\"overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = |overrightarrow{a}| |overrightarrow{b}|\\" is not a necessary condition for \\"overrightarrow{a} // overrightarrow{b}\\".

Because from overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = |overrightarrow{a}| |overrightarrow{b}|, we can infer the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is 0^circ, which implies overrightarrow{a} // overrightarrow{b}.

We are told that the parabola is increasing on the left side of the axis of symmetry. Let's analyze this information step by step to determine the range of a. 1. **Understanding the Behavior of the Parabola**: The axis of symmetry for a parabola defined by y = ax^2 is the y-axis, or x = 0. The parabola is symmetric about this axis. 2. **Increasing on the Left Side of the Axis of Symmetry**: For the parabola to be increasing on the left side, as we move from left to right (towards the axis of symmetry), the y-values must be increasing. This behavior is characteristic of a parabola that opens downwards. 3. **Relation to Coefficient a**: The direction in which a parabola opens is determined by the sign of the coefficient a in the equation y = ax^2.     - If a > 0, the parabola opens upwards.    - If a < 0, the parabola opens downwards. 4. **Conclusion**: Since we are given that the parabola is increasing on the left side of the axis of symmetry, it must open downwards.

Since the segments AX and BY are parallel by given condition, the segment KM is also parallel to them. 3. We know from the properties of parallelograms that in a quadrilateral KLMN all vertices are aligned such that the diagonals KM and LN intersect at their common midpoint T. 4. Consider the plane alpha passing through point T and perpendicular to AX. Since KM parallel AX, all points in this plane alpha are equidistant from points K and M. 5. Since T is the midpoint of LN, points L and N are equidistant from the plane alpha and lie on opposite sides (or both lie exactly in alpha). 6. Since the segments O_{1}N and O_{2}L are perpendicular to AX, they are parallel to alpha. Therefore, the points O_{1} and O_{2} are also equidistant from alpha, implying the midpoint S of segment O_{1}O_{2} lies in alpha.  7. Consequently, SK = SM. 8.

Given that in the arithmetic sequence _{a_n}, _{a_5}=33, _{a_{45}}=153, we can find the common difference and then the general term formula. Then, we can construct an equation with n as the variable based on _{a_n}=201 and solve the equation to find the answer. **Step-by-Step Solution** 1. Since _{a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote this common difference by d. 2. We know that _{a_5}=33 and _{a_{45}}=153. Using the formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence, _{a_n} = a_1 + (n - 1)d, we can write a system of two linear equations:  begin{cases} a_5 = a_1 + 4d = 33  a_{45} = a_1 + 44d = 153 end{cases}  3. Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a_1 and d. By subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:  40d = 120 Rightarrow d = 3  4. Substituting d=3 back into the first equation, we obtain:  a_1 + 4 cdot 3 = 33 Rightarrow a_1 = 21  5. So, the general term formula for the arithmetic sequence is _{a_n} = 21 + 3(n - 1). 6. Now, we want to find n such that _{a_n} = 201. Substituting _{a_n} = 201 into the general term formula, we have:  201 = 21 + 3(n - 1)  7. Solving for n, we get:  180 = 3(n - 1) Rightarrow n - 1 = 60 Rightarrow n = 61  **Final Answer:** The 201 is the 61^{st} term of the arithmetic sequence. Hence, the correct answer is boxed{B (61)}."},{"instruction":"Maddox and Theo both bought 3 Polaroid Cameras, each sold at 20 per camera from Amazon, and decided to sell them on eBay.

Theo's profit would then be the selling price minus the cost price, which is ( 69 - 60 = 9 ). Maddox made 15 more profit than Theo, so Maddox's profit is ( 9 + 15 = 24 ). Maddox's total selling price for the 3 cameras would be the cost price plus the profit, which is ( 60 + 24 = 84 ).

Thus, the equation of the tangent line can be expressed as y - c = bx. Simplifying this, we get y = bx + c.

Since p = q = r, and they are integers in a geometric progression with p < q < r, the only integer values satisfying p = q = r under increasing order constraint are not possible. We need to correct the assumption that p = q = r and look for nontrivial solutions. Since p, q, r are distinct, the previous step must be incorrect.

Using the distance formula, we get:    [    XA = sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + a)^2 + (z + a)^2}    ]    [    XB = sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2 + (z - a)^2}    ]    [    XC = sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + a)^2 + (z - a)^2}    ]    [    XD = sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - a)^2 + (z + a)^2}    ] 3. **Sum of the Squared Distances**:    Compute the sum of the squared distances from the point (X) to the tetrahedron vertices:    [    XA^2 = (x + a)^2 + (y + a)^2 + (z + a)^2    ]    [    XB^2 = (x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2 + (z - a)^2    ]    [    XC^2 = (x - a)^2 + (y + a)^2 + (z - a)^2    ]    [    XD^2 = (x - a)^2 + (y - a)^2 + (z + a)^2    ]        Summing these:    [    XA^2 + XB^2 + XC^2 + XD^2 = sum_{V in {A, B, C, D}} XV^2     ]        Expanding and combining like terms:    [    XA^2 + XB^2 + XC^2 + XD^2 = sum_{V in {A, B, C, D}} left( (x pm a)^2 + (y pm a)^2 + (z pm a)^2 right)    ]    Simplifying we get:    [    XA^2 + XB^2 + XC^2 + XD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 4(3a^2)    ]    This simplifies to:    [    XA^2 + XB^2 + XC^2 + XD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 12a^2    ] 4. **Using the QM-AM Inequality**:    The QM-AM inequality for distances states that the sum of distances is less than or equal to the square root of the sum of squared distances multiplied by the number of terms.

Therefore, we have f(-x) = -f(x). - Setting x = 3 in the given functional equation f(x) = f(6-x) + f(3), we find f(3) = 0. This simplifies the equation to f(x) = f(6-x). - This simplification implies f(3+x) = f(3-x), indicating symmetry about x = 3. - From the symmetry and the property of odd functions, we deduce f(x+6) = -f(x). - Extending this, f(x+12) = -f(x+6) = f(x), establishing that the period of f(x) is 12. Thus, option boxed{A} is correct. 2. **To find f(2023):** - Using the periodicity, f(2023) = f(168 times 12 + 7) = f(7). - Since f(x) = f(6-x), we have f(7) = f(-1) = -f(1) = -2022.

This would simply be 6! (6 factorial), because the first position can be filled by any of the 6 people, the second position by any of the remaining 5, and so on, giving us: 6! = 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 720 Now, let's calculate the number of arrangements where persons A and B are next to each other. We can treat person A and person B as a single unit. This unit, along with the 4 remaining people, amounts to 5 units that can be arranged in 5! ways. Since A and B can be either AB or BA within their unit, we need to multiply 5! by 2 for the different arrangements of A and B, obtaining: 2 times 5! = 2 times (5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1) = 240 Next, we compute the number of arrangements where person A or B is at one of the ends. This means person A or B has 2 choices for an end position, and the remaining 5 people (including either A or B, whoever is not on an end) can be arranged in 5! ways. So, we have: 2 times 5! = 240 However, since there are two people, A and B, and each could be at an end, this number should be doubled. That's another 240 times 2 = 480 invalid arrangements. If we subtract the 240 arrangements where A and B are next to each other and the 480 arrangements where A or B is at the end from the total number of arrangements, we get the number of valid arrangements where A and B are not next to each other and neither is at the end: 6! - 2 times 5! - 2 times 2 times 5! = 720 - 240 - 480 = 720 - 720 = 0 It seems we have made a mistake as the result cannot be 0. We need to correct the error by noting that in counting the cases where A or B is at one of the ends, some arrangements where A and B are next to each other have been counted twice: once when A is at the end and once when B is at the end. So, we need to add those back in. Specifically, each counted-twice arrangement consists of 2 positions filled by A and B in some order (2 choices), and 4 positions filled by the remaining people in 4! ways. Since there are 2 ends on our row, the number of doubly-counted arrangements is: 2 times 2 times 4! = 4 times 24 = 96 We subtract the 240 arrangements for A and B together, subtract the 480 arrangements where A or B is at an end, and add back the 96 doubly-counted arrangements: 6! - 2 times 5! - 2 times 2 times 5! + 2 times 2 times 4! = 720 - 240 - 480 + 96 = 720 - 624 = 96 Therefore, there are boxed{96} valid arrangements where persons A and B are not next to each other and neither is at either end of the row."},{"instruction":"Given point ( A ) is a point inside a unit circle centered at ( O ), satisfying ( |overrightarrow{OA}| = frac{1}{2} ).

Considering ( H ) is on the segment ( P Q ), the maximum and minimum values of ( overrightarrow{M H} cdot overrightarrow{C B} ) are (frac{1}{2}|C B|) and (-frac{1}{2}|C B|) respectively. 4.

Therefore, taking into account the convex property and the optimal cut arrangement principle, the minimum number of cuts required to break a 4-unit side cube into 64 one-unit side cubes is: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"instruction":"f 6 kilos of oranges and 5 kilos of apples cost a certain amount, and 5 kilos of oranges and 7 kilos of apples cost 488, the cost of each per kilo is 29.

This number ( a ) represents the frequency of appearance of a particular number from the line above.    - The number appearing ( a ) times on the original line must also induce the number ( a ) to appear at least ( a ) times on the new line created below it. 3. **Properties of each column**:    - If we observe any given column of numbers formed through this process, except for the first row, the entries in the columns will be in non-decreasing order.    - Why? Because the count of occurrences (a natural number) is consistently updated in a way that respects the ordering.     - This implies if you start with some number ( n ), and through multiple iterations, you end up with a number ( leq n ) appearing the same or more times due to the nature of re-counting. 4. **Sum of elements constraint**:    - Note that each new line formed still sums up to 2018 numbers. This is crucial because it constrains the progression of changes across lines.    - Mathematically, if each line's numbers differed without bound, their sum of the counts would necessarily exceed 2018. Since this cannot happen, there are limits on possible variations. 5. **Convergence to stability**:    - Initially, suppose that each new line is different. If each line were guaranteed to be different indefinitely, the sum of numbers would increasingly defer from 2018 due to persistent changes.    - Thus, given the finite sum restriction, the lines must eventually stabilize. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Therefore, after a finite number of iterations, the lines must become identical because the variations exhaust all possibilities without exceeding the finite sum constraint.

This forms a parallelepiped (AFEBCDGH). 2. **Volume Calculation for Tetrahedron**:    - Assume (d) is the distance between lines (AB) and (CD).    - Let (theta) be the angle between these lines.    - Using the properties of volume from geometry:      [      V_{text{tetrahedron}} = frac{1}{6} ab cdot d cdot sin(theta)      ] 3. **Height Estimation**:    - Let (h_a) be the height from vertex (D) to edge (AB) in (triangle ABD). It’s clear that the perpendicular distance from (D) to (AB) is greater than the perpendicular distance from face (AFEB) to (D), i.e., ( h_a > d ).    - Thus, the area of (triangle ABD) is:      [      S_{triangle ABD} = frac{1}{2}a cdot h_a > frac{1}{2}a cdot d      ] 4. **Surface Area Bound**:    - Similarly, the areas of other triangles forming the faces of the tetrahedron are:      [      S_{triangle ABC} > frac{1}{2}a cdot d, quad S_{triangle ACD} > frac{1}{2}b cdot d, quad S_{triangle BCD} > frac{1}{2}b cdot d      ]    - Therefore, the total surface area is:      [      S_{text{surface}} = S_{triangle ABD} + S_{triangle ABC} + S_{triangle ACD} + S_{triangle BCD} > (a + b)d      ] 5. **Relating Volume and Radius**:    - Using the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron inscribed with a sphere:      [      V = frac{1}{3} S_{text{surface}} cdot r      ]          - Solving for (r):      [      r = frac{3V}{S_{text{surface}}}      ]          Substitute (V) from previous derivation:      [      r = frac{ab cdot d cdot sin(theta)}{2 S_{text{surface}}}       ] 6. **Final Inequality**:    - Given ( sin(theta) leq 1 ),      [      r leq frac{ab cdot d}{2 S_{text{surface}}}      ]    - Using the fact that ( S_{text{surface}} > (a + b)d ):      [      r < frac{ab cdot d}{2(a + b)d} = frac{ab}{2(a + b)}      ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{r < frac{ab}{2(a+b)}} ]"},{"instruction":"<details><summary>Intro</summary>The answers to each of the ten questions in this section are integers containing only the digits   1  through   8 , inclusive.

We know that ( sqrt{36} = 6 ) and ( sqrt{25} = 5 ). Since (35) is closer to (36) than to (25), we can estimate that (sqrt{35}) is slightly less than (6). 3. For a more precise approximation, we can use the fact that (sqrt{35}) is between (5.9) and (6). Let's take (sqrt{35} approx 5.92). 4. Now, we calculate (6 times 5.92):    [    6 times 5.92 = 35.52    ] 5. The closest integer to (35.52) is (36). 6. To confirm, we can use the inequality approach:    [    6sqrt{35} approx 6 times 5.92 = 35.52    ]    Since (35.52) is closer to (36) than to (35), the nearest integer is (36).

Follow these steps to solve the problem: 1. **Expression Analysis**:     Given ( a^{frac{varphi(n)}{2}} equiv -1 pmod{n} ), this implies that squaring both sides yields:    [ left( a^{frac{varphi(n)}{2}} right)^2 equiv (-1)^2 pmod{n}, ]    which simplifies to:    [ a^{varphi(n)} equiv 1 pmod{n}. ]    According to Euler’s theorem, ( a^{varphi(n)} equiv 1 pmod{n} ) as long as ( gcd(a, n) = 1 ). 2. **Order of ( a )**:    The order ( omega_n(a) ) of ( a ) modulo ( n ) must divide (varphi(n)). Since we are given that:    [ a^{frac{varphi(n)}{2}} equiv -1 pmod{n}, ]    it means:    [ omega_n(a) ]    should be such that:    [ omega_n(a) = 2m text{ where } m text{ divides } frac{varphi(n)}{2}. ]    Particularly, (omega_n(a) = frac{varphi(n)}{2}). 3. **Prime Factorization and Euler's Totient Function**:    Consider the prime factorization of ( n ):    [ n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} ldots p_m^{k_m}, ]    The corresponding Euler's totient function is:    [ varphi(n) = n prod_{i=1}^m left(1 - frac{1}{p_i}right). ] 4. **Necessary Conditions**:    - ( a^2 equiv -1 pmod{n} ) means ( -1 ) must be a quadratic residue modulo ( n ).    - For (frac{varphi(n)}{2}) to be maximized modulo ( n ), certain constraints must be satisfied:      - If ( n = 2^k ) for any ( k geq 2 ), ( varphi(2^k) = 2^{k-1}).

Next, consider the case when (x+8 = -2^n) and (x-4 = -2^m):    [    2^m - 2^n = 12    ] 6. Since (x < -8), we have:    [    -8 - 2^n < -8 implies n geq 0    ]    And:    [    4 - 2^m < -8 implies m geq 4    ] 7. The solution for the equation (2^m - 2^n = 12):    [    2^m - 2^n = 12    ]    Let (m = 4), then:    [    n = 2    ]    This results in (x):    [    x + 8 = -2^4 implies x + 8 = -16 implies x = -24    ]    And:    [    x - 4 = -2^2 implies x - 4 = -4 implies x = 0    ]    So, the second solution is (x = -12):    [    y_2 = 3, x_2 = -12    ] 8.

Show that if the subring generated by  I cup {1}  is  R  for each nonzero ideal  I  then  R  is simple.","output":"To show that ( R ) is simple, we need to prove that ( R ) has no non-trivial two-sided ideals. We will proceed by contradiction and use the given condition that the subring generated by ( I cup {1} ) is ( R ) for each nonzero ideal ( I ). 1. **Assume ( R ) is not simple**:     Suppose ( R ) has a non-trivial ideal ( I ) such that ( 0 subsetneq I subsetneq R ). 2. **Direct sum decomposition**:    If ( R ) can be decomposed as a direct sum of nonzero rings ( A oplus B ), then ( A ) and ( B ) must be cyclic by considering ( I = B ) and ( I = A ) respectively and applying the given condition. This contradicts the non-commutativity of ( R ). 3. **Finite ring structure**:    Since ( R ) is finite, it can be decomposed into a direct sum of its ( p )-subrings using Bezout's lemma. Given that ( R ) is indecomposable, its order must be ( p^k ) for some ( k ). 4. **Jacobson radical**:    Let ( J(R) ) be the Jacobson radical of ( R ). Since ( R ) is finite, it is Artinian, and thus ( R/J(R) ) is semisimple. If ( J(R) = 0 ), then ( R ) is simple because an Artinian ring with a trivial radical is simple. 5. **Case when ( J(R) neq 0 )**:    If ( J(R) neq 0 ), then ( 1 ) generates ( R/J(R) ), making ( R/J(R) ) a cyclic field ( mathbb{F}_p ). Thus, ( J(R) ) is the unique maximal ideal of ( R ), making ( R ) a finite local ring. 6. **Properties of ( J(R) )**:    Note that ( p in J(R) ). For any ( k ) such that ( J(R)^k neq 0 ), ( R/(J(R)^k) ) is cyclic by the problem condition. If ( p in J(R)^2 ), then ( J(R) = J(R)^2 ) because both would give ( mathbb{F}_p ) when we quotient ( R ) by them. However, for Artinian rings ( R ), any right ( R )-module ( M ) satisfies ( M cdot J(R) = text{rad}(M) ). Thus, ( J(R)^2 = text{rad}(J(R)) ). 7. **Contradiction**:    Since ( J(R) ) is finite and Noetherian, it has a proper maximal submodule, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( p in J(R) - J(R)^2 ). 8. **Ideal structure**:    We claim ( (p) = J(R) ). By the problem condition, ( R/(p) ) is cyclic unless ( p = 0 ), in which case ( J(R) = 0 ) and ( R ) is the field ( mathbb{F}_p ). Since every element of ( R/(p) ) has order ( p ), we have ( R/(p) = R/J(R) = mathbb{F}_p ), and ( (p) subseteq J(R) ), so the ideals are equal. 9. **Cyclic structure**:    Each ( R/(p^k) ) is cyclic for all ( k ) such that ( (p^k) neq 0 ). If ( (p^{k+1}) neq 0 ), then ( (p^k) neq text{rad}(p^k) = (p^{k+1}) ). If ( q ) is the smallest positive integer for which ( p^q = 0 ), we can inductively show that for all ( n < q ), ( R/(p^n) = mathbb{Z}/(p^n)mathbb{Z} ). 10. **Contradiction in ideal structure**:     If ( (p^{q-1}) ) has ( k ) elements, then ( R ) has ( p^{q-1} cdot k ) elements, and ( 1 ) has order ( p^q ). For any nonzero ideal ( U ) satisfying ( 0 < U < (p^{q-1}) ), we have ( R/U = mathbb{Z}/(p^q)mathbb{Z} ). Distinct ideals ( U_1 ) and ( U_2 ) must be disjoint, leading to ( U_1 + U_2 = (p^{q-1}) ). If two distinct such ideals exist, we have ( k^2/p^2 = k ), implying ( k = p^2 ). This would make ( R ) commutative, contradicting the non-commutativity of ( R ). 11. **Conclusion**:     There exists at most one ideal between ( (p^{q-1}) ) and ( 0 ). The ideals of ( R ) form a linear total order under inclusion if ( J(R) neq 0 ). If ( J(R) ) is nonzero, ( R ) is an algebra on a free ( mathbb{Z}/(p^q)mathbb{Z} ) module with basis ( 1, b_1, ldots, b_m ). If the set ( b_i ) is nonempty, ( (p) = (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^{1+m} ) where ( m > 0 ), contradicting that ( R/(p) = R/J(R) = mathbb{F}_p ) is a cyclic field. Thus, ( R = mathbb{Z}/(p^q)mathbb{Z} ) if ( J(R) ) is nonzero, contradicting the non-commutativity of ( R ). 12. **Final conclusion**:     Therefore, ( J(R) = 0 ), and since ( R ) is Artinian with a trivial radical and is indecomposable, ( R ) is simple.

A regular pentagon has each internal angle equal to (108^circ), but sides of non-equal measure.          - **Pentagon with Equal Sides but not Equal Angles**:      Construct a pentagon where all sides are congruent in length but do not satisfy the angle requirements of a regular pentagon.

Let ( x, y, ) and ( z ) be such that ( x + y + z = pi k ) for some integer ( k ). Then:     [     |sin x| leq |sin y| + |sin z|     ]     If ( y neq pi l ) and ( z neq pi l ), for some integer ( l ), this inequality is strict. Specifically,     [     |sin x| = |sin(y + z)| = |sin y cos z + sin z cos y| leq |sin y| cdot |cos z| + |sin z| cdot |cos y| leq |sin y| + |sin z|      ]     This follows from the triangle inequality and properties of sine and cosine functions. 3. **Implications of the lemma**:     From this lemma, we can deduce that the sign of the function ( f_{n}(T) ) depends on the signs of the individual sine terms. For example, if ( sin n alpha > 0 ) and ( sin n beta > 0 ), then:     [     f_{n}(T) geq sin n alpha + sin n beta - |sin n gamma| > 0      ] 4. **Analyzing specific values**:     For ( n = 1 ):     [     f_{1}(T) = sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma > 0     ]     Since all angles of an acute triangle are less than ( frac{pi}{2} ), their sines are positive, making ( f_{1}(T) ) always positive.     For ( n = 2 ):     [     f_{2}(T) = sin 2 alpha + sin 2 beta + sin 2 gamma > 0     ]     Since for (alpha, beta < frac{pi}{2}), (sin 2alpha > 0) and (sin 2beta > 0), this is also positive. 5. **Example of ( n = 4 )**:     Let ( n = 4 ), and assume ( alpha geq beta geq gamma ). Since the triangle is acute, this implies (beta > frac{pi}{4} ). Therefore:     [     pi < 4beta leq 4alpha < 4 cdot frac{pi}{2} = 2pi     ]     This results in:     [     sin 4alpha < 0 quad text{and} quad sin 4beta < 0     ]     Consequently,      [     f_{4}(T) = sin 4 alpha + sin 4 beta + sin 4 gamma < 0     ] 6. **General case for ( n > 4 )**:     By similar reasoning as in the case ( n = 4 ), we need to check intervals of (sin) values over the range:     For each ( n ), if ( x = alpha = beta ) moves from (frac{pi}{4}) to (frac{pi}{2}), the value ( y = nx ) spans an interval greater than (pi). Therefore, the sine function will attain both positive and negative values over ( y ).     Hence for any ( n > 4 ), we can find triangles for which:     [     f_{n}(T) = sin n alpha + sin n beta + sin n gamma     ]     switches between positive and negative values. # Conclusion: Thus, the only natural number ( n ) for which (sin n alpha + sin n beta + sin n gamma < 0) for any acute triangle is ( boxed{4} )."},{"instruction":"An oreo shop now sells 6 different flavors of oreos and 4 different flavors of milk.

This means ( x < 16 ). The only number less than 16 with at least 6 divisors is 12, but ( s(12) neq 16 ). Therefore, ( d(x) < 6 ). 2. **Case ( d(x) = 2 ):**    If ( d(x) = 2 ), then ( x ) is a prime number. The sum of the divisors of a prime number ( p ) is ( s(p) = p + 1 ).

The sum of the divisors is ( s(p^2) = 1 + p + p^2 ). Thus:    [    (1 + p + p^2) cdot 3 = 96 implies 1 + p + p^2 = 32    ]    Solving the quadratic equation ( p^2 + p - 31 = 0 ):    [    p = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 4 cdot 31}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{125}}{2}    ]    Since ( sqrt{125} ) is not an integer, there are no integer solutions for ( p ). Thus, there are no solutions in this case. 4. **Case ( d(x) = 4 ):**    If ( d(x) = 4 ), then ( x ) can be of the form ( p^3 ) or ( pq ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct primes. The sum of the divisors is ( s(x) = 24 ). We test values of ( x ) less than 24 with 4 divisors:    - For ( x = 14 ) (divisors: 1, 2, 7, 14):      [      s(14) = 1 + 2 + 7 + 14 = 24 quad text{and} quad s(14) cdot d(14) = 24 cdot 4 = 96      ]      So, ( x = 14 ) is a solution.    - For ( x = 15 ) (divisors: 1, 3, 5, 15):      [      s(15) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 15 = 24 quad text{and} quad s(15) cdot d(15) = 24 cdot 4 = 96      ]      So, ( x = 15 ) is a solution.

Suppose ( a ) is positive. Then ( 6k - 1 ) must be positive because ( b^2 + 3 ) is always non-negative (since ( b^2 geq 0 ) and ( 3 > 0 )). 4. **Consider the prime divisors:**    If ( 6k - 1 ) is positive, it must have a prime divisor ( p equiv -1 pmod{3} ). This is because any integer of the form ( 6k - 1 ) can be written as ( 6m + 5 ) for some integer ( m ), and such numbers have prime divisors of the form ( 6n + 5 ). 5. **Contradiction with quadratic residues:**    Consider the prime ( p equiv -1 pmod{3} ). We have:    [    p mid b^2 + 3    ]    This implies:    [    b^2 equiv -3 pmod{p}    ]    However, the Legendre symbol ( left( frac{-3}{p} right) ) is equal to ( -1 ) when ( p equiv -1 pmod{3} ). This means that ( -3 ) is not a quadratic residue modulo ( p ), leading to a contradiction. 6. **Conclusion:**    Since assuming ( a ) is positive leads to a contradiction, ( a ) must be negative.

Thus, [ cos 112^circ = cos (360^circ - 112^circ) = cos 248^circ ] However, since 248^circ is outside the range 0 le n le 180, we consider the identity cos theta = cos (360^circ - theta). Applying this to 112^circ within the given range: [ cos 112^circ = cos (360^circ - 112^circ) = cos 248^circ ] Since 248^circ > 180^circ, we look for other solutions. We realize that cos 112^circ = cos 112^circ. So, n = 112 is the only solution within the range 0 le n le 180.

Example solution: Consider the example route illustrated in the left figure of the given image. By carefully following the path drawn, the tourist manages to traverse a total of 34 streets. Here, we define a \\"street\\" as a segment between two adjacent intersections.   2. Upper Bound Assessment: To know the maximum number of streets that the tourist can walk through: 1. There are a total of 36 intersections. 2. When the tourist walks through each street, they arrive at a new intersection. 3. Consequently, the maximum number of streets the tourist could walk is one less than the number of intersections, i.e., (36 - 1 = 35).  3. Further Analysis: To demonstrate that a tourist cannot walk through 35 streets without revisiting an intersection, we introduce a coloring argument: - We'll color the intersections in a checkerboard pattern (chessboard-like) where adjacent intersections have different colors. In this manner, there would be black and white intersections. - Both the hotel and the train station are situated on white intersections. By moving through any street, the tourist will alternately switch between black and white intersections. Since both the starting point (train station) and the ending point (hotel) are white, any permissible route must consist of an even number of streets to end again on a white intersection. Since 35 is an odd number, this means that no route traversing exactly 35 streets is possible: - With this even-odd argument, it's clear that not only is a path of 35 streets impossible, but we also identify the true limitation of our route— it must have an even number of streets to start and finish on white intersections.  Conclusion: Through this analysis, we establish that the longest route a tourist can walk on, without revisiting an intersection, consists of 34 streets. This solution is verified using coloring conventions, ensuring that no longer route is feasible per the restrictions. [ boxed{34} ]"},{"instruction":"The average age of seven children is 8 years old.

If we can prove this, then since there are 1002 other elements in (A), we can choose any of these other elements to be (c), and we would have (gcd(a, b) = 1 mid c).    Assume, for contradiction, that every pair of elements (a, b in A) has (gcd(a, b) > 1). Let (d) be the smallest element in (A). Since (gcd(d, d-1) = 1) and (gcd(d, d+1) = 1) by Euclid’s algorithm, the next element that can have a (gcd) of 1 with (d) must be at least (d+2).     Therefore, the elements of (A) must be of the form ({d, d+2, d+4, ldots, d+2(1003)}). This implies that (d + 2 times 1003 leq 2006), so (d leq 0). However, since (d geq 1) (as (d in A)), this is a contradiction.    Hence, it is impossible for all pairs of numbers in (A) to have a (gcd) greater than 1. Therefore, there must be at least two elements (a) and (b) in (A) such that (gcd(a, b) = 1). We can then choose any other element (c) in (A), and since (1 mid c), the proof is complete. 2. **Part (b): Prove that there exist three distinct numbers (a, b, c in A) such that (gcd(a, b)) does not divide (c).**    First, note that (A) cannot consist entirely of even numbers or entirely of odd numbers. If (A) contained only even numbers or only odd numbers, it would have at most 1003 elements (since there are 1003 odd numbers and 1003 even numbers in ({1, 2, ldots, 2006})). Therefore, (A) must contain at least one element of the opposite parity.    We consider three cases:    - **Case 1: 1003 odd numbers and 1 even number.**      Since there are 1003 odd numbers, (A) must include all odd numbers ({1, 3, 5, ldots, 2005}). Let (a = 3), (b = 9), and (c = 5). Here, (gcd(3, 9) = 3), and 3 does not divide 5, providing the required contradiction.    - **Case 2: At least two even numbers and some odd numbers.**      Let (a) and (b) be even numbers and (c) be an odd number. Then (gcd(a, b) = 2k) for some integer (k), and (c = 2m + 1) for some integer (m). Since (2k mid (2m + 1)) is impossible (as (2m + 1) is odd and (2k) is even), this provides the required contradiction.    - **Case 3: 1 odd number and 1003 even numbers.**      Let (c) be the odd number and (a) and (b) be two even numbers. The proof is the same as in Case 2, since an even number cannot divide an odd number.    Since we have accounted for all cases, our proof is complete.

Mark the edge (A_iA_j) with a directed arrow pointing from (A_i) to (A_j). 4. **Arrow Outflow**: Since each fly moves along the boundary of its face in the clockwise direction, there will be exactly one arrow coming out of each vertex. 5. **Cycle Formation**: The directed arrows form cycles within the graph (G).

Given the function y=(m+2)x^{m^2-3}+m-2, for it to be linear, the exponent of x must be 1. Therefore, we set the exponent equal to 1 and solve for m: 1. The condition for the function to be linear is that the coefficient of x must not be zero, and the exponent of x must be 1.

The equations of these asymptotes are derived from the equation of the hyperbola by setting the right side to zero, which gives us y = pm frac{b}{a}x. 2. **Equation of the Directrix of the Parabola**: The parabola given is y^{2} = 2px. The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the parabola and is located a distance p/2 from the vertex on the side opposite the parabola's opening. For this parabola, the equation of the directrix is x = -frac{p}{2}. 3. **Find the Coordinates of Points A and B**: Points A and B lie on the directrix and also on the asymptotes of the hyperbola.

This leads to frac{sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}}{a} = 2, and upon simplification, we find frac{b}{a} = sqrt{3}. 5. **Calculate the Area of triangle AOB**: The area of triangle AOB can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. In this case, the base is the distance between A and B along the y-axis, which is 2 times frac{sqrt{3}p}{2} = sqrt{3}p, and the height is the distance from the origin to the directrix, which is frac{p}{2}.

We need to determine the number of paths that visit each lattice point exactly once. 2. **First Move Analysis**:    Since Sally is starting at (2,1), she cannot remain on the middle row indefinitely. She must move either up to row 1 or down to row 3. Let's assume without loss of generality (WLOG) that she moves up to (1,1). The solution for the other case (moving down to row 3) will follow symmetrically, so we can later multiply our result by 2. 3. **Structure of the Path**:    Since Sally needs to cover all points, she must return to the middle row multiple times to avoid isolating any row.

Next, we use the property of square roots that allows us to take the square root of each factor: sqrt{8} = sqrt{2^3}.  Since the exponent 3 is not a perfect square, we look for the highest power of 2 that is a perfect square and less than 3, which is 2^2 = 4. Thus, we rewrite 2^3 as 2^2 cdot 2 = 4 cdot 2. Taking the square root of both sides, we have: sqrt{8} = sqrt{4 cdot 2} = sqrt{4} cdot sqrt{2} = 2sqrt{2}.

We are given that the difference between the highest and lowest score is 140 runs, so we can write: H - L = 140 ...(1) We are also given that the batsman's average in 46 innings is 60 runs. Therefore, the total runs scored in 46 innings is: Total runs = Average × Number of innings Total runs = 60 × 46 Total runs = 2760 Now, if we exclude the highest and lowest scores, the batsman has played 44 innings (46 - 2) with an average of 58 runs. So, the total runs scored in these 44 innings is: Total runs (excluding H and L) = Average × Number of innings (excluding H and L) Total runs (excluding H and L) = 58 × 44 Total runs (excluding H and L) = 2552 The sum of the highest and lowest scores can be found by subtracting the total runs excluding the highest and lowest scores from the total runs in all innings: H + L = Total runs - Total runs (excluding H and L) H + L = 2760 - 2552 H + L = 208 ...(2) Now we have two equations: 1) H - L = 140 2) H + L = 208 We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of H and L.

There are 10 such streets.     - If a path enters and exits each of these 10 horizontal streets, it must turn at least twice within each street:         - Once to change from horizontal to vertical or vice versa.         - Again to ensure the path continues to cover additional intersections.     - Therefore, for 10 horizontal streets, the minimum total number of turns would be 2 times 10 = 20 turns. 5. **Cross Verification**:     - Let's verify if fewer than 20 turns could potentially suffice. Consider a path that might skip even one street. This would mean the path would need to cover all intersections in the perpendicular direction, which still requires at least 2 turns per street for a total coverage:         - Here again, 10 streets needing 2 turns each: 2 times 10 = 20.

We need to show that the circumcircles of (BMR) and (CNR) intersect at a point on (BC). 1. **Identify the Geometry Setup**:    - Since (O) is the center of the circle with diameter (BC), it implies (OB = OC) and (OM = ON = frac{BC}{2}).    - The circle with diameter (BC) being a right-angle circle with respect to (M) and (N) implies (angle BMC = angle BNC = 90^circ). 2. **Properties of Circle with Diameter (BC)**:    - Since (M) and (N) are points on the circle with diameter (BC), (angle BMC = angle BNC = 90^circ). 3. **Angle Bisector of (angle MON)**:    - Since (MO = ON), the angle bisector of (angle MON) is also the line (OM = ON). Thus, the angle bisector of (angle MON) is the perpendicular bisector of segment (MN). 4. **Finding Intersection Point (R)**:    - The intersection of the angle bisectors of (angle BAC) and (angle MON) is point (R).    - Since (angle MON) is isosceles at (O), we identify that point (R) lies on the perpendicular bisector of (MN). 5. **Cyclic Quadrilateral properties**:    - Point (R) being on the angle bisector of (angle BAC) and perpendicular bisector of (MN) signifies that quadrilateral (RMNA) is cyclic.

A: 1 kilometer B: sin{10°} kilometer C: cos{10°} kilometer D: cos{20°} kilometer","output":"Let's denote the original slope as the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where the height is constant, and the base needs to be extended. The inclination angle is reduced by 20° - 10° = 10°, making the original and new incline angles supplementary to each other within a larger triangle formed by the extended base. To find the extended length, we have to consider the relationship between the hypotenuse and the base, which is associated with the cosine of the angle. For the original configuration with the slope at an inclination angle of 20°, the base of the slope can be calculated using the cosine function: [ text{Base (original)} = text{Hypotenuse} times cos(20°) = 1 times cos(20°) text{ kilometers}.] Now, when the angle is reduced to 10°, the new base length will be: [ text{Base (new)} = text{Hypotenuse} times cos(10°) = 1 times cos(10°) text{ kilometers}.] To determine the extended part of the base, we subtract the original base from the new base: [ text{Extension} = text{Base (new)} - text{Base (original)} ] [ text{Extension} = cos(10°) - cos(20°) text{ kilometers}.] Since cos(10°) is larger than cos(20°), the result will be positive, which means the base is indeed extended. However, the answer options provided do not match this result. Assuming a possible simplification, let's inspect the answer choices more closely. If the slope were projected onto the ground without changing its length, the base at a 10° incline would be the hypotenuse times the cosine of 10°. Since the slope length is unchanged (1 kilometer), this projection would be exactly 1 kilometer at 0° incline. In simple terms, the original problem description implies that no matter the angle, the slope (hypotenuse) is 1 kilometer. So when flat on the ground (0° incline), the slope covers 1 kilometer horizontally. Therefore, reducing the inclination to 10° would result in the same horizontal length. Accordingly, extending the base to achieve a 10° incline would require additional 1 kilometer to maintain the hypotenuse at the same length: [ boxed{1 text{ kilometer}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} = (m, 2) and overrightarrow{b} = (2, 1), and overrightarrow{a} perp overrightarrow{b}, then the value of frac {|2 overrightarrow{a}  overrightarrow{b}|}{ overrightarrow{a} cdot ( overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b})} is (　　) A:  frac {5}{3} B: 1 C: 2 D:  frac {5}{4}","output":"Since overrightarrow{a} = (m, 2) and overrightarrow{b} = (2, -1), and overrightarrow{a} perp overrightarrow{b}, therefore overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 2m - 2 = 0, therefore m = 1, therefore overrightarrow{a} = (1, 2), 2 overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b} = (0, 5), |2 overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}| = 5, Also, overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b} = (3, 1), overrightarrow{a} cdot ( overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) = 1 times 3 + 2 times 1 = 5, therefore frac {|2 overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}|}{ overrightarrow{a} cdot ( overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b})} = frac {5}{5} = 1.

Let's denote the triangular pyramid (tetrahedron) with a base ABC and apex D. According to the problem, the planes of the lateral faces (i.e., DAB, DBC, and DCA) form equal angles with the plane of the base ABC. 2. Let alpha be the angle between the planes of any lateral face and the base plane ABC. Let h be the height of the pyramid from the apex D to the base plane ABC.  3. The projection of point D onto the base plane is denoted as point P. We know that P lies in the base plane and the distance from D to P is precisely h. 4. Consider the distance from point P to any edge of the base, say AB. This distance is given by h cdot cot(alpha). To understand this step, we need to observe that the shortest distance from the vertex perpendicular to the plane gives the height of the pyramid, and considering the angle alpha formed with the base plane, the vertical height component along the normal of the base plane is h, while the other corresponding horizontal component directly gives the distance to the edge. 5. By examining the scenario geometrically, we see that if the angles (dihedral angles) between the base and the side faces of the pyramid are equal, many important properties come into play. To solidify this, let's use the concept of the correspondence between equal dihedral angles and the properties of the projection related to incircles and excircles of the base triangles. 6. If the dihedral angles at each edge of the base are equal, the projection P indeed becomes special. It is no ordinary centroidal property but a centralized locus in the sense of tangency and circle properties in planar Tetrahedral structures. Specifically, P must exactly be the center of the circle encompassing tangent distances equal due to symmetrical slope equivalencies. Hence, P is the incenter or the excenter for the circumcircle of the triangle ABC. # Conclusion: - If the dihedral angles of the pyramid's side faces to the base plane are all equal, then the projection of the pyramid's apex onto the base plane is the center of the inscribed or escribed circle of the base triangle. # Final Answer: [ boxed{text{Confirmed, the projection of the apex on the base is the incenter or excenter of the base triangle's circle.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Toothpicks of equal length are used to construct a rectangular grid.

From the original problem solution, we know lfloor x rfloor - {x} = {x} and thus {x} = x - lfloor x rfloor. This implies lfloor x rfloor = 2{x}. Since, lfloor x rfloor = 2 {x}, and {x} could be either 0 or frac{1}{2}, let's test {x} = frac{1}{2} leading lfloor x rfloor = 1 and x=1+frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}. Now, {x}^2 = left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4}, and {{x}^2} = frac{1}{4}. The common difference of the sequence is {x} - {{x}^2} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{4}.

Since x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers, the smallest difference between x and y (to ensure y is greater than x) is 2 (because the next odd number after an even number is exactly 2 units away). However, since y - x must be greater than N, and we are looking for the least possible value of z - x to be 7, we need to find the smallest odd y that satisfies both conditions. Let's start with the smallest possible even x, which is 2 (the smallest positive even integer). The next odd integer y would be 2 + 2 = 4, but since 4 is even, we must choose the next odd integer, which is 5. So, the smallest y that is greater than the smallest even x is 5. Therefore, y - x = 5 - 2 = 3. But y - x must be greater than N, so N must be less than 3 for this to be the smallest possible y that satisfies y - x > N. Now, we need to find the smallest possible odd z such that z - x is at least 7. Starting with x = 2, the smallest z that satisfies this is z = 2 + 7 = 9 (which is also odd, as required).

We aim to show that line ( KO ) is parallel to line ( AC ). 4. In triangle ( AB_1O ), since ( B_1C_1 ) is both an angle bisector and an altitude, ( AB_1O ) forms an isosceles triangle. This is because the angle at vertex ( O ) is bisected and both sides ( OB_1 ) and ( OB_2 ) are equal (radii of the circumcircle). 5. Consequently, examining triangle ( AKO ), where ( K ) is the point of intersection of lines ( AB ) and ( C_1B_1 ), we see that this triangle is also isosceles, which results in ( KO ) being parallel to ( AC ). 6.

In conclusion, the diagonals connecting opposite vertices of the hexagon formed by the intersection of triangles ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ) are indeed parallel to the sides of triangle ( T_1 ) and intersect at a single point, completing the proof.

Hence, these planes are non-intersecting as required by the problem statement. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"the diagram, the value of ( y ) is: (A) 40 (B) 60 (C) 45 (D) 50 (E) 80","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We have a geometric configuration involving several angles, and we need to determine the value of ( y ). 2. **Analyzing Angle Sum in Triangle ( triangle ABC ):**    - Recall the angle sum property of a triangle:       [      angle ABC + angle BAC + angle BCA = 180^circ      ]    - We are given that ( angle ABC = 80^circ ) and ( angle BAC = 60^circ ). 3. **Calculating ( angle BCA ):**    - Substitute the known angles into the angle sum property:      [      80^circ + 60^circ + angle BCA = 180^circ      ]    - Solving for ( angle BCA ):      [      angle BCA = 180^circ - 80^circ - 60^circ = 40^circ      ] 4. **Using Triangle Properties in ( triangle CDE ):**    - We observe that ( angle DCE ) corresponds to ( angle BCA ), thus ( angle DCE = 40^circ ).    - Note that ( triangle CDE ) is a right triangle with ( angle CED = 90^circ ). 5. **Calculating ( y ) in Triangle ( triangle CDE ):**    - Since the angle sum in a triangle is ( 180^circ ), and ( angle CED = 90^circ ):      [      angle DCE + angle CED + y = 180^circ      ]    - By substituting the known values:      [      40^circ + 90^circ + y = 180^circ      ]    - Solve for ( y ):      [      y = 180^circ - 40^circ - 90^circ = 50^circ      ] # Conclusion: The value of ( y ) is ( 50^circ ).

Let's denote the number of points marked on the line as n. Given: 1. The point A lies inside 40 segments. 2. The point B lies inside 42 segments. # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Define Notations:**    Let us denote:    - a_1: the number of points to the left of A.    - a_2: the number of points to the right of A.    - b_1: the number of points to the left of B.    - b_2: the number of points to the right of B. We can assume a_1 leq a_2 and b_1 leq b_2 without loss of generality. 2. **Derive Equations from the Given Conditions:**    The total number of segments that a point lies inside is given by the product of the number of points to its left and right. Therefore, for point A and point B:    [    a_1 cdot a_2 = 40    ]    [    b_1 cdot b_2 = 42    ] Additionally, the number of points to the left of A and B, plus the number of points to the right of A and B includes A and B plus all the other points between them:    [    a_1 + a_2 = b_1 + b_2    ] 3. **Factorization of 40 and 42:**    We need to find pairs (a_1, a_2) and (b_1, b_2) such that their products equal 40 and 42 respectively and their sums are equal.

To understand the geometric meaning of this inequality, consider the line ( y = x ). This line represents the points where the second coordinate is equal to the first coordinate. 3. The inequality ( y > x ) implies that the points of interest are above the line ( y = x ). When the second coordinate is increased (without changing the first coordinate ( x )), the point moves vertically upwards from the line ( y = x ). 4. Since the inequality is strict (( y > x )), the points that lie exactly on the line ( y = x ) do not satisfy the inequality. Hence, the line itself is not included in the solution set. 5. Therefore, the region that contains the points ( M(x, y) ) where ( y > x ) is the area above the line ( y = x ). 6. Alternatively, you can consider shifting the points horizontally to the left from the points on the line ( y = x ).

While this is a characteristic of some rectangles (when the diagonals are also equal), it is not a definitive condition for all rectangles, as other quadrilaterals like kites can also have perpendicular diagonals. Thus, ACbot BD alone does not ensure that ABCD is a rectangle. - **Option C: AB=AC** If one side of the parallelogram is equal to a diagonal, this does not necessarily imply a rectangle. This could indicate a rhombus or other types of quadrilaterals where a side can be equal in length to a diagonal. Hence, AB=AC cannot solely confirm that ABCD is a rectangle. - **Option D: AC=BD** For a parallelogram, if the diagonals are equal, it indicates that the parallelogram is a rectangle.

The absolute sum condition follows:        [    sum_{i=1}^n |r_i| + sum_{j=1}^n |c_j| geq sum_{r=-n}^{n} |r| - n = n^2    ]    This becomes apparent because if all sums are nonnegative, the absolute values of negative rows or columns will cancel and simplify to n^2. 5. **Upper Bound Estimation:**    However, we have another way to estimate this sum:        [    sum_{i=1}^n |r_i| + sum_{j=1}^n |c_j| = sum_{i=1}^k r_i + sum_{i=k+1}^n (-r_i) + sum_{j=1}^{n-k} c_j + sum_{j=n-k+1}^n (-c_j)    ]    Rearranging and considering absolute values:    [    = 2 sum_{i=1}^k sum_{j=1}^{n-k} a_{ij} - 2 sum_{i=k+1}^{n} sum_{j=n-k+1}^{n} a_{ij}    leq 4k (n - k)    ] 6. **Combining Results:**    Equating both bounds:    [    n^2 leq 4k(n-k)    ]    Analyzing the inequality gives us:    [    (n - 2k)^2 leq 0    ]    Which implies:    [    n = 2k    ]    Thus, n must be even. 7. **Constructive Proof by Induction:**    To show that any even n works, we utilize induction. We start with n = 2:        [    begin{matrix}    1 & -1     -1 & 1    end{matrix}    ]    This example satisfies the conditions. Assume an n times n array exists for some even n, where:    [    c_1 = n, c_2 = -n + 1, ldots, c_n = -1     ]    By extending this array to an (n+2) times (n+2) matrix as shown in the problem, each time we increase the array, we ensure the sums' properties are preserved by alternating and compensating, hence obtaining a new valid array with dimensions (n+2) times (n+2). # Conclusion: Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for such an array to exist is that n must be even.

Let ( x ) be the number of knights born in February. Since February in a leap year has 29 days, we know ( x leq 29 ). 2. Then, the number of liars born in February will be ( (29 - x) ).  3. People who answered \\"Yes\\" to being born in February include:    - Knights born in February: ( x )    - Liars born in months other than February (since they would lie): ( 100 - x ) 4. Therefore, the total number of liars in February plus those in other months combined equals:    [    (29 - x) + (100 - x) = 129 - 2x    ] 5. Hence, ( 71 leq 129 - 2x leq 129 ).  6.

The function has two key parts: 2^x, an exponential function with a base of 2, and 3, a constant. - As x tends to 0, 2^x approaches 1 (since any positive number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, f(0) = 2^0 + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4. - As x increases to infty, 2^x increases without bounds, which means f(x) will also increase without bounds. - As x moves from 0 toward infinity, 2^x + 3 grows continuously since exponential functions are continuous and increasing for x > 0. Now, looking at the value as x tends to 0, we start at f(0)=4. As 2^x increases, f(x) will start from 4 and increase to infty.

This result can be derived from properties of numbers in base 10. 3. **Digit Sum Analysis:**    Consider a number ( k ) that is a multiple of ( n ) and contains only the digits 0 and 1. The digit sum of ( k ) is simply the number of ones in ( k ).

This coloring is done independently for each edge. 2. **Fix a Set of ( k ) Vertices:**    Consider a fixed subset of ( k ) vertices from ( K_n ). There are (binom{k}{2}) edges between these ( k ) vertices. We need to calculate the probability that all these edges are the same color. 3. **Probability Calculation:**        The probability that all (binom{k}{2}) edges between ( k ) vertices are all yellow (or all purple) is:    [    2 times left( frac{1}{2} right)^{binom{k}{2}} = 2^{1 - binom{k}{2}}    ] 4. **Union Bound:**        To find the probability that there exists at least one monochromatic ( k )-clique in ( K_n ), we use the union bound. The number of ways to choose ( k ) vertices from ( n ) vertices is (binom{n}{k}). Therefore, the probability of having at least one monochromatic ( k )-clique is bounded by:    [    binom{n}{k} times 2^{1 - binom{k}{2}}    ] 5. **Upper Bound on the Probability:**        We require this probability to be less than 1 for a successful coloring. So,    [    binom{n}{k} times 2^{1 - binom{k}{2}} < 1    ]     6. **Simplifying the Binomial Coefficient:**    Using the bound (binom{n}{k} leq frac{n^k}{k!}), we get:    [    frac{n^k}{k!} times 2^{1 - binom{k}{2}} < 1    ]    Given ( n > 2^{k / 2} ), let ( n leq 2^{k / 2 + c} ) for some small ( c ).

This can be observed using simple approximations or induction.    Thus, it follows that for ( k ge 3 ), the inequality holds, ensuring the probability is less than 1. # Conclusion: This shows that for ( k ge 3 ) and ( n > 2^{k/2} ), it is possible to color the edges of ( K_n ) such that no monochromatic ( k )-cliques exist.

Let's choose a checker, say at position (i,j). 2. Perform the operation of flipping all checkers in the same row i and the same column j, including the selected checker itself. 3. Note that the chosen checker (i,j) is flipped when we perform the operation on row i and is flipped again when we perform the operation on column j. Therefore, the chosen checker (i,j) is flipped an odd number of times. 4. All other checkers in the row i and column j are flipped exactly twice (once when flipping the row and once when flipping the column), which means they return to their original states (since flipping twice is equivalent to no flip). Conclusion: - The chosen checker (i,j) will be flipped and all other checkers will remain the same. Thus, we have flipped exactly one checker on the board. **(b)** To determine if it's possible to make all checkers white on a 5 times 6 board starting from exactly half black checkers: 1. Every time we perform the described operation on a column and row, we change the color of an even number of checkers. 2. This observation is key because if you start with exactly half black (15 black) and half white checkers, each operation changes the color of an even number of checkers. Mathematical reasoning: Upon each operation, the total number of flips must preserve the parity of the number of black checkers. Thus, since there are an odd number of black checkers initially (15), and an even number of flips cannot change the odd parity to even, it is impossible to end with all white (0 black, which is even).

From the top face, there are four adjacent faces (let's call them A, B, C, and D). This provides 4 initial choices. 2. From each of the adjacent faces (e.g., A), there are two other adjacent faces that you can move to (excluding the top and bottom faces and the one just visited). For example, from A, if B and C are the other adjacent faces at the top level, you can move to either B or C, providing 2 choices. 3. From either of these faces, the only remaining option, without visiting any face twice, is to move down to the bottom face. This is always allowed as the last move. Calculating the total number of ways: - 4 initial choices (A, B, C, D). - Each choice leads to 2 subsequent choices. - Hence, the total number of sequences is 4 times 2 = 8.

We need to analyze which of these guesses would be correct:        - By observation:      - \\"not greater than 12\\" is always true since the maximum number of teachers is 12.        Thus, one guess is \\"not greater than 12\\". 3. **Pairwise Comparison of Guesses:**    We can create pairs of mutually exclusive guesses and analyze whether they can both be partially correct. Each pairs consist of:    - (not greater than even number, not less than the next odd number)        Hence, the pairs are:    - \\"not greater than 2\\" and \\"not less than 3\\"    - \\"not greater than 4\\" and \\"not less than 5\\"    - \\"not greater than 6\\" and \\"not less than 7\\"    - \\"not greater than 8\\" and \\"not less than 9\\"    - \\"not greater than 10\\" and \\"not less than 11\\" 4. **Truthfulness of Each Pair:**    Consider the logically feasible pairs:    - Each pair of statements is mutually exclusive but can be balanced:      - \\"not greater than 2\\" implies a choice of exactly 2.      - \\"not less than 3\\" implies a choice of exactly 3.            Both cannot be right simultaneously. Hence each group can have maximum one correct guess. 5. **Counting Correct Guesses:**    - Only one statement from each pair can be true, so:      - Each pair collectively contributes 1 correct guess.      - There are 5 pairs, contributing total: (5) correct guesses.     6. **Summing Up All Correct Guesses:**    Combine the standalone correct statement: \\"not greater than 12\\".

The new area, A', is A' = b times 3h = 3(b times h) = 3A. - Therefore, tripling the height indeed triples the area. This statement is correct. **Option (B): Tripling the base of a triangle triples the area.** - Consider a triangle with base b and height h. - The area of the triangle is A = frac{1}{2}bh. - Tripling the base, the new base is 3b. The new area, A', becomes A' = frac{1}{2}(3b)h = frac{3}{2}bh = 3(frac{1}{2}bh) = 3A. - Tripling the base indeed triples the area.

A line passing through the focus of the parabola y^2=4x intersects the parabola at points A and B. When considering the case where the slope of line AB does not exist, we find that the sum of the x-coordinates equals 2, which meets the condition.

The equation has no solution, leading to the conclusion. **Solution** Solution: The minimum value of a^2+2a+3 (where a in mathbb{R}) is 2. For a line passing through the focus of the parabola y^2=4x and intersecting the parabola at points A and B,   If the slope of line AB does not exist, then the sum of the x-coordinates equals 2, which is suitable.   If the slope of line AB exists, let the slope of line AB be k, then the equation of line AB is y=k(x-1),   Substituting into the parabola y^2=4x gives k^2x^2-2(k^2+2)x+k^2=0,   Since the sum of the x-coordinates of points A and B equals 2,   therefore frac{2({k}^2+2)}{{k}^2}=2,   therefore the equation has no solution,   therefore such a line does not exist.

By substitution of tan alpha: frac{sin alpha + 2cos alpha}{4cos alpha -sin alpha} = frac{tan alpha + 2}{4 - tan alpha} Now we input the value of tan alpha: = frac{2 + 2}{4 - 2} = frac{4}{2} = 2 So, boxed{frac{sin alpha + 2cos alpha}{4cos alpha -sin alpha} = 2}. (2) To evaluate sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha, we can use the identity sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1 to express the entire expression over a common denominator of 1. sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha = frac{sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha}{sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha} Again, replace frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} with tan alpha and cos^2 alpha with 1 - sin ^2 alpha where necessary: = frac{tan alpha cos^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha}{tan^2 alpha cos^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha} Since cos^2 alpha is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out: = frac{tan alpha + 1}{tan^2 alpha + 1} Now replace tan alpha with its known value: = frac{2 + 1}{2^2 + 1} = frac{3}{5} Thus, boxed{sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha = frac{3}{5}}."},{"instruction":"A point (x,y) is randomly picked from inside the rectangle with vertices  (0,0), (4,0), (4,1), and (0,1).

The rectangle is defined by the vertices (0,0), (4,0), (4,1), and (0,1). This means the rectangle has a length of 4 units (along the x-axis) and a height of 1 unit (along the y-axis). Therefore, the area of the rectangle is calculated as: [ text{Area of rectangle} = text{length} times text{height} = 4 times 1 = 4 ] 2. The condition x < y defines a region within this rectangle. To visualize this, consider the line x = y, which is a diagonal line passing through the origin (0,0) and points where x and y are equal. The region where x < y is to the left of this line, within the rectangle. 3. The shaded triangle, which satisfies the condition x < y, is bounded by the lines x = y, y = 1, and x = 0. The base of this triangle is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,1), which is 1 unit long. The height of this triangle is the same as its base because it is a right-angled isosceles triangle formed by the line x = y. Therefore, the area of this triangle is: [ text{Area of triangle} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 1 times 1 = frac{1}{2} ] 4. The probability that a randomly picked point (x,y) from inside the rectangle satisfies x < y is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle. Thus, the probability is calculated as: [ text{Probability} = frac{text{Area of triangle}}{text{Area of rectangle}} = frac{frac{1}{2}}{4} = frac{1}{8} ] Therefore, the probability that a randomly picked point (x,y) from inside the rectangle satisfies x < y is boxed{frac{1}{8}}."},{"instruction":"The local salon offers mani/pedis for 40.00.

We express u^2 as: [ u^2 = (3^x + 3^{-x})^2 = 3^{2x} + 2 + 3^{-2x} ] Thus, 3^{2x} + 3^{-2x} = u^2 - 2.

Thus, the minimum occurs at u = 2, giving: [ y_{min} = 2^2 + 3m cdot 2 + m^2 - 3 = m^2 + 6m + 1 ] Hence, g(x)_{min} = boxed{m^2 + 6m + 1} for m geq -frac{4}{3}. When -frac{3m}{2} > 2, i.e., m < -frac{4}{3}, the minimum of y occurs at u = -frac{3m}{2} because the function is monotonically decreasing before this point and monotonically increasing after. Thus: [ y_{min} = left(-frac{3m}{2}right)^2 + 3m cdot left(-frac{3m}{2}right) + m^2 - 3 = -frac{5}{4}m^2 - 3 ] Therefore, g(x)_{min} = boxed{-frac{5}{4}m^2 - 3} for m < -frac{4}{3}. **Conclusion:** Hence, the minimum value of the function g(x) is given by: [ boxed{ begin{cases}  -frac{5}{4}m^2 - 3, & m < -frac{4}{3}  m^2 + 6m + 1, & m geq -frac{4}{3} end{cases} } ]"},{"instruction":"A chemical factory plans to invest in a new production line, but this requires approval from the environmental protection department before it can go into production.

A salesperson said that the number of attempts is no more than (10+9+8+ldots+2+1=55), and another employee proposed to reduce the number of attempts since if the key does not fit 9 suitcases, it will definitely fit the tenth one.

For example, if you have x moles of N2O5, the molecular weight would be: Molecular weight of x moles of N2O5 = 108 grams/mole * x moles This will give you the total weight in grams for x moles of boxed{N2O5} ."},{"instruction":"Let p, q, r be the sides of a triangle, and let theta, phi, psi be the angles opposite these sides respectively.

(blacksquare) 5. **Constructing the Cycle:**    - Since (mathcal{C}) has more than (frac{k}{2}) vertices, we can choose some ( u in mathcal{C} ) which is connected to either ( a ) or ( b ), say it is connected to ( a ).    - Since there are two edges passing through ( u ) in (mathcal{C}), there is ( v in mathcal{C} ) with ( v ne u_0 ) such that ( uv in mathcal{C} ).    - By our lemma, ( vv_0 in mathcal{C} ) and ( av_0 in G ).    - Continuing this way, we obtain that (mathcal{C}) must look something like ( b_2a_2b_3a_3 cdots b_ka_k ) and ( ab_i in G ) for all ( i = 2,3,ldots,k ). 6. **Final Arrangement:**    - We similarly get that either ( a_1b_i in G ) for all ( i = 2,3,ldots,k ) OR ( b_1a_i in G ) for all ( i = 2,3,ldots,k ).    - If ( a_1b_i in mathcal{C} ) for all ( i = 2,3,ldots,k ):      - We know at least one of ( ab_1 ) or ( ba_1 in G ). Without loss of generality, assume ( ab_1 in G ).      - Then we consider the ( 2k ) length cycle: ( ab_1a_1 cup (mathcal{C} setminus {a_k}) ).    - If ( b_1a_i in mathcal{C} ) for all ( i = 2,3,ldots,k ):      - Again, one of ( ab_1 ) or ( ba_1 in G ). If ( ab_1 in G ), then consider ( b_1a cup mathcal{C} ).      - If ( ba_1 in G ), then consider ( aba_1b_1 cup (a_3b_3a_4b_4 cdots a_kb_k) ). This completes the proof of the problem.

Neighbors for each person in the auditorium can thus range from 3 to 8, while the president and deputies have one or two neighbors. 3.

This gives us the sequence:    [    2, 4, 6, ldots, 1992    ] 5. **Recursive Splitting**: We need to verify that this arrangement works by recursively splitting the sequence. The size of the permutation to verify decreases as follows:    [    1992 to 996 to 498 to 249 to 125 to 63 to 32 to 16 to 8 to 4    ] 6. **Base Case Verification**: For the base case of 4 numbers, we can trivially arrange them as:    [    1, 3, 2, 4    ]    - The arithmetic mean of any two numbers in this sequence is not equal to any number placed between them. 7. **Inductive Step**: If we can arrange (n) numbers such that the condition holds, we can also arrange (2n) numbers by splitting them into odd and even numbers and arranging them as described. 8. **Conclusion**: By recursively applying this process, we can arrange the entire set ({1, 2, ldots, 1992}) such that the arithmetic mean of any two numbers is not equal to any number placed between them.

Next, factorize 84686 to find its prime factors: - Check for divisibility by 2: 84686 is even, so divide by 2, we get 42343. - Check divisibility by smaller primes (3, 5, etc.).
