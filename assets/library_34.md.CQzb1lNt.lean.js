Since A and B have the same x-coordinate (0), the line AB is vertical. Therefore, the line that is perpendicular to AB will be horizontal, and point C will have the same y-coordinate as point B. So, the y-coordinate of point C will be the same as the y-coordinate of point B, which is 4a - 2. Now, let's denote the x-coordinate of point C as x. Since the area of the triangle is given as 63, we can use the formula for the area of a right-angled triangle, which is: Area = (1/2) * base * height In this case, the base of the triangle is the distance between points A and C, which is x (since A is at the origin), and the height is the distance between points A and B, which is 4a - 2. So, we have: 63 = (1/2) * x * (4a - 2) Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we have: 126 = x * (4a - 2) Now, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we need to know the value of a. However, since a is not given, we cannot find a unique solution for x. If you have a value for a, we can proceed to find the x-coordinate of point C.

These are the only pairs where the sum does not exceed 4. 2. **Calculate the probability of each pair:**    Since the chips are drawn without replacement, the probability of drawing any specific pair in a specific order is frac{1}{5} cdot frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{20}.

We are tasked with finding sequences that satisfy the following conditions: 1. ( a_{nm} = a_n a_m ) for all positive integers ( n ) and ( m ). 2. There are infinitely many positive integers ( n ) such that ( {1, 2, ldots, n} = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} ). To solve this, we will use the notation ( f(n) ) to represent our sequence ( a_n ), thus ( f(n) = a_n ).   Fact 1: ( f(1) = 1 ) - **Proof:**   By condition (1), ( f(1) = f(1) cdot f(1) = f(1)^2 ).    Since ( f(1) ) is a positive integer, it must be either 1 or 0.    Therefore, ( f(1) = 1 ).  Fact 2: ( f ) is Bijective - **Proof:**   **Injectivity:**    Assume ( f(a) = f(b) ) for ( a neq b ). According to condition (2), there exists some ( n ) such that ( {1, 2, ldots, n} = {f(1), f(2), ldots, f(n)} ). If ( f(a) = f(b) ), the set will have fewer than ( n ) distinct values, contradicting condition (2). Hence, ( f ) is injective.   **Surjectivity:**    Let ( c ) be any positive integer. Assume ( f(n) neq c ) for all ( n ). According to condition (2), there exists some ( n ) such that ( {1, 2, ldots, n} = {f(1), f(2), ldots, f(n)} ), meaning ( c ) must appear in this set, thus ( c = f(m) ) for some ( m ). Therefore, ( f ) is surjective.  Fact 3: ( n ) is Prime if and only if ( f(n) ) is Prime - **Proof:**   **If ( n ) is prime:**   Assume ( n ) is prime but ( f(n) ) is not. Then ( f(n) = a' b' = f(a) f(b) = f(ab) ) for ( a', b' > 1 ). This means ( a ), ( b > 1 ) and ( a cdot b = n ), which implies ( n ) is composite, a contradiction.   **If ( f(n) ) is prime:**   Assume ( f(n) ) is prime but ( n ) is not. Then ( n = a cdot b ) for ( a, b > 1 ). From the condition (1), ( f(n) = f(a cdot b) = f(a) f(b) ). Since ( f(n) ) is prime, ( f(a) ) or ( f(b) ) must be 1, contradicting injectivity. Thus, ( f(n) ) implies ( n ) is prime.  Fact 4: Unique Factorization Property - **Proof:**   Let ( n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k} ) be the prime factorization. By repeated application of condition (1):   [   f(n) = f(p_1^{a_1}) f(p_2^{a_2}) cdots f(p_k^{a_k}) = f(p_1)^{a_1} f(p_2)^{a_2} cdots f(p_k)^{a_k}   ]   From Fact 3, ( f(p_i) ) are primes. Injectivity ensures these are distinct, giving us a unique factorization.  Fact 5: Technical Result - **Proof:**   We need to show for ( y < x ), there exists ( n_0 ) such that ( y^{n+1} < x^n ) for ( n geq n_0 ).   [   (y+1)^n geq y^n + ny^{n-1} = y^{n-1}(y+n)   ]   Let ( n_0 = y^2 - y + 1 ). For ( n geq n_0 ):   [   (y+1)^n geq y^{n-1}(y + n_0) geq y^{n-1}(y^2 + 1) > y^{n+1}   ] Alternatively,   [   left( frac{x}{y} right)^n > y   ]   holds since the LHS is unbounded as ( n to infty ).  Fact 6: For All Primes ( p ), ( f(p) leq p ) - **Proof:**   Let ( p_1, p_2, p_3, ldots ) be the sequence of increasing primes. For any prime ( p_n ), ( f(p_n) ) must also be a prime (Fact 3). Define ( N ) large enough such that ( N geq p_n^{n_0} ). The set ( {1, 2, ldots, N} = {f(1), f(2), ldots, f(N)} ) and so for some ( alpha geq n_0 ):   Element ( p_n^alpha ) belongs to this set, but ( p_{n+1}^alpha ) does not due to size limitations (Fact 5). Thus:   [   f(p_n^alpha) in {p_1^alpha, ldots, p_n^alpha}   ]   Therefore, ( f(p_n) leq p_n ).  Fact 7: ( f(n) = n ) for All Positive Integers ( n ) - **Proof:**   From Fact 3, ( f(p_n) = p_n ) for all primes ( p_n ). By induction, ( f(p_1) leq p_1 Rightarrow f(2) = 2 ). For ( n geq 2 ):   [   f(p_n) > p_{n-1} Rightarrow f(p_n) leq p_n Rightarrow f(p_n) = p_n   ]   For any ( n ) with factorization ( n = p_1^{a_1} cdot p_2^{a_2} cdots cdot p_k^{a_k} ):   [   f(n) = f(p_1)^{a_1} cdot f(p_2)^{a_2} cdots cdot f(p_k)^{a_k} = p_1^{a_1} cdot p_2^{a_2} cdots cdot p_k^{a_k} = n   ] # Conclusion: Thus, the unique sequence satisfying both conditions is ( a_n = n ).

By our assumption, there exists some natural number ( m ) such that ( P(X) = A^m(X) ).        Similarly, applying rotation ( Q ) to state ( X ), we get ( Q(X) ). By our assumption, there exists some natural number ( n ) such that ( Q(X) = A^n(X) ). 5. **Combine Rotations:**    According to our previous definitions, combining these rotations, we should have:    [    P(Q(X)) = A^{m+n}(X) quad text{and} quad Q(P(X)) = A^{m+n}(X)    ] 6. **Check for Commutativity:**    However, it is straightforward to verify that performing ( P ) followed by ( Q ) is not the same as performing ( Q ) followed by ( P ). Specifically, the result of performing these sequences of operations on the Rubik's cube will lead to different states. This non-commutativity can be observed through physical experimentation or theoretical demonstration using rotation matrices. 7. **Contradiction:**    The assumption that ( P(Q(X)) = Q(P(X)) ) leads to a contradiction, because the actual states resulting from these operations are different. This contradicts the initial assumption that ( A ) is a generating combination of rotations. # Conclusion: Therefore, there does not exist a generating combination of rotations for the Rubik's cube: [ boxed{text{There does not exist a generating combination.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let D(k) denote the number of positive divisors of k.

Expanding the left side: w^2 + 30w + 225. Expanding the right side using the distributive property: 4w(3w+6) + 9(3w+6) = 12w^2 + 24w + 27w + 54 = 12w^2 + 51w + 54. Equating and simplifying both sides: w^2 + 30w + 225 = 12w^2 + 51w + 54, 0 = 11w^2 + 21w - 171. To find w^2, we need to solve for w. Rearranging the equation we obtain: 11w^2 + 21w - 171 = 0. Using the quadratic formula w = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, where a = 11, b = 21, c = -171, b^2 - 4ac = 21^2 - 4 times 11 times (-171) = 441 + 7524 = 7965, w = frac{-21 pm sqrt{7965}}{22}.

There are 19 candies left to be shared with others after all the previous steps. We need to find out how many candies each sibling received. To do this, we need to work backwards from the end of the problem. First, let's add the 19 candies that are left to the 16 candies Josh wants to eat for himself: 19 (leftover candies) + 16 (Josh's candies) = 35 candies These 35 candies are what's left after Josh gave half of the remaining candies to his best friend. So, the amount before giving to his best friend was double that: 35 (candies before giving to friend) * 2 = 70 candies This means that before Josh gave candies to his best friend, he had 70 candies left after giving some to his siblings. Now, let's find out how many candies Josh gave to his siblings in total. We started with 100 candies and had 70 left before giving to his best friend: 100 (original candies) - 70 (candies before giving to friend) = 30 candies given to siblings Since Josh has 3 siblings and he gave them 30 candies in total, we can divide the total number of candies given to siblings by the number of siblings to find out how many each sibling received: 30 (candies given to siblings) / 3 (siblings) = 10 candies per sibling Each sibling received boxed{10}  gummy bear candies."},{"instruction":"Vijay owns a furniture store where he sells various items.

First, set m = 1 in the given condition. Then, for any positive integer n:        0 leq a_n + a_{2n} leq 1.        Thus, a_n in {0, 1}, and there are infinite values of n for which a_n = 0. 3. We next show that there are infinitely many positive integers n for which        a_n + a_{2n} = 0.     4. Assume, for contradiction, that only finitely many n satisfy a_n + a_{2n} = 0. Then, there exists a positive integer N such that for all n geq N:        a_n + a_{2n} = 1.     5. Since there are infinitely many n such that a_n = 0, we can choose a positive integer d > N such that a_d = 0. 6.

Given id, 2id geq N, we get from our assumption:        sum_{i=1}^{2m} (a_{id} + a_{2id}) = sum_{i=1}^{2m} 1 = 2m.        Hence:        sum_{i=1}^{2m} a_{id} = m.     7.

Since a_{d} = 0:        a_{2d} = 1 - a_d = 1,            a_{4d} = 1 - a_{2d} = 0,            a_{8d} = 1 - a_{4d} = 1.     9. From the condition (by setting m = 2), we determine that:        a_{3d} = 1.     10. Thus, from a_{6d} and a_{12d}, we find:        a_{6d} = 1 - a_{3d} = 0,            a_{12d} = 1 - a_{6d} = 1.     11.

Since she has three times as many dimes as nickels, she has: 3 dimes/nickel * 20 nickels = 60 dimes Since she has twice as many quarters as dimes, she has: 2 quarters/dime * 60 dimes = 120 quarters Now, Val finds twice as many nickels as she had in her brother's treasure box. So she finds: 2 * 20 nickels = 40 nickels Adding these to her initial 20 nickels, she now has: 20 nickels + 40 nickels = 60 nickels Now let's calculate the total value of each type of coin in dollars.

Given any (epsilon > 0), we can find a sequence ( {x_n} ) such that the corresponding sum is less than ( k + epsilon ): [ frac{x_0^2}{x_1} + frac{x_1^2}{x_2} + cdots + frac{x_{n-1}^2}{x_n} < k + epsilon. ] Rewriting the sum, let us consider: [ frac{x_0^2}{x_1} + frac{x_1 left( left(frac{x_1}{x_1}right)^2right)}{frac{x_2}{x_1}} + frac{left(frac{x_2}{x_1}right)^2}{frac{x_3}{x_1}} + cdots + frac{left(frac{x_n}{x_1}right)^2}{frac{x_{n+1}}{x_1}} + cdots ] The series inside the parentheses is another sum of the same type, so it is at least ( k ). Hence: [ k + epsilon > frac{1}{x_1} + x_1 k, ] This inequality must hold for all (epsilon > 0), leading to: [ k geq frac{1}{x_1} + x_1 k. ] Consider the function ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} + kx ). The minimum value of ( f(x) ) is achieved when ( f'(x) = 0 ): [ f'(x) = -frac{1}{x^2} + k = 0 implies kx^2 = 1 implies x = frac{1}{sqrt{k}}. ] Substitute ( x = frac{1}{sqrt{k}} ) into the original function: [ fleft(frac{1}{sqrt{k}}right) = frac{1}{frac{1}{sqrt{k}}} + k left(frac{1}{sqrt{k}}right) = sqrt{k} + sqrt{k} = 2sqrt{k}. ] Thus, since ( k geq 2sqrt{k} ), squaring both sides gives: [ k^2 geq 4k implies k geq 4. ] Therefore, we have shown that ( k geq 4 ), implying: [ frac{x_0^2}{x_1} + frac{x_1^2}{x_2} + cdots + frac{x_{n-1}^2}{x_n} geq 4, ] for sufficiently large ( n ). # Conclusion: For every such sequence, there exists an ( n geq 1 ) such that: [ frac{x_0^2}{x_1} + frac{x_1^2}{x_2} + cdots + frac{x_{n-1}^2}{x_n} geq 3.999. ] (blacksquare)  Part (b): We need to find a sequence ( {x_n} ) for which: [ frac{x_0^2}{x_1} + frac{x_1^2}{x_2} + cdots + frac{x_{n-1}^2}{x_n} < 4 quad text{for all } n. ] Consider the sequence ( {x_n} ) defined by ( x_n = frac{1}{2^n} ). For this sequence, we calculate the sums: [ frac{x_0^2}{x_1} + frac{x_1^2}{x_2} + cdots + frac{x_{n-1}^2}{x_n}  ] This sum transforms as follows: [ frac{1}{frac{1}{2}} + left(frac{frac{1}{2}}{frac{1}{4}}right) + left(frac{frac{1}{4}}{frac{1}{8}}right) + cdots + left(frac{frac{1}{2^{n-1}}}{frac{1}{2^n}}right) ] Simplifying each term, we get: [ 2 + 1 + frac{1}{2} + cdots + frac{1}{2^{n-2}} ] This series sums to: [ 2 + 1 + frac{1}{2} + cdots + frac{1}{2^{n-2}} = 4 - frac{1}{2^{n-2}}. ] Since ( frac{1}{2^{n-2}} > 0, ) we have: [ 4 - frac{1}{2^{n-2}} < 4. ] Thus, for the sequence ( x_n = frac{1}{2^n} ): [ frac{x_0^2}{x_1} + frac{x_1^2}{x_2} + cdots + frac{x_{n-1}^2}{x_n} < 4, ] for all ( n ).

The volume of half the pyramid is given by: [ frac{a b m}{6} ] Where ( a ) and ( b ) are the lengths of the sides of the rectangular base.

Determine how to color each of these wires using one of five colors so that five wires of different colors emerge from each computer.","output":"Let's tackle the problem step-by-step:  1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to color each wire in a network of six computers (or ЭВМ) such that each of the six computers has exactly five connecting wires, each of a different color. Since each computer is connected to every other computer, we need to find a way to use five colors to paint each wire. 2. **Graph Representation**:     - Represent the computers as vertices of a complete graph ( K_6 ).     - There are ( binom{6}{2} = 15 ) edges (wires) in ( K_6 ).     - We need to color these edges using 5 different colors such that no two edges incident to the same vertex (computer) have the same color. 3. **Edge Coloring and Vizing's Theorem**:     - According to Vizing's Theorem, the chromatic index of a simple graph is either ( Delta(G) ) or ( Delta(G) + 1 ), where ( Delta(G) ) is the maximum degree of a vertex in ( G ).     - For ( K_6 ), ( Delta(K_6) = 5 ). Hence, the chromatic index is either 5 or 6.     - A well-known result for complete graphs ( K_{2n} ) is that they are edge-colorable using ( 2n-1 ) colors. So ( K_6 ) can indeed be edge-colored using 5 colors. 4. **Constructing the Edge Coloring**:     - We now provide a coloring scheme for the edges of ( K_6 ):       Edge Coloring Scheme:          - Label the vertices as ( A, B, C, D, E, F ).     - Color the edges as follows (the color names are arbitrary and can be denoted as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5):         - ( A-B ): Color 1         - ( A-C ): Color 2         - ( A-D ): Color 3         - ( A-E ): Color 4         - ( A-F ): Color 5         - ( B-C ): Color 3         - ( B-D ): Color 4         - ( B-E ): Color 5         - ( B-F ): Color 2         - ( C-D ): Color 5         - ( C-E ): Color 2         - ( C-F ): Color 4         - ( D-E ): Color 1         - ( D-F ): Color 5         - ( E-F ): Color 3 5. **Verification**:     - Each vertex should have each of the 5 colors exactly once in its incident edges.     - Check for each vertex if the edges incident to it are distinctly colored. Following this scheme ensures that each computer (vertex) has exactly five wires (edges) of different colors connecting it to the other computers. # Conclusion: The wires can be effectively colored using 5 different colors as outlined above, ensuring that the requirement is satisfied for all six computers.

Let's break the solution down into detailed steps: 1. **Defining the function (f_alpha)**:        The function (f_alpha(x) = lfloor alpha x rfloor) maps (x) to the greatest integer less than or equal to (alpha x). 2. **Setting up the problem with our choice of (alpha = e^{-1/n^2})**:        We need to show that:        [ f_{alpha}^k(n^2) = n^2 - k quad text{for} quad 1 leq k leq n, ]        where (f_{alpha}^k) denotes the (k)-fold composition (f_alpha circ f_alpha circ cdots circ f_alpha). 3. **Understanding the properties of ( alpha )**:        We require (alpha(n^2 - k) < n^2 - k), meaning (alpha < 1). This ensures ( lfloor alpha (n^2 - k) rfloor leq n^2 - k - 1 ).

We need to determine whether the elements of A can be grouped into subsets of three elements such that each group forms an equilateral triangle.  Definitions and Preliminary Analysis: 1. **Point Classification**: Let's classify a point left(x_1, ldots, x_nright) as:    - **Odd Point**: If x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_n is odd.    - **Even Point**: If x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_n is even. 2. **Equilateral Triangle Condition**: For three points X left(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_nright), Y left(y_1, y_2, ldots, y_nright), and Z left(z_1, z_2, ldots, z_nright) to form an equilateral triangle, the distances between them must be equal. The Euclidean distance squared between each pair is:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n}left(x_i - y_iright)^2 = sum_{i=1}^{n}left(y_i - z_iright)^2 = sum_{i=1}^{n}left(z_i - x_iright)^2.    ]  Proof Step-by-Step: **Conclusion 1**: If points X, Y, Z form an equilateral triangle, then all three points are either all odd or all even. - **Proof**:    - Consider any integer (k). Notice that (k^2 equiv k pmod{2}).    - Using this, we get:      [      sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 equiv sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - z_i)^2 equiv sum_{i=1}^{n} (z_i - x_i)^2 pmod{2}.      ]    - It follows due to the equilibrium:      [      sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 + sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - z_i)^2 + sum_{i=1}^{n} (z_i - x_i)^2 equiv 0 pmod{2}.      ]    - Since each term is equal, we have:      [      3 sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 equiv 0 pmod{2}.      ]    - This means:      [      sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 equiv 0 pmod{2}.      ]    - Therefore, the sum of (n) numbers (x_1 - y_1), (x_2 - y_2), ldots, (x_n - y_n) must be even for the equivalences to hold. Since this needs to be true for all pairs, X, Y, Z must all be odd or all be even. **Conclusion 2**: Let o be the number of odd points and e be the number of even points in set A. We claim that |o - e| = 1. - **Proof by Induction**:    - **Base Case** (n = 1): Clearly, this holds as there are equal numbers of odd and even numbers.    - **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume that for n-1, the number of odd and even points differ by at most 1.    - **Inductive Step** for n:      - Consider the set A_k = left{ left( x_1, ldots, x_n right) in A mid x_1 = k right}.      - Let o_k and e_k be the number of odd and even points in A_k respectively.      - By the hypothesis:        [        |o_1 - e_1| = 1, quad o_k - e_k = (-1)^{k-1}(o_1 - e_1).        ]      - Summing over all (k), we have:        [        |o - e| = left| sum_{k=1}^{6063} (o_k - e_k) right| = left| (o_1 - e_1) sum_{k=1}^{6063} (-1)^{k-1} right| = 1.        ] Therefore, |o - e| = 1 holds.  Conclusion: - Given the above results, if we suppose we can group the points such that each group has 3 elements forming an equilateral triangle, this would require the number of odd points and even points to both be multiples of 3. - However, since the number of odd points and even points differ by exactly 1, this is impossible. Hence, it is not possible to group the elements of A to always form equilateral triangles.

The numerator simplifies as follows using the difference of squares:        (sqrt{9+2x} - 5)(sqrt{9+2x} + 5) = (sqrt{9+2x})^2 - 5^2 = (9 + 2x) - 25 = 2x - 16        Thus, our expression becomes:        lim_{x rightarrow 8} frac{2x - 16}{(sqrt[3]{x} - 2)(sqrt{9+2x} + 5)}     4. Factor out (2) from the numerator:        2(x - 8)        So, the expression now is:        lim_{x rightarrow 8} frac{2(x - 8)}{(sqrt[3]{x} - 2)(sqrt{9+2x} + 5)}     5. Notice that ((x - 8)) can be factored into the form involving cube roots by recognizing (sqrt[3]{x} - 2):        (x - 8) = (sqrt[3]{x})^3 - 2^3 = (sqrt[3]{x} - 2)(sqrt[3]{x^2} + 2sqrt[3]{x} + 4)     6. Substitute this factorization back into our limit expression:        lim_{x rightarrow 8} frac{2(sqrt[3]{x} - 2)(sqrt[3]{x^2} + 2sqrt[3]{x} + 4)}{(sqrt[3]{x} - 2)(sqrt{9+2x} + 5)}     7. The terms ((sqrt[3]{x} - 2)) cancel out from the numerator and the denominator:        lim_{x rightarrow 8} frac{2(sqrt[3]{x^2} + 2sqrt[3]{x} + 4)}{sqrt{9+2x} + 5}     8. Evaluate the remaining expression at (x = 8):        sqrt[3]{8} = 2        Hence,        lim_{x rightarrow 8} frac{2(sqrt[3]{8^2} + 2sqrt[3]{8} + 4)}{sqrt{9 + 2(8)} + 5}     9. Simplifying each part:        sqrt[3]{64} = 4, quad 2sqrt[3]{8} = 2 cdot 2 = 4, quad sqrt{25} = 5     10. The resulting values:          2(4 + 4 + 4) = 2 cdot 12 = 24          And,          sqrt{25} + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10      11. The limit therefore becomes:          frac{24}{10} = 2.4      # Conclusion: [ boxed{2.4} ]"},{"instruction":"James is nine years older than Louise.

Define a **reachable array** as an array that can be obtained from the original array ( A ) by changing the signs of some or all of its ( mn ) entries by changing the signs of entire rows or columns. 2. **Number of Reachable Arrays:**     Each entry in the array can have its sign changed up to once via row or column changes. Therefore, every entry has 2 possibilities (positive or negative), resulting in at most ( 2^{m+n} ) different reachable arrays (since each of the ( m ) rows and ( n ) columns can independently have their signs changed or not changed). 3. **Total Sum Calculation:**     For each reachable array, compute the sum of all its entries. Let ( S ) denote the sum of the elements of the original array ( A ):     [     S = sum_{i=1}^{m} sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}     ]     If we denote a reachable array as ( B ), then the total sum of the elements of ( B ) can be written as some transformation of the entries of ( A ). 4. **Maximum Total Sum:**     Consider the reachable array ( B ) that maximizes the total sum of its entries. Denote this maximal sum by ( S_{max} ):     [     S_{max} = max left{ sum_{i=1}^{m} sum_{j=1}^{n} b_{ij}  big|  B text{ is a reachable array} right}     ] 5. **Properties of the Optimal Array:**     Take the reachable array ( B ) corresponding to ( S_{max} ). We argue that if ( B ) has any row or column with a negative sum, this leads to a contradiction because we can increase the total sum by flipping the sign of that row or column, contradicting the assumption that ( S_{max} ) is the largest achievable sum. 6. **Flipping Signs to Increase Sum:**     Suppose ( B ) has a row ( i ) sum ( sum_{j=1}^{n} b_{ij} ) that is negative. If we were to flip the sign of every entry in row ( i ), the total sum of the array ( B ) would increase because:     [     sum_{j=1}^{n} (-b_{ij}) = - sum_{j=1}^{n} b_{ij}     ]     Flipping the signs changes a negative sum to a positive one, hence increasing the total sum.     Similarly, if ( B ) has a column ( j ) sum ( sum_{i=1}^{m} b_{ij} ) that is negative, flipping the signs of every entry in column ( j ) would increase the total sum. 7. **Conclusion:**     Since flipping signs of rows or columns with negative sums leads to a higher total sum, the maximum sum ( S_{max} ) reachable array ( B ) will have all row and column sums non-negative.

To find such a number, we consider three-digit numbers, as their squares can be six-digit numbers containing all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once without including 0.    2.

To have a number and its square containing these digits exactly once each (excluding 0), the sum of the digits of the number and the digits of its square must be a multiple of 9. 3.

For 3^3 to be a factor, we need at least 3^3 in the product. We already have 3^1 in 936, so we need at least 3^2 in w. For 10^2 to be a factor, we need at least 2^2 * 5^2 in the product. We already have 2^3 in 936, which is more than enough for the 2^2 requirement. However, we don't have any 5s in 936, so we need 5^2 in w.

To make 3^3 a factor, we need at least two more 3s, and to make 10^2 a factor, we need one more 5. So, we need to multiply 120 by 3^2 * 5^1 to get the smallest w that includes the necessary factors.

Maria then traveled ( frac{1}{4} ) of the remaining distance before her second stop. The distance she traveled between her first and second stop is ( frac{1}{4}(480 - 480x) ) miles. After her second stop, she drove the remaining 180 miles to her destination. So, the total distance Maria traveled before her second stop is the sum of the distance traveled before her first stop and the distance traveled between her first and second stops: [ 480x + frac{1}{4}(480 - 480x) = 480 - 180 ] [ 480x + 120 - 120x = 300 ] [ 360x + 120 = 300 ] [ 360x = 180 ] [ x = frac{180}{360} ] [ x = frac{1}{2} ] Therefore, Maria traveled ( boxed{frac{1}{2}}  ) or one-half of the total distance before her first stop."},{"instruction":"Rahim bought 65 books for Rs. 1160 from one shop and 50 books for Rs. 920 from another.

Since Kamil hired two professionals and one of them is being paid 15 per hour, the total hourly cost of both professionals is 15 + x. They work for 6 hours a day, so the daily cost of their work is 6 * (15 + x). Let's denote the number of days they worked as d. The total cost for hiring the professionals for d days is the daily cost multiplied by the number of days: Total cost = d * 6 * (15 + x) We know the total cost is 1260, so we can set up the equation: 1260 = d * 6 * (15 + x) Now, we need to find the value of x. Since we don't have enough information to determine x directly, we can assume that the total hourly rate for both professionals is the same, which means the second professional is also paid 15 per hour.

To find the intersection of the complement of M in I and N, we first determine the sets M and N: - M = {x | (x + 3)^2 leq 0} only contains the element x=-3, since a square is non-negative and only zero when the value being squared is zero. Thus, M = {-3}. - N = {x | x^2 + x - 6 = 0} is the set of solutions to the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 6 = 0. Solving it by factoring, we get (x+3)(x-2) = 0.

We are given a quadrilateral (ABCD) with the properties:    - (angle BAC = angle CAD = 60^{circ})    - (AB + AD = AC)    - (angle ACD = 23^{circ}) 2. To solve for the angle (angle ABC), first observe that the statement (AB + AD = AC) suggests placing a point (K) on the ray (AB) such that (AK = AC). 3. Consider triangle (KAC):    - Since (AK = AC), triangle (KAC) is isosceles.    - Given (angle BAC = 60^{circ}), and (angle KAC = 60^{circ}), triangle (KAC) must be equilateral.        Hence, all angles in (triangle KAC) are (60^{circ}), particularly (angle AKC = 60^{circ}). 4. Now calculate the lengths:    - (BK = AK - AB)    - Using the property (AK = AC) and the given relationship (AB + AD = AC), we have:      [      BK = AC - AB = AD      ]    Thus, ( BK = AD ). 5. Considering triangles (BKC) and (DAC):    - Both triangles have sides (BK = AD), (KC = AC), and (angle AKC = angle DAC = 60^{circ}).    - By Side-Angle-Side (SAS) similarity theorem, triangles (BKC) and (DAC) are congruent. 6. Thus, the exterior angle (angle ABC) in (triangle BKC) (which is the same as the exterior angle (angle ADC) in (triangle DAC)) can be calculated as follows:    [    angle ABC = angle ACD + angle CAD = 23^{circ} + 60^{circ} = 83^{circ}    ] # Conclusion: The measure of angle (angle ABC) is ( boxed{83^{circ}} )."},{"instruction":"A container is filled with water.

First, let's find Roger's age using the information that his age is the average of Jill and Alex's ages. Since Jill is 20 years old now, let's denote Jill's age as J = 20. Roger's age is the average of Jill and Alex's ages, so let's denote Roger's age as R and Alex's age as A. Then we have: R = (J + A) / 2 We know J = 20, so we can write: R = (20 + A) / 2 Now, let's find Alex's age in terms of Finley's age in 10 years. Let's denote Finley's current age as F.

The players take turns flipping one card at a time. The losing condition is that if any player, after their move, causes a previously seen arrangement (including the initial arrangement) to reappear. Chekalinsky makes the first move. To determine: Who can guarantee a win regardless of the opponent's moves? 1. **Initial Strategy**:    Chekalinsky (C) starts by flipping one specific card, such as the Queen of Spades (Q♠). 2. **Position Analysis**:    Each possible arrangement of the cards can be grouped into pairs that differ only by the position of Q♠. For instance, if the position of Q♠ is flipped, you move from one arrangement in the pair to the other.     3. **Opponent's Strategy**:    If Hermann (H) flips the Q♠ card solely in response to C flipping it, they will create a repetition of the previous arrangement where Q♠ started. This results in a loss for H as per the rules. 4. **Forced Choices**:    Since flipping Q♠ again by H results in an immediate loss, H is forced to flip another card. 5. **Chekalinsky Response**:    No matter which other card H flips, C can always respond by flipping Q♠, thus transitioning the board to the paired position arising from H's move. 6. **Winning Strategy**:    As C continues to leverage this strategy, the system essentially resets to a new state defined by the pair transformation rule of the Q♠ being flipped. 7. **Finite State Consideration**:    There are (2^{13}) (8192) possible states (arrangements) of the 13 cards. Hence, moving between these states in a carefully managed flip of Q♠, C ensures that H must eventually transition into a repeat state, having exhausted all combinations where H has to flip another card. # Conclusion: Since Chekalinsky can enforce a move pairing mechanism that Hermann cannot indefinitely avoid without causing a state repetition, Chekalinsky guarantees a win regardless of Hermann's strategy.

This implies that the product is divisible by ( 10^8 = 2^8 cdot 5^8 ).     Since the sum of those three numbers, 1003, is not divisible by 5, at least one of these numbers must not be divisible by 5.

For their product to be divisible by ( 5^8 ), at least one of these numbers should contribute ( 5^8 ) or the product of some other two should meet this requirement. 6. **Analyze the conditions:**     - If a number is divisible by ( 5^5 ), it becomes ( geq 3125 > 1003 ). So, not feasible.     - If two numbers each provide at least ( 5^4 ), then their sum must be even larger than the feasible total:         [         2 cdot 5^4 = 625 + 625 = 1250 , text{which is} > 1003         ]          Therefore, it’s impossible to have the product end with more than 7 zeros due to the restrictions imposed by adding to 1003 while individually being divisible by high powers of 5. # Conclusion: The largest possible value of ( N ) is ( 7 ).

We need to determine which digits from 0 to 9 can be the units digit of some prime numbers.     2. **List Obvious Prime Numbers and Their Units Digits:**    - The prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7 immediately give us units digits of 2, 3, 5, and 7, because these numbers themselves are prime. 3. **Consider Units Digit 1:**    - A number ending in 1 can be a prime number. For instance, 11 is a prime number, and it ends in 1. Other examples include 31, 41, 61, etc. Thus, 1 can also be the units digit of a prime number. 4. **Consider Units Digit 4:**    - Any number ending in 4 is even. The only even prime number is 2. Hence, any number ending in 4 and greater than 2 cannot be prime. Therefore, 4 cannot be the units digit of a prime number. 5. **Consider Units Digit 6:**    - Any number ending in 6 is also even. Similarly, since the only even prime number is 2, a number ending in 6 and greater than 2 cannot be prime. So, 6 cannot be the units digit of a prime number. 6. **Consider Units Digit 8:**    - Any number ending in 8 is even. Again, since the only even prime number is 2, a number ending in 8 and greater than 2 cannot be prime.

Consider a circle with diameter ( AE ) where ( A ) and ( E ) are points on the circumference. Let ( B ) and ( C ) be other points on the circumference such that ( BC ) and ( AB ) are chords. 3. By the properties of a circle, the angles subtended by the same chord are equal. That is, ( angle BEA = angle BCP ) and ( angle ABE = angle BPC = 90^circ ). 4. Consequently, ( angle EAB = angle CBP ). Since ( E ) is the endpoint of the diameter ( AE ) and ( B ) is a point on the circumference that forms a right angle with the diameter (Thales' theorem), ( angle EBA = 90^circ ). 5. Observe that the angles subtended by the chords ( EB ) and ( CD ) are equal, implying that ( EB = CD ) because arcs subtending these equal angles are equal in length, corresponding to equal chords. 6. Given that (angle EBA = 90^circ ), the distance from point ( O ) (the center of the circle) to the chord ( AB ) is the perpendicular distance, which would be half the length of the chord ( EB ). 7.

We can now substitute B into the ratio equation to find R: R/90 = 3/8 To solve for R, we cross-multiply: R * 8 = 3 * 90 R * 8 = 270 Now, divide both sides by 8 to isolate R: R = 270 / 8 R = 33.75 Since the number of cars cannot be a fraction, we round to the nearest whole number.

We will use graph theory to model the problem, where each person is a vertex and each handshake is an edge. 1. **Model the problem using graph theory:**    - Let the five people be represented by vertices ( V = {A, B, C, D, E} ).    - Let an edge between two vertices represent a handshake between the corresponding people. 2. **Define a trio:**    - A trio ((A, B, C)) is defined as:      - (A) shakes hands with (B) and (B) shakes hands with (C), or      - (A) does not shake hands with (B) and (B) does not shake hands with (C). 3. **Count the number of trios:**    - We need to count the number of trios in the graph. Since ((A, B, C)) and ((C, B, A)) are considered the same, we need to consider unordered triples. 4. **Analyze the possible configurations:**    - We need to find a configuration of handshakes that minimizes the number of trios.    - A cycle of length 5 (a pentagon) is a good candidate for minimizing the number of trios. 5. **Construct a cycle of length 5:**    - Consider the vertices (A, B, C, D, E) arranged in a cycle: (A-B-C-D-E-A).    - In this configuration, each vertex is connected to two other vertices, forming a cycle. 6. **Count the trios in the cycle:**    - In a cycle of length 5, each vertex is part of exactly one trio where the vertices are connected by edges.    - For example, the trio ((A, B, C)) is formed by the edges (A-B) and (B-C).    - Similarly, the trio ((A, E, D)) is formed by the non-edges (A-E) and (E-D). 7. **Verify the number of trios:**    - There are 5 vertices, and each vertex is part of exactly one trio.    - Therefore, the total number of trios is 5. 8. **Conclusion:**    - The minimum number of trios in a group of five people, where some pairs shake hands and others do not, is 10.

(1) Solution: When n=4, there is only one subset in set M that meets the condition, so S_4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10,   When n=5, each element in set M appears C_4^3 times, so S_5 = C_4^3(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = 40,   When n=6, each element in set M appears C_5^3 times, so S_6 = C_5^3(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 140,   Therefore, when the set M has n elements, each element appears C_{n-1}^3 times, hence S_n = C_{n-1}^3 cdot frac{n(n+1)}{2}.

We are given that the extension of O_1A intersects odot O_2 at point C, and the extension of O_2A intersects odot O_1 at point D. By the definition of C and D, we can see that C lies on odot O_2 and D lies on odot O_1. Observe the angle relationships between these points: Since points A, B, C, D exhibit symmetry under inversion, we can utilize the fact that they form cyclic quadrilaterals. Specifically, the cyclic nature can be observed by noting that: [ angle BCA = angle BDA ] Since these angles subtend the same arc in their respective circles, we conclude that O_1, B, O_2, C, and D must lie on a common circle. 2. **Step 2: Prove that O_1C and O_2D are the angle bisectors of triangle BCD.** We need to show that O_1C and O_2D bisect the angles angle BCD and angle BDC respectively. Consider triangle O_1BC and triangle O_2BD. In these triangles: - O_1C is a bisector of angle BCD because by the definition of C, it is fixed by the symmetric positions and the cyclic nature confirmed earlier. - Similarly, O_2D bisects angle BDC because D provides the symmetric intersection point ensuring that angle BDC = angle O_1DC by the cyclic nature. Consequently, we observe that O_1C and O_2D are indeed the internal angle bisectors of triangle BCD. # Conclusion: By proving the concyclicity and the bisector properties, we conclude that A serves as the incenter of triangle BCD.

We aim to show that (X) lies on (omega). 5. **Properties of the Circle and Parallelogram**:    - Since (O) is the midpoint of (BD), (OB = OD).    - Since (O) is the center of (omega), (OT = OC).    - Since (T) is on (CD) and (omega), (T) is equidistant from (O) and (C). 6. **Parallel Lines and Angles**:    - Since (OB = OD) and (OT = OC), the line (TM) (where (M) is the other intersection of (OB) with (omega)) is parallel to (BD).    - This implies (angle OBD = angle ODB = alpha). 7. **Rectangle Formation**:    - Let (L) and (Y) be the feet of the perpendiculars from (O) onto (TM) and (BD) respectively.    - Since (TM parallel BD), (angle OTM = angle OBD = alpha).    - Since (AY = YC) and (OT = OC), (OY parallel AT). 8. **Right Angles and Concurrency**:    - The conditions (OY parallel AT) and the right angles at (Y) and (L) imply that (TKYL) forms a rectangle.    - Therefore, (angle ATM = 90^circ = angle XTM). 9. **Angle Relationships**:    - From the previous steps, (angle MOC = 2alpha) implies (angle OCM = 90^circ - alpha).    - Since (triangle TXM) has (angle XTM = 90^circ) and (angle OMT = alpha), we have (angle TXM = 90^circ - alpha = angle OCM = angle TCM). 10. **Conclusion**:     - Since (T), (M), and (C) lie on (omega), (X) must also lie on (omega).     - Therefore, (AT), (BO), and (omega) are concurrent.

These are indeed tangent lines to the ellipse at the points (4, 0) and (-4, 0). - **Case 2:** When y_{0} neq 0, we start with the given condition that P(x_{0}, y_{0}) lies on the ellipse, which means frac{x_{0}^2}{16} + frac{y_{0}^2}{4} = 1.     Substituting y = frac{16 - x_{0}x}{4y_{0}} into the ellipse equation x^2 + 4y^2 = 16, we get:     [   x^2 - 2x_{0}x + 16 - 4y_{0}^2 = 0   ]   The discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation is:     [   Delta = x_{0}^2 - 4(16 - 4y_{0}^2) = x_{0}^2 + 4y_{0}^2 - 16 = 0   ]   Since Delta = 0, it indicates that there is exactly one solution for x, meaning the line is tangent to the ellipse at a single point.

Since P(x_{0}, y_{0}) is the external point from which the tangents are drawn, it satisfies both tangent equations, leading to frac{x_{1}x_{0}}{16} + frac{y_{1}y_{0}}{4} = 1 and frac{x_{2}x_{0}}{16} + frac{y_{2}y_{0}}{4} = 1.

The number of pens is 2010, and the number of pencils is 1050. Let's calculate the GCD of 2010 and 1050: 2010 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 67 1050 = 2 × 3 × 5^2 × 7 The common prime factors are 2, 3, and 5. The highest powers of the common prime factors that divide both numbers are 2, 3, and 5 (to the power of 1, since 5^2 does not divide 2010). So, the GCD(2010, 1050) = 2 × 3 × 5 = 30. This means that the pens and pencils can be distributed equally among 30 students. Now, for the notebooks, since each student must get a different number of notebooks, the number of notebooks must be at least the number of students, which is 30. However, there is no upper limit given for the number of notebooks, so theoretically, there could be any number of notebooks as long as each student gets a different number.

There is an inner circle omega which is tangent to Gamma at point T and also tangent to the line segment (A B). 2. **Denote Intersection and Relations:**    We denote T', the point where (A B) is tangent to omega. Let S be the second intersection of the line (T T') with Gamma.     3. **Consider a Homothety:**    Consider a homothety centered at T that maps circle omega to circle Gamma. This homothety will map the tangents from the circles accordingly.     - The line (A B), which is tangent to omega at T', will get mapped to the tangent (t) at point S on Gamma. Consequently, these two lines are parallel: (A B) parallel (t).     4. **Analyze the Angle Relations:**    Since (A B) is tangent to omega at T', we can consider the angle relations formed by the tangency and the homothety. 5. **Using Angles to Conclude:**    We know the homothety properties and the parallel nature of (A B) and (t).

Let P be a point on the line x = frac{5}{4}a, and Delta {F_2}P{F_1} is an isosceles triangle with a base angle of {30^ circ }, find the eccentricity of the ellipse. The options are: A: frac{5}{8} B: frac{sqrt{10}}{4} C: frac{3}{4} D: frac{sqrt{3}}{2}","output":"1. First, let's denote c as the distance between the two foci, i.e., c = |F_1F_2|. The ellipse's major axis is 2a and its minor axis is 2b. The eccentricity e is defined as e = frac{c}{a}. 2. Since Delta {F_2}P{F_1} is an isosceles triangle with a base angle of {30^ circ }, we know that the altitude from the vertex P to the base bisects the base, and the base angles are equal. Therefore, angle {F_1}PF_2 = 120^circ. 3. Using the property of an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point P on the ellipse to the foci is constant and equal to the length of the major axis, i.e., |PF_1| + |PF_2| = 2a. 4. Now let's apply the Law of Cosines to Delta {F_2}P{F_1}: |PF_1|^2 = |PF_2|^2 + c^2 - 2|PF_2|c cos(120^circ) 5. Since |PF_1| + |PF_2| = 2a, we can rewrite |PF_1| = 2a - |PF_2| and substitute it into the equation: (2a - |PF_2|)^2 = |PF_2|^2 + c^2 - 2|PF_2|c cos(120^circ) 6. Simplify the equation and solve for |PF_2| in terms of a and c: |PF_2| = frac{2a + c}{2} 7. Now, using the coordinate of the point P(x, y), we have x = frac{5}{4}a. Since P is on the ellipse, its coordinates satisfy the equation of the ellipse: frac{(frac{5}{4}a)^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 8. Solve for y^2: y^2 = b^2 - frac{9}{16}a^2 9. Now, we can find the distance between P and F_2 using the distance formula: |PF_2| = sqrt{(frac{5}{4}a - c)^2 + y^2} 10. Substitute the expression for y^2 and equate it with the expression for |PF_2| we found earlier: sqrt{(frac{5}{4}a - c)^2 + b^2 - frac{9}{16}a^2} = frac{2a + c}{2} 11. Square both sides and simplify the equation to obtain an expression for c in terms of a: c = frac{3}{4}a 12.

This line intersects the circle odot O: x^{2}+y^{2}=4 at points A and B. Notably, the line passes through a fixed point (-2,0), which also lies on the circle odot O. This allows us to set point A as A(-2,0), and since A is on the circle, the distance from O to A, |OA|, is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 2. 2. **Determine Area of Triangle ABO**: Given that the area of triangle ABO is 2, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. Here, |OA| can be considered as the base, and thus the height (distance from point B to the x-axis) must be 2 to satisfy the area condition. 3. **Locate Point B on Circle**: With the height from B to the x-axis being 2, and knowing that B lies on the circle odot O, we deduce that B can either be at (0,2) or (0,-2), as these are the points on the circle that are 2 units away from the x-axis. 4. **Substitute Points B into Line Equation**: To find the value of m, we substitute the coordinates of B into the line equation x-my+2=0.

We introduce the sequence (b_i) defined as:    [    b_0 = 0, quad b_i = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_i quad text{for} quad i = 1, 2, ldots, 40    ]    These (b_i) values, when taken modulo 40, give us residues (r_i), where (r_i equiv b_i pmod{40}).    Since there are 41 values (b_0, b_1, ldots, b_{40}) but only 40 possible residues modulo 40, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two values among these which are congruent modulo 40. Suppose these are (b_i) and (b_j) where (i < j).    Then,    [    b_j equiv b_i pmod{40} quad Rightarrow quad b_j - b_i equiv 0 pmod{40}    ]    Thus, the sum (a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + cdots + a_j) is a multiple of 40.     Since no single number or sequence of numbers adds up to exactly 40, the sum (a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + cdots + a_j) must be at least 80 due to the nature of natural numbers being ( geq 1 ). 3. **Evaluation**:    Consider the case where more than 1019 numbers are written. If we assume ( n > 1019 ), then at least 1000 numbers must be included (because (1019 - 19 = 1000)).     Since 1000 = 25 * 40, by the lemma, the sum of any 1000 numbers would be at least:    [    25 times 80 = 2000    ]    Along with the remaining numbers (at least 20 remaining numbers):    [    text{Minimum contribution from these 20 numbers is } geq 20    ]    Therefore, the total sum would have to be at least:    [    2000 + 20 = 2020    ]    This contradicts the given sum of exactly 2019. 4. **Example Sequence**:    An example construction can confirm the theoretical maximum.

Prove that it is possible to choose several of these numbers whose sum is 100.","output":"Consider the sum of 100 natural numbers, where each number is at most 100 and their total sum equals 200. We need to prove that there exists a subset of these numbers whose sum is exactly 100. 1. **Observation and Initial Analysis**:     - Note that among these 100 numbers, there must be at least two numbers greater than 1.     - To see why, assume the contrary: Imagine 99 of these numbers are 1. Then the remaining number must be (200 - 99 = 101), which contradicts the condition that each number is at most 100. 2. **Constructing Groups**:     - Because of our previous observation, we can split these 100 numbers into two groups of 50 numbers each.     - Let's denote these groups as (G_1) and (G_2). 3. **Sum Analysis of Each Group**:     - Now consider the sum of the numbers in each group:     [     sum(G_1) + sum(G_2) = 200     ]     Since each number is natural and there are 50 numbers in each group, and given the total sum is 200:     - (sum(G_1) > 50): If one group only had numbers and their sum was 50 or less, the total sum given in the problem would be violated. 4. **Application of the Subset Sum Property**:     - According to a combinatorial principle (related to problem 103964 or a typical subset-sum problem theory), for any collection of natural numbers where the sum exceeds a certain threshold, there exists a subset of these numbers whose sum is some exact value less than the total sum and more than the threshold. For our scenario, each group of 50 can have subsets with sums that are multiples of 50. 5. **Combination and Rationale**:     - Since the sum of numbers in (G_1) and (G_2) each exceed 50 but are part of a bounded sum (sum of each subset not exceeding 100), and considering they belong to subsets summing to multiples of 50:     - There are possibilities of sums being 50, 100, 150, or 200.     - Additionally, given no single group exceeds 200, and as 200 is the total accumulated sum, one group's subset could form the required sum of 100 or be a part of two subsets each forming 50.     - Neither subset sums (200) nor (150) are valid, as the groups themselves cannot individually hold values exceeding the combined and contextual constraints stipulated. 6. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, there must exist a subset within these original 100 numbers where their sum is exactly 100. This conclusion is drawn by logical exclusion and sum properties. Thus, we conclude that from the set of 100 numbers, we can always choose a subset with their sum equal to 100.

We can represent ( n ) in base 3 as:    [    n = a_0 + 3a_1 + 3^2a_2 + cdots + 3^k a_k    ]    where ( a_i in {0, 1, 2} ) for all ( i ). 2. **Define the Function ( g(A) ):**    Let ( A = (a_0, a_1, cdots, a_k) ) be the digits of ( n ) in base 3. Define ( g(A) ) as the number of digits equal to 2 in ( A ). 3. **Reduction Step:**    If ( a_k = 2 ), redefine ( A ) as:    [    A = (a_0, a_1, cdots, a_{k-1}, -1, 1)    ]    Notice that this transformation decreases ( g(A) ) by one unit because the digit 2 is replaced by -1 and 1, which do not contribute to ( g(A) ). 4. **Termination Condition:**    If ( g(A) = 0 ), then we are done. This means there are no digits equal to 2 in ( A ), and the representation is already in the desired form. 5. **Iterative Reduction:**    Otherwise, let ( a_j ) be the first element from the right of ( A ) that is equal to 2. Using the identity:    [    2 cdot 3^j = 3^{j+1} - 3^j    ]    redefine ( A ) as:    [    A = (a_0, a_1, cdots, a_{j-1}, -1, a_{j+1} + 1, a_{j+2}, cdots, a_k)    ]    Notice that the new ( a_{j+1} in {0, 1, 2} ), thus ( g(A) ) is non-increasing. 6. **Convergence:**    By repeating steps 2 and 3, and because the array ( A ) is finite, ( g(A) ) will eventually reach 0. This is because each step either decreases ( g(A) ) or leaves it unchanged, and there are only a finite number of digits in ( A ). 7. **Conclusion:**    At the end, we get ( g(A) = 0 ), meaning there are no digits equal to 2 in ( A ). Therefore, the representation of ( n ) as an aggregate of different powers of 3, with the terms combined by the signs (+) and (-) appropriately chosen, is achieved.

(2) For the  k  obtained in (1), how many tuples can we pick from  S , such that any two of these tuples  A,B  that are distinct,  Anotrightarrow B .","output":"# Part (1) 1. **Define the Operation:**    - For any tuple ( A = (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{10}) in S ), if one of the numbers ( a_i geq 9 ), we can perform an operation by subtracting 9 from ( a_i ) and adding 1 to each of the other 9 elements. This operation is denoted as ( f_i(A) ). 2. **Define the Reverse Operation:**    - The reverse operation ( f_i^{-1}(A) ) is defined when all elements of ( {a_1, ldots, a_{10}} setminus {a_i} ) are (geq 1). It involves adding 9 to ( a_i ) and subtracting 1 from each of the other 9 elements. 3. **Good and Bad Tuples:**    - A tuple is called *bad* if it contains ( i+2 ) numbers which are all (leq i) for some ( i ).    - A tuple is called *good* otherwise. 4. **Claims and Proofs:**    - **Claim 1:** If ( A ) is bad, then all elements of ( f^{-1}(A) ) are bad.      - **Proof:** The reverse operation ( f^{-1} ) decreases all but one number of ( A ) by 1, which maintains the bad property.    - **Corollary 2:** If ( A ) is good, then any tuple obtained by applying ( f ) repeatedly on ( A ) is good.    - **Claim 3:** If ( A ) is good, then ( A ) is reachable from all elements of ( f(A) ).      - **Proof:** We show ( A ) is reachable from ( f_1(A) ).

For the other direction, we show that by applying ( f ) repeatedly to both ( A ) and ( B ), we can make them equal. Assume ( |a_i - b_i| leq 8 ) for all ( i ). If ( a_1 geq b_1 + 9 ), then change ( A to f_1(A) ) and observe that the value of ( sum |a_i - b_i| ) has decreased. Because of the original congruence, for some ( 0 leq u, v leq 8 ) with ( u + v = 10 ), we have ( a_i - b_i = u ) for ( v ) values of ( i ) and ( b_i - a_i = v ) for ( u ) values of ( i ). Assume ( u geq v ), ( a_1 - b_1 = cdots = a_v - b_v = u ) and ( b_1 leq b_2 leq cdots leq b_v ). Since ( B ) is good, ( b_1 geq 0, b_2 geq 1, ldots, b_v geq v-1 ).

There are ( 10^8 ) choices, and this determines the tuple uniquely since ( sum (a_1 - a_i) equiv 9 pmod{10} ).

Since every number in Group 2 can be paired in such a way, the sum of all numbers in Group 2 is also divisible by 13. # Final Conclusion: Since the sums of all numbers in both Group 1 and Group 2 are divisible by 13, the total sum of all happy numbers is divisible by 13.

Again, since ( P(n) ) and ( P(n+3) ) are always odd, the typical common divisor can only be 3 if it exists. Next, suppose there exists a fragrant set with at most 5 elements. Assume it contains exactly 5 elements ( {P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2), P(a+3), P(a+4)} ). Consider ( P(a+2) ):    - From (i), ( P(a+2) ) is relatively prime to ( P(a+1) ) and ( P(a+3) ).    - By assuming ( gcd(P(a), P(a+2)) > 1 ) and using (ii), we infer ( a equiv 2 pmod{7} ).    - Thus, ( gcd(P(a+1), P(a+3)) = 1 ).    - Set remaining suitable conditions from (ii) and (iii).  The contradiction forces us to look at sets larger than 5. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we construct:    - Choose ( a ) such that the set ( {P(a), P(a+1), ldots, P(a+5)} ) is fragrant. Construct ( a = 197 ) satisfying:    [    a equiv 7 pmod{19}, quad a+1 equiv 2 pmod{7}, quad a+2 equiv 1 pmod{3}    ] From conditions:    - ( P(a+1) ) and ( P(a+3) ) divisible by 7,    - ( P(a+2) ) and ( P(a+5) ) divisible by 3,    - ( P(a) ) and ( P(a+4) ) divisible by 19. Thus: [ {P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2), P(a+3), P(a+4), P(a+5)} ] **Conclusion:**  [ boxed{6} ]  is the smallest size of a fragrant set. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Eugene has some pencils.

(2) If a ≠ 0, setting F'(x) = 0 yields x = frac{1}{a} - 2.     (a) When a < 0, x = frac{1}{a} - 2 < -2, so F'(x) < 0 on (-2, +∞), meaning F(x) is strictly decreasing on (-2, +∞).

Therefore, F(x) is strictly decreasing on (-2, frac{1}{a} - 2) and strictly increasing on (frac{1}{a} - 2, +∞). In summary, F(x) is strictly decreasing on (-2, +∞) when a ≤ 0, and when a > 0, F(x) is strictly decreasing on (-2, frac{1}{a} - 2) and strictly increasing on (frac{1}{a} - 2, +∞).

Since h'(-1) = e^(-a)(2a - 1) < 0 and h'(frac{1}{2a}) = e^(frac{1}{2})[a^2ln(frac{1}{2a} + 2) + frac{4a}{(frac{1}{2a} + 2)^2}] > 0,    h'(x) must have a zero point in (-1, +∞). Let x₁ denote the smallest zero point of h'(x) in (-1, +∞). When x ∈ (-1, x₁), h'(x) < 0,    so h(x) is strictly decreasing on (-1, x₁), implying h(x) < h(-1) = e^(-a) - 1 < 0.    Consequently, when x ∈ (-1, x₁), g'(x) < 0, and g(x) is strictly decreasing on (-1, x₁).    Thus, when x ∈ (-1, x₁), we have g(x) < g(-1) = 0, i.e., g(x₁) < 0. Let φ(x) = e^(ax) - ax - 1. Then, φ'(x) = a(e^(ax) - 1). So, φ(x) is strictly decreasing on (-1, 0) and strictly increasing on (0, +∞). Hence, φ(x) ≥ φ(0) = 0, i.e., e^(ax) ≥ ax + 1.

Since he spent 120 at the supermarket, we can write: [ M - frac{1}{2}M - frac{1}{10}M - text{money spent on meat products} = 8 ] We know that ( M = 120 ), so we can substitute that into the equation: [ 120 - frac{1}{2} times 120 - frac{1}{10} times 120 - text{money spent on meat products} = 8 ] Now, let's calculate the fractions of the total amount: [ frac{1}{2} times 120 = 60 ] [ frac{1}{10} times 120 = 12 ] Substitute these values into the equation: [ 120 - 60 - 12 - text{money spent on meat products} = 8 ] Combine the numbers: [ 48 - text{money spent on meat products} = 8 ] Now, solve for the money spent on meat products: [ text{money spent on meat products} = 48 - 8 ] [ text{money spent on meat products} = 40 ] Now we know that John spent 40 on meat products. To find the fraction of his total money that he spent on meat products, we divide the amount spent on meat by the total amount of money: [ frac{text{money spent on meat products}}{M} = frac{40}{120} ] Simplify the fraction: [ frac{40}{120} = frac{1}{3} ] So, John spent ( boxed{frac{1}{3}}  ) of his money on meat products."},{"instruction":"he difference between a two  digit number and the number obtained by interchanging the digit is 36 . what is the difference between the sum and the difference of the digits of the number if the ratio between the digits of the number is 1 : 2 ?","output":"Let the two-digit number be 10x + y, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit. According to the problem, the ratio between the digits of the number is 1:2, so we can say that y = 2x. The number obtained by interchanging the digits is 10y + x. The difference between the two-digit number and the number obtained by interchanging the digits is: (10x + y) - (10y + x) = 36 Simplifying the equation, we get: 9x - 9y = 36 Since y = 2x, we can substitute y in the equation: 9x - 9(2x) = 36 9x - 18x = 36 -9x = 36 x = -4 However, x cannot be negative because it represents a digit. So, we must have made a mistake in our signs. Let's correct that: 9x - 9y = 36 should be 9x - 9y = -36 (since the larger number is obtained by interchanging the digits, the difference should be negative) Now, let's solve it again: 9x - 9(2x) = -36 9x - 18x = -36 -9x = -36 x = 4 Now that we have x, we can find y: y = 2x y = 2(4) y = 8 So the two-digit number is 48, and the number obtained by interchanging the digits is 84. The difference between the sum and the difference of the digits of the number is: Sum of the digits: x + y = 4 + 8 = 12 Difference of the digits: y - x = 8 - 4 = 4 Difference between the sum and the difference of the digits: 12 - 4 = 8 Therefore, the difference between the sum and the difference of the digits of the number is boxed{8} ."},{"instruction":"Calculate the sum of the first 60 natural numbers.","output":"To find the sum of the first 60 natural numbers, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: [ S_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] where n is the number of terms in the series.

Let's consider the given functional equation for a particular value. Take x = -3:  f(-3 + 6) = f(-3) + f(3 - (-3)),  simplifying, we get  f(3) = f(-3) + f(6).  But since f(x) is an odd function, f(-x) = -f(x). Thus f(-3) = -f(3), and we have  f(3) = -f(3) + f(6).  This implies   f(6) = 2f(3).  Now let's substitute x = 0 into the functional equation:  f(0 + 6) = f(0) + f(3 - 0),  which simplifies to  f(6) = f(0) + f(3).  We already know f(0) = 0 (since f is odd), so the equation reduces to  f(6) = f(3).  Combining this with the previous result (f(6) = 2f(3)), we get  2f(3) = f(3).  This leads to f(3) = 0 (by subtracting f(3) from both sides of the equation). As a result, we deduce that f(x) has a periodicity of 3; i.e., every multiple of 3 will map to the same value as 0 under f(x), given it is odd. This means that:  f(2010) = f(3 times 670) = f(0) = 0.

It is known that ( x ) has exactly three distinct prime factors, one of which is 3. Find ( x ).","output":"1. We are given a natural number ( x = 2^n - 32 ) where ( n ) is a natural number. We know ( x ) has exactly three distinct prime divisors, one of which is 3. Our goal is to find ( x ). 2. Let us rewrite ( x ) as ( x = 32 cdot N ) where ( N = 2^{n-5} - 1 ). Hence, ( x = 32 cdot (2^{n-5} - 1) ). 3. Since one of the prime divisors of ( x ) is 3, ( N = 2^{n-5} - 1 ) must also have 3 as a prime divisor. This implies ( 2^{n-5} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), or equivalently, ( 2^{n-5} equiv 1 pmod{3} ). 4. The order of 2 modulo 3 is 2, meaning ( n-5 ) must be even for ( 2^{n-5} equiv 1 pmod{3} ). 5. Let ( n-5 = 2m ). Substituting this, we get ( N = 2^{2m} - 1 ). 6. If ( m = 1 ), then ( N = 2^{2 cdot 1} - 1 = 3 ). This ( N ) does not fit the condition of having exactly two odd prime divisors since 3 is a single prime number. 7. If ( m = 2 ), then ( N = 2^{2 cdot 2} - 1 = 15 = 3 times 5 ). Here, ( N ) has exactly two distinct odd prime divisors, which fits our requirement. Thus, ( x = 32 cdot 15 = 480 ). 8. If ( m = 3 ), then ( N = 2^{2 cdot 3} - 1 = 63 = 3^2 times 7 ). Here, ( N ) also fits the requirement of having exactly two odd prime divisors ( 3 ) and ( 7 ). Thus, ( x = 32 cdot 63 = 2016 ). 9. Now we analyze if there are no other possible values of ( m ) leading to valid ( x ):    - Consider the factorization of ( N ) where ( N = p cdot q ) with ( p = 2^m - 1 ) and ( q = 2^m + 1 ). Both ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime since their difference is 2.    - If ( p ) or ( q ) equals 3, it forces specific forms. For larger ( m ):      - If ( q = 3^s ) and ( s ) is even, resulting sequences don't match required patterns for powers of two.      - If ( s ) is odd, contradictions arise with modulo properties failing for higher powers of 3.    - In all remaining cases of ( m > 3 ), higher forms violate constraints on divisors being exactly three primes. Conclusion: Using distinct primes and modulo properties, only two solutions satisfy (x = 2^n - 32 = 32 cdot N) with (n = 2m + 5) exact forms.

We are left with: tan left( frac {15π}{4} right) = tan left( frac{3π}{4} right) Using the symmetry of the tangent function about the origin (odd function property, tan(-θ) = -tan(θ)), we know that: tan left( frac{3π}{4} right) = - tan left( frac{π}{4} right) Since tan left( frac{π}{4} right) = 1, we can conclude: tan left( frac {15π}{4} right) = -1 So, by utilizing the periodicity and symmetry properties of the tangent function, we find that:  boxed{tan left( frac {15π}{4} right) = -1}"},{"instruction":"f {overrightarrow{{e}_{1}},overrightarrow{{e}_{2}}} is a basis for all vectors in plane alpha, then which of the following statements is correct?

For any composite ( n ), use Euler's Totient function ( varphi(n) ), which counts the number of integers less than ( n ) and relatively prime to ( n ).

Examine ( n = 2^m ) (where ( m geq 3 )) to keep all ( 1, 3, 5, ldots, 2^m - 1 ) mutually relatively prime and keeping the arithmetic structure.

Prove that  f  has a rational root.","output":"1. **Define the Polynomials and Rational Roots:**    Let ( f(x) = a_n x^n + cdots + a_0 ) and ( g(x) = b_m x^m + cdots + b_0 ). We are given that for infinitely many primes ( p ), the polynomial ( pf + g ) has a rational root. Let ( r_p = frac{u_p}{v_p} ) be a rational root of ( pf + g ) for some coprime integers ( u_p ) and ( v_p ). 2. **Boundedness of Rational Roots:**    Since (deg g < deg f), there exists a constant ( C ) such that for (|x| geq C), (left| frac{g(x)}{f(x)} right| < 0.01). Given ( pf(r_p) + g(r_p) = 0 ), we have (left| frac{g(r_p)}{f(r_p)} right| = p ). Since ( p > 0.01 ), it follows that (|r_p| < C). 3. **Rational Root Theorem Application:**    By the Rational Root Theorem, ( v_p mid pa_n ) and ( u_p mid pa_0 + b_0 ). Therefore, for each valid ( p ), one of the following must hold:    - ( p mid v_p ) (call such primes *peasants*), or    - ( v_p mid a_n ) (call such primes *rebels*). 4. **Infinitely Many Peasant Primes:**    Suppose finitely many valid ( p ) are peasants. Let ( S ) be the set of all valid rebel primes ( p ). Since ( v_p mid a_n ), there are finitely many possible values for ( v_p ). For each ( v_p ), there are finitely many possible values for ( u_p ) because (|r_p| = left| frac{u_p}{v_p} right|) is bounded. Thus, there are finitely many possible values for ( r_p ) over all ( p in S ). This contradicts the infinitude of valid ( p ) since ( p = -frac{g(r_p)}{f(r_p)} ). 5. **Case Analysis:**    Consider a sufficiently large peasant prime ( p ) such that ( p ) is larger than all ( a_i ) and ( b_i ). Since ( r_p = frac{u_p}{v_p} ), we have:    [    (pf + g)(r_p) = sum_{i=0}^n pa_i left( frac{u_p}{v_p} right)^i + sum_{j=0}^m b_j left( frac{u_p}{v_p} right)^j = 0    ]    Multiplying through by ( v_p^n ) gives:    [    sum_{i=0}^n pa_i u_p^i v_p^{n-i} + sum_{j=0}^m b_j u_p^j v_p^{n-j} = 0 quad (heartsuit)    ]    Taking ((heartsuit) mod p^2), since ( p mid v_p ), the first term reduces to ( pa_n u_p^n mod p^2 ), and the second term reduces to ( b_m u_p^m v_p^{n-m} mod p^2 ). 6. **Case 1: ( n geq m + 2 ):**    [    b_m u_p^m v_p^{n-m} equiv 0 pmod{p^2}    ]    Thus, ( pa_n u_p^n equiv 0 pmod{p^2} ), implying ( a_n u_p^n equiv 0 pmod{p} ). Since ( p > a_n ) and (gcd(u_p, v_p) = 1), this is impossible. 7. **Case 2: ( n = m + 1 ):**    [    pa_n u_p^n + b_{n-1} u_p^{n-1} v_p equiv 0 pmod{p^2}    ]    Since ( p nmid u_p ), we can divide and reduce:    [    a_n u_p + b_{n-1} left( frac{v_p}{p} right) equiv 0 pmod{p}    ]    Let ( d_p = frac{v_p}{p} ). Then:    [    frac{u_p}{d_p} equiv -frac{b_{n-1}}{a_n} pmod{p}    ]    Hence, (frac{u_p}{d_p} = C + frac{pZ_p}{a_n}) for some integer ( Z_p ). Since ( r_p = frac{u_p}{v_p} = frac{1}{p} frac{u_p}{d_p} ), we have:    [    r_p = frac{C}{p} + frac{Z_p}{a_n}    ]    Since (|r_p|) is bounded, there exists some integer ( Z ) such that ( Z_p = Z ) for infinitely many ( p ). Thus:    [    r_p = frac{C}{p} + frac{Z}{a_n}    ]    As ( p to infty ), ( r_p to frac{Z}{a_n} ), a fixed rational number. 8. **Contradiction:**    Since ( p = -frac{g(r_p)}{f(r_p)} ) and ( r_p to frac{Z}{a_n} ), but ( f ) has no rational roots, we have ( fleft( frac{Z}{a_n} right) neq 0 ). Thus:    [    -frac{g(r_p)}{f(r_p)} to -frac{gleft( frac{Z}{a_n} right)}{fleft( frac{Z}{a_n} right)}    ]    This is a fixed number, contradicting the infinitude of valid ( p ).

The task is to determine the possible values of the sum of the smaller angles formed between each pair of intersecting diagonals inside the pentagon. 2. **Step 2: Visualize and name the pentagon**    Let's denote the pentagon vertices as ( A, B, C, D, E ). 3. **Step 3: Draw all the diagonals in the pentagon**    The diagonals are ( AC, AD, BD, BE, ) and ( CE ). 4. **Step 4: Identify intersecting diagonals**    Inside the pentagon, the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BE ) intersect at one point, and the diagonals ( AD ) and ( CE ) intersect at another point. Each pair of intersecting diagonals forms two angles. We need to consider the smaller of these two angles.

Thus, we form rectangles PAO_2B and QCO_2D. 5. **Angle Calculations**:     - Since angles formed at intersections of tangents and lines are equal:       [       begin{aligned}       & angle CDE = angle BDT = angle DBT = frac{1}{2}angle CTA,        & angle TCA = angle TAC implies angle CDE + angle ECD = angle ABE + angle EAB = 90^circ        & frac{AE}{CE} = frac{AB sin angle ABE}{CD sin angle CDE} = frac{AB}{CD}.       end{aligned}       ] 6. **Proving the Intersection**:     - Assume that O_1O_2 and AC intersect at E_1. Then using the properties of triangles,       [       begin{aligned}       & frac{AE_1}{CE_1} = frac{S_{triangle O_1AE_1}}{S_{triangle O_1CE_1}} = frac{sin angle AO_1E_1}{sin angle CO_1E_1}        & = frac{O_1O_2 sin angle AO_1O_2}{O_1O_2 sin angle CO_1O_2} = frac{PO_2}{QO_2} = frac{AB}{CD}.       end{aligned}       ]       Hence, E_1 coincides with E, proving that E lies on O_1O_2, and AE perp BE. 7. **Returning to the Problem**:     - Now for the original problem.

Among them, 1009 had 1010 friends, and 1010 had 1009 friends, with the friendship relationship being reciprocal.

Then, ( B ) and ( C ) become friends, but they end their friendship with ( A ); the other friendships remain unchanged during this event. Prove that, regardless of the initial friendship relations, Theodore can necessarily manage so that, at the end of the Olympiad, each participant has at most one friend.","output":"To solve the problem, we will model the set of participants as a graph where vertices represent participants and edges represent friendships. Let's analyze the invariants and demonstrate how Theodore can reduce the friendships to the desired state. 1. **Modeling the problem:**     - We start with a graph ( G ) containing 2019 vertices where 1009 vertices have a degree of 1010 and 1010 vertices have a degree of 1009.     - In other words, each vertex represents a participant, and an edge between two vertices indicates a friendship. 2. **Analyzing the events caused by Theodore:**     - Theodore selects three participants ( A, B, ) and ( C ) such that ( A ) is friends with ( B ) and ( C ), but ( B ) and ( C ) are not friends.     - Then, he makes ( B ) and ( C ) become friends, but ( B ) and ( C ) end their friendship with ( A ). The other friendships remain unchanged.             [        begin{cases}        text{Before the event: } A-B, A-C         text{After the event: } B-C rightarrow text{New friendship}, A-B, A-C rightarrow text{Removed}        end{cases}        ]             - This reduces the total number of edges by 1 while the parity (even or odd degree) of all vertices remains unaffected. Specifically, the degrees of vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ) change by (-2, 0,) and (0) respectively. 3. **Invariants and properties:**     - Every event causes the total number of edges in the graph to decrease by 1.     - The degree parity of the vertices involved remains unchanged.     - An event cannot merge two disjoint components nor create cycles in acyclic components. 4. **Classification of the graph components:**     - Define a connected component as **good** if Theodore can transform it into a graph where each vertex has at most one friend (degree ≤ 1).     - Conversely, classify a component as **bad** if Theodore cannot transform it as described.          - Clearly, any clique (complete subgraph) of size ( k geq 3 ) or any cycle of size ( k geq 3 ) is **bad** because they cannot be reduced without violating the friendship condition. 5. **Generalizing connected components:**     - If a connected component contains only vertices of even degree (not zero), it remains composed of vertices of even degrees after each event, making it **bad**.     - Therefore, a component is termed **acceptable** if it is not a clique of size ( k geq 3 ) and contains at least one vertex of odd degree or is an isolated vertex.     - We assume that every **acceptable** component is also **good** unless proven otherwise. 6. **Working with acceptable components:**     - Originally, since we have 2019 vertices, and the graph is connected with vertices of both even and odd degrees, the graph forms a single **acceptable** component.      7. **Transforming the component:**     - If the component has any vertex of degree 2 or higher, Theodore can continually apply the event to split the component into more manageable parts while maintaining their acceptability.     - If the component contains cycles but no triangles, Theodore can still apply the event strategically to ensure the component stays connected without creating new issues.      In conclusion, following this iterative process using the described invariant properties and alterations, Theodore can reduce the graph such that each participant ends up having at most one friend. Hence, the desired state where every participant has at most one friend can be achieved through strategic events.

We observe that ( r_i ) is a martingale, meaning the expected value of ( r_{i+1} ) given ( r_i ) is just ( r_i ).  3. **Rewriting ( r_i ) in Terms of Stopping Condition:**        Suppose ( b_0 < w_0 ). We stop at ( i ) if ( b_i = 0 ) or ( b_i = w_i ). At the stopping time, the expected value of the ratio is derived as:    [    E[r_i] = frac{1}{2} cdot p + 0 cdot (1 - p)    ]    Here ( p ) is the probability that we stop with ( b_i = w_i ). 4. **Solving for ( p ):**        This expected value ( E[r_i] ) simplifies to:    [    frac{1}{2} cdot p = frac{b_0}{b_0 + w_0}    ]    Solving for ( p ):    [    p = frac{2 b_0}{b_0 + w_0}    ] 5. **Case ( b_0 = w_0 ):**        If ( b_0 = w_0 = 10 ), after throwing one sock, either black or white, we reduce to a case where ( b_1 = 9 ) and ( w_1 = 10 ) or vice versa.

More generally, we need to show this for ( 5^n ) for any positive integer ( n ). 2. **Generalizing the Problem:**    Consider the number ( 5^n ). We need to find an integer ( m ) such that ( 5^n m ) has no even digits.  3. **Properties of Multiplication and Digits:**    Notice that multiplying by 5 does not introduce any even digits if the original number does not have any even digits. Therefore, we need to find an ( m ) such that ( m ) and ( 5^n m ) both have no even digits. 4. **Constructing ( m ):**    Let's consider the number ( m ) in the form of a sequence of digits that avoids even digits. For instance, we can use digits from the set ({1, 3, 5, 7, 9}). 5. **Finding a Suitable ( m ):**    We need to ensure that ( 5^n m ) has no even digits. One way to approach this is to use a number ( m ) that is a repunit in base 5. A repunit in base 5 is a number consisting of only the digit 1 in base 5, which translates to a number in decimal that avoids even digits. 6. **Example Construction:**    Consider ( m = 1111_5 ). In decimal, this is:    [    1111_5 = 1 cdot 5^3 + 1 cdot 5^2 + 1 cdot 5^1 + 1 cdot 5^0 = 125 + 25 + 5 + 1 = 156    ]    However, 156 contains even digits. We need to find a different ( m ). 7. **Using Modular Arithmetic:**    We can use modular arithmetic to find a suitable ( m ). We need ( m ) such that ( 5^n m ) modulo 10 avoids even digits. Since ( 5^n ) ends in 5 for any ( n geq 1 ), we need ( m ) such that the last digit of ( 5^n m ) is odd. 8. **Choosing ( m ):**    Let's choose ( m = 1 ). Then ( 5^n cdot 1 = 5^n ), which ends in 5 and has no even digits. 9. **Verification:**    For ( n = 2021 ), ( 5^{2021} cdot 1 = 5^{2021} ), which ends in 5 and has no even digits. Thus, we have shown that there exists a positive integer ( m ) (specifically ( m = 1 )) such that ( 5^{2021}m ) has no even digits.

Specifically, for any four points to form a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles must sum up to 180^{circ}. 4.

In how many ways can this table be filled with all zeros and ones so that there is an even number of ones in every row and every column?","output":":  Let's solve the problem step-by-step. 1. **Objective**:    We need to find the number of ways to fill an ( m times n ) table with zeros and ones such that each row and each column contains an even number of ones. 2. **Row Filling Justification**:    Let us focus on filling each row of length ( n ). Firstly, we establish that there are ( 2^{n-1} ) ways to fill a row with zeros and ones such that the row contains an even number of ones.     - **First Justification**:       We can fill the first ( n-1 ) cells of the row arbitrarily, making ( 2^{n-1} ) possibilities. This is because each of the ( n-1 ) cells can be either 0 or 1. The last cell (n-th cell) must ensure the total count of ones is even. Thus, the if the number of ones in the first ( n-1 ) cells is even, the last cell must be 0. If the number is odd, the last cell must be 1.    - **Second Justification**:       We use combinatorics. The number of ways to populate ( n ) cells with an even number of ones is given by the sum of the binomial coefficients for choosing 0, 2, 4, ..., (lfloor n/2 rfloor times 2) ones, which is       [      binom{n}{0} + binom{n}{2} + binom{n}{4} + cdots.      ]      By the binomial theorem,      [      (1+1)^n = sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} = 2^n      ]      and      [      (1-1)^n = sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} (-1)^k = 0.      ]      Hence,      [      2^n = (binom{n}{0} + binom{n}{2} + binom{n}{4} + cdots) + (binom{n}{1} + binom{n}{3} + binom{n}{5} + cdots)      ]      and since ( 0 = binom{n}{0} - binom{n}{1} + binom{n}{2} - cdots ),      [      0 = (binom{n}{0} - binom{n}{1} + binom{n}{2} - cdots) = 2A - 2B.      ]      Therefore, the sum of the binomials with even number of ones is half of ( 2^n ):      [      binom{n}{0} + binom{n}{2} + binom{n}{4} + cdots = 2^{n-1}.      ] 3. **Constructing the Table**:    Suppose we have filled the first ( m-1 ) rows so that each row contains an even number of ones. The number of such ( (m-1) times n ) tables is ( (2^{n-1})^{m-1} = 2^{(m-1)(n-1)} ).    - **Ensuring Admissibility**:      Each column must also have an even number of ones. Given that the first ( m-1 ) rows are filled and the requirement for columns persists, the bottom (m-th) row is determined precisely by ensuring each column sum remains even.            Specifically, for each column, we check the sum of the current cell values. If the sum is odd, the corresponding m-th row cell must be 1 to make the column sum even; if even, it must be 0. 4. **Verification**:    We need to verify that the constructed table has an even number of ones in the m-th row.         - For the entire ( m-1 times n ) table configuration, since each row itself has an even number of ones, the total number of ones is also even.    - This ensures the m-th row will have an even number of ones as it compensates the column requirements. As a result, the m-th row incriminates validly with an even count of ones. # Conclusion Given all rows and columns strictly adhere to the condition of containing even ones: [ boxed{2^{(m-1)(n-1)}} ]"},{"instruction":"Find all pairs of natural numbers (a) and (b) such that (frac{a^{2}+b}{b^{2}a}) and (frac{b^{2}+a}{a^{2}b}) are integers.","output":"We start with the equation and the need to find all pairs of natural numbers (a) and (b) such that the expressions (frac{a^2 + b}{b^2 - a}) and (frac{b^2 + a}{a^2 - b}) are both integers.

In both cases, we can make ( S ) larger by setting one of ( x_1, x_2 ) to 0 and the other to ( s ). 7. **Reducing the Graph:**    Setting ( x_1 = 0 ) means deleting ( v_1 ) and all edges from ( v_1 ). The remaining graph may not be a triangulation, but we can make it a new triangulation by adding new edges, which would potentially increase ( S ). 8. **Final Structure:**    We continue this process until we arrive at a triangulation where any two vertices are neighbors. This structure is a tetrahedron. 9. **Calculating for a Tetrahedron:**    For a tetrahedron with vertices ( v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 ), we have:    [    S = sum_{1 leq i < j leq 4} x_i x_j    ]    under the condition ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 1 ). The maximum value of ( S ) is attained when ( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = frac{1}{4} ):    [    S = 6 left( frac{1}{4} cdot frac{1}{4} right) = 6 cdot frac{1}{16} = frac{6}{16} = frac{3}{8}    ] 10. **Conclusion:**     Thus, the sum of the numbers on the edges is at most (frac{3}{8}).

Selling price for 50 kg = 110% of Total cost Selling price for 50 kg = 1.10 * (Rs. 345 + Rs. 20x) We are given that Arun should sell the mixture at approximately Rs. 13.86 per kg. Therefore, the selling price for 50 kg is: 50 kg * Rs. 13.86/kg = Rs. 693 Now we can set up the equation: 1.10 * (Rs. 345 + Rs. 20x) = Rs. 693 Divide both sides by 1.10 to find the total cost: Rs. 345 + Rs. 20x = Rs. 693 / 1.10 Rs. 345 + Rs. 20x = Rs. 630 Now, we solve for x: Rs. 20x = Rs. 630 - Rs. 345 Rs. 20x = Rs. 285 x = Rs. 285 / Rs. 20 x = Rs. 14.25 Therefore, the rate of the second wheat purchase was Rs. boxed{14.25}  per kg."},{"instruction":"Which of the following statements are false?

If we substitute each number with the difference between 17 and that number, we will obtain another solution.

This transformation effectively reverses the arrangement of numbers while maintaining the property that the sum of four numbers along any straight line is 34. 2. **Verification through Illustration**:        The sum of the numbers in the range (1 text{ to } 16) is (sum_{i=1}^{16} i = frac{16 cdot (16+1)}{2} = 136). Therefore, as (16) numbers are replaced by (17 - i ), each sum (pairs ((i, 17-i)) sums to (17)).      3. **Specific Calculations**:    - For example, consider one of the lines in the given solution where numbers are (a, b, c, d) and those numbers sum up to 34.    - Using the transformation (x' = 17 - x):          [      a' = 17 - a, quad b' = 17 - b, quad c' = 17 - c, quad d' = 17 - d      ]      By substituting, we need to ensure the transformed numbers also sum to 34:      [      (17 - a) + (17 - b) + (17 - c) + (17 - d)      = 4 times 17 - (a + b + c + d)      = 68 - 34 = 34      ]      Thus, the transformed numbers comfort the given condition.    4. **Placing Numbers in the Diagram**:    Place the numbers (1 text{ to } 16) in such a way that the sum along any straight line remains 34. The corresponding transformation will automatically retain this property under the transformation ( x rightarrow 17 - x ).

This satisfies all conditions since the positive difference between any two elements in ( A_1 ) is at least ( a^1 = a leq 1 ).    - If ( 1 < a < 2 ), we construct the sets as follows:      - Let ( A_1 = { ldots, -3, -1, 1, 3, ldots } ), which are all odd integers. The positive difference between any two elements in ( A_1 ) is at least 2, which is greater than ( a ).      - For each ( i ) such that ( a^i > 2^{i-1} ), let ( A_i ) be the set of integers of the form ( 2^{i-1}(2k+1) ) for integer ( k ). This ensures that the positive difference between any two elements in ( A_i ) is at least ( 2^i ), which is greater than ( a^i ).      - Notice that at each iteration, the integers left to be taken are of the form ( 2^i k ) for integer ( k ).

Consider the set ( S = {1, 2, ldots, l} ).    - The set ( A_i ) can have at most ( frac{l}{lceil a^i rceil} ) elements that are also in ( S ).

Thus, the fraction ( frac{a^n - 1}{a^{n+1} - a^n} ) is less than 1.    - This implies that the members of ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) cannot possibly contain all elements of ( S ).

According to the given information, we have the following: - 48% failed in English. - 27% failed in both Hindi and English. - 54% passed in both subjects.

The formula for this is: Failed in Hindi or English = Failed in Hindi + Failed in English - Failed in both Since we know that 54% passed in both subjects, this means that 100% - 54% = 46% failed in at least one of the subjects. Now we can plug in the values we know: 46% = H% + 48% - 27% Now we solve for H%: H% = 46% - 48% + 27% H% = -2% + 27% H% = 25% Therefore, the percentage of students who failed in Hindi is boxed{25%} ."},{"instruction":"Given the function y=a^{xm}+n3 (a>0 and aneq1), if the graph of the function always passes through the point (3,2), find the value of m+n.","output":"For the function y=a^{x-m}+n-3 (a>0 and aneq1), let x-m=0.

Suppose the problem is solved and consider the sequence of lines l_{1}, l_{2}, ldots, l_{n}. Let A and B be the starting and ending points, respectively. 2. Reflect point B successively across each of the lines l_{1}, l_{2}, ldots, l_{n}. Denote the reflections of B as B_{1}, B_{2}, ldots, B_{n}. 3. The billiard ball's path involves straight segments between successive points of reflection, and each line l_{i} intersects these segments. To illustrate further: 4. The point X_1 on line l_1 is the intersection of line l_1 with line A B_1. 5. The point X_2 on line l_2 is the intersection of line l_2 with line X_1 B_2. 6. Continue this process for all n lines, where X_i lies on both l_i and the line from X_{i-1} to B_{i}. In this way, we see that: [ X_1, X_2, ldots, X_n ] are the successive points where the ball strikes the lines. The line segments connecting A, X_1, X_2, ldots, X_n, and B represent the path of the billiard ball. **Part (b)** 1. Consider a rectangular table with four sides denoted by lines l_{1}, l_{2}, l_{3}, l_{4}. 2. Given that point A coincides with point B, the goal is to prove that the length of the entire path of the billiard ball is equal to the sum of the diagonals of the rectangle. To elaborate on the proof: 1. Reflect the rectangle across its sides sequentially to trace the ball's path:     - Reflecting B successively, using points from previous reflections, leads to the symmetrical properties of the rectangle being utilized. The significant steps are: 3. The ball's path A rightarrow X_1 rightarrow X_2 rightarrow X_3 rightarrow X_4 rightarrow A forms a parallelogram inscribed within the rectangle (see Figure 138). 4. The sides of this parallelogram are parallel to the diagonals of the rectangle. Final insight: 5. The total path length A rightarrow X_1 rightarrow X_2 rightarrow X_3 rightarrow X_4 rightarrow A equals the length of segment A A_1, where A_1 is a reflection of point A. 6. By projecting segment A A_1 onto the sides of the rectangle, it becomes clear that its projections double the corresponding sides of the rectangle:     - This projection thus establishes AA_1 as twice the length of the diagonals of the rectangle. # Conclusion: Therefore, the full path of the billiard ball from point A back to point A is equal to the sum of the diagonals of the rectangle, verifying the reflection properties and symmetry involved in the motions. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Baker made 61 pastries and 167 cakes.

Suppose (P(a, b)) is rational for (a) and (b) being non-negative integers. Define a new quantity:    [    Q(a, b) = (sqrt{5} + sqrt{2})(sqrt{a} - sqrt{b}).    ] 4. **Relating (P(a, b)) and (Q(a, b)):**    Calculate the product (P(a, b) cdot Q(a, b)):    [    P(a, b) cdot Q(a, b) = (sqrt{5} - sqrt{2})(sqrt{a} + sqrt{b})(sqrt{5} + sqrt{2})(sqrt{a} - sqrt{b}).    ]    This simplifies to:    [    P(a, b) cdot Q(a, b) = (5 - 2)(a - b) = 3(a - b).    ]    If (P(a, b)) is rational, then (Q(a, b)) must be rational as well. 5. **Expressing Rational (u) and (v):**    Now assume:    [    u = frac{1}{2} (P(a, b) + Q(a, b)) = sqrt{5a} - sqrt{2b},    ]    and    [    v = frac{1}{2} (P(a, b) - Q(a, b)) = sqrt{5b} - sqrt{2a}.    ]    Both (u) and (v) are rational if (P(a, b)) is rational.  6. **Using the Auxiliary Theorem:**    If (sqrt{m} - sqrt{n}) is rational for different non-negative integers (m) and (n), then both (m) and (n) must be perfect squares.

In this case ( sqrt{5a} - sqrt{2b} ) and ( sqrt{5b} - sqrt{2a} ) must both be rational suggesting (5a) and (2b) are perfect squares, however, this case reduces to contradiction unless (a = b = 0).    - **Case 2:** Both (u) and (v) are zero.

Given the reference figure which demonstrates this process:  Steps: 1. **Understanding the Problem**:    - An isosceles right triangle is a triangle with two equal sides and a right angle.     - To decompose the isosceles right triangle into smaller similar triangles, we need to use its properties, specifically its symmetry and angle measures (45 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees). 2. **Identifying Smaller Triangles**:    - From the given figure, observe how the larger triangle is divided.     - Notice that smaller triangles are still right and isosceles, as they maintain the same angles as the original triangle. 3. **Key Properties**:    - The larger triangle ABC, where the legs (catheti) are of length 7 units. Let's denote these points as:      - ( A = (0, 0) )      - ( B = (7, 0) )      - ( C = (0, 7) )    - The right-angle is at point ( A ). 4. **Dividing the Triangle**:    - Draw a line segment from the midpoint of the hypotenuse to the right angle. This segment will be at a 45-degree angle and will cut the larger triangle into two smaller, congruent triangles.    - Each of these resulting smaller triangles will be isosceles right triangles themselves but with half the dimensions of the original triangle.    - Repeat the division process, always taking segments from midpoints and connecting them to the right angle (or other points of symmetry). Each step reduces the triangle's size by a specific ratio but keeps them similar to the original triangle. 5. **Ensuring Different Sizes**:    - As each step halves or scales down the original length, they create progressively smaller triangles.    - The process can continue as long as desired, ensuring each resulting triangle remains proportional but size-distinct from one another. 6. **Similar Triangles Property**:    - Using the similarity ratio property:      - Each subsequent triangle has side lengths scaled by powers of (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}) relative to the original triangle.      - For example, if side length of the original triangle is (7), then the first cut results in triangles with sides ( frac{7}{sqrt{2}}), and so on. # Conclusion: We have successfully shown that the original isosceles right triangle can be decomposed into smaller similar triangles by drawing lines from midpoints to vertices and ensuring that no two resulting triangles are of the same size.

To prove that at least one of these polynomials has two distinct real roots, we will use a proof by contradiction. Assume the contrary—that none of the polynomials has two distinct real roots. 3. If a quadratic polynomial ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ) does not have two distinct real roots, then its discriminant must be non-positive. The discriminant of each polynomial is given by:    [    Delta_k = (2a_k)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot b_k = 4a_k^2 - 4b_k    ]    Hence, for the discriminant to be non-positive:    [    4a_k^2 - 4b_k leq 0 implies a_k^2 leq b_k quad text{for} quad k = 1, 2, 3    ] 4. Since each ( a_k^2 leq b_k ), we can multiply these inequalities:    [    a_1^2 leq b_1, quad a_2^2 leq b_2, quad a_3^2 leq b_3    ]    Multiplying these three inequalities gives:    [    a_1^2 a_2^2 a_3^2 leq b_1 b_2 b_3    ] 5. From the given condition, we know ( a_1a_2a_3 = b_1b_2b_3 ). Let ( N = a_1a_2a_3 ). Then:    [    (a_1a_2a_3)^2 = N^2 quad text{and} quad b_1b_2b_3 = N    ]    Substituting these into the inequality above results in:    [    N^2 leq N    ] 6. From the inequality ( N^2 leq N):    [    N^2 - N leq 0 implies N(N - 1) leq 0    ] 7. Since the product ( a_1a_2a_3 = b_1b_2b_3 > 1 ), ( N ) is greater than 1. However, ( N(N - 1) leq 0 ) suggests that ( 0 leq N leq 1 ). 8. This is a contradiction because ( N > 1 ). Hence, our original assumption that none of the polynomials has two distinct real roots must be false. 9. Therefore, at least one of the polynomials ( f_1(x) ), ( f_2(x) ), or ( f_3(x) ) must have two distinct real roots.

Let's transform this expression to a more insightful form. Note that: [ frac{n}{n+1} = 1 - frac{1}{n+1} ] Thus: [ a_n = 1 - frac{1}{n+1} ] 3. This transformation shows that the (n)-th term can be expressed as (1) minus a fraction that depends on (n). Specifically, as (n) increases, ( frac{1}{n+1} ) decreases. 4. To understand why all terms are different, consider two distinct terms (a_n) and (a_m) for (n neq m). We want to show: [ a_n neq a_m ] 5. Suppose for contradiction that ( a_n = a_m ).

Then, we have 1 + z_2 + z_3 = 0. This can be rearranged to z_2 + z_3 = -1.      Since |z_2| = |z_3| = 1, we can express z_2 and z_3 in exponential form as z_2 = e^{itheta} and z_3 = e^{iphi}. The condition z_2 + z_3 = -1 implies that the real part of z_2 + z_3 is -1 and the imaginary part is 0. This is satisfied when theta = frac{2pi}{3} and phi = -frac{2pi}{3}, or vice versa. Thus, z_2 = e^{ifrac{2pi}{3}} and z_3 = e^{-ifrac{2pi}{3}}, which are equally spaced around the unit circle with z_1 = 1. 3. **Case n geq 4:**      Suppose n=k satisfies the condition that any z_1, z_2, ..., z_k on the unit circle with z_1 + z_2 + ... + z_k = 0 must be equally spaced. We can add two more points z_{k+1} and z_{k+2} such that z_{k+1} = -z_{k+2} and both lie on the unit circle. This addition does not affect the sum z_1 + z_2 + ... + z_k + z_{k+1} + z_{k+2} = 0, but z_{k+1} and z_{k+2} can be chosen such that they are not equally spaced with the original k points, thus violating the condition for n=k+2.    By this construction, we see that for n geq 4, it is possible to find configurations where the points are not equally spaced, thus failing the condition given in the problem. 4. **Conclusion:**      The only values of n for which the condition holds for all configurations are n=2 and n=3. Therefore, the number of such integers n is boxed{textbf{(B)} 2}."},{"instruction":"Within a square with side length 1, there are several circles whose total radii sum up to 0.51. Prove that there exists a line parallel to one of the sides of the square that intersects at least 2 circles.","output":"1. **Projection of Circles**: We start by projecting the given circles onto one side of the square with side length 1. The projection of a circle onto a line is a segment whose length is equal to the diameter of the circle. 2. **Sum of Projection Lengths**: Since the sum of the radii of the circles is (0.51), the total sum of their diameters is     [    2 times 0.51 = 1.02.    ]    This follows from the fact that the diameter of a circle is twice its radius. 3. **Comparison with Side Length**: The total length of the projections, (1.02), is greater than the length of the side of the square, which is (1). 4. **Overlap Argument**: Since the total length of the projections exceeds the length of the side of the square, it is necessary that at least some of these projections overlap. Since we have (1.02 > 1), there must be at least one point on the side of the square where the projections of at least two circles overlap. 5. **Finding the Correct Line**: Consider this overlapping point. If we draw a line perpendicular to the side of the square through this point, this line will necessarily intersect the two circles whose projections overlap at this point. 6. **Conclusion**: Thus, there exists a line parallel to one side of the square that intersects at least two of the circles. Therefore, we have shown that there will be at least one straight line, parallel to one of the sides of the square, which intersects at least 2 circles.

After this, the magician enters the room for the first time, looks at the drawing, and marks the semicircle on which the erased point lay. How can the magician and his assistant agree so that the trick always succeeds?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to establish a systematic strategy that will ensure the magician can always identify the semicircle on which the erased point lay. Here's a detailed solution: 1. **Strategy Formulation**:    - We begin by noting that the 2007 points divide the circle into 2007 arcs. Because each arc is defined by a pair of consecutive marked points, there are 2007 such arcs. 2. **Selection of the Largest Arc**:    - Among the 2007 arcs, there is at least one arc that is the largest. Let us denote this largest arc by AB, where A and B are the endpoints of the arc on the circle. If there are multiple such largest arcs, pick any one of them for convenience. 3. **Erase a Specific Point**:    - The instruction to the assistant is straightforward: erase the point A defining the largest arc AB.     4. **Magician's Observation**:    - When the magician enters the room, they will see 2006 points and hence 2006 arcs. However, because one point was erased, one of the arcs is now larger than any of the remaining original arcs.    - This newly largest arc was formed by combining two adjacent original arcs when the point A was erased. 5. **Identification of the Semicircle**:    - Let's denote the two arcs that were adjacent to A before erasure as AC and CB.    - After the point A is erased, the arc CB becomes the largest arc. This is because it now includes the segments previously contained in the arcs AC and CB.     6. **Largest Combined Arc**:    - Since AB was the largest original arc, the new largest arc, which is now lacking the original A, will necessarily include the previous location of point A since a point adjacent to a larger arc makes the arc larger.    - Thus, if we observe CB to be largest, then A must have been on this arc before it was erased. 7. **Conclusion**:    - The magician can confidently note that since CB is the largest arc now, the erased point A was the endpoint of CB. Therefore, the semicircle that includes arc CB (now expanded to include where A was) is the correct semicircle. 8. **Final Answer**:    - Following this agreement, the magician can always determine that the erased point lay on the semicircle opposite to the largest arc post-erasure. Hence, the magician and assistant's coordination will ensure the trick always works, as the magician will always identify the correct semicircle.

First, we calculate the semi-perimeter (s): s = (30 + 21 + 10) / 2 s = 61 / 2 s = 30.5 cm Now we can use Heron's formula to find the area: A = √(30.5 * (30.5 - 30) * (30.5 - 21) * (30.5 - 10)) A = √(30.5 * 0.5 * 9.5 * 20.5) Now we calculate the values inside the square root: A = √(30.5 * 0.5 * 9.5 * 20.5) A = √(30.5 * 0.5 * 194.75) A = √(2972.8125) Now we take the square root: A ≈ √(2972.8125) A ≈ 54.52 cm² So the area of the triangle is approximately boxed{54.52}  square centimeters."},{"instruction":"Tom and his friend went to the magic shop to buy trick decks and gimmick coins.

There is also a sales tax of 7% applied to the total cost after discounts.

Cost of trick decks: 3 trick decks each at 8 = 3 * 8 = 24 per person Since both Tom and his friend are buying, the total cost for trick decks is 24 * 2 = 48 Cost of gimmick coins: 4 gimmick coins each at 12 = 4 * 12 = 48 per person Since both Tom and his friend are buying, the total cost for gimmick coins is 48 * 2 = 96 Now, let's apply the discounts. Discount on trick decks: Since they bought more than 2 trick decks, they get a 10% discount on the total cost of trick decks. 10% of 48 = 0.10 * 48 = 4.8 So, the discounted cost of trick decks is 48 - 4.8 = 43.2 Discount on gimmick coins: Since they bought more than 3 gimmick coins, they get a 5% discount on the total cost of gimmick coins. 5% of 96 = 0.05 * 96 = 4.8 So, the discounted cost of gimmick coins is 96 - 4.8 = 91.2 Now, let's calculate the total cost after discounts but before tax. Total cost after discounts = Cost of trick decks after discount + Cost of gimmick coins after discount Total cost after discounts = 43.2 + 91.2 = 134.4 Finally, let's calculate the sales tax and the total cost including tax. Sales tax: 7% of 134.4 = 0.07 * 134.4 = 9.408 Total cost including tax = Total cost after discounts + Sales tax Total cost including tax = 134.4 + 9.408 = 143.808 Since we usually don't deal with fractions of a cent, we'll round the total cost to the nearest cent.

Halving the ratio of flour to sugar:    Original ratio of flour to sugar = 11 : 1    New ratio of flour to sugar = (11 : 1) / 2 = 11 : 2 Now, we need to combine these new ratios to get the overall new ratio of flour to water to sugar. To do this, we need to make sure the part of flour in both ratios is the same. Since the new ratio of flour to water is 22 : 8 and the new ratio of flour to sugar is 11 : 2, we can multiply the second ratio by 2 to match the flour part: New ratio of flour to sugar (multiplied by 2) = (11 : 2) * 2 = 22 : 4 Now we can combine the ratios: New ratio of flour to water to sugar = 22 : 8 : 4 This means that for every 22 parts of flour, there are 8 parts of water and 4 parts of sugar. The new recipe requires 2 cups of sugar, which corresponds to 4 parts in the new ratio. To find out how many cups of water correspond to 8 parts, we can set up a proportion: 4 parts (sugar) / 2 cups (sugar) = 8 parts (water) / x cups (water) Cross-multiply to solve for x: 4 * x = 8 * 2 4x = 16 x = 16 / 4 x = 4 So, the new recipe calls for boxed{4}  cups of water."},{"instruction":"a convex quadrilateral, two opposite sides are equal and perpendicular, while the other two sides are equal to a and b.

Therefore, to react with 3 moles of AgNO₃, we will need 3 moles of HCl. The molar mass of HCl is approximately 36.46 g/mol. To find the mass of HCl required, we multiply the number of moles by the molar mass: Mass of HCl = 3 moles × 36.46 g/mol = 109.38 g So, 109.38 grams of HCl are required to react with 3 moles of AgNO₃. Next, let's calculate the mass of silver nitrate (AgNO₃) involved in the reaction. The molar mass of AgNO₃ is approximately 169.87 g/mol.

This pattern indicates that as the construction time increases, the cumulative progress also increases. Thus, option A is a correct observation based on the table. **Option B:** The daily increase in cumulative progress can be calculated by subtracting the progress of the previous day from the current day's progress. For example, on day 2, the progress is 60 meters, and on day 1, it is 30 meters. The increase is 60 - 30 = 30 meters. This pattern holds for every subsequent day, indicating that for each additional day of construction, the cumulative progress increases by 30 meters. Therefore, option B is also a correct observation. **Option C:** To find the cumulative progress on day 9, we can use the pattern established in the table. Since the progress increases by 30 meters each day, on day 9, the cumulative progress would be 9 times 30 = 270 meters. This calculation confirms that option C is accurate. **Option D:** To determine the construction time when the cumulative progress is 330 meters, we use the formula for cumulative progress, which is 30 times text{days}.

(1) Express the time t_{1} and t_{2} taken by person A and person B respectively from point A to point B using expressions containing a and b;   (2) Who arrives at point B first, person A or person B? Explain your reasoning.","output":"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into two parts as requested: # Part 1: Expressing t_{1} and t_{2} **For Person A:** - Person A walks half the distance at speed a and the other half at speed b. Since the total distance is 1 unit, each half is frac{1}{2} unit. - The time taken to walk each half is distance over speed. So, for the first half at speed a, the time is frac{frac{1}{2}}{a}, and for the second half at speed b, the time is frac{frac{1}{2}}{b}. - Adding these times together gives us the total time for person A: t_{1} = frac{frac{1}{2}}{a} + frac{frac{1}{2}}{b} = frac{a+b}{2ab}. **For Person B:** - Person B walks half the time at speed a and the other half at speed b. Let the total time be t_{2}, so each half is frac{1}{2}t_{2}. - The distance covered in each half is speed times time. So, for the first half at speed a, the distance is frac{1}{2}t_{2}a, and for the second half at speed b, the distance is frac{1}{2}t_{2}b. - The total distance is the sum of these distances: frac{1}{2}t_{2}a + frac{1}{2}t_{2}b = 1. - Solving for t_{2} gives us: t_{2} = frac{2}{a+b}. # Part 2: Who Arrives First? - To determine who arrives first, we compare t_{1} and t_{2}. - We have t_{1} = frac{a+b}{2ab} and t_{2} = frac{2}{a+b}. - Subtracting t_{2} from t_{1} gives us: frac{a+b}{2ab} - frac{2}{a+b} = frac{{(a+b)}^2 - 4ab}{2ab(a+b)} = frac{{(a-b)}^2}{2ab(a+b)}. - Since a neq b and both are positive, (a-b)^2 > 0 and ab(a+b) > 0. - Thus, frac{{(a-b)}^2}{2ab(a+b)} > 0, which implies frac{a+b}{2ab} > frac{2}{a+b}. - This means t_{1} > t_{2}, indicating that person B arrives at point B first. Therefore, the final answers are: (1) t_{1} = frac{a+b}{2ab} and t_{2} = frac{2}{a+b}. (2) Person B arrives at point B first. Encapsulating the final answers: - For the time expressions: t_{1} = boxed{frac{a+b}{2ab}} and t_{2} = boxed{frac{2}{a+b}}. - For who arrives first: Person B arrives first, so the answer is boxed{text{Person B}}."},{"instruction":"that significant day, Alice solved three tough riddles at once. She stumbled upon two brothers sitting under a tree, smirking. Alice hoped that during this encounter she would be able to solve three riddles: 1) determine the day of the week; 2) find out which one of the brothers is Tweedledee; 3) figure out whether Tweedledee acts like a Lion or a Unicorn when he lies (this riddle she had long wanted to solve). Upon seeing Alice, the brothers made the following statements. First. Today is not Sunday. Second. Today is Monday. First. Tomorrow is one of the days when Tweedledum lies. Second. The Lion lied yesterday. Alice clapped her hands in delight. The problem was completely solved! What is the solution to this problem?","output":"1. **Analyzing the Logical Statements Given by the Brothers:**     We are given the following information:    - The first brother says: \\"Сегодня не воскресенье\\" (\\"Today is not Sunday\\").    - The second brother says: \\"Сегодня понедельник\\" (\\"Today is Monday\\").    - The first brother says: \\"Завтра - один из дней, когда Труляля лжет.\\" (\\"Tomorrow is one of the days when Trulalla lies.\\").    - The second brother says: \\"Лев лгал вчера.\\" (\\"The Lion lied yesterday.\\"). 2. **Determining the Possible Days:**        According to the problem, both brothers cannot lie on Sunday and assert \\"Today is not Sunday.\\" So, it cannot be Sunday.    Thus, we can conclude that today is not Sunday. 3. **Validating the Truthfulness of Brothers:**        If the first brother is telling the truth with \\"Сегодня не воскресенье,\\" then it's not Sunday. If today were Sunday, he would be lying, which is contradictory because both cannot lie on Sunday.    Therefore, the first brother is telling the truth, and hence the second brother is lying since \\"Сегодня понедельник\\" is false. 4. **Further Analysis Based on the Second Brother's Lie:**    If the second brother is lying and says that \\"Today is Monday,\\" today cannot be Monday. Therefore, today is not Monday. 5. **Identifying the Lie Days of Trulalla and the Lion:**     Since the second brother, Trulalla, lied about \\"Сегодня понедельник,\\" the first brother's statement \\"Завтра - один из дней, когда Труляля лжет.\\" must refer to days other than Saturday (he can only lie about tomorrow being a lie day).     This implies tomorrow is a day Trulalla lies, which can be Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday (considering cyclic logic). 6. **Excluding Days Based on Given Statements:**    The second brother's lie \\"Лев лгал вчера\\" contradicts possible truth that’s applied to check logical constraints, focusing on understanding our true day falling in line with variables as Friday links and not false \\"not Sunday, not Monday.\\" 7. **Final Constraints to Conclude Proper Day Identification:**     - Today can't be Sunday.     - Today can't be Monday.     - Today can't be Saturday (if tomorrow leads one lie days).     - Today not Tuesday (assumed second's lie visibility). 8. **Remaining Constraints Concluding Properly:**        The consistent residues focus Friday identification; tomorrow leads to lies covering \\"Trulalla.\\" Therefore, understanding our correct variable fallacies and balancing the following \\"truth-lie-day,\\" today logically constrains Friday.

There are two cases to consider:    - Case 1: The tens place of ( n ) is zero.    - Case 2: The units place of ( n ) is zero.  Case 1: Tens' Place is Zero 4. Identify numbers with zeros in the tens place, i.e., numbers of the form ( overline{a0c} ):        For instance:    - ( 105 rightarrow 15 )    - ( 108 rightarrow 18 )    - ( 405 rightarrow 45 ) 5.

Simplifying further, since i^2 = -1, we get: [z = 3 - 3i + i + 1 = 4 - 2i.] 4.

Simplify the denominator and numerator separately:    - For the numerator: (3+i)(1+i) = 3(1+i) + i(1+i) = 3 + 3i + i + i^2 = 3 + 4i - 1 = 2 + 4i.    - For the denominator: (1-i)(1+i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. 6.

Why, asks the clever youngster, when I look in the mirror, do my right and left sides switch places, but my top and bottom do not? If the mirror changes sides in the horizontal direction, why doesn't it do so in the vertical direction? Why don't I see myself standing on my head?","output":"Part 1: Compass Paradox at the North Pole 1. **Understanding the Setup:**    - We begin with a person moving towards the North Pole.    - On a standard compass, the directions are marked as ( mathrm{N}, mathrm{E}, mathrm{S}, mathrm{W} ).    - When moving toward the North Pole, East is to the right and West is to the left. 2. **Reaching the Pole:**    - Upon reaching the North Pole and continuing to move, the person must turn around to see the North direction again.    - This action creates a seeming paradox: initially, East was to the right and West to the left, but after passing through the North Pole, the directions seem reversed. 3. **Detailed Analysis:**    - If ( mathrm{W} ) and ( mathrm{E} ) were fixed points, indeed, when moving across the North Pole, ( mathrm{W} ) would change from left to right, and ( mathrm{E} ) from right to left.    - However, ( mathrm{W} ) and ( mathrm{E} ) are directions on the globe and not fixed points. North determines the directionality for East and West.    - Therefore, when you face the North Pole, West (left) and East (right) remain directions relative to North. After crossing the pole, these directions naturally seem to change sides because you are now looking backward.    In essence, the compass still correctly shows East to the right and West to the left according to the globe's coordinate system whether before or after reaching the North Pole.  Part 2: Mirror Reflection Paradox 1. **Initial Observation:**    - Standing in front of a mirror, a person’s right hand appears as the left hand in the reflection, and vice versa.    - However, the top of the body remains the top, and the bottom remains the bottom. 2. **Why This Happens:**    - A mirror reflection does not actually swap left and right physically but swaps front and back.    - When you raise your right hand, it appears to be on the left in the mirror because the reflection reverses the depth axis (front-back), not the horizontal or vertical axes. 3. **Explanation with Directions:**    - Consider a person facing North while looking in the mirror:      - Their East side (right side in reality) appears on the left in the mirror because the mirror reflects the directionality of the body facing it.    - The orientation (top-bottom) does not change because the mirror does not invert vertically; it provides a depth inversion (front-back).  Conclusion: - The paradoxes arise from misconceptions about how directions and reflections work. - For the compass paradox, understanding the globe's coordinate system resolves the seeming direction flip at the North Pole. - For the mirror paradox, recognizing that mirrors invert the depth axis (front-back) rather than the horizontal axes (left-right) clarifies why side-swapping but not top-bottom inversion occurs.

Let us rewrite ( f(x) ): 1. **Analysis of (f(x)) Not Being Identically Zero**:    We need to demonstrate that ( f(x) ) is not identically zero.

Thus:    [    g(y) = 1    ] 3. **Express the odd property for the point**:    Since ( g(x) ) is odd, we write:    [    g(-y) = -1    ]    This implies:    [    f(-y) = g(-y) + 4 = -1 + 4 = 3    ]    Here, ( -y = lg lg 3 ) (noticing that ( lg log_3 10 = - lg lg 3 )). 4. **Find the desired value**:    Since ( -y = lg lg 3 ), we have:    [    f(lg lg 3) = 3    ] # Conclusion: The value of ( f(lg lg 3) ) is: [ boxed{3} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=2 sqrt {3}sin xcos x2sin ^{2}x, xinmathbb{R}, the interval of monotonic increase for the function f(x) is ______.","output":"Solution: f(x)=2 sqrt {3}sin xcos x-2sin ^{2}x   = sqrt {3}sin 2x-1+cos 2x   =2left( dfrac { sqrt {3}}{2}sin 2x+ dfrac {1}{2}cos 2xright)-1   =2sin left(2x+ dfrac {pi}{6}right)-1.   From - dfrac {pi}{2}+2kpileqslant 2x+ dfrac {pi}{6}leqslant dfrac {pi}{2}+2kpi, we get - dfrac {pi}{3}+kpileqslant xleqslant dfrac {pi}{6}+kpi, kinmathbb{Z}.   Thus, the interval of monotonic increase for the function f(x) is left[kpi- dfrac {pi}{3},kpi+ dfrac {pi}{6}right], (kinmathbb{Z}).   Therefore, the answer is: boxed{left[kpi- dfrac {pi}{3},kpi+ dfrac {pi}{6}right], (kinmathbb{Z})}.   By using the double angle formulas for sine and cosine, and the formula for the sine of the sum of two angles, and then applying the monotonicity of composite functions, we can find the interval of monotonic increase for f(x).   This question tests the application of the double angle formulas for sine and cosine, the formula for the sine of the sum of two angles, and the monotonicity of composite functions, making it a basic question."},{"instruction":"Given a parabola C with focus F and equation y^{2}=2px(p > 0), two points A, B on C satisfy overrightarrow{AF}=3overrightarrow{FB}.

Given the conditions, it's clear that the slope of line AB exists and is not 0. Let the equation of line AB be y=k(x-frac{p}{2}). Let A(x_{1},y_{1}), B(x_{2},y_{2}), and the midpoint of AB be M(x,y). overrightarrow{AF}=(frac{p}{2}-x_{1},-y_{1}), overrightarrow{FB}=(x_{2}-frac{p}{2},y_{2}). Given overrightarrow{AF}=3overrightarrow{FB}, we have frac{p}{2}-x_{1}=3(x_{2}-frac{p}{2}), which leads to 3x_{2}+x_{1}=2p (1). From begin{cases} y=k(x-frac{p}{2})  y^{2}=2px end{cases}, we get k^{2}x^{2}-(k^{2}+2)px+frac{k^{2}p^{2}}{4}=0. By Vieta's formulas, we know x_{1}+x_{2}=frac{(k^{2}+2)p}{k^{2}} (2), and x_{1}x_{2}=frac{p^{2}}{4} (3). Solving (1) and (2), we get x_{1}=frac{k^{2}p+6p}{2k^{2}}, x_{2}=frac{k^{2}p-2p}{2k^{2}}. Substituting into (3), we find k^{2}=3. Therefore, x=frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}=frac{5p}{6}. The distance d from M to the directrix is d=x+frac{p}{2}=frac{4p}{3}. Thus, frac{4p}{3}=frac{16}{3}, solving for p gives p=4. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is y^{2}=8x. Hence, the answer is: boxed{y^{2}=8x}. By substituting the equation of line l into the parabola equation, using Vieta's formulas and vector coordinate operations, we can find the value of k. Then, using the midpoint coordinate formula, we can find the x-coordinate of M, and thus the distance d from M to the directrix, leading to the equation of the parabola. This problem tests the relationship between a line and a parabola, Vieta's formulas, vector coordinate operations, and the midpoint coordinate formula, assessing computational skills. It is considered a medium-difficulty question."},{"instruction":"A farmer has three trucks to carry water to his farm. Each truck uses three tanks with a capacity of 150 liters of water.

Here is a detailed step-by-step explanation of why this set works: 1. **Define the Set**:     Let the set be ( S = { 2^{2k+1} mid k geq 0 } ). For instance, the set will have elements like ( 2^1, 2^3, 2^5, ldots ). 2. **General Form of Elements**:     Consider ( a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_n ) where each ( a_i = 2^{2k_i+1} ) for some ( k_i in mathbb{N} cup {0} ). 3. **Summation of Elements**:     Consider the sum of any finite number of distinct elements ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) from set ( S ):     [     a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n = 2^{2k_1+1} + 2^{2k_2+1} + cdots + 2^{2k_n+1}     ] 4. **Factor out the Smallest Power**:     Without loss of generality, assume ( k_1 < k_2 < cdots < k_n ):     [     2^{2k_1+1} + 2^{2k_2+1} + cdots + 2^{2k_n+1} = 2^{2k_1+1}left(1 + 2^{(2k_2+1)-(2k_1+1)} + cdots + 2^{(2k_n+1)-(2k_1+1)}right)     ]     Simplify the exponent differences, let (d_i = 2k_i - 2k_1), we have:     [     = 2^{2k_1+1} left(1 + 2^{d_2} + cdots + 2^{d_n}right)     ] 5. **Odd Factor Insight**:     Notice that (d_2, ldots, d_n) are even since (2k_i - 2k_1) will always be even (as they are differences of even numbers):     [     = 2^{2k_1+1}left(1 + 2^e text{(for even e's)} right)     ]     The expression inside the parentheses, i.e., (1 + 2^{text{even}} + cdots + 2^{text{even}}) results in an odd number because 1 (an odd number) is added to a series of even numbers. Let this sum be (m), which is odd. 6. **Examining the Sum for a Square**:     Since (m) is odd, consider:     [     a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n = 2^{2k_1+1} cdot m     ]     The term (2^{2k_1+1} cdot m) is divisible by (2^{2k_1+1}), an odd power of 2. For a number to be a perfect square, all prime powers in its prime factorization must be even. The presence of an odd power of 2 in (2^{2k_1+1}) ensures that their sum cannot be a perfect square since the power of 2 would not be even. # Conclusion: Thus, using the set ( { 2^1, 2^3, 2^5, ldots } ) of odd powers of 2, we ensure that the sum of any finite number of elements in this set is not a square.

Since these are consecutive odd numbers, they form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. 2. **Sum of the Arithmetic Sequence:**        The sum (S_n) of the first (n) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:    [    S_n = frac{n}{2} left( a_1 + a_n right)    ]     3. **Properties of Odd Numbers:**        For an arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd numbers, the first term (a_1) and the (n)-th term (a_n) are both odd. The sum of two odd numbers is always even. Therefore, (a_1 + a_n) is an even number. 4. **Analysis of the Sequence Sum:**        Let (k) be the integer such that:    [    frac{a_1 + a_n}{2} = k quad text{(since (a_1 + a_n) is even)}    ]        Thus, the sum (S_n) can be rewritten as:    [    S_n = n cdot k    ]    where (k) is an integer. 5. **Constraints on n and k:**        Since the sequence has at least two terms ((n geq 2)), and (a_1 + a_n geq 4) (the sum of the smallest two positive odd numbers, 1 and 3, which is 4), it follows that (k geq 2).     6. **Conclusion on Prime Sum:**        The sum (S_n = n cdot k) must be the product of two integers (n) and (k) where both (n geq 2) and (k geq 2). Therefore, (S_n) is always the product of two positive integers greater than 1, which implies that (S_n) cannot be a prime number.

The probability of picking another red ball on the second draw is: P(Red2 | Red1) = 4/11 The probability of both events happening (picking a red ball on the first draw and then another red ball on the second draw) is the product of the probabilities of each individual event: P(Both Red) = P(Red1) * P(Red2 | Red1) P(Both Red) = (5/12) * (4/11) Now, let's calculate this probability: P(Both Red) = (5/12) * (4/11) = 20/132 = 5/33 ≈ 0.15151515151515152 Since the calculated probability matches the given probability, we can conclude that the number of balls picked at random, n, is boxed{2} ."},{"instruction":"Carlo has a music recital next week.

What is the radius of the inscribed circle?","output":"Let's begin by understanding the problem: Given a symmetric trapezoid (ABCD) where (AB parallel CD) and (AB=2a geq 2b=CD), an inscribed circle can be drawn whose center (K) bisects the diameter of the circumcircle drawn through point (O) with radius (R=1). We need to find the radius (varrho) of the inscribed circle. 1. **Identify the properties of the trapezoid:**    - Since the trapezoid is symmetric and an inscribed circle can be drawn, the equality (AD + BC = AB + CD) holds. Given (AB = 2a) and (CD = 2b), we find:      [      AD + BC = 2a + 2b      ]    - The height (h) of the trapezoid responds to the diameters of the inscribed circle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:      [      2varrho = sqrt{(a + b)^2 - (a - b)^2}      ]      Simplifying:      [      sqrt{a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - (a - b)^2} = sqrt{a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - (a^2 - 2ab + b^2)}      ]      [      sqrt{4ab} = 2sqrt{ab}      ]      Hence:      [      varrho = sqrt{ab}      ] 2. **Understanding the distance (OK = frac{1}{2}):**    - Assume the distance from (O) (center of the circumcircle) to (K) (center of the inscribed circle) is (OK = frac{1}{2}). The distances from (O) to lengths (a) and (b) can be expressed as:      [      a^2 = R^2 - left(frac{R}{2} - varrhoright)^2 = frac{3}{4} - varrho^2 + varrho      ]      [      b^2 = frac{3}{4} - varrho^2 - varrho      ] 3. **Putting it all together:**    - By multiplying the refined expressions of (a^2) and (b^2) we get:      [      varrho^4 = a^2b^2 = left(frac{3}{4} - varrho^2right)^2 - varrho^2      ]      Simplifying further:      [      varrho = sqrt{frac{9}{40}}      ] 4. **Verify with derived relationships:**    - From Euler's relation for the particular bicentric quadrilateral:      [      2varrho^2 left(R^2 + d^2right) = (R^2 - d^2)^2      ]      Using distances, we find:      [      varrho^2 = frac{left(frac{3}{4}right)^2}{frac{10}{4}} = frac{9}{40}      ] Thus, the radius (varrho) of the inscribed circle in the symmetric trapezoid is: [ boxed{ varrho = sqrt{frac{9}{40}} = 0.4743 text{ units} } ]"},{"instruction":"Let y be a positive number such that when it is raised to the power of z, it is equal to the cube of the positive square root of 16.

Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. **Initial Setup and Rules:**    - There are two heaps with (a) and (b) pebbles, respectively.    - In the first round, Barry chooses a positive integer (k), and Andrew takes away (k) pebbles from one of the heaps.    - In the second round, the roles are reversed: Andrew chooses a positive integer (k), and Barry takes away (k) pebbles from one of the heaps.    - The game continues with the roles reversing each round.    - The player who takes the last pebble loses the game. 2. **Key Observations:**    - The game is symmetric in terms of the roles of the players, but the initial move is made by Barry.    - The critical point is to determine the conditions under which a player can force the other player to take the last pebble. 3. **Winning and Losing Positions:**    - A losing position is one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position.    - A winning position is one where there exists at least one move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. 4. **Analysis of Small Cases:**    - If (a = 1) and (b = 1), the player to move loses because they must take the last pebble.    - If (a = 1) and (b > 1), or (a > 1) and (b = 1), the player to move can always leave the opponent with ((1, 1)), which is a losing position. 5. **General Case Analysis:**    - If (a + b = 2^x + 1) for some integer (x), the player to move is in a losing position. This is because any move will leave the opponent with a sum of pebbles that is not of the form (2^x + 1), and the opponent can always return to a position of the form (2^x + 1) on their turn.    - If (a = 2^x + 1) and (b < a), or (b = 2^x + 1) and (a < b), the player to move is in a losing position for similar reasons. 6. **Conclusion:**    - If the initial configuration satisfies (a = 1) or (b = 1) or (a + b = 2^x + 1) or (a = 2^x + 1) and (b < a) or (b = 2^x + 1) and (a < b), then Andrew has a winning strategy.    - Otherwise, Barry has a winning strategy.

Solution: # Part (b) - Proof: To prove that it is impossible to have more than 17 cells colored under the given constraints: 1. **Assumption and Initial Division**:     - Assume we have managed to color 18 cells.     - Divide the 9 times 9 square into nine smaller 3 times 3 squares. 2. **Numbering and Notation**:     - Label the rows from ( a ) to ( i ) and the columns from ( 1 ) to ( 9 ) (giving each cell a coordinate like ( a1 ), ( b2 ), etc.).     - Name the smaller (3 times 3) squares using Greek letters, say from ( alpha ) to ( theta ) (as illustrated on the right-side diagram). 3. **Observation on (3 times 3) Squares**:     - Note that each (3 times 3) square cannot have more than two cells colored, as otherwise, the minimum distance constraint (greater than 2) would be violated. 4. **Centre and Corner Cells Consideration**:     - Since each (3 times 3) square can have a maximum of 2 colored cells, and there are 9 such squares, ideally, there would be ( 2 times 9 = 18 ) cells.     - Each (3 times 3) square must have one of the colored cells in a corner due to distance constraints.          **Central Square (( varepsilon )) Analysis**:     - Suppose the central (3 times 3) square ( varepsilon ) has a cell ( d4 ) colored in it.     - Then, to avoid contradiction, any other (3 times 3) squares must also comply with the distance condition and allow a proper selection of corners for another cell (2 total per (3 times 3)). 5. **Corners' and Potential Conflicts**:     - For the top-left (3 times 3) square ( alpha ):         - If ( a1 ) or such corners are selected for a colored cell, then following squares ( beta ), ( gamma ) ... cause conflicts in pattern consistency.      6. **Contradiction Observation for Remaining Cells**:     - Proceed examining by ensuring distance constraints on cells in other respective (3 times 3) named squares:         - ( beta ), ( delta ), etc., to test corners and the placement typically form spatial conflicts.     - Especially when ensuring the second presumptive colored cell in the assumed central square further disqualifies placements in attached (3 times 3) as analyzed before.        7. **Conclusion of Contradiction**:     - The contradiction arises from none of the drawn valid placements actually satisfying all distance constraints.     - Hence, the initial assumption of having 18 colored cells is incorrect due to spatial violations per the given problem. [ boxed{text{It is impossible to have more than 17 colored cells in the given constraints.}} ] # Conclusion: The proof illustrates that coloring more than 17 cells in a 9 times 9 grid while adhering to the stipulation of distances between centers being greater than 2 units is inherently contradictory, conclusively proving the impossibility.

The rays (AB) and (DC) intersect at point (S). The circle (omega), passing through (A, O, C), intersects the segment (CD) at point (M neq C). We need to prove that (M) is the midpoint of the segment (DS).  Steps: 1. **Initial Observations and Angle Calculation:**    * Since (ABCD) is inscribed in (Omega) and (BD) is the diameter, (angle BAC) and (angle BDC) are right angles because an angle subtended by a diameter in a circle is a right angle due to the Inscribed Angle Theorem.     2. **Angles in the Inscribed Quadrilateral:**    * Considering quadrilateral (AOMC) which is inscribed in circle (omega):      [      alpha = angle OAC      ]      [      angle OMC = 180^circ - alpha      ]      since opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to (180^circ) (cyclic quadrilateral property).       3. **Isosceles Triangle Property:**    * Triangle (OAC) is isosceles with (OA = OC) (radii of circle (Omega)), hence:      [      angle OCA = alpha      ]     4. **Angles around (C):**        * (angle OCD) and (angle ODC) are denoted as (beta). Thus,      [      angle ACD = angle OCA + angle OCD = alpha + beta      ] 5. **Angles relating to (S):**        * Since (angle CAB) and (angle CDB) are subtended by the same arc (CB) in (Omega):      [      angle CAS = angle CAD = beta      ] 6. **Exterior Angles in Triangle (ACS):**    * (angle ACD) is an exterior angle for triangle (ACS), and thus:      [      angle ACD = angle CAS + angle CSA      ]      Substituting values from prior steps:      [      alpha + beta = beta + angle CSA Rightarrow alpha = angle CSA      ] 7. **Parallel Lines and Midpoint:**    * Observing that (angle OMD) is equal to (angle CSA) implies:      [      alpha = angle OMD      ]      This implies (MO parallel SA).       8. **Median Line Property:**        - As (O) is the midpoint of (BD) (which is a diameter of (Omega)):      - (MO) is the median line in triangle (BSD). 9. **Conclusion:**        - Since (MO) is parallel to (SA) and passes through the midpoint (O) of (BD), it follows that (M) is the midpoint of (DS) according to the midpoint theorem.

Let (O) be the circumcenter of triangle (ABC). 2. **Mapping and Positioning Points**:     Identify arbitrarily any point (X) on the plane. Let (X_i) be the reflection of (X) across the corresponding line (l_i). Consequently, select (M) as another arbitrary point on the plane, and reflect it similarly to determine points (M_1, M_2,) and (M_3). 3. **Considering Midpoints**:    Let's denote the midpoints of segments (O_1O_2), (O_2O_3), and (O_3O_1) as ((O_1, O_2, O_3)) respectively, and the midpoints of segments (M_1M_2), (M_2M_3), and (M_3M_1) as ((P_1, P_2, P_3)), respectively. 4. **Parallelism and Homothety**:     Since we know that segments connecting the midpoints of the sides of a triangle are parallel to the sides of the triangle itself and half the length (by the Midline Theorem), we observe that triangles (Delta O_1O_2O_3) and (Delta ABC) are similar by a homothety with center (O) and ratio 2. 5. **Homothety Argument**:     Note, due to the geometric arrangement:     [     overrightarrow{M_iO_i} = text{translation vector for reflection} implies overrightarrow{P_1O_1} = overrightarrow{M_1O_1} + overrightarrow{M_2O_2} text{ is symmetric with respect to the median lines in} triangle O_1O_2O_3.     ]    6. **Rotational Symmetry**:     Because vectors (overrightarrow{M_1O_1}) and (overrightarrow{M_2O_2}) are symmetric due to reflection, each midpoint vector forms angles (2 angle C) in relation to the respective lines forming triangles. Therefore, by ensuring the translation and rotational symmetry invariances, the intersection argument holds through the cyclic properties and symmetry in Euclidean space. 7. **General Conclusion**:     Since the segments connecting the midpoints must adhere to these symmetry transformations and alignments through circumcenter arguments,     the point of intersection of these lines and their reflective properties is preserved under these transformations.
