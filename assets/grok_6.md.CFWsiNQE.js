Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Steven Vasquez directed and co-wrote with James Townsend, the star, this strange little drama cum horror flick with evidently very good ideas and intentions: make a gay film that takes a different storyline than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be judged on its merits as a thriller. So why doesn't it work? For starters the film loses direction from the opening frame and wanders rather aimlessly throughout the film, dead set on making a suspense thriller but getting sidetracked into satisfying an audience who wants to see nude encounters. Not that that is a bad thing: it can certainly enhance some films that have been Hollywood successes. The film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women, relationships, disturbed parenting, the club scene with all the wild antics that accompany such events - and murder. It is all a bit much to cram into a 96-minute film. Devon (James Townsend) by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend Jenna (Sarah Kelly) but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets Brian (Alex Wilson) who has been down the same path and can offer Devon assistance on every level. They bond, Devon comes out, and the mysteries begin: boys are missing in the neighborhood, Devon's stepfather psychologist Dr. Kirk Tyler (Dan Swett) is not at all what he appears to be and despite Devon's consoling mother Donna (Sonja Fisher) Devon is cast into the streets because of his new relationship. It seems Dr Tyler is in a dark business with hunky Detective Cunningham (Earl McDougle) who apparently is investigating the missing boys... Devon gathers his resources from his understanding girlfriend Jenna and her cronies and together the group unveils the dark doings of Dr. Tyler and his detective sidekick. And through it all Donna radiates warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy, etc. Some of the actors are pleasing to the eye (and there is very little the eye doesn't examine frequently!) but the degree of acting is at an all time low. The only thing that makes us forgive that (and in some cases it is just too poor to forgive) is the feeling of commitment on the part of everyone involved. Yes, this is a low budget movie and yes, the director needs time to learn his trade. But in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level. Maybe their next one will be more polished. Grady Harp Available options: (i). negative; (ii). positive;","output":"(iii). mixed.  Based on the provided review, the correct sentiment is mixed.

Make no mistake, Al Gore is a POLITICIAN! Three years ago he was busted/ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving NOT a hybrid, a Yugo, or even a GM Metro but a LINCOLN (go google it if you like)! Or how about the fact that Mr. Gore & his Hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel-guzzling jets to attend the premiers of \\"An Inconvenient Truth.\\" So much for conservation huh, Al? Anyway, it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" & discover the main fundamental flaw. While the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the EFFECTS of supposed \\"global Warming\\" there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed CAUSE of it. For example: I can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot & they can point out an automobile which is not running right. BUT can they tell you with any degree of certainty WHY? Generally not! A second flaw, just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago (the toilet wasn't even invented yet)? What did they have, a June bug in a match box? Hell, even 50-60 years ago? Therefore, how do we know with ANY degree of certainty that the planet is \\"getting warmer\\" when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best? Or that man is THE sole cause of it? The answer is we don't & Science is NEVER a consensus. Thirty years ago, Time Magazine did a cover proclaiming a \\"New Ice Age\\". The truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in Earth Science will tell you that Volcanic Erruptions, Solar Activity & El Ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed \\"Global Warming.\\" Finally, what Al Gore fails to adequately address is; even IF America decides to follow the global gospel according to Al & implement everything he recommends, how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism? Answer: It's wishful thinking, Mr. Gore & you being a former VP of the USA know it! If the folks who produced \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" were really honest, they would have titled their film \\"Al Gore Wants Attention.\\" But what I'd really like is for someone to ask the former VP this; why were two of the planet's biggest polluters (AKA China & India) EXEMPT from abiding by the Kyoto Accords?

Movie title: Detour Movie plot: Edgar G. Ulmer's Detour begins in a diner somewhere in the middle of nowhere as Al Roberts (Tom Neal) ruminates in voice over about his life and what has lead him to this place in time. Hes got a tale to tell and theres a reason because it has taught Al something about Fate. His experiences have left Al irascible and he argues sullenly with the waitress, the diner manager and a trucker who drops a nickel in a juke box and plays the song that Al and his girlfriend called their song. Als problem becomes more apparent as he explains the events that have brought him here. In flashback he talks about his relationship with his singer girlfriend Sue (Claudia Drake) as he accompanied her on piano in a New York club. When she leaves for fame and fortune in Los Angeles Al is lonely and decides to hitch hike to the coast to be with her. He accepts a ride from good-time-Charlie Charles Haskell Jr. (Edmund MacDonald). During their drive Haskell tells Al a little about himself, relating a story about deep scratches he has on his hand that he received when he picked up a woman who shunned his advances.

Choices:  - dendrites  - synapses  - Sensory Receptors  - the nodes  A: The answer is:","output":"The nodes, specifically, the nodes of Ranvier. The extracellular fluid is in contact with the axon membrane only at the nodes, which are small gaps in the myelin sheath. To understand this better, let's delve into the structure and function of neurons, which are the primary cells within the nervous system. Neurons are comprised of several parts: the soma (cell body), dendrites, the axon, and axon terminal. These components work in coordination to transmit signals within the nervous system. Dendrites: These are projections that extend from the soma, receiving signals from other neurons and transmitting them towards the cell body. Synapses: These are the junctions between neurons where information is exchanged. They can be electrical or chemical, and information is transmitted using neurotransmitters that cross the synaptic cleft. Sensory Receptors: They are specialized cells that detect specific stimuli, such as touch, pressure, or temperature, and convert them into electrical signals, which are then relayed to neurons. Axons: The axon is a long, slender projection that transmits electrical signals away from the soma towards other neurons, muscles, or glands. An insulating myelin sheath covers many axons, which functions to increase the speed of signal transmission and prevent signal degradation. The myelin sheath has gaps known as the nodes of Ranvier. At these nodes, the axon membrane is in direct contact with the extracellular fluid, enabling the exchange of ions across the membrane. This is essential for the proper conduction of electrical impulses along the axon. In summary, the extracellular fluid is only in contact with the axon membrane at the nodes of Ranvier. This unique structure facilitates efficient signal conduction within the nervous system by enabling ions to cross the membrane at select locations, thus propagating the electrical impulses rapidly while conserving energy."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Paragraph: Health officials have warned that the region, home to a fifth of the world’s population, could be the new frontline against the disease because of millions living in packed slums and fragile public health systems. India’s caseload rose to 13,387, a jump of nearly 700 over the previous day, despite a harsh lockdown now in its fourth week and which will last at least until early May. Authorities have identified a fifth of India’s hundreds of  districts as red zones with the highest number of cases, including the cities of New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Hyderabad. But Lav Agarwal, federal health joint secretary leading the fight against the coronavirus, said the rate of increase of infections was slowing because of the lockdown of 1.3 billion people in the world’s second-most populous country after China. Before the shutdown, the number of cases was doubling every three days, but now it was taking 6.2 days to double, Agarwal said, citing government data. “There is a decline, but we have to remain (in) the fight,” he said. The government has said it will permit farm and industrial activity in parts of the countryside that are least affected by the coronavirus from next week to lessen the pain for millions. Authorities in the resort islands of the Maldives placed the capital Male under a 14-day lockdown after eight people tested positive over the last three days, taking the total to 28. The government had earlier stopped all travel to and from the tropical islands and shut down businesses. But on Friday, the Health Protection Agency issued strict stay-at-home orders for Male, home to 40 percent of the country’s population of 450,000, fearing a big outbreak in the congested city. Maldives, best known for its white sands and palm-fringed atolls, reported its first case at the beginning of March when two employees of an island resort tested positive. Bangladesh also warned its 160 million people that the country was at risk after positive cases were detected in 45 districts out of a total of 64. It warned of strict action against anyone violating stay-at-home orders. “Only social distancing can keep the outbreak under control as no vaccine or treatment is available for the disease,” the directorate general of health services said in a statement. The big worry remains the low level of testing across the region. India has slowly raised the number to a little over 27,000 on Thursday, but in comparison with other countries it remains small given the huge population. India has tested 203 people per million of its population, lower than Brazil (296) and well behind the United States at 9,866 and Italy 18,481, all of which are themselves considered laggards in the race to screen as many people as possible. Here are official government figures on the spread of the coronavirus in South Asia:  * India has 13,387 confirmed cases, including 437 deaths  * Pakistan has 5,988 cases, including 107 deaths  * Bangladesh has 1838 cases, including 75 deaths  * Afghanistan has 906 cases, including 30 deaths  * Sri Lanka has 238 cases, including 7 deaths  * Maldives has 28 cases and no deaths  * Nepal has 16 cases and no deaths  * Bhutan has five cases and no deaths  Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser Claim: South Asia coronavirus cases hit 22,000 as Maldives locks down capital.

Answer the following question: As it turned out, Greg would have had a hard time canceling the check, even if he'd changed his mind. Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that. Of course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours. They needed to cash that check and disappear as soon as they could. The bank put up a bit of a fuss about the check, which was one more reason Paul hated Bank of Fucking America. They always had some rule to screw a customer. But Chloe made a bunch of noise and actually jumped up and down at one point and eventually they walked out of the bank with a cashier's check.

You are given a new situation: Marcus has a long day ahead of him. He woke up early, around 7 AM to start his day. For a research study he takes his blood pressure around 9 AM and continues on through his day. Around noon he takes his blood pressure again noting that it has increased a little. He takes his blood pressure one more time before going to bed around 10PM  and a hint : Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours.  Please answer this question : Will an animals blood pressure be at its highest in the middle of the day or at its lowest? A:","output":"Based on the provided information about circadian rhythms and their influence on blood pressure and other biological processes, it is likely that an animal's blood pressure will be at its highest in the middle of the day. This is because most activities, including eating and drinking, tend to occur during daytime hours, causing physiological changes within the body. Additionally, in humans, blood pressure changes in a regular way throughout the 24-hour cycle, with an increase during the day. However, it is essential to note that the specific patterns of circadian rhythms may vary among different animal species.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. O'Neill was born in a hotel, the Barrett House, at Broadway and 43rd Street, on what was then Longacre Square (now Times Square). A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway, which houses offices, retail, and ABC Studios. He was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O'Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan, who was also of Irish descent. After suffering from multiple health problems (including depression and alcoholism) over many years, O'Neill ultimately faced a severe Parkinsons-like tremor in his hands which made it impossible for him to write during the last 10 years of his life; he had tried using dictation but found himself unable to compose in that way. While at Tao House, O'Neill had intended to write a cycle of 11 plays chronicling an American family since the 1800s. Only two of these, A Touch of the Poet and More Stately Mansions, were ever completed. As his health worsened, O'Neill lost inspiration for the project and wrote three largely autobiographical plays, The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey into Night, and A Moon for the Misbegotten. He managed to complete Moon for the Misbegotten in 1943, just before leaving Tao House and losing his ability to write. Drafts of many other uncompleted plays were destroyed by Carlotta at Eugene's request.  O'Neill died in Room 401 of the Sheraton Hotel (now Boston University's Shelton Hall) on Bay State Road in Boston, on November 27, 1953, at the age of 65. As he was dying, he whispered his last words: \\"I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room.\\" Dr. Harry Kozol, the lead prosecuting expert of the Patty Hearst trial, treated O'Neill during these last years of illness. He also was present for O'Neill's death and announced the fact to the public.  O'Neill is interred in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood.  In 1956 Carlotta arranged for his autobiographical play Long Day's Journey into Night to be published, although his written instructions had stipulated that it not be made public until 25 years after his death. It was produced on stage to tremendous critical acclaim and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957. This last play is widely considered to be his finest. Other posthumously-published works include A Touch of the Poet (1958) and More Stately Mansions (1967).  The United States Postal Service honored O'Neill with a Prominent Americans series (1965-1978) 1 postage stamp.

It gives you a chance to slow down, to relax and to appreciate yourself and your life in general. It helps you slow down enough to breathe deeply, to calm your thoughts, and to research the natural world filled with wonders. And yes, to love yourself more. Try to spend one day for a long travel on foot--far from the requirements of work and family. First, choose a date and mark it as your \\"relaxing day\\". Next, choose a place that you want to visit on foot. If you enjoy being out in nature, head to a wide and open place. Try to choose a place that's no more than 15 minutes from your home. You want to spend your time walking, not driving. Walk at an easy speed so you can walk longer and farther. If you normally walk two miles a day, go for four to six miles. Wear comfortable clothes. If it's warm, wear a hat to protect your face. And don't forget your sunglasses-- not only to protect your eyes but also to give you a sense of privacy while you walk. Before you go out, get up early so you can spend a few minutes relaxing. Relaxing is something few people spend in their spare time, but it leaves you feeling much lighter and less annoyed. Read something relaxing before you leave home, and it'll put you in a different condition of mind. And, of course, eat a healthy breakfast and drink plenty of water. Then pick up your backpack and head out. And enjoy yourself. Question: From the passage, we can control our feeling by  _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"having a long walk\\"?

The playing time of a phonograph record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing. At the beginning of the 20th century, the early discs played for two minutes, the same as early cylinder records. The 12-inch disc, introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to three and a half minutes. Because a 10-inch 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music, almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. For example, when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings, recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923, one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52–2:59. What factors would effect playing time of a phonograph?","output":"The playing time of a phonograph record is affected by various factors, such as: 1. Turntable speed: The rotational speed of the turntable on which the record plays has a significant impact on the playing time. Records with a faster speed, such as 78 rpm (revolutions per minute), have shorter playing times because the stylus covers more groove length per minute. Slower speeds, such as 33⅓ or 45 rpm, typically increase playing time as the stylus moves through the grooves at a slower pace, allowing for more sound to be recorded. 2. Groove spacing: The spacing between the grooves on a record also affects its playing time. Widely spaced grooves allow for longer sound waves, resulting in longer playing time. Conversely, more grooves packed into a given space will result in less space for each sound wave, leading to a reduced playing time. Some records utilize microgroove technology, featuring narrower grooves, which can hold more recording time. 3. Record size: The physical size of the record itself plays a role in determining the playing time. Larger records have more surface area, allowing for more grooves and thus more playing time. For instance, a 12-inch record can hold more audio than a 10-inch record. As mentioned in the article, the introduction of the 12-inch disc in 1903 increased the playing time of phonograph records. 4. Recording techniques: The techniques used during recording can also impact the playing time. Some recording processes compress the sound waves, fitting more audio content within a given space. However, this can sometimes lead to reduced audio quality. 5. Material: The quality and type of material the record is made of can also affect the playing time. Softer materials, such as vinyl, allow for deeper and wider grooves, leading to better audio quality and longer playing times, while harder materials, like shellac found in early 78 rpm records, often have shallower grooves, resulting in shorter playing times. In summary, the playing time of a phonograph record is influenced by factors including turntable speed, groove spacing, record size, recording techniques, and the material used to create the record. Advances in technology and manufacturing processes allowed for adjustments in these factors, thereby improving playing times and audio quality over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated.

Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What do ancathostega have four of?\\" is Limbs. Acanthostega is considered one of the earliest tetrapods found and provides essential insights into the early evolution of vertebrates. Tetrapods are defined as vertebrates with four limbs, and as amphibians, they represent the first true tetrapods. Acanthostega lived during the late Devonian period, approximately 360 million years ago. This ancient creature played a crucial role in the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments of early vertebrates. While it still possessed some fish-like features, it was characterized by its distinct four limbs. The limbs of Acanthostega were relatively short, with well-developed digits. They most likely allowed the creature to navigate shallow waters and the bottoms of swamps, although its flat and sprawling limbs were not as adapted to terrestrial life compared to some of its later descendants. Its limbs retained some flipper-like characteristics, suggesting that it was not yet fully adapted to walking on land. Other options listed in the answer choices like eggs, feet, wings, alveoli, lungs, ovaries, and rings do not represent the primary characteristic that defines Acanthostega as one of the first true tetrapods. While it's true that Acanthostega had lungs, it also had gills, further illustrating its evolutionary journey from water to land. The limbs of this ancient amphibian reveal vital information about the gradual transition from fins to limbs in the evolutionary history of vertebrates. In summary, Acanthostega, as one of the earliest and most complete tetrapods, is best characterized by its four limbs. These limbs provide critical evidence of the evolutionary steps taken by early vertebrates in their adaptation to life on land, marking a significant milestone in the history of life on Earth."},{"instruction":"Q: What proteins synthesized in cells act as catalysts?

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   As a result of sand mining, Would Qatar's fisheries earn more money or less money than Oman's fisheries?  Twenty first century is seeing an explosion of artificial island building. Many countries are building islands in the middle of seas and oceans, which they often use for tourism or for defensive purposes. For example, UAE had build several islands in the Persian Gulf. To build those islands they had to ask Oman and Qatar to export sand to them. Qatar declined to export sand, but Oman agreed. Oman in turn had to mine huge quantity of sand in their own country.  Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","output":"Based on the information in the paragraph, Qatar's fisheries would earn more money than Oman's fisheries. This is because Qatar declined to export sand for artificial island building, while Oman agreed and had to mine large quantities of sand in their own country. Sand mining causes erosion and impacts the local wildlife, including harm to organisms like coral and destruction of fisheries, financially harming their operators. Since Qatar did not engage in sand mining, its fisheries would not suffer from these negative effects and would therefore earn more money compared to Oman's fisheries, which are impacted by sand mining."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- A 35-year-old father found to be sane when he killed his three young daughters last July was sentenced to three life sentences without the possibility of parole Monday. St. Croix County Judge Howard Cameron said the lives of sisters Amara,11, Sophie, 8, and Cecilia, 5, were each so important that Aaron Schaffhausen had to serve each sentence consecutively. \\"Each child has to be recognized as an individual girl,\\" Cameron said. \\"To make it concurrent would diminish what happened to those young girls.\\" Schaffhausen and his wife Jessica had recently divorced when he came to spend the day with his daughters last year. \\"You can say, 'Three young girls are dead, we've lost their lives, he did it because he hated","output":"his ex-wife and wanted to make her suffer.' But that doesn't begin to capture the horror of this crime, the tragic impact on this family, and the community who loved these beautiful young girls,\\" said Prosecutor Linda Smith during the sentencing hearing. Schaffhausen, expressionless and dressed in a simple orange prison jumpsuit, showed no visible emotion during the statement or when he was sentenced. The courtroom was packed with family and community members, some of whom openly sobbed during the proceedings. Prior to the sentencing, family members of the victims were allowed to make impact statements, sharing stories of their loved ones and the monumental loss they've experienced. One by one, the grandmother, aunts, and other relatives stood at the podium, battling through tears as they described the pain and emptiness that the loss of the three girls has left them. Schaffhausen's ex-wife, Jessica, also took the stand, launching into an emotional and heartbreaking account of the devastation he had willfully caused for his own malicious reasons. \\"You killed my babies, my everything, in the cruelest kind of way,\\" she addressed her ex-husband directly. \\"You made sure that I will never be able to hug, kiss, laugh with them, or comfort them ever again. You shattered so many lives, and for what? Just to spite me? You'll never know the damage you caused, but I hope you'll never get to sleep another restful night for as long as you live.\\" The defense, in a bid for a lighter sentence, had argued that Schaffhausen was mentally unfit when he committed the murders. They called on psychologists who testified that he had a severe adjustment disorder and suffered from depression. However, the prosecution successfully countered those claims by presenting extensive evidence that showed Schaffhausen was fully aware of his actions and planned the murders deliberately. After several weeks of proceedings and testimonies, the jury eventually found Schaffhausen guilty of three counts of intentional homicide, as well as one count of attempted arson. During the sentencing, Judge Cameron told Schaffhausen, \\"You took three beautiful girls from this world, girls who did nothing to deserve such hatred from their own father. You tried to control your wife and hurt her in the worst possible way, and for that, I'm giving you the maximum punishment allowed under Wisconsin State law.\\" He then announced the three consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole, ensuring that Schaffhausen would remain behind bars for the rest of his life. In the aftermath of the heart-wrenching case, the community continued to grieve the loss of the three young girls, in mourning for the bright futures they'll never be allowed to experience. Memorials, vigils, and fundraisers were organized by community members and extended family, and plans for a permanent memorial were discussed. Moving forward, the hope is to remember Amara, Sophie, and Cecilia for their joy and brightness in life, rather than the horrific circumstances surrounding their deaths."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Test it out, observe and study your subject.  Be objective and look at everything as if you have never seen it before. Observe it as if it's a totally unique thing, but most importantly, observe your relationship or interaction with the experience and the object. The ways we can learn the most about a subject as well as how to gain the best outcome is to observe our relationships - how do we feel about the experience - is the mind open or closed to the experience?  This helps you observe life more completely, rather than being selective, or allowing parts of the mind to cloud the issue.  Ask yourself often to identify what you see, as you might not always know, even if you do identify it but a secondary feeling or idea arises, then identify that as well. Once you can identify them, you can explore them, just like once you've identified the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, you can start to put the puzzle together and you can gain practical understanding and skills. Luckily, in essence there are very few cases when the solution to many of our life challenges aren't already within the problem we experience - or in essence, our relationship with the problem. By exploring the foundation of the problem, a solution can be found, or if a solution is simply impossible, then a person can then start to come to terms with accepting the realities of life and finding a silver lining or creative opportunity if they are practical. In life aspects, many of our frustrations, unhappiness, depression and sorrows happen because we aren't looking at things completely and applying our understanding, or observing the issue to understand it. Generally it is wise to go back to the beginning and examine the central facts and test those in relation to what you see. You might be studying to gain an insight into a maths project, but if you are too tired or not interested then it is useful to identify this feeling as this is your relationship with the subject. Sincerity is actually deep in the practice and benefits of understanding. If you are seeing something that is real and can be retested to give the same result, then you will have to satisfy yourself that it is what it is. It might mean consequently you have to let go of other ideas or wishes, but ultimately that is up to you to let them go, because you cannot progress beyond these hurdles. You have to climb over them until you can leap over them. For example, it took a while until you could repeat the alphabet without error. Some people can learn it quickly, but these are very rare people so it pays to keep observing and learning. Very often things can suddenly make sense (like a \\"light-bulb moment\\"), even things you have seen dozens of times before. Through life experience, your mind develops the tools needed to put together pieces of the puzzle, as well as identify different angles and ways that the experience can be improved. The mind is often able to relate what has been seen to prior experiences in order to make connections. By using an inward observation, eventually even this tool and skill gathering becomes apparent.","output":"This article says that to learn and understand things better, we need to look at them closely and think about our feelings towards them. It is like putting together a puzzle by finding different pieces and seeing how they fit. We can learn better by thinking about how we feel about a subject and exploring the problem. Sometimes, when we keep trying and learning, we suddenly understand things better, like a \\"light-bulb moment\\". Our mind helps us by linking new things to what we already know. So, we should always observe, learn, and understand to get better at things in life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On 29 May 1842, Victoria was riding in a carriage along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate. As Victoria was riding in a carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.

Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Q: Paragraph: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has become a global public health emergency. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and its downstream targets are activated in SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected Vero E6 cells and activation of p38 MAPK enhances the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV infection. In addition, weak activation of Akt cannot prevent SARS-CoV infection-induced apoptosis in Vero E6 cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, which is constitutively phosphorylated at tyrosine (Tyr)-705 and slightly phosphorylated at serine (Ser)-727 in Vero E6 cells, was dephosphorylated at Tyr-705 on SARS-CoV infection. In addition to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in virus-infected cells, other MAPKs, i.e., extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and c-Jun Nterminal kinase (JNK), were phosphorylated. Although inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK (PD98059 and SP600125) had no effect on phosphorylation status of STAT3, inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580 and SB202190) partially inhibited dephosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr-705. Tyr-705-phosphorylated STAT3 was localized mainly in the nucleus in mock infected cells, whereas STAT3 disappeared from the nucleus in virusinfected cells. As STAT3 acts as an activator of transcription in the nucleus, these results suggest that STAT3 lacks its activity on transcription in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells.

The two sentences present distinct ideas and do not necessarily imply each other. The first sentence explains that several Republican leaders are using Democrats as their allies against Clinton to counter the accusations of partisanship. It implies that Republican leaders want to show that the opposition to Clinton's actions or policies is not strictly on partisan grounds, and they involve Democrats to achieve this objective. The first sentence conveys the strategies used by Republican leaders and their intentions. The second sentence claims that Democrats are comfortable with being referred to as allies by Republican leaders in their campaign against Clinton. This sentence assumes that Democrats are either agreeing with the Republicans or do not mind being used as a tool in their fight against Clinton. This sentence focuses more on the Democrats' perspective and views on the situation. These sentences do not entail one another. The first sentence might be true, describing the Republicans' tactics, but it does not say how Democrats feel or react to those tactics. In a similar manner, the second sentence might state that Democrats are okay with being invoked as allies, but it does not mention the Republican leaders' motivation or intent for doing so.

Wales, particularly South Wales, became a melting pot of European nationalities and cultures. At first workers from England, Ireland and the rural areas of Wales rushed into the coalfields of South Wales. By 1911, workers from Ireland, Italy and Spain had joined the industrial workforce there. Many of these newcomers were prepared to work for less pay. But during this period, workers, dissatisfied with regular pay cuts, poor safety, the growing trend of employers to pay workers with tokens  , which could only be spent in the company store, returned to the land. In 1891, the rural population of Wales was about 616,000 and by 1911 just over 649,000 people lived and worked in these areas. The rural population continues to grow slowly even today. People from richer parts of the UK, particularly southern England, are buying holiday or retirement homes in Wales. In some areas this has led to a shortage of affordable housing for local people. This, combined with the lack of employment prospects in rural Welsh communities, has started a new movement of people in search of jobs and homes into the towns and cities of Wales and to other parts of the UK and Europe. As so many Welsh people have migrated to other countries over the last 200 years, it's really no surprise that many visitors come to see friends and  s -- there were 229,000 visitors in 1998. These visitors strengthen their links to their land of origin and continue to support the Welsh economy. During the hot summer days, about 28% of the visitors visit the countryside and nearly 70% visit the seaside. Question: Why was South Wales so attractive to people in the early 20th century? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because its coal industry needed a large number of workers.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"Because its coal industry needed a large number of workers.\\" is correct. In the early 20th century, South Wales was a center of coal mining, an industry that required an extensive labor force. Attracting workers not just locally but also from England, Ireland, and later, from countries like Italy and Spain. These individuals were drawn by the prospect of available work, despite the challenging conditions and insufficient pay most would agree to. This large influx of workers turned South Wales into a melting pot of various European nationalities and cultures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the next sentence in the following story. How to protect your home from halloween pranks and vandalism  Treat visitors kindly.  The biggest reason that people tend to attack your home on halloween is that you might be avoiding giving them candy. If you show yourself to be a welcoming neighbor, you might not get vandalized.","output":"In order to maintain a positive and friendly atmosphere throughout the Halloween festivities, it is essential to create a warm and inviting environment for all visitors, as this will significantly decrease the likelihood of your home becoming a target for pranks or malicious activity. Begin by decorating your front yard or porch with festive and good-natured Halloween decorations, such as jack-o-lanterns, cheerful ghosts, and brightly colored string lights, which will convey your enthusiasm and support for the holiday. Additionally, ensure that your outdoor area is well-lit and hazard-free to create a safe space for trick-or-treaters who may be visiting your home after dark. When children approach your door for candy, greet them with a friendly smile and engage in light-hearted conversation to build rapport and establish a sense of camaraderie. Compliment their costumes and make each child feel special, acknowledging the effort they have put into dressing up for the occasion. Consider offering a selection of treats to accommodate varying preferences and dietary restrictions, such as nut-free and gluten-free options, in order to further demonstrate your consideration and care for the trick-or-treaters. Another way to protect your home from Halloween mischief is to be vigilant and maintain a watchful eye on your surroundings. Keep your ears and eyes open for any suspicious activity or unusual noise, and report any concerning incidents to local law enforcement or community watch groups. Connecting with your neighbors and forming a friendly bond can also serve as an effective deterrent, as it encourages a more respectful and supportive environment within your community, making potential pranksters think twice before targeting your home. When decorating your property, avoid using overly frightening or provocative displays, as this might unintentionally provoke retaliation from visitors or serve as an attractive target for mischief. Stick to light-hearted and fun decorations that will promote a joyful atmosphere rather than one of fear or intimidation. Lastly, securing and reinforcing your home against potential vandalism is crucial. Remove or lock away any valuables or easily damaged items that are within reach of passers-by, such as garden ornaments or potted plants. Additionally, investing in a home security system, whether it be video surveillance, motion-detector lights, or a simple doorbell camera, can act as a strong deterrent for would-be pranksters and provide you with peace of mind during the Halloween season. In summary, fostering a welcoming and friendly atmosphere during Halloween, while taking precautionary measures to safeguard your property from potential harm, will significantly reduce the likelihood of your home falling victim to pranks or vandalism. By treating visitors kindly, creating a safe and inviting environment, and remaining vigilant and proactive, you can ensure a fun and enjoyable Halloween experience for both you and your community."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: The increase in electrons across the periodic table explains why elements go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Look at period 2 in Figure below as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight.  and the situation: James is memorizing the periodic table and some of the features of the elements on it. He is currently working on the fourth row which starts with Potassium (K) on the far left and ends with Krypton (Kr) to the far right.  Answer the following question: Given two elements are in the same row of the periodic table, which element will have a higher number of elections, a metal or a nonmetal? Answer:","output":"A nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal, if they are in the same row of the periodic table.  Step 1: Understand the concept of increasing electron count across a period. As we move from left to right across a period in the periodic table, the electron count increases. This is because elements are arranged in increasing order of atomic number. Each element has one proton and one electron more than the element to its left. Step 2: Recognize the location of metals and nonmetals in the periodic table. Metals are found on the left side of the periodic table, while nonmetals are found on the right side. Metalloids are found between metals and nonmetals. Step 3: Apply the concept to a specific row (like the fourth row that James is studying). In the fourth row of the periodic table, Potassium (K) at the far left is a metal, and Krypton (Kr) at the far right is a nonmetal. As we move across the period from K to Kr, the electron count increases with every element. Conclusion: Given two elements in the same row of the periodic table, a nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Long before the year 1523, Thomas of Absberg had started to kidnap merchants and imperial diplomats from Nuremberg and Augsburg as they travelled. Although these raids often took place in present-day Lower Franconia, he concealed the whereabouts of those he abducted, hiding them in different castles and changing their locations. He had allies far into Bohemian territory, so he could hide his own whereabouts and elude pursuit. He continued his raids even after 1523, but was eventually murdered in 1531 by a follower. The raids of Hans Thomas Absberg during the period 1519-1530 were documented and fought by the Nuremberg War Office . Feuding at that time was a legitimate means of enforcing one's interests. For the Franconian Imperial Knights, whose importance was waning, it was also a means to combat the power of the emerging territorial states, such as the Bishopric of Bamberg and Burgraviate of Nuremberg, as well their margraviates,  Kulmbach and Ansbach. However, the robber barons often misused this means of dispute, because a feud had inter alia to be properly announced and needed a reasonable justification. This misuse spelt the end of feuding as a legitimate arm of policy. It was replaced by an even more effective peace under the Landfrieden. How many years did the raids of Hans Thomas Absberg span?","output":"The raids of Hans Thomas Absberg spanned from 1519 to 1530, which is a period of 11 years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the Titanic tragically never completed its voyage. Late in the evening of April 14, 1912, it struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. The iceberg was not spotted until it was too late to avoid collision, and the ship's hull was breached, causing seawater to flood into the compartments. Despite frantic efforts to save the vessel, the damage was too severe, and the ship gradually sank in the early hours of April 15, less than three hours after the collision. Due to insufficient lifeboats and inadequate emergency procedures, more than 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster, making it one of the deadliest peacetime sinkings of a superliner in history. The sinking of the Titanic marked a significant moment in maritime history, leading to substantial revisions in maritime laws and the adoption of the first International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Thus, based on the information provided, it is accurate to say that the Titanic never finished its planned voyage from Southampton to New York. The ship's intended journey was tragically cut short by the disaster, causing it to become embedded in history as a haunting symbol of the dangers of maritime travel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who was knighted in 1911?, using the article: In addition to the knighthood bestowed in 1911, Wood's state honours were his appointments as Companion of Honour in 1944, to the Order of the Crown (Belgium; 1920), and Officer of the Legion of Honour (France; 1926). He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the Royal College of Music (1923). Jacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music, works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, Marcel Dupré and Walton. The Poet Laureate, John Masefield, composed a poem of six verses in his honour, entitled \\"Sir Henry Wood\\", often referred to by its first line, \\"Where does the uttered music go?\\". Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre's, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained-glass window in Wood's honour.Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in Southwark, which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975. His bust stands upstage centre in the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season, decorated by a chaplet on the Last Night of the Proms. His collection of 2,800 orchestral scores and 1,920 sets of parts is now in the library of the Royal Academy of Music. For the Academy he also established the Henry Wood Fund, giving financial aid to students. The University of Strathclyde named a building at its Jordanhill campus after him. His best-known memorial is the Proms, officially \\"the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", but universally referred to by the informal short version.His biographer Arthur Jacobs wrote of Wood: His orchestral players affectionately nicknamed him \\"Timber\\" – more than a play on his name, since it seemed to represent his reliability too.

Article: I give two examples as to why intelligent life may not actually exist, though I admit that for me, or even for a physicist who devoted his or her entire life to researching and studying the universe, it's shocking to claim that completely no life exists elsewhere. Keeping that in mind, I'd just like to consider conditions elsewhere in the known universe. You really only need to look at our own solar system or the Earth at certain periods in its own history to appreciate that most places are much worse and much less suitable for life than our mild, watery globe. So far, space scientists have discovered about seventy planets outside the solar. But it appears that if you wish to have a planet suitable for life, you just have to be very lucky, and the more advanced the life is, the luckier you'll have to be. I'm by no means a space observer, but I can recognize some particularly fortunate breaks we've had on the Earth. For example: We are, to a degree, at the right distance from the perfect type of star, the one that is big enough to radiate a huge amount of energy, but not so big as to bum itself out quickly. Had our sun been ten times as huge, it would have burnt out completely after only ten million years, instead of ten billion and surely we would not exist. Too near, everything on the Earth would have boiled and withered away; any further, everything would have frozen over. The universe is a surprising place, and our existence within it is a wonder. If a long and unimaginably complex sequence of events dating back 4.6 billion years or so hadn't happened in a particular manner at a particular time --if, to take just one example, the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out by a meteor --we might still be a few centimeters long, with whisker  and a tail, and you'll be reading this in a cave somewhere. Question: What makes the Earth more suitable for life than other planets in the solar system? - The Earth is the only planet that can receive energy from the sun. - The sun is at the right distance from us and in proper size. - The distance between the planets was neither too long nor too near. - The dinosaurs were no longer a threat to the Earth. A:","output":"The Earth is more suitable for life than other planets in the solar system because it is at the right distance from the sun, which is also of proper size. This means that Earth receives the perfect amount of energy for life to thrive. The sun is large enough to radiate a significant amount of energy, but not so large that it burns out too quickly. If the Earth were too close to the sun, everything would boil and wither away, while if it were too far, everything would freeze over. This ideal distance and the sun's proper size have contributed to the mild, watery conditions on Earth that make it suitable for life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

I had heard of this group and seen them briefly on YouTube, but when we saw them perform at the Monte Carlo, I WAS BLOWN A-WAY!  I was just amazed from the beginning of the Jabbawockeez all the way to the end at how talented this group was, how engaging their performance was.  It was one of the most artsy dance crew performances I have ever seen,  They were athletic, sometimes funny, their choreography in sync, their music a mix of old school to New Jack Swing to modern mainstream, they took this entire audience to another level of music and rhythm awareness I know I've never been before.  At the same time they are an enigma and I get why they wear those masks so that their performances are recognized as a group of people rather than the talents of of one individual.  I like that even after the show they still had this air of mystery about them.  I think their show was worth whatever we paid to see them,  which wasn't an arm and leg.

Question 2: What happens if I drink one glass of water every 20 minutes? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Hi there, little buddy! Remember, I'm here to help you understand things better. Let's look at each question one by one. Question 1: Drinking a lot of water is good for your body, but you don't want to drink too much at once because it can make you pee a lot, just like you said. When you drink a lot of water, your body wants to balance the amount of water, so it tells your kidneys to make more pee to remove extra water. You should sip water throughout the day instead of gulping down a lot at once. This will help you stay hydrated without having to go to the bathroom all the time. Question 2: If you drink one glass of water every 20 minutes, your body will still try to find the right balance of water. Drinking water regularly is a good thing, but that might be a little too often for your body to handle. It could make you have to go to the bathroom even more than before! You should listen to your body and drink water when you're thirsty, but remember not to drink too much, too fast. Now for your question about if the answers are the same: The answers are similar because they both talk about how your body tries to keep the right amount of water inside by making you go to the bathroom more often when you drink too much water. But the main idea is to drink water throughout the day without drinking too much at once or drinking too quickly.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the man who allowed access for the person that placed a bouquet of red roses bearing a handwritten message? from the following article ?  During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here. Brzezinski further stated: The fact that the Soviet government has enabled me to be here—and the Soviets know my views—is symbolic of the breach with Stalinism that perestroika represents. His remarks were given extensive coverage on Soviet television. At the...","output":"The answer to the question is Gorbachev.

As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same impulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man. He leaned forward and touched the chauffeur's shoulder. \\"Stop at the Court of General Sessions,\\" he commanded. What he proposed to do would take but a few minutes. A word, a personal word from him to the district attorney, or the judge, would be enough.  Question: \\"Why was it a charming morning?\\" Answer: \\"The traffic policemen who cleared the way for him were charming\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, this answer is incorrect. The text states that it was a charming morning because \\"the spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean.\\" The salutes from the traffic policemen added to Arnold Thorndike's experience, but they were not the main reason why it was a charming morning. The pleasant weather and clean air contributed to the delightful atmosphere of the morning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Explanation: Rounding the corners of a wooden cube means making the sharp edges smooth and curved. If we use a lighter to melt the corners (option I), it will not work because wood doesn't melt like ice cream. Instead, it will burn and get damaged. On the other hand, using a metal file (option II) is a good choice because it helps to shave off tiny bits of wood from the corners, making them smooth and rounded.

Washington (CNN) -- Senate Republicans narrowly blocked Democratic campaign finance disclosure legislation in the Senate Tuesday after raising concerns the bill would curb freedom of speech and tilt campaign spending in favor of the Democrats. A 57-41 vote fell short of the 60 votes needed for the Senate to cut off debate on the measure. Republicans unanimously opposed the measure while Democrats solidly backed it. Democrats said the legislation -- known as the DISCLOSE Act -- would bring greater transparency to campaign contributions from corporations, labor unions, and other special interests, which were able to ramp up political spending in the wake of the Supreme Court's controversial ruling in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission earlier this year.

Title: The Simpsons Movie Movie plot: While performing on Lake Springfield, music group Green Day perished when the lake's pollution dissolves their barge, following an audience revolt after frontman Billie Joe Armstrong proposes an environmental discussion. At their memorial, Grampa Simpson foresees the destruction of the town, but only Marge takes this seriously. Later that day, Homer dares his son Bart to skate naked to the Krusty Burger restaurant and Bart is arrested by Chief Wiggum. Bart considers their neighbor Ned Flanders a better father figure after Homer refuses to take responsibility for the incident. Lisa and a new Irish friend named Colin convince the entire town to clean their lake. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger and names it \\"Spider Pig\\" (later \\"Harry Plopper\\", and simply \\"Plopper\\"), and stores the pig's feces (and some of his own) in a silo, until Marge tells him to safely dispose of the waste. Homer intends to take his silo to the waste management plant, but after Lenny calls to tell him that Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down and is giving away free donuts, Homer impatiently dumps the silo straight into the lake, polluting it worse than before. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated; Flanders and Bart (who bond after Homer humiliates Bart) discover the creature before the EPA captures it. Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, presents five \\"unthinkable\\" options to U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger to keep the town's pollution contained; the slow-witted president, doesn't bother reading number 3 before picking it; enclosing Springfield in a large glass dome.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway. In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \\"Avengers Initiative\\". Agent Natasha Romanoff is sent to Calcutta to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract. In Stuttgart, Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard.

We were headed to Chipotle, but after seeing some great Yelp reviews, we diverted off State Street to try this little hole in the wall taqueria on Gilman Street.  Unless you're a big fan of formica, the decor barely rates one star, we're talking dive with a capital D.  The place could use a real thorough cleaning as well.  Our tabletop was a sticky, but with a napkin, some water and a lot of elbow grease, our eating space became acceptable.  The flat screen on the wall featured the Mexican version of MTV which kept my 10 year old very entertained with the plot development of each video.  (Boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy is sad)   The laminated menu contained primarily Mexican food truck fare (tacos, gorditas, burritos, tostadas, etc.)  As a fan of the late, great Up and In podcast, I was overjoyed to see Boing! as one of the beverage options along with Jarritos and horchata.  But with ala cart prices from 2 to 3 for many of the items, it encouraged us to sample a variety of items.  The cheese quesadilla ordered by my daughter was a revelation.  Rather than your standard thin layer of shredded jack cheese pressed between a couple of tortillas, this baby featured a crispy masa pocket crammed full of melted queso fresco cheese.  She quickly wolfed it down and ordered a second one, proclaiming this version to be far superior to what she's consumed at Pasqual's or Chipotle.  I ordered a steak taco, a pork gordita and a chorizo & potato sopes.  The steak taco came in a double corn tortilla topped with finely chopped onions, queso fresco and cilantro.  Unlike the pungent onions that plagued a recent meal at La Mestiza, these onions were fresher and the smaller dice complimented the meaty goodness of this taco.  The steak was well seasoned and perfectly prepared.  The pastor gordita, which had the same masa exterior as the quesadilla was also a culinary delight.  The crispy exterior was a perfect foil to the melt in your mouth goodness of the pork filling.  The chorizo sopes was a solid offering, but it was a little greasy and did not meet my lofty expectations after enjoying the steak and pork offerings.  The basket of chips that we were served were average.  My daughter did not like having to apply the salsa from a squeeze bottle onto the chips.  The salsa was watery and a little bland compared to the other items we enjoyed.  Service was a little chaotic.  The server that took our order was not very attentive (it was a rare occurrence to get water glasses and / or the chip basket refreshed), but halfway through the meal, we were adopted by another server who did a great job.  The total bill with tip was about 20, a great value for the quantity / quality of the food received.  I definitely plan on returning to try more of the menu.

Background: Rogers Clark Ballard Morton (September 19, 1914 - April 19, 1979) was an American politician who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Commerce during the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, Jr., respectively. He also served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland. Though he was born in Louisville, Kentucky, Morton moved to a farm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the early 1950s. In 1962, he was elected to the House of Representatives, in which capacity he established an environmental record. Context: Morton was born in Louisville, the son of David Clark Morton, a physician, and his wife, Mary Harris Ballard Morton, an heiress to a flour milling business.

Morton also had a career in politics, serving as chairman of the Republican National Committee and representing Kentucky in both the United States House of Representatives and then the United States Senate.  Morton received his early education from the Woodberry Forest School near Orange, Virginia, and in 1937 graduated from Yale University, where he was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter). Like his father, Morton worked to become a physician and entered the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. However, he dropped out after only one year. In 1939, Morton married the former Anne Jones. They had two children, David Clark and Anne Morton.  In 1938, Morton was commissioned in the United States Navy but only served for a short time due to problems with his back. Afterwards, he entered his family's flour business, Ballard & Ballard. In 1941, at the outset of World War II, Morton enlisted in the Armored Field Artillery of the United States Army as a private and served in the European Theater. He received a commission during the war and left the army as a captain in 1945.  After the war, Morton returned to the family business, where he served as president from 1947 to 1951.

Both of these systems use a two-stage filtration process, in which fluid and waste products are first extracted and these are filtered again to re-absorb any re-usable materials while dumping toxic and spent materials as urine. The difference is that protonephridia combine both filtration stages in the same organ, while metanephridia perform only the second filtration and rely on other mechanisms for the first – in annelids special filter cells in the walls of the blood vessels let fluids and other small molecules pass into the coelomic fluid, where it circulates to the metanephridia. In annelids the points at which fluid enters the protonephridia or metanephridia are on the forward side of a septum while the second-stage filter and the nephridiopore (exit opening in the body wall) are in the following segment. As a result, the hindmost segment (before the growth zone and pygidium) has no structure that extracts its wastes, as there is no following segment to filter and discharge them, while the first segment contains an extraction structure that passes wastes to the second, but does not contain the structures that re-filter and discharge urine.

Barack Hussein Obama II ( ( listen); born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. The first African American to assume the presidency, he was previously the junior United States Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008. Before that, he served in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 until 2004. Obama was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after the territory was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. From age six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki Public School) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. As a result of those four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \\"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\\".  In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School-- a private college preparatory school-- with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \\"Barry\\". Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.  Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \\"The opportunity that Hawaii offered - to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect - became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\\" Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \\"push questions of who I was out of my mind\\". Obama was also a member of the \\"choom gang\\", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.  After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.

This process ensures a well-constructed and accurate representation of the costume you have in mind. The other option, \\"Find a costume that you want to make and try to copy that costume. Make it all in one go so you don't forget where you started,\\" is not recommended. Trying to make the entire costume at once may lead to mistakes, lack of attention to detail, and a final product that doesn't look or fit as intended. It's better to take your time and follow a systematic approach to create a well-made, polished costume."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. How do you do this: Carry multiple grocery bags.","output":"To carry multiple grocery bags efficiently and safely, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Inspect the bags Before you start, take a moment to inspect the grocery bags. Make sure the bags are sturdy and well-constructed to prevent them from ripping while carrying. Additionally, check that the handles are securely attached and not damaged. Step 2: Sort items by weight Organize your shopping items by weight, placing the heaviest items at the bottom of the bags and lighter items on top. Doing so will ensure better weight distribution and reduce the risk of squishing fragile items such as fruits and bread. Step 3: Choose an appropriate number of bags Estimate the number of bags needed to carry your groceries, taking into account their capacity and your strength. It's better to use more bags to efficiently distribute the weight, as various bags may be easier to handle than one overly packed bag. Step 4: Group the handles Hold the handles of several bags in one hand so that you can grip them together. You can do this by threading the handles through your fingers or by using the palm of your hand. Make sure you don't overload one hand – evenly distribute the bags between both hands. Step 5: Adjust your grip Find a comfortable and secure grip on the handles. You can wrap the handles around your hand or wrist for more stability, or hold them with your fingertips for lighter bags. Ensure you can maintain a solid grip on the bags as you walk. Step 6: Maintain good posture As you carry the grocery bags, maintain proper posture to prevent strain on your back and shoulders. Stand tall with your chest up and shoulders back, and engage your core to help distribute the weight more evenly across your body. Step 7: Walk steadily Walk at a comfortable pace, and avoid any sudden movements or excessive twisting that may cause the bags to swing and become unbalanced. Use extra caution when walking on uneven surfaces or when navigating obstacles such as curbs or stairs. Step 8: Set the bags down carefully When you arrive at your destination, set the bags down gently, especially if they contain fragile items. Use your legs to support the weight as you lower the bags, and avoid bending at the waist to reduce strain on your back. By following these steps, you can carry multiple grocery bags safely and efficiently while minimizing the risk of dropping or damaging your items."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If less hydrogen is pressing down on the core, it would have a direct impact on the overall gravitational force exhibited by the star, specifically leading to a reduced gravitational pull. The layers of hydrogen that surround the star's core are responsible for providing the necessary mass and pressure that contribute to the immense gravitational forces the star generates.  As the core contracts under pressure, gravitational force increases, leading to an enhancement in the ability to draw objects towards it. However, with less hydrogen pressing down on the core, this process would be less effective, resulting in diminished gravitational forces being generated. Consequently, the star's ability to draw more objects into it would be weakened. Thus, the supposed perturbation of less hydrogen pressing down on the core influences the second effect mentioned (drawing more objects into it) by producing a lesser effect. The star would have a weaker gravitational force, and as a result, its capacity to attract additional objects (including light) would be reduced, limiting its ability to draw them in, ultimately leading to a weaker gravitational interaction with surrounding matter and radiation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She eats it, then shows a table covered in ingredients. she","output":"smiles contentedly and looks around the kitchen for the necessary equipment to begin her baking adventure. She's decided to make some homemade chocolate chip cookies for her family's game night. After pulling out a mixing bowl, she gathers the ingredients - all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, white and brown sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla extract. She preheats the oven to 350°F (175°C) and proceeds to mix the dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl - carefully measuring the flour, baking soda, and salt. Next, she attends to the wet ingredients, placing softened butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl. With her electric mixer in hand, she begins to cream the butter and sugars together until it reaches a smooth, fluffy texture. She cracks an egg into the mix, adds the vanilla extract, and continues to blend until everything is well combined. The woman then gradually adds the dry ingredient mixture to the wet mixture, making sure not to overmix the dough or risk creating a tough texture in the finished cookies. She keeps blending until a slightly sticky, but manageable, dough forms in front of her. Satisfied with her concoction, she reaches for the star of the cookies - the chocolate chips. Pouring them in generously, she folds the chocolate chips into the dough, ensuring that every bite will contain a good amount of chocolaty goodness. After lining her baking sheets with parchment paper, she scoops equally-sized portions of the dough onto the sheets, making sure to leave enough space between them to account for any spreading during the baking process. As the cookie dough balls sit on the kitchen counter, the tantalizing aroma of chocolate and butter lingers in the air, tempting anyone in its vicinity to indulge. She looks at the clock, noting the time and calculating how long it will take before her family's game night begins. Sliding the baking sheets into the oven, she sets the timer for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are golden brown. As they bake, she takes advantage of the time to clean, putting away unused ingredients and washing the dishes. The timer beeps, and she swiftly dons her oven mitts to remove the baking sheets from the oven. The cookies have transformed into perfect golden brown mounds of deliciousness. She transfers them onto wire racks to cool. As the cookies cool, she starts preparing other snacks and drinks for the game night. She organizes the living room, placing coasters, plates, and game pieces on an accessible table. Excited by the thought of a night of laughter and friendly competition, her anticipation fills her with joy. Finally, with the delicious, homemade chocolate chip cookies as the centerpiece, the family game night has all the elements for a memorable and enjoyable evening. The woman can't help but feel proud of her labor of love and the part she played in creating a special bonding moment for her family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has ordered Apple to help unlock an iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Rizwan Farook. But Apple has continued to fight the order, saying it would set a \\"dangerous precedent\\". The case will be heard in a federal court on 22 March. Farook and his wife killed 14 people in the Californian city last December before police fatally shot them. The FBI wants to access data on Farook's iPhone but the device is encrypted and can only be unlocked by entering the correct Pin code. Guessing the code incorrectly too many times could permanently wipe the device, so the FBI has asked Apple to develop a new version of its operating system that circumvents some of its security features. Apple has repeatedly stated that creating a compromised version of iOS would have security implications for millions of iPhone users and would set a precedent. The FBI's court order refers to a 1789 law called the All Writs Act, which can give courts the power to force companies to cooperate in a criminal investigation. But in its latest response, Apple said the DOJ was using the law to \\"resolve a policy and political issue\\". \\"According to the government, short of kidnapping or breaking an express law, the courts can order private parties to do virtually anything the Justice Department or FBI can dream up. \\"The Founders would be appalled.\\" But the FBI has said encryption could make smartphones \\"warrant-proof\\".

Merkel - This is the last name of Angela Merkel, the German politician who served as the Chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2021. In Finnish, the name remains unchanged. Therefore, the Finnish translation of the sentence is \\"Ensinnäkin se oli komissio, toiseksi spekulaattorit ja kolmanneksi neuvosto ja erityisesti rouva Merkel.\\" This accurately conveys the original English meaning while maintaining proper Finnish grammar and sentence structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Explaining 'Chain Migration'      The president wants to put an end to what he calls the nation's \\"horrible\\" system of \\"chain migration.\\" We explain what it means.      LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:      President Trump is meeting with congressional leaders at Camp David this weekend, and immigration is at the top of the agenda. Trump has a long list of demands, among them - eliminating the nation's, quote, \\"horrible system\\" of so-called chain migration, a byproduct of the family visa system. Through September of last year, family visas made up roughly 37 percent of all immigration visas to the United States. To better understand just what chain migration means, we turn now to NPR's John Burnett in Austin. John, hey.      JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu.      GARCIA-NAVARRO: Chain migration - talk us through it. Is this part of the nation's legal immigration system?      BURNETT: Right. It's the visa program through which immigrants already residing here can bring their family members over. Some call it family reunification. The way it works is visas are granted according to the family tree. Green card holders or legal residents can petition the Immigration Service to bring over their spouses and their minor children. And once the petitioner gets citizenship, they can apply to bring over parents, married children and adult siblings.      GARCIA-NAVARRO: So if I've just become a citizen, I could petition for my sister who's living in another country who's not a citizen to get a visa and come to the United States. But what do critics say?      BURNETT: Well, they say it's a system stuck on autopilot - that these extended immigrant families, like your sister coming over, can grow and grow with no regard to who's actually coming. President Trump joins a long line of immigration restrictionists. For years, they sought to reduce the number of family-based visas, and their ultimate goal is to slash the overall numbers of immigrants who come to America.      GARCIA-NAVARRO: So proponents, though, say we're a nation of immigrants. You know, what are they worried about?      BURNETT: Well, the president claims that chain migration takes jobs from Americans and threatens national security. Remember the Bangladeshi man who tried to set off a pipe bomb in the New York subway last month? Trump points out that he entered the country through extended-family chain migration.      GARCIA-NAVARRO: So if Trump and his supporters don't want chain migration, what is the model that they want?      BURNETT: Well, what they want - it's called a merit-based scheme. It's similar to what Canada has. It gives preference to job training and English proficiency and education. Trump and his supporters in Congress want to cut the number of green cards from about a million annually - that's the current level - to half of that over a decade.      Defenders of the status quo claim it's fear mongering to say that family-based visa system lets in terrorists. They say all immigrants admitted to the U.S. undergo rigorous security screening and that that Bangladeshi subway bomber was radicalized after he got here.      GARCIA-NAVARRO: So where does the business community come down in the debate over this type of migration? Obviously, there's a lot of interest and concern about restricting immigration in a country right now where there is very low unemployment and many businesses say they need migrants.      BURNETT: Exactly. And the pro-business types say we need more immigrants, not less, especially in those tech fields that depend so heavily on them. And they worry that if we reduce immigration, there won't be enough workers for a healthy economy and we'll keep out the people who've given America its genius for innovation. The model they want is to let the market, not the government, decide how many immigrants get to come here.      GARCIA-NAVARRO: So I've been seeing these TV ads that have been showing - by NumbersUSA, which is an anti-immigration group, and the White House also says this - that a single illegal immigrant can result in hundreds of family members coming in. Is that accurate?      BURNETT: Well, the current system does not set limits on how many spouses and minor children of parents a legal immigrant can bring in. It does set caps on married children and adult siblings. And there are also caps just on the total immigrants who can come from each country. For instance, if your sister was coming from Mexico or India or the Philippines, they could wait 10 to 20 years or more to immigrate to the U.S.      I should add that a survey published last week by Reuters shows the number of immigrants approved for family-based visas, which is what we're talking about, dropped in 2017 to the lowest level in more than a decade. So even without new laws, the government has already begun to narrow the gate.      GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's John Burnett. Thank you so much.      BURNETT: You bet, Lulu.

The lack of clarity about when and how Viktor and Amalija Knavs obtained their legal residencies raises questions about whether the couple secured their residency through family-based immigration, which President Trump calls chain migration and has said he wants to restrict. Immigration experts said it would have been the most direct, and most likely, way for Mrs. Trump’s parents, formerly of Slovenia, to get their green cards.      Their immigration lawyer, Michael J. Wildes, declined to offer any details.      “It’s a privilege to help this family, but I have to respect their privacy as well,” Mr. Wildes said in a brief interview.      “Immigration is in our DNA,” he added. “We have to take great pride, no matter where somebody hails from, in that legacy.” ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Visas are granted according to relationships within the family tree. Green card holders can petition for their spouse and minor children to join them in the US, while citizens can apply for their parents, married children, and adult siblings to receive visas.  Critics argue that chain migration brings a never-ending flow of extended immigrant families into the US without control or oversight. They aim to reduce the number of family-based visas to decrease overall immigration numbers. Proponents of chain migration, however, argue that the US is a nation of immigrants and that the current system strengthens family and community ties.  President Trump supports moving to a merit-based visa system similar to Canada's, where preference is given to factors such as job training, English proficiency, and education levels. The merit-based system intends to reduce the number of green cards granted annually, though critics argue that the current system provides thorough security screenings and that reducing the number of immigrant workers would harm the economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Eyes are used for seeing by animals by sensing light, so the light has to enter into the cow's eyes for it to be able to detect the presence of the farmer.  The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: 2). into the moon: The moon has nothing to do with the cow's ability to see the farmer. The moon reflects sunlight towards Earth, but the light still needs to enter the cow's eyes for it to see the farmer.  3). into the sun: Similar to the moon, the sun plays a role in providing light; however, it's the light entering the cow's eyes that allows it to see the farmer.  4). into a bucket: A bucket is not relevant when it comes to the cow's ability to see the farmer. Light entering a bucket would not help the cow see the farmer; it's the light entering the cow's eyes that matters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Gender: The first statement mentions \\"two boys,\\" while the second statement uses the term \\"two kids.\\" It's important to note that \\"kids\\" is a gender-neutral term and could refer to boys, girls, or a combination of both. Without additional information, we cannot know the gender of the children in the second statement. 2. Activity: Both statements involve outdoor activities in a forest. However, the first statement specifically mentions that the boys have an ax, while the second statement says that the kids are gathering firewood. It is plausible that an ax might be used to gather firewood, but the second statement does not explicitly mention that fact. Additionally, firewood can be gathered in various ways without using an ax, such as by picking up fallen branches and twigs. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that an ax is involved in the second statement. 3. Context: The first statement sets the scene by mentioning that the individuals are \\"outside with an ax in a forested environment.\\" In contrast, the second statement indicates that the kids are \\"gathering firewood in a forest.\\" The forested environment is present in both scenarios, but the specific context and surrounding details may vary. In summary, while the two statements share a similar setting and overall theme, there isn't enough concrete information to conclude that they refer to the same situation.

The other planes followed their leaders aimlessly, first east, then west, then northeast over the ocean, as Tailor tried to make sure of the direction by radio. Then, suddenly Tailor was heard to give orders to dive...     Quickly, two giant Martin seaplanes were sent up to search for Flight 19.

Most of the world's water is salty ocean water or frozen polar ice. By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified  as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes.  Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. \\"You do the math, and it gets a little scary,\\" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. \\"We're waking up,\\" he says. \\"But not fast enough.\\"  In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard.

Unfortunately, several attempts have been made and they've fallen short of the great potential in the character. So, no, this isn't the Modesty you know from the comic strip (currently reprinted in nice editions from Titan Books). This is Modesty some 5 or 6 years prior to the first strip, and from what you can piece together from her back-story, it's accurate. Miramax had the movie rights to the character, with Quentin Tarantino acting as advocate and technical adviser. Early drafts of the Miramax project attempted to adapt one of the best novels, but always managed to leave out some crucial element. Tarantino wasn't happy with any of them, and offered to remove his name from the project so they could proceed. To the studio's credit, they wanted to keep him in the process, since they knew he \\"got\\" the character and her world. With the movie rights close to expiration, they decided to try a very different approach. The result was \\"My Name is Modesty,\\" a small direct-to-video movie that introduces the character. The movie does not introduce Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These characters are important to Blaise's adventures throughout most of the published stories. What this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself. She never loses her composure, and you never doubt that she's in charge even unarmed in a room full of gangsters with guns. Most of the movie takes place within a casino, which undoubtedly saved money on the production. It doesn't matter. The film does not come across as cheap. Instead, it gives a fairly comprehensive (and believable) back-story for the character and demonstrates just how far she thinks ahead. Should Miramax adapt any of the comic stories or novels now, they've laid out the character's background nicely and won't have to spend much time on her \\"origin.\\" I realize the words \\"Direct-to-Video\\" don't inspire confidence, but this film is well worth a look.

In part that can explain the reason why, although we have implemented free trade agreements, they have not been as good as they can become because the Government of Canada has actually impeded and impaired the ability of the Canadian private sector to be competitive with its counterpart south of the border because it has not done much with removing the interprovincial trade barriers that hamstring them so badly.

[+] No.","output":"[+] No. The paragraph provided does not allow us to conclude that Canada has not implemented fair trade agreements. The main issue raised in the text is not about the fairness or equalness of the trade agreements implemented, but rather the domestic interprovincial trade barriers that are claimed to be impeding the Canada's private sector's competitiveness. The paragraph highlights that free trade agreements have been established but criticizes the effectiveness of these agreements. While the speaker suggests that these trade agreements could be more beneficial, the discussion revolves around their effectiveness and not their existence or fairness. The claim made by the speaker is that the Government of Canada has negatively impacted the Canadian private sector's ability to compete because of the continued existence of interprovincial trade barriers. \\"Fair trade,\\" is another complex economic concept with its own set of rules and principles, mainly focused on equitable trade, fair payment to exporters, and sensible environmental practices.  From the passage, it can be inferred that 'Free Trade Agreements' were implemented but the effectiveness of these agreements is questioned due to the existing interprovincial trade barriers; No direct or implied statement on 'Fair Trade Agreements' is made.  Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine whether or not fair trade agreements have been implemented. The idea of the \\"fairness\\" of the trade agreements was not discussed at all in the paragraph; only their effectiveness in light of the interprovincial trade barriers was touched upon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: In Virginia, legal victory for McAuliffe over voting rights for felons RICHMOND -- Virginia’s highest court on Thursday refused to find Gov. Terry McAuliffe in contempt of court over his efforts to restore voting rights to felons. Republican legislative leaders recently filed a contempt-of-court motion against McAuliffe (D) after the governor announced that he had individually restored rights to 13,000 felons and was working to do the same for a total of more than 200,000. McAuliffe’s action came in response to a July ruling by the Virginia Supreme Court, which threw out a blanket clemency order that he had issued in April. The governor has described his latest move as a way to comply with the court’s order while addressing “an issue of basic justice.” But in a motion filed in court two weeks ago, Republicans argued that the practical effect of McAuliffe’s workaround is the same as the original, sweeping clemency order that the state Supreme Court declared unconstitutional. Without comment Thursday, the court denied the motion. “I am pleased that the Supreme Court has dismissed the case Republicans filed in their latest attempt to prevent individuals who have served their time having a full voice in our society,” McAuliffe said in a written statement. “Restoring these Virginians’ civil rights is morally the right thing to do, and we will continue to move forward via a process that is in full compliance with the court’s July 22nd ruling and the precedent of previous governors. It is my hope that the court’s validation of the process we are using will convince Republicans to drop their divisive efforts to prevent Virginians from regaining their voting rights and focus their energy and resources on making Virginia a better place to live for the people who elected all of us to lead.” Republican leaders did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Summary:","output":"Virginia’s highest court has ruled in favour of Governor Terry McAuliffe regarding his efforts to restore the voting rights of convicted felons.

The Bucket Bear, as it had come to be called, had been roaming through Perry Township, Clarion County, for over a month with a black bucket-like object stuck on its head. The Patriot-News reports that animal rescue volunteer Dean Hornberger planned the mission to free the Bucket Bear with his girlfriend Samantha Eigenbrod after seeing a photo of it on Facebook. Scroll down for video. Blinded: Krissy Elder took a photo of the Bucket Bear roaming the highway and woods of western Pennsylvania and set up Save the Bucket Bear to rally support to encourage authorities to intervene. To the rescue: A group of volunteers conducted an impromptu rescue mission in the woods of Pennsylvania to free the Bucket Bear. The two rounded up a band of volunteers to assist in the rescue and set off for the woods near where the bear was photographed. Hornberger and Eigenbrod had been searching for two hours and were about to call it quits for the day, when they came across the Bucket Bear near the highway. Hornberger approached it and attempted to wrestle off the rubber container, which turned out to be an air bag that likely broke off a tractor trailer. The bear slipped out of his grasp and led the group on a 20-minute chase through the woods towards 'the biggest mud hole in the area,' as Hornberger described it. Once the group tackled the bear, Shawn Balcita pinned it down with his body while Hornberger cut the metal ring on the cushion with a hacksaw. Eigenbrod recorded video of the brave rescue on her cellphone. Brave: Shawn Balcita posted photos to Save the Bucket Bear of scratches from the bear's claws and said he also had a gash on his chest. After Balcita released it, the Bucket Bear dashed back into the woods, freed of its cumbersome bucket. According to Save the Bucket Bear, a Facebook page set up by Krissy Elder, the Pennsylvania Game Commission was contacted but told her they could not do anything while the bear was healthy and 'mobile.' Balcita and Hornberger suffered some scratches from the bear's claws, but otherwise the group emerged unharmed. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

A marine biologist has killed off claims that a giant crab is living on the Kent coast - insisting the image is probably a well-doctored hoax. Residents of Whitstable were left shocked when a photo emerged appearing to show a huge crustacean just yards from the coastal town's harbour. But sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, says it is impossible one of the creatures could grow so big. This image of Whistable harbour from above led to claims that a 'Crabzilla' could be living off the Kent coast. The image (left) appears to show a crustacean the length of five or six boats lurking in the Thames Estuary, but marine biologist Dr Verity Nye (right) says the picture is  a hoax. Dr Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, said: 'The idea of a giant \\"crabzilla\\" would very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax. 'I don't know what the currents are like around that harbour or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.' She added: 'The UK does have large crabs. The biggest is the spider crab which can grow up to 1.2 metres in size, but they tend to stay in much deeper water, about 1,000-metres deep, and are a different shape from the image in this photo. 'Crabs with a \\"pie crust edge\\", like the one in the crabzilla image, are known as edible crabs, or Cancer pagarus, but tend only to grow to about 20 to 30 centimetres.' Mocked-up photos poking fun at the idea of a Crabzilla were posted on Twitter after the image emerged. The largest crabs in British waters are spider crabs,  which live in waters between 10 and 1,000 metres deep. Edible crabs, shaped like the one in the aerial photo of Whitstable, grow to only 30 centimetres long. Dr Nye added: 'The largest crabs in the world are Japanese Spider Crabs, which can grow to about 3.7 metres in size, about as big as a small car, but again, they tend to stay in deep water and don't come ashore. 'Crabs are amazing because they are so diverse, we have about 60 species around the UK, and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found, but I laughed when I saw this picture.' The photograph of the apparent 50ft crustacean was originally posted on a blog called Weird Whistable, a collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town. The image has sparked a rash of less believable online images, with Twitter users mocking up their own pictures of giant claws emerging from the water. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A photograph of a giant crab, dubbed \\"Crabzilla,\\" off the coast of Whitstable, Kent, has been circulating online, prompting residents to believe that a massive crustacean is dwelling close to the town's harbour.

Dr. Nye explains that the UK does have large crabs, such as the spider crab, which can grow up to 1.2 meters in size, but they tend to dwell in deeper waters and have a different shape from the alleged Crabzilla. The crustacean appearing in the photograph is similar to edible crabs or Cancer pagarus, which grow to approximately 20 to 30 centimeters in size. Furthermore, the largest crabs globally are Japanese Spider Crabs, which can reach 3.7 meters in size but mostly remain in deep waters. Since the image's release, more improbable pictures have surfaced online, with Twitter users sharing their own snapshots of colossal claws emerging from the water. As an expert in the field, Dr. Nye stated that she laughed upon seeing the photograph, as the possibility of a giant crab of that scale living near the UK coast is implausible.

On Monday, the company behind the miracle ingredient agreed to pay 3.5 million to settle accusations by the Federal Trade Commission that it used phony science to back up its claims. Applied Food Services had pushed green coffee extract in its advertising as a diet aid. But federal regulators said there was no scientific basis for its marketing. “Applied Food Sciences knew or should have known that this botched study didn’t prove anything,” said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement. “In publicizing the results, it helped fuel the green coffee phenomenon.” In June, a group of U.S. lawmakers criticized Dr. Oz for his endorsement of the product, calling it careless and disappointing. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., the chairwoman of the subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Insurance, lashed out at a hearing, saying: “I don’t get why you need to say this stuff when you know it’s not true. When you have this amazing megaphone, and this amazing ability to community, why would you cheapen your show by saying things like that?” Oz, a graduate of Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Business School, said at the time that he’d use a more critical lens before hawking products on his show. “In addition to exercising an abundance of caution in discussing promising research and products in the future, I look forward to working with all those present today in finding a way to deal with the problems of weight loss scams,” said Oz in a statement. But Oz also said his motives were sincere in initially touting green coffee extract. “My job is to be a cheerleader for the audience, when they don’t think they have hope,” he told lawmakers, according to The Hill.

Hardly influenced by either development, Old Dutch remained close to the original language of the Franks, the people that would rule Europe for centuries. The language however, did experienced developments on its own, like final-obstruent devoicing in a very early stage.

I read this background article the other day: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.  I am facing a new situation today: Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill. They hit a large rock and fell. Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person was less exposed to external mechanical force? The answer to this question is:","output":"Rob was less exposed to external mechanical force in this situation. To explain further, let's first understand the difference in the severity of their injuries. In the new situation, Tammy and Rob both experienced an external mechanical force when they hit a large rock and fell from the tandem bike. However, the impact of this force on each person's brain was different. Tammy was diagnosed with a serious brain injury in the hospital, which as per the background article, indicates that this injury has resulted from a violent blow or jolt to her head or body, causing brain dysfunction. A serious brain injury often leads to permanent brain damage, affecting the individual's ability to talk, control body movements, and may also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. On the other hand, Rob suffered only a mild concussion. A concussion is a milder form of traumatic brain injury caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or body. Its effects are usually temporary and may include headaches, dizziness, or temporary confusion, but generally do not result in long-term or permanent damage. In this case, Rob's brain was exposed to a lower level of external mechanical force compared to Tammy, resulting in a less severe injury. As a result, Rob's chances of recovery are significantly higher and he is expected to experience fewer, if any, long-term consequences from the accident. In conclusion, while both Tammy and Rob experienced an external mechanical force during the accident, Rob was less exposed to it, as evidenced by the less severe injury he sustained - a mild concussion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film shows a scene of a girl being kidnapped from a charity plane by Vietnamese rebels (a U.N. supplies [as in food and medicine] plane) in Vietnam.  Then we are taken to the United States to a detention center in Los Angeles where the warden of the center and 6 of the toughest prisoners are hired to rescue the girl, whose name is Gabrielle Presscott, daughter of Jameson Prescott, CEO and billionaire.  Warden Toliver and prisoners (by last name only, their first names are never revealed) Butts and Monster (black youths), Lopez and Vasquez (Latino youths, with Vasquez being a girl), and Brophy and Lamb (white youths). The group travels to Vietnam with three days to rescue Gabrielle, spending one day to train and the rest of the days to find her. After winning a battle the group spends the night at a village brothel and has a small celebration, with Brophy sneaking away into the night.  The group awakens to find the rebels with Brophy as a hostage and asking the villagers to hand over the rest of the Americans.  The group decides to attempt a rescue for Brophy and are successful, however, Lopez and Monster are both killed during the fight. The group runs away into the jungle and is tiredly marching along when Lamb steps on a landmine.  While Toliver is trying to disarm the mine, some rebels are slowly getting nearer and nearer to the group.  Brophy once again sneaks away but sacrifices himself, bringing another death to the group.

According to the theory of evolution, why do we die? Options are: (i). no (ii). yes The answer is:","output":"(i). no The following two questions are not the same. They may be connected in some ways as they deal with life and death, but they seek answers to different aspects.  The first question, \\"Why do we live if we are going to die?\\" is an existential question about the purpose and meaning of life. It represents the human need to understand and rationalize the ultimate fate of death. This question often arises when an individual contemplates their mortality, purpose, and value of life. Various philosophical, religious, and spiritual perspectives try to answer this question. For example, some may argue that the purpose of life is to achieve happiness, while others may believe that life is a test that prepares us for the afterlife. The second question, \\"According to the theory of evolution, why do we die?\\" focuses on a biological and scientific perspective on death. This question assumes that there must be an evolutionary reason for our mortality. According to the theory of evolution, death is a natural part of life that helps maintain the balance and health of ecosystems. It should be noted that the driving force behind evolution is the survival and reproduction of the fittest, not individual longevity. Species evolve through natural selection, ensuring specific traits that benefit its survival, such as predator evasion, reproduction, or any other adaptive traits, get passed on to the offspring. Death, in an evolutionary sense, helps reduce competition for resources and allows species to adapt faster to changing environments. It also reduces the accumulation of harmful genetic mutations within populations. Evolutionarily, organisms that had reproducing younger and then dying earlier were more successful in passing on their genes rather than organisms focusing on an extended life. In summary, the first question focuses on the philosophical and emotional aspects of life and death, while the second question centers on the scientific and evolutionary reasons for death. They may share some similarities in context, but they ultimately ask for different answers. Therefore, the answer is option (i). no."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"No matter how hard I try, I feel that I say the wrong thing or something inappropriate.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"I feel like I usually say the wrong thing.\\" is true?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"I feel like I usually say the wrong thing\\" is true based on the premise \\"No matter how hard I try, I feel that I say the wrong thing or something inappropriate,\\" we must first break down both statements and analyze them thoroughly. Premise: \\"No matter how hard I try, I feel that I say the wrong thing or something inappropriate.\\" In this premise, we can derive a few important aspects: 1. The speaker is making an effort to communicate effectively. 2. Despite this effort, they still feel like they are uttering incorrect or inappropriate statements. 3. This feeling is pervasive, meaning it occurs regularly or frequently. Hypothesis: \\"I feel like I usually say the wrong thing.\\" The hypothesis should be seen as a conclusion deduced logically from the premise. Here, the hypothesis is a summarization of the feeling expressed in the premise, focusing merely on saying the wrong thing. Analyzing the two statements, we can draw a few conclusions: 1. Consistency: Both the premise and the hypothesis describe a consistent feeling that the speaker experiences. The premise reveals a continuous struggle to communicate effectively, while the hypothesis simplifies this struggle into a single statement regarding the frequency of saying the wrong thing. 2. Inclusivity: The hypothesis omits the aspect of \\"something inappropriate\\" present in the premise. This omission may result in a less inclusive or narrower understanding of the issue. The premise encompasses both instances of saying the wrong thing as well as instances of saying something inappropriate, while the hypothesis focuses solely on the wrong thing aspect. 3. Emotional Aspect: The premise shows that the speaker is making a genuine effort to avoid such unfavorable situations, revealing an emotional aspect to their struggle. The hypothesis, although it derives from the same struggle, does not explicitly illustrate this emotional component. The simplification can be seen as a factual statement, whereas the premise exposes the emotional dimension. Based on the consistency and the emotional aspect of the analysis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis \\"I feel like I usually say the wrong thing\\" can be regarded as true in the context of the speaker's emotions and experiences. However, it is essential to note that the hypothesis does not fully represent the scope of the issue described in the premise, as it leaves out the element of saying \\"something inappropriate.\\" In conclusion, while the hypothesis is true in the sense that it represents the feelings and struggles of the speaker, it does not completely capture the entire scope of the issue as presented in the premise. Nevertheless, the hypothesis effectively summarizes a significant aspect of the problem and provides a sound basis for understanding the speaker's emotions and experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, team Obama acknowledged the need to recalibrate its debate strategy, vowing to be more aggressive in countering Romney's assertions and highlighting the President's accomplishments.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week.

In 1883, Galicia was first connected by rail to the rest of Spain, by way of O Barco de Valdeorras. Galicia today has roughly 1,100 kilometres (680 mi) of rail lines. Several 1,668 mm (5 ft 5 21⁄32 in) Iberian gauge lines operated by Adif and Renfe Operadora connect all the important Galician cities. A 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in) metre gauge line operated by FEVE connects Ferrol to Ribadeo and Oviedo. The only electrified line is the Ponferrada-Monforte de Lemos-Ourense-Vigo line. Several high-speed rail lines are under construction. Among these are the Olmedo-Zamora-Galicia high-speed rail line that opened partly in 2011, and the AVE Atlantic Axis route, which will connect all of the major Galician Atlantic coast cities A Coruña, Santiago de Compostela, Pontevedra and Vigo to Portugal. Another projected AVE line will connect Ourense to Pontevedra and Vigo.

The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications - Portugal's then current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes. In the grounds of avoiding a potentially serious financial crisis in the Portuguese economy, the Portuguese government decided to give them a bailout, eventually at a future loss to taxpayers and to the Portuguese people in general.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The Portuguese government bailed out Banco Português de Negócios (BPN) after it accumulated significant losses due to bad investments, embezzlement, and accounting fraud.

US baseball player Pete Rose was accused in 1989 of (and he confessed in 2004 to) what, that has made him ineligible to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame?","output":"Pete Rose, a former Major League Baseball (MLB) player and manager, was accused in 1989 of betting on baseball games, including those involving his own team, the Cincinnati Reds, while he was serving as their manager. He initially denied these accusations, but in 2004, he admitted to having placed bets on his own team, although he claimed that he never bet against the Reds. The scandal began in early 1989 when MLB started an investigation led by attorney John Dowd, known as the \\"Dowd Report.\\" This investigation found substantial evidence that Rose had engaged in gambling activities and had bet on baseball games. Rose's gambling activities not only involved placing bets on other teams but also on games that he was involved in as a player-manager. The Dowd Report collected testimonies from various individuals, including bookmakers and Rose's associates, and revealed betting records, phone calls, and other forms of evidence that connected Rose to these activities. In August 1989, then-MLB Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti placed Pete Rose on the \\"permanently ineligible list,\\" effectively banning him from MLB and making him ineligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. This decision was made due to Rose's longstanding association with gambling and the potential threat it posed to the integrity of the sport. Rose accepted the ban but did not admit to any wrongdoing at the time. It wasn't until 2004, in his autobiography \\"My Prison Without Bars,\\" that Rose confessed to his gambling activities, confirming many of the assertions made in the Dowd Report. Despite his admission and public apologies, Rose's lifetime ban has not been lifted, and he remains ineligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame. Multiple attempts to get reinstated and gain eligibility for the Hall of Fame have been made by Rose, but all have been unsuccessful as of now. The case of Pete Rose and his banishment from baseball remains one of the most significant, controversial, and debated issues in the history of the sport. Many argue that his outstanding on-field achievements should outweigh his off-field transgressions, while others firmly believe that the sanctity of the game and the rules set by the league must prevail, even if it means excluding one of the most accomplished players in the history of baseball from the Hall of Fame."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Breaking down the project goals into smaller, measurable milestones not only helps you track the progress made but also provides a clear and concise way to communicate this progress to your manager. By focusing each status report on a specific milestone, you can easily assess whether the project is on track and, if not, identify the challenges hindering the progress. When you write your status report, make sure to include information about the current status of each milestone, any potential roadblocks, and the corrective measures you are taking to overcome these roadblocks. This allows your manager to understand how the project is progressing and will enable them to provide any additional resources, guidance, or assistance required to ensure a successful outcome. In addition to the project milestones, it's crucial to keep track of any risks or potential issues that may affect the project's success. Be transparent in your status report and discuss these risks, along with the steps you are taking to mitigate them. This demonstrates your proactive approach to problem-solving and shows that you are attentive to any irregularities that may impact the project. Finally, always make sure to include a summary at the beginning of your status report, outlining the key points of the report. This will give your manager a quick overview of the project's current position and allows them to dive deeper into the report details if needed. Remember, a well-written status report can significantly contribute to the successful completion of a project by keeping all stakeholders informed and aligned to the project's timeline, budget, and objectives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What did the innocent man feel after he was accused of committing murder? Options: - fear - great sorrow - die - guilty - own death  Explain why a human would choose \\"great sorrow\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human might choose \\"great sorrow\\" as the answer to the question because they can empathize with the intensity of the emotions the innocent man would experience after being falsely accused of a heinous crime. The experience of being accused of murder has profound implications not only for the person's life but also for their mental and emotional well-being. In this context, let us explore the human emotions and the reason why “great sorrow” stands out as a more appropriate answer. 1. Fear: Although fear is a valid emotion that one might experience when accused of a serious crime, it may not completely encapsulate the depth of the psychological impact on the innocent man. The fear could be based on facing trial, imprisonment, or social ostracization. However, fear may not cover the grief and sadness that come from being wrongly accused and having one's character maligned. 2. Great sorrow: Great sorrow signifies emotional pain and distress, often stemming from grief, sadness, and disappointment. In this case, the innocent man's sorrow may originate from several sources. It could stem from the knowledge that someone out there believes he is capable of committing such a grave act, the social stigma and tarnished reputation created by the accusation, and the potential impact on his loved ones. The profound feeling of sorrow might also arise from the potential derailment of his life plans and goals in dealing with these false allegations. Therefore, great sorrow captures the deep emotional pain that may consume an individual in such a situation. 3. Die: While this option may seem a bit extreme, the severity of a murder accusation might lead an innocent person to consider the possibility of facing severe consequences, including facing the death penalty, imprisonment, or social despair. However, this choice doesn't delve into the emotional aspect of the question but rather highlights the potential outcomes in a more literal sense. 4. Guilty: Although the man is innocent, being falsely accused could make him question his innocence, wondering how a scenario such as this could even occur. However, this option doesn't wholly capture the emotional turmoil he would experience and doesn't resonate as deeply as \\"great sorrow.\\" 5. Own death: This response somewhat resonates with the \\"die\\" option, in which the innocent man might be metaphorically or even literally thinking about his death. Emotionally, however, it does not express the genuine feelings of sadness or despair that the accused person would feel. Ultimately, a human would likely choose \\"great sorrow\\" because it captures the intense emotional pain that the innocent man would experience. Though fear, guilt, and the thought of death might play a role, sorrow encapsulates a wider range of feelings that characterize the agony of being wrongfully accused of murder. The immense sadness, disappointment, and despair associated with great sorrow make it a more fitting answer in understanding the emotional turmoil of the innocent man."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Now, let's look at the other options and explain why they are wrong. a. While it acknowledges the difference in personal preference, it is unnecessarily confusing and complicated compared to the correct answer. It is not explained in a clear way that a five-year-old could easily understand. b. This option talks about students feeling comfortable and appreciating the notion of lying down and reclining but does not give any clear instruction on the sidestroke position, which is the main focus of this paragraph. c. This option advises against forcing students to lie on their stomachs but then contradicts itself by saying to have them lay on their stomachs anyway. It does not offer any guidance on the actual sidestroke position, which is what we should be looking for in the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Manchu (Manchu: manjU; Mollendorff: manju; Abkai: manju; simplified Chinese: Man Zu ; traditional Chinese: Man Zu ; pinyin: Manzu; Wade-Giles: Man3-tsu2) are an ethnic minority in China and the people from whom Manchuria derives its name. They are sometimes called \\"red-tasseled Manchus\\", a reference to the ornamentation on traditional Manchu hats. The Later Jin (1616-1636), and Qing dynasty (1636-1912) were established by Manchus, who are descended from the Jurchen people who earlier established the Jin dynasty (1115-1234) in China. Manchus form the largest branch of the Tungusic peoples and are distributed throughout China, forming the fourth largest ethnic group in the country. Octagonal drum is a type of Manchu folk art that was very popular among bannermen, especially in Beijing. It is said that octagonal drum originated with the snare drum of the Eight-banner military and the melody was made by the banner soldiers who were on the way back home from victory in the battle of Jinchuan. The drum is composed of wood surrounded by bells. The drumhead is made by wyrmhide with tassels at the bottom. The colors of the tassels are yellow, white, red, and blue, which represent the four colors of the Eight Banners. When artists perform, they use their fingers to hit the drumhead and shake the drum to ring the bells. Traditionally, octagonal drum is performed by three people. One is the harpist; one is the clown who is responsible for harlequinade; and the third is the singer.  \\"Zidishu\\" is the main libretto of octagonal drum and can be traced back to a type of traditional folk music called the \\"Manchu Rhythm\\". Although Zidishu was not created by Han Chinese, it still contains many themes from Chinese stories, such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, Romance of the West Chamber, Legend of the White Snake and Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. Additionally, there are many works that depict the lives of Bannermen. Aisin Gioro Yigeng, who was pen named \\"Helu\\" and wrote the sigh of old imperial bodyguard, as the representative author. Zidishu involves two acts of singing, which are called dongcheng and xicheng.  After the fall of the Qing dynasty, the influence of the octagonal drum gradually reduced. However, the Chinese monochord and crosstalk which derived from octagonal are still popular in Chinese society and the new generations. Many famous Chinese monochord performers and crosstalkers were the artists of octagonal drum, such as De Shoushan and Zhang Sanlu.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Is it used in traditional Manchu folk music?","output":"Yes, the octagonal drum is used in traditional Manchu folk music.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi, an Ashari theologian and Sunni jurist of the Maliki maddhab, was a prominent Andalusian scholar during the medieval era. Born and raised in the Iberian Peninsula's Islamic region, he spent his formative years studying Islamic theology, jurisprudence, and literature, eventually becoming an influential figure among his contemporaries. One of the key influences on Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi's intellectual development was the renowned Persian philosopher and theologian Al-Ghazali. Inspired by Al-Ghazali's works, ibn al-Arabi sought to reconcile rationalism and mysticism, striving for a balanced understanding of Islamic teachings and the human intellect's role in interpreting them. This endeavor led him to embrace the Ashari creed, a theological school that emphasizes the importance of rational inquiry while affirming the divine attributes of Allah. Throughout his life, Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi was deeply committed to the Maliki maddhab, one of the four primary schools of Islamic jurisprudence. As a distinguished jurist and scholar, he contributed significantly to the development of Islamic law and theology, authoring numerous books and treatises on various subjects. His scholarly work has left a lasting impact on the Muslim world, particularly in the region of Andalusia. Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi passed away in 543H (1148 CE), leaving behind a rich legacy of contributions to the intellectual and spiritual life of Islam. Today, he continues to be remembered and revered as one of the most significant thinkers and scholars of the medieval era, his ideas and teachings still influential among Muslims today. In commemorating this remarkable individual, the color associated with Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi is #b0c4de. This soft hue serves as a reminder of the subtle elegance and sophistication of his teachings, which continue to resonate with spiritual seekers and scholars alike, drawing from an era of Islamic history marked by intellectual vitality and profound inquiry into the deepest aspects of human experience."},{"instruction":"Craft one incorrect answer.

What is the best way to: To make canvas shoes into closed toe sandals. Available options: (i). Using eyebrow scissors, remove the back of the shoes, forming curved sandal shape on the sides.; (ii). Using fabric scissors, remove the back of the shoes, forming curved sandal shape on the sides.; Answer:","output":"The best way to transform canvas shoes into closed-toe sandals is a combination of careful planning, the right tools, and some creativity. Here, we will discuss how to use fabric scissors (option ii) to achieve this goal, along with some additional information and tips to ensure success. First and foremost, gather the necessary materials and tools: 1. A pair of canvas shoes 2. Fabric scissors (sharp and precise for clean cuts) 3. Fabric marker or chalk for marking cut lines 4. Seam ripper (optional, but useful for disassembling parts of the shoes) 5. Sandpaper or a nail file (for smoothing cut edges) 6. Fabric glue or a sewing kit (to reinforce edges and prevent fraying) Step-by-step process: 1. Plan your design: Before you start cutting away any part of the shoe, visualize and plan the final look you want to achieve in your closed-toe sandals. This step is crucial in minimizing any irreversible damage. Take into account the current style and structure of the shoes, as well as the sandal shape you're aiming for. You should also decide if you want to keep any of the shoes' original elements, such as straps, laces, or logos. 2. Mark the cut lines: Using a fabric marker or chalk, draw the curved sandal shape on the sides of the canvas shoes. Be precise and symmetrical so that when you make the cuts, the sandals look even and well-designed. If you're uncertain about your marking skills, practice on paper beforehand or use a stencil. 3. Remove shoelaces and other removable parts: Before cutting, it's essential to take out any laces, insoles, and removable elements so that they’re not damaged or obstruct your cutting path. 4. Cutting the shoe: Using fabric scissors, carefully cut along the marked lines you've drawn on the sides of the shoes, making sure to use smooth, steady motions to achieve clean edges. Be cautious and take your time to prevent any unnecessary damage to the shoe structure. 5. Trimming additional areas: Depending on your desired design, you may need to trim other areas of the shoe, such as the heel, tongue, or straps. Use fabric scissors for larger cuts and an optional seam ripper for smaller, more precise adjustments. 6. Smoothing the edges: After cutting all the necessary parts, use sandpaper or a nail file to smooth the edges of the material. This step will provide a cleaner look to your closed-toe sandals and prevent any rough or jagged edges from causing discomfort while wearing them. 7. Reinforcing the edges: To prevent fraying and ensure durability, reinforce the cut edges with either fabric glue or a sewing kit. If using fabric glue, apply a thin layer to the edges and allow it to dry. If using a sewing kit, sew around the edges with an appropriate stitch that complements the shoe's fabric. 8. Reassemble and customize: Finally, reattach any removed elements, such as laces or insoles. You can also take this opportunity to add other customizations like decorative beads or embroidery. With these steps and attention to detail, you can successfully transform your canvas shoes into stylish and unique closed-toe sandals that provide both comfort and personal flair."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Which type of respiration helps organisms generate quick bursts of speed, as opposed to long steady movement?   Choices:  - insertion respiration  - anabolic respiration  - digestion respiration  - anaerobic respiration  A: Answer:","output":"Anaerobic respiration helps organisms generate quick bursts of speed, as opposed to long steady movement. This type of respiration occurs in white muscle cells that are full of carbohydrates, which allows for the rapid production of ATP needed for quick, intense actions. Unlike aerobic respiration that takes place in red muscles full of mitochondria and creates ATP slowly over a long time, anaerobic respiration is ideal for sudden and short bursts of energy, providing an advantage during instances like escaping predators or chasing after prey. However, it also comes with the disadvantage of not being sustainable for continuous movement, as a predator may eventually catch a white-muscled prey if the pursuit continues for an extended period."},{"instruction":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Worthless !

Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work. Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission. The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice. The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana. \\"This award came as a real surprise to me. It is truly an honor. Just being the first chair of the commission which began the implementation of the pro bono process was somewhat humbling.

Let's analyze the given sentence to understand it better. The original sentence states that there is a woman in a brown jacket engaging in the action of taking a picture. We also know that the woman is positioned near two other people during the moment she is taking the picture. However, the sentence doesn't explicitly state that the woman is aiming her camera at those two people, and as a result, we cannot assume that the woman is taking a picture of those two individuals. It's possible that the woman is capturing a selfie with the two people in the background, or they are together capturing a shared experience such as an event or scenery. Alternatively, the woman might be taking a picture of something entirely unrelated to the two people nearby, such as a landmark, an animal, or any other object, person, or scene. Given the lack of explicit information about the subject of the woman's photo, it is impossible to determine with certainty whether \\"The woman is taking a picture of the others.\\" is an accurate interpretation or not. The information isn't clear enough to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the subject of the woman's photograph. To conclude, while it's possible that the woman may be taking a picture of the two other people, we cannot declare the sentence \\"The woman is taking a picture of the others.\\" as a true sentence based solely on the information provided in the original sentence.

Question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: At the end of your meal what will a waiter do? Options: - serve food - eat - set table - serve meal - present bill Answer:","output":"At the end of your meal, the action most in line with common sense that a waiter would do is to present the bill. This is because presenting the bill is the typical task performed by a waiter once you have finished eating at a restaurant. During your dining experience, a waiter has several responsibilities, such as greeting you upon arrival, explaining the menu, taking your order, serving your food, and attending to any additional requests you may have. The waiter's primary goal is to provide the best possible service to ensure you have an enjoyable and memorable dining experience. While all the options mentioned are tasks a waiter might perform, they are not appropriate to perform at the end of a meal. Serving food, setting the table, and serving a meal are tasks that are executed before or during your meal, not at the end of the meal. Eating is not typically a responsibility of a waiter as they are there to cater to your needs, not partake in the meal themselves. In conclusion, a waiter's role at the end of your meal is to present the bill. This allows you to review your charges and make the payment for the dishes and beverages consumed during your visit to the restaurant. This signals the end of the dining experience and is the most logical and common sense action for a waiter to take once your meal has concluded."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  The location of the Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces. This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure: ...and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. The location of the \\"lower part of the city\\", elsewhere referred to as the \\"Lower City\\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98 ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later Herodian-era expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the...  answer the following question:  In which area has excavations uncovered substantial evidence of habitation?

Engineers used plastic dams in a bid to stop water getting into signal boxes at Cowley Bridge, Devon. But Network Rail engineer Steve Hawkins said they would have to wait for flooding to subside before they can begin repairs. Water from the swollen River Exe has washed away the ground from underneath some of the nearby track, buckling rails and making the area unstable. Trains between London Paddington and Penzance use the area and passengers were being advised to make alternative arrangements. Mr Hawkins said: \\"Once we're assured from the Environment Agency and the Met Office that the flooding isn't going to occur again, we'll then remove the dams that we've got in place. \\"We'll then start work on the structure of the track which, depending on how bad it is, it could take from between three days and five days to fix.\\" Mr Hawkins added flood defences installed a decade ago had worked until this winter - and the firm was now expecting more rain.

The name \\"Melanesia\\" (\\"islands of dark [people]\\") is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning \\"land of the blacks\\" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants. The concept among Europeans of Melanesia as a distinct region evolved gradually over time as their expeditions mapped and explored the Pacific. Early European explorers noted the physical differences among groups of Pacific Islanders. In 1756 Charles de Brosses theorized that there was an 'old black race' in the Pacific who were conquered or defeated by the peoples of what is now called Polynesia, whom he distinguished as having lighter skin.

While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.  After reading the above, is \\"The number of hijackers\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Which two factors were different between the three other hijacked planes and United 93?\\"?","output":"Yes, the number of hijackers is one of the factors that were different between the three other hijacked planes and United 93.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor. A landmark budget agreement that passed in the U.S. House on Thursday faces certain death in the Senate unless at least five Republicans step up to support it – but so far there are no takers at all. The GOP's Senate leaders plan to launch a procedural effort to kill the plan over a laundry list of objections – including a claim that it short-changes military veterans and other government retirees. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin conceded that he needs to find Republicans who will vote for the measure after Republicans announced their intention Thursday night to block the deal. 'We need Republican votes to pass the budget agreement, period,' Durbin told reporters on Thursday. 'We need at least five. And I’m hoping that there will be more than that.' Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and the third-most powerful Senate leader, acknowledged that 'there are not five Republicans who have announced they’re for it.' In fact, no Republican senators have publicly said that they will vote in favor of the agreement that Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray unveiled Tuesday evening. Turtle in the headlights? Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is on the hot seat as his caucus prepares to fight against the budget agreement that the House passed easily Thursday night. No way, Jose: Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative tea-party darling, said the budget proposal 'spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare. I cannot support it' Their plan would roll back. 63 billion in mandatory cuts from the so-called budget sequester that took effect in March. Some of that restored spending. would be offset by cuts to military and civilian government pensions. Annual cost-of-living increases in most military veterans' retirement benefits would be cut by 1 per cent, an amount that the Military Officers Association of America says could cost a typical former soldier or sailor 80,000 over a 20-year period. The GOP's three most senior senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have announced that they will vote 'no.' Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, all considered top-tier presidential contenders in 2016, are all lined up against the measure. The proposal 'spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare,' Cruz said Thursday. 'I cannot support it.' Gang of two: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray negotiated a shutdown-averting agreement that could be headed nowhere. Rubio emailed supporters on Wednesday, saying that the agreement Ryan and Murray negotiated over a six-week period 'continues Washington's irresponsible budgeting decisions by spending more money than the government takes in and placing additional financial burdens on everyday Americans.' House Speaker John Boehner fanned the flames of a civil war inside the GOP by slamming conservative groups that opposed the budget deal -- but it could all be for nought if his Senate colleagues decide to kill it. And Paul said in a statement that the March sequester cuts 'were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem. Undoing tens of billions of this modest spending restraint is shameful and must be opposed.' Other Republicans who face primary challenges from tea party-backed candidates are also vowing to cast 'no' votes. 'After careful review of the agreement, I believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees,' South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said in a statement. 'Our men and women in uniform have served admirably during some of our nation’s most troubling times. They deserve more from us in their retirement than this agreement provides.' Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, echoed Graham's complaint. 'I do not support paying for increased federal spending on the backs of our retired and active duty troops,' Wicker's Thursday statement read. 'Congress should not change the rules in the middle of the game for those who have chosen to serve our nation in the military. ... The plan should be rejected.' Other Republicans object to what one GOP Senate staffer told MailOnline is the agreement's 'pixie dust approach to budgeting.' 'We're doing what we always do,' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'We set out a ten-year plan while knowing full well that we have a decade to undo it and shift gears again.' Looking toward 2016: Sen. Rand Paul said the unpopular 'sequester' budget cuts 'were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem' and should never be rolled back. Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions explained that Democrats will need 60 'yes' votes – on two separate procedural ballots – in order to pass it. The GOP's parliamentary roadblocks will have the same effect as a traditional filibuster without consuming countless hours of Senate time when the measure is considered early next week. Even if Senate Democrats manage to find enough Republican support to pass the agreement, it won't have the force of law. What Ryan and Murray proposed Wednesday is merely a framework for a budget that has yet to be written. Members of Congress who sit on appropriation committees will still be required to craft – and pass in both houses – a final budget bill by January 15. Unless they can pull it off, the federal government will be headed for its second shutdown in three months. Highlights:","output":"1. A landmark budget agreement passed in the U.S. House but faces challenges in the Senate. 2. At least five Republican senators must support it for it to pass, but currently, none have publicly stated they will vote in favor of it. 3. The GOP Senate leaders plan to launch a procedural effort to kill the plan, objecting to it short-changing military veterans and other government retirees. 4. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin is trying to find Republicans to vote for the measure. 5. Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul are lined up against the measure, opposing its increased spending, taxing, and continued funding for Obamacare. 6. Republicans facing primary challenges from tea party-backed candidates are expected to vote \\"no\\" on the proposal. 7. If the agreement passes the Senate, it still only serves as a framework, needing final approval in both houses in January to avoid another government shutdown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. They are addressing separate issues.  1. The first question asks about the correct grammar usage between two given phrases: 'I will appreciate if you..' or 'I would appreciate if you..'. To answer this question, the correct grammar usage is 'I would appreciate if you..'. This is because the phrase 'I would appreciate if you..' is more polite as it is in the conditional form. It suggests that you are making a request, and the action from the other person depends on their willingness to help or cooperate. On the other hand, the phrase 'I will appreciate if you..' sounds more like a statement conveying that you are definitely going to appreciate someone's help, but it lacks the politeness and the conditional element. 2. The second question, \\"How do I correct WordPress mobile grammar errors?\\" is related to fixing grammar errors, specifically on the WordPress mobile platform. This question is not related to the comparison between the two given phrases in grammatical correctness. Instead, it asks for ways to correct grammar errors in a specific context, that is, using the WordPress mobile app or mobile site. To answer this question, you can correct grammar errors in WordPress Mobile by following these steps: a. Open the WordPress mobile app or access your WordPress site from a mobile browser. b. Navigate to the post or page you wish to edit. c. Locate the content area containing the grammar errors you need to fix. d. Edit the text directly within the content area, carefully correcting any grammar errors you find. e. Make sure to proofread your changes thoroughly to ensure no other errors were introduced. f.

Are both bands, The Colourist and Muse, from Ireland? A:","output":"To answer this complex question, we need to look into the origins of both bands, The Colourist and Muse, and determine if they are indeed from Ireland. The Colourist is an American rock band formed in 2009, hailing from Orange County, California. The band consists of Adam Castilla (vocals, guitar), Maya Tuttle (drums, vocals), Justin Wagner (keyboard, guitar), and Kollin Johannsen (bass, guitar). They released their self-titled debut album in 2014. Their music style is described as indie-pop, with a combination of catchy melodies, electronic elements, and powerful instrumentals. Given the fact that The Colourist originates from the United States, they are not from Ireland. Muse, on the other hand, is a British rock band formed in 1994 in Teignmouth, Devon, England. The trio is made up of Matthew Bellamy (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Christopher Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and Dominic Howard (drums, percussion). Muse is known for their energetic live performances, ambitious concept-driven albums, and a fusion of various music styles, such as alternative rock, electronic, and progressive rock. They have released multiple acclaimed albums, including \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" (2001), \\"Absolution\\" (2003), \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" (2006), and \\"The Resistance\\" (2009).

In this case, guitar is not a specific instance of violin, so the relationship is not 'HYPER'.    - 'COORD': This relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. Guitar and violin both belong to the semantic class of musical instruments, so the relationship is 'COORD'.    - 'RANDOM': This relationship applies when neither 'HYPER' nor 'COORD' are applicable.

Premise: Laid out like a chessboard (nearly half the size of China's similarly designed capital, Chang'an), Nara had its imperial palace at the northern end, with court residences, Buddhist monasteries, and Shinto shrines stretching to the south. Hypothesis: There were Buddhist monasteries in the west of Nara. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Based on the premise provided, we cannot conclude definitively whether the hypothesis that \\"There were Buddhist monasteries in the west of Nara\\" is entailed or not. The premise only tells us Nara had a layout similar to a chessboard, being nearly half the size of China's Chang'an, with the imperial palace located at the northern end and court residences, Buddhist monasteries, and Shinto shrines stretching south. It does not specify whether there were Buddhist monasteries in the western part of the city.  To ascertain whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we would need more context and information about the spatial arrangement of the monasteries in relation to other parts of Nara. Specifically, we would need information about the location of the Buddhist monasteries within the city – whether they were concentrated in one particular area, or distributed equally throughout Nara, including the west. If we were to discover additional sources that describe the geographic location of Buddhist monasteries within Nara, we might be able to establish the hypothesis' validity. For instance, historical texts or archaeological evidence could provide further information regarding the distribution and development of religious institutions within Nara. Additionally, studying the city planning approach of Nara in comparison to Chang'an may offer insights into whether there were indeed Buddhist monasteries located in the west of Nara, as many cities during that period followed similar city planning methods. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"There were Buddhist monasteries in the west of Nara\\" cannot be decisively confirmed or denied based on the information provided in the premise.

Although the crew is overdue for shore leave, Porter, a cold, efficient leader, lies to them in order to coerce them to volunteer for the dangerous assignment. Farragut soon reunites with his old shipmate, Chief Petty Officer Link, who tries to convince him that Porter, who years earlier trained Farragut harshly in an attempt to teach him patience and discipline, is not as heartless as he appears. This starts to show itself when Porter later reconciles with Farragut about their past and agree to be civil with one another. Once the ship is at sea, Porter and Farragut open their orders and are dismayed to discover their mission: to disguise themselves as pirates, with no ties to or protection from the United States, in order to track down pirates raiding the West Indies. One night soon after, Farragut is in charge of the ship when a storm hits. Link becomes trapped beneath a keg of rum from which he has tried to sneak a drink and Farragut is forced to break the ship's rudder to rescue him.

Summarize this article: Saint Is Already A More Popular Baby Name Than North Kim Kardashian and Kanye West got creative, but not too creative, with their new son’s name.      After keeping the public waiting for two days, Kim Kardashian broke her silence Monday afternoon on the name of her son, her second child with Kanye West:      Kim and Kanye went for popularity this time, at least compared with the name they chose for their daughter, North, who was born in 2013.      According to the Social Security Administration’s database of baby names, 32 boys born last year were named Saint. That’s more than the 13 kids born last year who were named North. (The SSA reports names by sex; to be included in the data, a name must have been given at least five times. In 2013, for example, all 20 babies in the data set named North were male, and North West isn’t included.) Over time, too, “Saint” seems more popular than “North.”      Santos, the Spanish name meaning “saint,” is even more popular. About 235 babies in the U.S. were given that name last year.      North West could not immediately be reached for comment.

Saint, not surprisingly, is a relatively rare name. Just 32 boys born in 2014 were registered with the first name Saint, according to records from the Social Security Administration (SSA).      Saints first appeared in the SSA records in 1891, when five baby girls were given the name. (The SSA database has recorded the birth, year and gender for each social security application since 1879.) Five years later, in 1896, there was a sudden spike in popularity when 10 baby boys were registered as Saints.      Since then, the name has bubbled up and down, but it seems to be experiencing a steady growth in popularity over the past decade. Since 2008, around a dozen Saints have been born each year – all boys. Looking at the data going back to 1940, more than 300 Saints have been born in America.      The image below comes from an interactive built by Randy Olson that uses SSA data to analyze US name trends.            Americans called Saint.

Read this article and answer this question On 22 December the Pretender landed in Scotland at Peterhead, but by the time he arrived at Perth on 9 January 1716, the Jacobite army numbered fewer than 5,000. In contrast, Argyll's forces had acquired heavy artillery and were advancing quickly. Mar decided to burn a number of villages between Perth and Stirling, so as to deprive Argyll's army of supplies. On 30 January Mar led the Jacobites out of Perth; on 4 February the Pretender wrote a farewell letter to Scotland, sailing from Montrose the following day. Many Jacobites who were taken prisoner were tried for treason and sentenced to death. The Indemnity Act of July 1717 pardoned all those who had taken part in the Rising, but the whole of the Clan Gregor, including Rob Roy MacGregor, was specifically excluded from the benefits of that Act. Another attempt, this time with Spanish support, was undertaken in 1719, only to end again in defeat in the Battle of Glenshiel. James's son Charles Edward Stuart attempted to win the throne for his father in 1745, in another Jacobite rising, but was defeated at the Battle of Culloden. James died in 1766.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The story begins with a prologue, narrated by Michael Hordern, establishing the Lapine culture and mythology and describing the creation of the world and its animals by Lord Frith, the sun god. All the animals co-exist peacefully and eat grass together but the rabbits, led by Prince El-ahrairah, quickly multiply and overwhelm the other animals with their insatiable hunger. When Frith warns El-ahrairah to control his people, the prince scoffs at him, claiming that his are the strongest people in the land. In retaliation, Frith gives to each of the other animals a gift, turning them into predators, or 'elil' that hunt and feed on the rabbits. However, Frith also bestows upon the rabbits the gifts of speed and cunning, enabling them a fighting chance against their enemies. All creatures may seek to kill El-ahrairah and his descendants but, with their wits and quickness, the rabbits may survive.The film then transitions to realistic animation and brings us to the English countryside of Sandleford. Fiver (Richard Briers), a young runt rabbit with prophetic abilities, foresees the end of his peaceful rabbit warren during an afternoon grazing, or 'silflay'. He exclaims to his older brother, Hazel (John Hurt), that the field they live on is covered in blood, but Hazel acknowledges the image as a trickery of the sunset. Regardless, he agrees to take Fiver to the Chief Rabbit to see if they can have the warren evacuated. However, the Chief Rabbit (Ralph Richardson) dismisses them, saying that leaving the warren in the height of the mating season is preposterous enough without it being based on a young rabbit's prophecy. Knowing that his brother's visions have always come to light in the past, Hazel helps Fiver gather any rabbits willing to leave the warren and they all sneak away during the night. They are briefly stopped by Captain Holly (John Bennett) of the Owsla, the rabbit police force, but they manage to fight past him.

Merman was born in her maternal grandmother's house located at 359 4th Avenue in Astoria, Queens in New York City in 1908, though she would later emphatically insist that it was actually 1912. Her father, Edward Zimmermann (1879-1977), was an accountant with James H. Dunham & Company, a Manhattan wholesale dry-goods company, and her mother, Agnes (Gardner) Zimmermann (1883-1974), was a teacher. Edward Zimmermann had been raised in the Dutch Reformed Church and his wife was Presbyterian. Merman began to become forgetful with advancing age, and on occasion, had difficulty with her speech. At times her behavior was erratic, causing concern among her friends. On April 7, 1983, she was preparing to travel to Los Angeles to appear on the 55th Academy Awards telecast, when she collapsed in her apartment. Merman was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where doctors initially thought she had suffered a stroke. However, after undergoing exploratory surgery on April 11, Merman was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma. The New York Times reported that she underwent brain surgery to have the tumor removed, but it was inoperable and her condition was deemed terminal (doctors had given Merman eight and half months to live). The tumor caused Merman to become aphasic, and, as her illness progressed, she lost her hair and her face swelled. According to Merman biographer Brian Kellow, Merman's family and manager did not want the true nature of her condition revealed to the public. Merman's son Robert, Jr., who took charge of her care, later said he chose not to publicly disclose his mother's true condition because Merman strove to keep her personal life private. He stated, \\"Mom truly appreciated [her fans'] presence and their applause. But you shouldn't attempt to be personal--she drew lines, and she could cut you off.\\"  Merman's health eventually stabilized enough for her to be brought back to her apartment in Manhattan. On February 15, 1984, 10 months after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, Merman died at her home in Manhattan at the age of 76. On the evening of Merman's death, all 36 theatres on Broadway dimmed their lights at 9 pm in her honor. A private funeral service for Merman was held in a chapel at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on February 27, after which Merman was cremated at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. In accordance with her wishes, Merman's remains were given to her son Robert, Jr. Merman was interred in the Shrine of Remembrance Mausoleum in Colorado Springs, Colorado, next to her daughter Ethel.  On October 10, 1984, an auction of her personal effects, including furniture, artwork, and theatre memorabilia, earned in excess of 120,000 at Christie's East. The 56th Academy Awards, held on April 2, 1984, ended with a performance of \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" in tribute to Merman.

Is \\"In the mid-to-late Republican era, and probably much earlier, many of Rome's leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult, along with a share of their divinity.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What did many Romans claim in the Republican era?\\"","output":"Yes, the given statement, \\"In the mid-to-late Republican era, and probably much earlier, many of Rome's leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult, along with a share of their divinity,\\" effectively answers the question \\"What did many Romans claim in the Republican era?\\" by providing an insight into the religious beliefs and ancestral connections of Romans during this time. However, an even more detailed and comprehensive answer would provide additional context and examples to further illustrate these claims. During the Republican era of Rome, which began in 509 BCE and lasted until 27 BCE, religious beliefs were an integral part of Roman society. Many patrician families claimed connections to deities or other divine figures to bolster their social prominence, authority, and legitimacy. This practice allowed them to associate their family lineage with divine blessings and protection. For example, the gens Julia, the family to which Julius Caesar belonged, claimed descent from Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, through their legendary ancestor Aeneas, who was a hero in both Greek and Roman mythology. This connection not only elevated the status of the gens Julia but also conferred an aura of divine favor and power to the family. Likewise, other prominent Roman families held similar beliefs about their ancestors. The gens Fabia claimed a connection to Hercules, while the gens Claudia asserted that their lineage traced back to the Sabine deities Marsyas and Quirinus. Such connections reinforced the idea that these families held a unique and powerful position within Roman society, as they were not only distinguished by their wealth and social standing, but also by their divine heritage. Additionally, these families often established cults or religious ceremonies dedicated to their divine ancestors, granting them further prestige and reinforcing the belief in their divine connections. These cults and religious practices were an essential aspect of Roman civic and family life during the Republic and served to solidify the elite families' positions within the broader society. By claiming connections to divine or semi-divine figures, Roman families bolstered their social status, further distinguished themselves from other families, and legitimized their power and influence. This practice was deeply ingrained in Roman society during the Republican era, representing the intertwining of family, religion, and politics in the pursuit and maintenance of power. In conclusion, during the Republican era of Rome, many leading Roman clans claimed connections with divine and semi-divine ancestors in an effort to secure and legitimize their authority, influence, and status within Roman society. This practice included the establishment of cults and religious ceremonies dedicated to these ancestors, reinforcing the important role of religion in public and private life. As such, the given statement effectively addresses the question about what many Romans claimed in the Republican era, while a more detailed response would provide additional examples and context to further illustrate the significance of these claims."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Use evidence from the fact that heavy rains cause flooding to answer this question: \\"Heavy rains cause flooding which\\"","output":"Heavy rains cause flooding, which can lead to several long and short-term consequences affecting various aspects of life, including ecosystems, communities, infrastructure, and human behaviors. The evidence supporting this assertion is abundant through the observation of various instances of flooding events around the world. 1. Damage to infrastructure: Heavy rains cause an influx of water beyond the drainage system's capacity, leading to flooding. This can result in extensive damage to roads, bridges, buildings, and other infrastructure. In many cases, the damage may be severe enough to require significant repair or reconstruction efforts, placing a substantial financial burden on governments and communities. 2. Loss of life and property: Flooding, as a result of heavy rains, can lead to loss of life, injuries, and significant property damages. During flood events, buildings may collapse, vehicles can be swept away, and people may get caught in the rapidly rising waters, leading to casualties. Moreover, properties, including homes, businesses, and farmland, can be severely damaged or destroyed. 3. Disruption of daily life: Heavy rainfall and flooding can cause considerable disruption to daily life in affected areas. People may be forced to evacuate their homes, schools and workplaces may be closed, and transportation systems might be severely impacted. This disruption can lead to loss of income, educational gaps for students, and long-term socio-economic implications for affected communities. 4. Impact on agriculture and food supply: Excessive rainfall can cause flooding in agricultural fields, leading to crop failures and harming livestock. This can result in food shortages and price increases, both locally and in areas that receive food imports from the flooded regions. Moreover, disruptions in transportation networks can exacerbate these food supply issues and contribute to food insecurity. 5. Environmental impact: Flooding due to heavy rains can significantly impact natural environments. Floods can displace wildlife, leading to disrupted ecosystems and the loss of habitats for various species. Additionally, heavy rains can cause soil erosion and sedimentation in rivers and other water bodies, negatively impacting aquatic life and water quality. 6. Spread of waterborne diseases: Flooding caused by heavy rains can also increase the risk of waterborne diseases, such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever. This occurs when contaminated floodwaters mix with drinking water sources or when people are exposed to floodwater, which may contain sewage or other pollutants. The spread of these diseases may result in serious public health concerns. 7. Psychological impact: Flooding can have lasting psychological effects on affected individuals and communities. The loss of homes, possessions, and loved ones can lead to anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other mental health issues. Moreover, the uncertainty and fear of future floods can create long-term stress for people living in flood-prone areas. In conclusion, heavy rains cause flooding, which has wide-ranging consequences on various aspects of life. The evidence gathered from flood events worldwide highlights the severe impact of these disasters on infrastructure, human life, agriculture, natural environments, public health, and mental well-being. Therefore, it is crucial for governments, communities, and individuals to increase awareness and adopt mitigation measures to minimize the risks associated with flooding caused by heavy rainfall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two investigate the murder of a highly obese man (Bob Mack) who was fed spaghetti until a kick to his stomach burst him open. Somerset investigates the murder while Mills is given the murder case of Defense Attorney Eli Gould (Gene Borkan), with GREED written in Gould's blood on the floor. Gould was forced to carve a pound of flesh off of his body, and subsequently bled to death.

Going to the victim's house, Somerset finds three groove marks in front of the refrigerator and finds that the plastic-like slivers fit into them perfectly. Knowing the slivers resulted from the refrigerator being moved, Somerset looks behind it. He finds the word GLUTTONY written behind the fridge in grease, along with a note containing a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost.

Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to learn about a thing called a \\"census.\\" A census is a way for us to count how many people live in a place, like a country, and learn more about them. One of the things we can find out is how many people are living together in one home. This is called a \\"household.\\" Now, imagine a big house where a family lives. There's a mommy, a daddy, and maybe a brother or sister. That's a whole bunch of people living in one home, which makes one household. When we count all the households in a place, we find out how many homes have families or groups of people living in them. If we play a fun game and compare two groups, one group with all the people and another group with all the households, guess which one is bigger? You got it! The people group is much bigger! Why is the people group bigger? That's because there's are lots of mommies, daddies, brothers, and sisters in different homes (households). So, when we count them all together, there are more people than homes.  The census helps us know that there are more people on Earth than households.

When two grade-school boys get into a fight in the park that results in one boy, Zachary Cowan, hitting the other, Ethan Longstreet, in the face with a stick, their parents meet in a Brooklyn apartment to discuss the matter. Zachary's parents, Alan and Nancy Cowan, visit the home of Michael and Penelope Longstreet, Ethan's parents. Their meeting is initially intended to be short, but due to various circumstances, the conversation continues to draw out. In fact, Alan and Nancy begin to leave the apartment on two occasions, but are drawn back in to further discussion. At first, the couples are friendly to each other, but their respective comments start to hurt feelings, making everyone argue with one another. Apart from fighting among themselves, the couples blame each other about who is responsible for the fight between their sons. Nancy calls the Longstreets \\"superficially fair-minded\\" and Penelope and Michael complain about Alan's arrogant and dull attitude. Everyone also gets irritated with Alan when he accepts endless business phone calls on his BlackBerry, interrupting the discussion, and showing he has more interest in his business problems than the matter at hand. Michael also receives many phone calls from his ailing mother, to his frustration. Nancy accuses Michael of being a murderer because he, annoyed by the constant noise it made during the night, had earlier turned his daughter Courtney's pet hamster loose in the street. Penelope becomes emotional about the hamster and with everyone arguing with each other. Other issues include a risky drug Alan is working to defend and Michael's mother has been prescribed, and the question of idealism and responsibility that is part of Penelope's current work.

The meeting is set up in the aftermath of a fight between their grade-school boys, Zachary Cowan and Ethan Longstreet, that took place in a park. The conflict escalated to the point that Zachary hit Ethan in the face with a stick. The main reason for their meeting is to discuss this serious incident and to discover, upon conversing, possible solutions or ways forward for their children. Alan and Nancy Cowan are the parents of Zachary, the boy who inflicted harm during the fight. Meanwhile, Michael and Penelope Longstreet are the parents of Ethan, the boy who was hit in the face by Zachary's stick. The meeting begins with an intention for it to be short but, with varying circumstances including arguments, accusations, and revelations about personal issues, keeps getting extended. Alan's habit of incessantly accepting business calls on his Blackberry shows his prioritized interest in work rather than their sons' issue, which also aggravates the discussions and the Longstreets' resentments. Michael, too, receives plenty calls from his sick mother and is accused of being a murderer by Nancy for releasing his daughter's pet hamster into the street out of annoyance.  Not only does the meeting make it clear that their sons' fight isn't an isolated issue, but it also reveals personal and familial problems each pair of parents explore during their meeting. This includes the revelation of a risky drug Alan defends professionally and which Michael's mother consumes.

I read their reviews and the 4.5 star average immediately intrigued me. It takes a lot to earn a 4.5/5 star average on yelp and it made me wonder, it made me ponder and it made me eager to visit immediately to see what all this burger hype was about.   While planning an office hours at Lobby's, I spoke to Lobby several times and listened to him explain the attention he gives to his burgers. The incredibly lean meat, the personal attention to each patty, Lobby's commitment to making the patty's from scratch...it sounded like this was a business that was definitely handled with some tender loving care.   So the day arrived for me to finally visit Lobby's. The directions indicated that it was in a strip mall. For those of you who might get a little turned around like I do...go towards the grocery store and when you're facing it look to the left and behind you and poof, there's Lobby's! So I walked in and received a friendly welcome from the staff the second my foot entered the store. As I sat there for several hours, I noticed that Lobby and staff treat every customer the same way and each customer gets a personal welcome upon arrival. I also like how they welcome but they don't banter the potential customers to try the food. They let the customer decide for themselves. The decor was retro and cool and I could see the burger and fries being made right in front of me. I glanced at the menu even though I knew that only a burger this visit would do, and I was pleased with the price. Inexpensive.   Moving on to the grand finale, the food. I ordered the cheeseburger and upon the staffer's recommendation, I got it with provolone and kept everything on it, especially Lobby's special sauce. The staffer suggested I take some special sauce on the side for my fries and swore by it so I didn't question the man and said OK! The burger and fries arrived and I immediately knew I was in trouble... the gluttony kind. Nestled on a fresh sesame bun and topped with thick and juicy pickles, lettuce, tomato and the special sauce, the patty was cooked to perfection and just the right size. I took one bite and was in cheeseburger paradise and I didn't even have to go to Hawaii! The burger was juicy, full of taste and the meat was lean. The special sauce. Oh my the special sauce. It's not your typical special burger sauce. There was an ingredient in there that made it just the right amount of sweet and perfect for dipping fries. I guess the lesson here is trust the Lobby's staffer! I tried to guess what the ingredients in the special sauce were but Lobby said that nobody has ever been able to guess. So that's a challenge yelpers. Figure out what's in the special sauce and let me know! The fries were crunchy and delicious, but there were a lot of them so if you go with a friend, you might want to share the fries since the burger will fill you up.   I can't wait to visit Lobby's again and try the Italian Beef sandwich Donald S was raving about. If it's anything like the burger, I know I'll be in heaven. But in the meantime, I'll just have burgerlicious dreams about the tastiness I experienced with Lobby's Burgers. And now I see why they have such a high rating on yelp. Bravo Lobby!

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the King that a mounted white horse representing him is carved into the chalk hills of Osmington? , can you please find it?   Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645.  In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

This iconic figure was created in 1808 to celebrate the King's patronage of the town and to improve Weymouth's reputation as a popular destination during his reign. The carving is an impressive sight and serves as a lasting tribute to the connection between King George III and the town of Weymouth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person following whose death the memorial was abandoned half-finished? from the following article ?  Mary Watts died in 1938, and was buried alongside George Frederic Watts near the Watts Mortuary Chapel, which she had herself designed and built in Compton in 1901. Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52 of the intended 120 spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be a symbol of the Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.The nave of Christ Church Greyfriars was destroyed by bombing on 29 December 1940. By then the decline in the population of the City of London had reduced the congregation to less than 80, and the parishes of St Leonard, Foster Lane and Christ Church Greyfriars were merged with nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. Although parts of the ruins were cleared during a widening of King Edward Street after the Second World War, the remains of the nave of Christ Church Greyfriars became a public memorial in 1989; the tower is now office space.St Botolph's Aldersgate remains open as a functioning church. Unusually for an English church, because of its location in a now mainly commercial area with few local residents, services are held on Tuesdays instead of the more traditional Sundays. On 4 January 1950, St Botolph's Aldersgate and the surviving ruins of Christ Church Greyfriars were both designated Grade I listed buildings.In 1934, a statue of Sir Robert Peel erected in Cheapside in 1855 was declared an obstruction to traffic and removed.

Solve this instance: PURPOSE The circadian clock gene Bmal1 is involved in cancer cell proliferation and DNA damage sensitivity. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of Bmal1 on oxaliplatin sensitivity and to determine its clinical significance in colorectal cancer.    EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Three colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT116, THC8307 and HT29, were used. The Bmal1-mediated control of colorectal cancer cell proliferation was tested in vitro and in vivo. MTT and colony formation assays were performed to determine the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to oxaliplatin. Flow cytometry was used to examine changes in the cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis rate. Proteins expressed downstream of Bmal1 upon its overexpression were determined by Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze Bmal1 expression in 82 archived colorectal cancer tumors from patients treated with oxaliplatin-based regimens.     RESULTS Bmal1 overexpression inhibited colorectal cancer cell proliferation and increased colorectal cancer sensitivity to oxaliplatin in three colorectal cancer cell lines and HCT116 cells model in vivo. Furthermore, the overall survival of patients with colorectal cancer with high Bmal1 levels in their primary tumors was significantly longer than that of patients with low Bmal1 levels (27 vs. 19 months; P = 0.043). The progression-free survival of patients with high Bmal1 expression was also significantly longer than that of patients with low Bmal1 expression (11 vs. 5 months; P = 0.015). Mechanistically, the effect of Bmal1 was associated with its ability to regulate G2-M arrest by activating the ATM pathway.     CONCLUSION Bmal1 shows the potential as a novel prognostic biomarker and may represent a new therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.

Mel Wexler is a successful producer who has become a workaholic since the death of his family in a plane crash. Trying to forget his loss, he throws himself on producing Manhattan. For the lead role, he tries to cast the feared film star Sabina Quarles, who has a reputation of being hard to work with. She initially declines, explaining she is too good for television. However, because of her past with Mel, she finally accepts the role. They soon start a relationship, but he remains suspicious of her constant visits to San Francisco. She is reluctant to explain why she is going there every month, which makes him think she has an affair. Meanwhile, playing her stepson in the series is Bill Warwick, an actor who is a sex symbol. He is married to Sandy, but because of his image, he has to keep their marriage a secret. Sandy was once a great actress, but her drug addiction has turned her into a street prostitute, ignoring her work. He thinks a co-starring role could help her going towards the right path, but she fails to show up at her audition. The role eventually goes to Gaby Smith, a rich actress who graduated from Yale.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To consider the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"There are less trucks on the motorway this winter,\\" let's analyze it from several perspectives, including grammar, semantics, and style. 1. Grammar: The sentence structure is clear and conforms to the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern. All the words are in their correct form and properly arranged. The only issue that can be pointed out is the use of the word \\"less\\" instead of \\"fewer.\\" Although it is fairly common for people to use \\"less\\" when referring to a smaller number or quantity, it is grammatically incorrect in this context. The correct word to use here is \\"fewer,\\" as trucks are countable objects. A more accurate sentence would be: \\"There are fewer trucks on the motorway this winter.\\" 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence conveys a clear meaning. It communicates that the number of trucks present on the motorway has decreased during this winter season compared to other times or previous winters. The language is simple, and the words are well-chosen to express the intended meaning. Using \\"fewer\\" instead of \\"less\\" would improve the semantic accuracy and clarity. 3. Style: The sentence is concise and uses plain language, which is generally considered a positive feature in terms of style. It is easily understandable and does not contain any redundant or complex elements that could lead to confusion. However, using the proper term \\"fewer\\" would enhance the sentence's stylistic value and formally correctness. 4. Pragmatics: The sentence appears to be a statement presenting a fact or an observation about the number of trucks on the motorway during this winter. It can be contextually relevant and informative, particularly for those concerned with transport, logistics, or road safety. The information provided allows for further discussions or interpretations, such as analyzing potential reasons for this decrease or examining its influence on traffic conditions. In conclusion, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"There are less trucks on the motorway this winter\\" is relatively strong except for the incorrect use of the word \\"less\\" instead of \\"fewer.\\" Other aspects, such as grammar, semantics, style, and pragmatics, are well-executed, resulting in a clear and concise statement. A minor revision to the sentence, correcting the usage of \\"less\\" to \\"fewer,\\" would improve its linguistic integrity even further. The revised sentence would be: \\"There are fewer trucks on the motorway this winter.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is an analysis of both questions: 1. \\"Can I change the battery of my phone with a high capacity one?\\": This question is about whether it is possible to replace the current battery of the user's phone with a battery that has a higher capacity. The focus here is on the specific action of changing to a different battery and the compatibility of using a high capacity battery in the phone. 2. \\"How does phone battery charging work?\\": This question is about the process of charging a phone's battery – how the battery gets replenished with energy when connected to a power source.

This article: Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the subject whose identification with the cathedral itself is emphasized by her monumental stature?, what is it ?

More funds were also put towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, possibly because the Canadian populace had come to perceive the CAF as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers, as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence. The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Question: Analyze the key challenges and goals faced by the Canadian Armed Forces during the implementation of the Canada First Defence Strategy in 2008. Consider factors such as equipment modernization, training, recruitment, public perception, and retention of existing members. Answer: The Canadian Armed Forces faced several challenges and goals during the implementation of the Canada First Defence Strategy in 2008. Among these were modernizing equipment, improving training and readiness, and establishing the Canadian Special Operations Regiment. The government also focused on addressing recruitment, which had dwindled in the 1980s and '90s, possibly due to the Canadian public perceiving the armed forces as peacekeepers rather than soldiers. A 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence revealed that nearly two-thirds of Canadians supported the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan and believed the military should be stronger. However, they also felt that the purpose of the armed forces should shift towards responding to natural disasters. Furthermore, Chief of Defence Staff, Walter Natynczyk, discussed the challenges related to retention of existing military members.

(CNN) -- A monument to communism, the Palace of Culture and Science dominates Warsaw's skyline. But soon the city's most prominent piece of architecture, a \\"gift\\" from Josef Stalin in the 1950s, will be joined by a building that will reflect the spirit of 21st century Poland. Designed by Daniel Libeskind, Zlota 44 is the star architect's first project in the country of his birth. Currently under construction the 54-story luxury apartment building that is supposed to resemble an eagle, Poland's nation symbol, is situated opposite the Palace of Culture and Science and close to one of the city's few synagogues that survived the Second World War. Libeskind left","output":"Poland when he was a young child, and the opportunity to design a building in his homeland holds particular significance and emotional weight for him. As an internationally renowned architect, he has left his mark on cityscapes around the world, with iconic works such as the Jewish Museum in Berlin and the master plan for the rebuilt World Trade Center in New York City. In returning to Poland, Libeskind aims to create not only a visually stunning addition to Warsaw's skyline, but also a powerful symbol of the nation's resilience and growth. Zlota 44's design, with its inspirations drawn from the Polish eagle, embodies both the rich history and traditions of the country, as well as its ambitious and optimistic vision for the future. The striking, contemporary form stands in deliberate contrast to the austere, monolithic structure that is the Palace of Culture and Science, highlighting Poland's transformation from its Soviet-dominated past into a modern, economically vibrant, and culturally diverse nation. The decision to place Zlota 44 near one of Warsaw's surviving synagogues represents a nod to Poland's Jewish heritage and the resiliency of the Jewish community in the face of great adversity during the Second World War. For Libeskind, who was born to a Jewish family in post-war Poland, the project's proximity to this significant historical site further underscores the personal connection he feels in realizing his architectural vision within the city. Construction of Zlota 44 has faced some challenges, including financial setbacks, regulatory hurdles, and concerns about its impact on the surrounding environment. However, these obstacles have only served to galvanize the determination of the project's supporters, who view the tower not only as an architectural marvel but also as a potent symbol of perseverance. Once completed, Zlota 44 will boast luxurious living spaces, state-of-the-art amenities, and breathtaking panoramic views of the city. The building's ground floor will feature retail and cultural spaces, intended to activate and engage the public and further emphasize the building's connection to the broader urban context. In designing Zlota 44, Daniel Libeskind sought to create a unique architectural statement that would both contribute to Warsaw's rapidly changing urban fabric and provide a meaningful expression of national identity. Through its elegant form and symbolic resonance, Zlota 44 promises to become a lasting testament to the transformative power of modern Polish ambition and the enduring human spirit. It will serve not only as a beacon of progress for the people of Warsaw but also resonate with individuals across the globe seeking to overcome adversity and build a brighter, more inclusive future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Königsberg (until 1946 officially: Königsberg in Preußen) was a city in the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights, the Duchy of Prussia, the Kingdom of Prussia and Germany until 1946. After being largely destroyed in World War II by Allied Forces and then annexed by the Soviet Union thereafter, the city was renamed Kaliningrad, and few traces of the former Königsberg remain today. The literal meaning of Königsberg is 'Kings Mountain'. In the local Low German dialect, spoken by many of its German former inhabitants, the name was \\"Kenigsbarg\\". Further names included , Old Prussian: \\"Kunnegsgarbs, Knigsberg\\", and .  - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital.  - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow.  - An oblast is a type of administrative division of Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and the now-defunct Soviet Union and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The term is analogous to \\"state\\" or \\"province\\".  - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area. Moscow has the status of a Russian federal city.  - The post-Soviet states, also collectively known as the former Soviet Union (FSU) or former Soviet Republics, are the 15 independent states that emerged from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in its dissolution in December 1991, with Russia internationally recognised as the successor state to the Soviet Union. On March 11, 1990, Lithuania was the first to declare its independence, with Estonia and Latvia following suit in August 1991. All three Baltic states claimed continuity from the original states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1944 and were admitted to the United Nations on 17 September 1991. The remaining 12 republics all subsequently seceded. 12 of the 15 states, excluding the Baltic states, initially formed the CIS and most joined CSTO, while the Baltic states focused on European Union and NATO membership.  - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively.

Options：  A. aquarium  B. creek  C. pet store  D. playground  E. pond The answer is:","output":"E. Pond A detailed and long answer to support the selection of this option is as follows: Several factors lead us to believe that option E, the pond, is the most suitable answer to the question. A goldfish is a type of freshwater fish, and ponds are common places where they can be found, either in their natural environment or within ornamental ponds in gardens, parks, and other public areas. Additionally, these ponds often provide the ideal environment for goldfish to thrive, as they contain ample space, natural water sources, and a diverse ecosystem. The four other options, while possible, have their own limitations or lower probability of being the place where a colorful pebble falls on a goldfish: A. Aquarium: An aquarium could be a plausible answer, as goldfish are often found living in aquariums as pets. However, the question's phrasing hints that the pebble is a naturally occurring, colorful pebble, which would be more likely to be found in a pond. Furthermore, aquarium owners are more likely to use specific substrate materials, such as gravel and sand, rather than colorful pebbles. B. Creek: Although goldfish could potentially live in a creek, creeks often contain faster-moving, colder water than ponds, which is generally less suitable for goldfish. This makes finding both a colorful pebble and a goldfish in the same creek environment less likely. C. Pet store: A pet store may indeed have goldfish and colorful pebbles, but the likelihood of a pebble accidentally falling on a goldfish is relatively low. Pet stores usually keep fish in carefully maintained tanks with filtration systems, and it would be unusual for stores to have loose, colorful pebbles that are not already contained within fish tanks or decorative displays. D. Playground: Playgrounds are not natural habitats for goldfish, as they are human-made environments where children play. While it is possible that a goldfish might temporarily be present in a fountain or ornamental fixture within a playground, the likelihood of encountering both a colorful pebble and goldfish in this setting is very low. By analyzing the given options, it becomes clear that option E, the pond, is the most likely answer to the question. A pond provides an ideal location for goldfish and is a more natural setting for the occurrence of colorful pebbles. This combination of elements makes it the most suitable place for the pebble to fall on a goldfish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Select from: 1. no. 2. yes.","output":"1. No. The two questions you asked are related, but they are not paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase restates the same information in a different way. It's sort of like translating a sentence into a different format while keeping the core meaning intact. Here, the first question specifically asks how to write an argumentative paragraph, which is a type of literary practice aiming to convince the reader about a certain point of view. The second question, on the other hand, generally asks about paragraph writing— a broader term that entails writing a distinct section in a text that discusses a particular point or idea, which can be of various types like descriptive, narrative, argumentative, expository, and more. Let's elaborate these two distinctly: 1. **How to write an argumentative paragraph?** To write an argumentative paragraph, you must follow a specific format and adhere to certain guidelines. - **Identify your topic:** Choose a debatable issue, something that different people could argue about or see in different ways.  - **State your position:** Start the paragraph strongly by stating your position. This can be done in the topic sentence, which sets the tone for the rest of the paragraph. - **Support your position:** Use evidence to back up your viewpoint. This evidence could be based on research or personal opinion, but it needs to be solid and convincing. Examples, statistics, facts, quotes from experts can serve as your evidence. - **Explain your evidence:** This is where you interpret the evidence and explain how it supports your viewpoint.  - **Refute opposing arguments:** After presenting your argument, acknowledge the opposing side and refute their arguments. Show why your perspective is more valid. - **Conclude:** Restate your standpoint and summarize the main points of your argument without merely repeating the initial sentences.  2. **What is paragraph writing?** Paragraph writing is the practice of organizing ideas into a self-contained group of sentences that centers around a single topic or idea. A paragraph typically consists of three main parts: - **Topic sentence:** It states the main idea of the paragraph. It tells the reader what to expect from the rest of the paragraph. - **Supporting Sentences:** These describe, explain, or support the main idea stated in the topic sentence. They can include facts, statistics, quotations, examples, explanations, and other details. - **Concluding Sentence:** It sums up the paragraph, emphasizing the significance of the information in the paragraph, and often provides a transition to the next paragraph. Now, while argumentative paragraph writing can be a subset of paragraph writing, it is not accurate to say that the two questions are paraphrases of each other. They are asking about different features within the practice of writing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).  The discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted for the bulk of the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors. 1.

The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).  - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.  - The Übermensch (German for \\"Overman, Superman, Superhuman, Hyperman, Hyperhuman\\") is a concept in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. In his 1883 book \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\", Nietzsche has his character Zarathustra posit the Übermensch as a goal for humanity to set for itself. It is a work of philosophical allegory, with a structural similarity to the Gathas of Zoroaster/Zarathustra.  - A polemic is contentious rhetoric that is intended to support a specific position.

The record store sold more CDs than vinyl records because","output":"the digital format had gained considerable popularity among the music enthusiasts due to its convenience, accessibility, and affordability, making it more appealing to them in various aspects such as storage, durability, and versatility. As CD technology gained traction, it revolutionized the way people consumed music by offering a plethora of advantages, which eventually led to its dominance within the industry.  Firstly, the compact disc represented a massive leap forward in terms of sound quality, which turned out to be a decisive factor for those who sought immersive listening experiences without the limitations posed by analog formats. CDs enabled listeners to access crystal-clear audio without any interference from external factors such as dust or mechanical wear, which were common issues with vinyl records. This marked improvement in quality played a significant part in making CDs the preferred choice for avid music fans who were eager to explore the full potential offered by high fidelity sound technology. Next, the physical dimensions of CDs made them a more practical solution for both consumers and manufacturers. CDs were significantly smaller and lighter than vinyl records, occupying less space, and simplifying the logistics related to storage and transportation. This made it easier for individuals to carry and maintain sizeable music collections without facing any major constraints in terms of available space. In addition, the reduced physical footprint of CDs translated into more affordable production costs, which ultimately contributed to the lower retail prices and increased sales figures when compared to its vinyl counterparts. Moreover, CDs were a more durable and robust medium than vinyl records, which were quite susceptible to damage due to mishandling or fluctuations in temperature and humidity. The inherent vulnerability of vinyl impaired its longevity, and posed serious challenges for users who were required to adhere to stringent storage guidelines in order to preserve the quality of their music library. On the other hand, CDs were much more resilient to such perturbations, and could withstand the test of time without any discernible loss in performance. This made it a more attractive proposition for purchasers who sought long-term value and reliability when investing in their favorite albums. Furthermore, the digital nature of compact discs offered increased versatility and compatibility with various types of playback devices on the market. At the height of the CD era, users could easily migrate their music collection across an array of players, ranging from standalone home-based systems, portable audio devices, and even in-car entertainment solutions. This seamless integration created a level of convenience that was absent with vinyl records, as customers could now enjoy their tunes on multiple platforms without being burdened by the constraints imposed by the analog medium. In conclusion, the factors contributing to the higher number of CDs sold in comparison to vinyl records at the record store primarily revolved around the benefits of the digital format, which encompassed attributes like superior sound quality, compact size, enhanced durability, and increased compatibility across various devices. These advantages presented a value proposition that was difficult to ignore, and as a result, ushered in a new chapter in the history of music consumption, where compact discs reigned supreme as the preferred mode of enjoying one's favorite tunes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As you may recall, WestLB experienced financial difficulties during the worldwide economic crisis, with the European Commission ordering its restructuring in 2012. Subsequently, the bank underwent significant transformations, which led to the establishment of two separate entities, Portigon AG and ERGO Trust GmbH, to consolidate the operations. This event had a profound impact on the financial competitive landscape, and I want to ensure that you are informed of the latest details concerning these entities. Portigon AG now performs most of the former roles of WestLB's financial services, excluding the banking operations. This company provides a wide range of services, including risk management, IT services, real estate management, and back-office support. Despite operating on a relatively smaller scale than before, Portigon AG still prioritizes service quality and client satisfaction, sharply focusing on meeting the current needs and mitigating risks while considering future industry trends. ERGO Trust GmbH, on the other hand, has taken a more specialized stance in the banking sector. It is responsible for managing the assets of the former WestLB, particularly the NRW.BANK, which acts as Northern Westphalia's development bank. A state-owned entity, it channels financial resources into valuable projects and initiatives such as urban and rural development, environmental programs, infrastructure, and technological innovation. This approach puts ERGO Trust GmbH in a unique position to foster regional growth and expand opportunities across numerous sectors. Now that you are up-to-date with the current state of affairs, I would like to invite you to participate in the upcoming webinar session \\"Embracing the Future: Opportunities with Portigon AG and ERGO Trust GmbH\\". The purpose of this virtual event is to explore and discuss the possibilities for collaboration between your organization and both Portigon AG and ERGO Trust GmbH to capitalize on their respective strengths and services. Our expert panel will also provide insights on the most promising sectors for growth and investment in the region, outlining the policy framework that supports these initiatives. The webinar will take place on [Date] at [Time] and will last approximately [Length]. Attendance is free of charge, so I highly encourage you to share this invitation with your colleagues and peers who might benefit from the discussion.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, child labour began to decline in industrialised societies due to regulation and economic factors. The regulation of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial revolution. The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was passed in 1803. As early as 1802 and 1819 Factory Acts were passed to regulate the working hours of workhouse children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the \\"Short Time Committees\\" in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11–18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9–11 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in 1847 limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days. Lord Shaftesbury was an outspoken advocate of regulating child labour. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): In the 19th century was there an increase or decreased need to child labour?","output":"In the 19th century, there was a decrease in the need for child labor.

American researchers have put together a 700-year record of the rainy seasons, which is expected to provide guidance for experts making weather predictions. Every year, damp air masses,known as monsoon,produce large amounts of rainfall in India, East Asia, Northern Australia and East Africa. All this wet air is pulled in by a high pressure area over the Indian Ocean and a low pressure area to the south. According to Edward Cook , a weather expert at Columbia University in New York., the complex nature of the climate systems across Asia makes monsoons hard to predict. In addition, climate records for the area are too recent and not detailed enough to be of much use. Therefore, he and a team of researchers spent more than fifteen years traveling across Asia, looking for trees old enough to provide long-term records. They measured the rings, or circles, inside thousands of ancient trees in more than 300 places. Rainfall has a direct link to the growth and width of rings on some kinds of trees. The researchers developed a document they are calling a Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas. It shows the effect of monsoons over seven centuries, beginning in the 1300s. Professor Cook says the tree-ring records show periods of wet and dry weather. \\"If the monsoon basically fails or is a very weak one, the trees affected by monsoons at that location might put on a very narrow ring. But if the monsoon is very strong, the trees affected by that monsoon might put on a wide ring for that year. So, the wide and narrow ring widths of the chronology that we developed in Asia provide us with a measure of monsoon variability.\\" With all this information, researchers say they can begin to improve computer climate models for predicting the behavior of monsoons. \\"There has been widespread famine and starvation and human dying in the past in large droughts. And on the other hand, if the monsoon is particularly heavy, it can cause extensive...

Answer: A huge difference exists between, on the one hand, well established disciplines that exist in almost all universities all over the world, have a long history, and have a well established set of journals and conferences, and, on the other hand, suggestions for new fields supported only by few universities and publications. Question: what is a discipline of study Answer:","output":"A discipline of study, also known as an academic discipline or field of study, is a specific area of knowledge or learning that encompasses a specific subject area or branch of knowledge. Disciplines are usually defined and recognized by the academic institutions in which they are taught and by the scholarly community at large. They are typically characterized by their subject matter, methods of study, and the theories that underpin them. Established academic disciplines often have their own departments, courses, degree programs, research publications, conferences, and professional associations. They usually have a long history and are widely recognized by universities and researchers across the world. Examples of such academic disciplines include biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, history, literature, and psychology. On the other hand, there are emerging disciplines or interdisciplinary fields that may be supported by only a few universities and publications. These fields often combine elements from multiple traditional disciplines, leading to the development of new methods and theories. Examples of such interdisciplinary fields include bioinformatics, cognitive science, and environmental science. In summary, a discipline of study refers to a specific area of knowledge or learning that is recognized and taught within the academic community.

S., China, Israel, and a crowd of private companies plan to set up camp on the moon. So if and when they plant a flag, does _ give them property rights? A NASA working group hosted a discussion this week to ask: Who owns the moon? The answer, of course, is no use. The Outer Space Treaty, the international signed by more than 100 countries, states that the moon and other celestial bodies   are the province of all mankind. No doubt that would annoy all of the people throughout the ages, like monks from the Middle Ages, who have tried to claim the moon was theirs. But ownership is different from property rights. People who rent apartments, for example, don't own where they live, but they still hold rights. So with all of the upcoming missions   to visit the moon and beyond, space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush. \\" This is a very relevant discussion right now. We've got this wave of new lunar missions from around the world,\\" said William Marshall, a scientist in the small-spacecraft office at NASA, but who spoke this week at an event hosted by NASA's Co Lab, a collaborative  public-private working group. He was speaking from his personal interest and not on behalf of the agency. To be sure, the United States aims to send astronauts back to the moon by as early as 2015, in a mission that would include a long-term settlement. China and Israel, among others, are also working on lunar projects. And for the first time, several private groups are building spacecraft to land on the moon in an attempt to win millions of dollars in the Google Lunar X Prize. Some participants say that they plan to gain some property rights in the mission.

Felicia was going on a trip to Japan and asked Elena how to fit in because","output":"Elena had been living there for the past five years. Elena happily agreed to share her knowledge and experience with her friend. Elena started by explaining the cultural norms and etiquette in Japan to Felicia. She emphasized the importance of being polite and respectful as these are highly valued traits in Japanese society. \\"In Japan,\\" Elena said, \\"it's crucial to show respect to others in your actions and speech. It's simple actions like bowing when you meet someone, saying 'itoashimasu’ before starting a meal, and ‘gochisosama deshita’ at the end of a meal, or thankfully accepting change with both hands at a store that can make a huge difference in how you're perceived. Using honorific titles like 'san', 'kun', or 'sama' after someone's name is also important. It indicates respect and acknowledgment.\\" Next, Elena emphasized the role of intricate customs tied to specific situations. For instance, she mentioned the tradition of taking one's shoes off before entering a home or certain traditional establishments. \\"You'll notice a change in the floor level,\\" she explained, \\"That's your cue to remove your shoes. And remember to wear nice socks as your feet may be exposed!\\" She also talked about the bathhouse etiquette which includes washing thoroughly before entering the onsen and avoiding the use of mobile phones or loud conversations that could disrupt the serenity. Elena also talked about punctuality, stating that it is highly prized in Japan. \\"Trains, meetings, appointments—all follow a strict timeline,\\" she said, \\"Being late is seen as a lack of respect for others' time. Always plan to arrive at least ten minutes ahead of schedule—just to be safe.\\" She then moved on to discuss the societal norms. \\"Don't stick your chopsticks straight into a bowl of rice,\\" warned Elena, \\"This is something you do at a funeral and is considered very disrespectful if done casually. Also, avoid blowing your nose in public. It's seen as a private act and could earn you some odd stares.\\"  Elena also advised Felicia on clothing standards. According to Elena, the Japanese prefer a more conservative dressing style. \\"Avoid revealing clothes,\\" she said, \\"Especially in religious locations like temples.\\" Lastly, Elena advised Felicia on the importance of understanding the language, even if it's just basic conversational phrases or greetings. Although English is taught in schools, not every Japanese will be fluent or confident in it. \\"Knowing even basic phrases like 'Sumimasen' (excuse me), 'Arigatō gozaimasu' (thank you), 'Ohayō gozaimasu' (good morning), 'Konbanwa' (good evening) can be extremely helpful,\\" said Elena. \\"Also, if you can, learn to read the two primary alphabets, Hiragana and Katakana. Many key signs, menus, and directions are written in these scripts.\\" Elena concluded her advice by wishing Felicia an enriching trip, \\"Japan is a beautiful country, Felicia, with a deep, complex, and fascinating culture. It may seem a bit daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll begin to appreciate the subtleties even more. Remember, it's all about respect, politeness, empathy, and understanding.\\" Felicia thanked Elena for her valuable advice and felt much more prepared and excited about her upcoming journey to Japan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A British climber was killed by a falling rock on El Capitan on Sunday, the second death reported over the weekend at Yosemite National Park, officials said.      Felix Joseph Kiernan, 28, of London was climbing the east buttress of El Capitan with a partner about 600 feet up the route when a loose block of granite dislodged, park spokeswoman Kari Cobb said. The rock was about 1 foot across and 2 feet wide and fell about 150 feet before it hit Kiernan.      A second climbing party below Kiernan called the Yosemite Emergency Communication Center on a cellphone around 2 p.m. to report the accident. Rangers and Yosemite Search and Rescue personnel climbed up the popular route to get Kiernan, his partner and the other climbers, Cobb said.      The crews reached Kiernan's body at about 4 p.m. and brought it to Yosemite Valley via helicopter. The other climbers also were taken off the granite monolith.      On Saturday afternoon, 19-year-old Aleh Kalman of Sacramento is presumed to have died after being swept off the Nevada Fall, Cobb said.      Kalman was hiking the Mist Trail with a church group when he swam into the Merced River, witnesses told park rangers. He was about 150 feet from the cliff when he was swept away by the current and over the edge.      His body has not been recovered, and on Monday park rangers decided to scale back search efforts because of rising water levels at the base of the fall, park spokesman Scott Gediman said.      Gediman said the high water levels that make it treacherous for search and rescue workers are expected to continue over the next several days.      The weekend's deaths are the third and fourth accidental deaths at the park this year, he said. The park averages 12 to 15 deaths a year.      \\"Yosemite is a wild place, and we want our visitors to enjoy the park but they also need to make good decisions,\\" Gediman said.      The reporter can be reached at (559) 441-6165 or amoreno@fresnobee.com. ||||| A busy weekend at Yosemite National Park saw rare back-to-back fatalities after a man was swept over a 600-foot waterfall and another was struck by a falling rock while climbing El Capitan, officials said.      Numbers show that accidental deaths at the park are not up overall compared to last year, and officials stressed that two fatalities in one weekend is rare.      \\"It's not very often that this happens,\\" park spokeswoman Kari Cobb said.      PHOTOS: Four seasons in Yosemite      On Saturday, a 19-year-old Sacramento man visiting the park with a church group stopped along the popular Mist Trail for a swim above Nevada fall, officials said. Aleh Kalman reached a rock in the middle of the Merced River — about 150 feet from the edge of the waterfall — and was swimming back toward the bank when he was caught in a current and swept over.      Though Kalman's body has not been recovered, park spokesman Scott Gediman said officials believe it was unlikely he survived the 594-foot drop.      \\"It's almost a 600-foot vertical drop; we do believe it's impossible to survive a fall like that,\\" Gediman said.      The search was scaled back Monday after high water levels made the effort too dangerous to continue, Cobb said.      \\"There's too much water, the wind is too powerful, and the mist is too thick,\\" she said.      On Sunday afternoon, a 28-year-old London man died as he attempted to climb El Capitan, the granite monolith that towers over 3,000 feet above Yosemite Valley. Felix Joseph Kiernan and his climbing partner were about 600 feet up the east buttress when Kiernan's partner stood on a rock and knocked it loose, Cobb said.      The one-foot by two-foot rock fell about 150 feet before it struck Kiernan, officials said. Another climbing party below the pair used a cellphone to call for help, but Kiernan was pronounced dead when rangers reached him about two hours later.      The El Capitan death was the second on the popular climbing spot in as many weeks. A Montana man died May 19 after a rock dislodged and sliced his line, park officials said. Mason Robison, 38, fell about 230 feet before a second line stopped his fall, but was pronounced dead when search-and-rescue teams reached him.      Cobb did not have numbers available for El Capitan fatalities, but said most climbing deaths or injuries result from problems with gear. Rock fall-related incidents are \\"very uncommon,\\" she said.      \\"It doesn't happen every year,\\" she said.      The weekend deaths mark the third and fourth accidental fatalities at the park this year, Cobb said, along with three natural deaths. The park typically sees between 12 and 15 deaths per year, with 7 or 8 considered accidental.      \\"It's definitely hard,\\" Cobb said of the timing. \\"But we look at these as opportunities to teach visitors how to come to Yosemite to be safe.… It really does allow us to get that safety message even further than we would.\\"      kate.mather@latimes.com ||||| Climber killed on Yosemite's El Capitan                              Photo: Michael Maloney, The Chronicle Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Image 1 of 3 El Capitan, Yosemite in morning light.

The two climbers, both from London, were about 600 feet up on the popular East Buttress route around 2 p.m. Sunday when one of the men dislodged the rock, said park spokeswoman Kari Cobb.      The rock, measuring about 1 foot by 2 feet by 2 feet, fell 150 feet and hit the man's climbing partner, Felix Joseph Kiernan.      Other climbers used cell phones to call for help, and rescue crews who ascended the route reached Kiernan around 4 p.m., Cobb said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.      Latest news videos      Kiernan was the second climber killed on El Capitan in less than two weeks. On May 20, a Montana man, 38-year-old Mason Robison, died on a part of the cliff known as the Muir Wall when a chunk of rock to which he was attached cracked loose. Robison fell 230 feet and came to a jerking halt at the end of his haul line.      Kiernan's death was the second tragedy in the park over the weekend. On Saturday, Aleh Kalman, 19, of Sacramento was swept away while swimming in the Merced River upstream of Nevada Fall, which drops 594 feet.      Crews searched the base of the waterfall Saturday and Sunday without finding his body. They called off the operation Monday because of rising waters, Cobb said.      Kalman had been cooling off in the river Saturday afternoon after hiking the Mist Trail with his church group. The river current swept him about 150 feet downstream and over the falls. ||||| A Montana man died in a rock climbing accident as he tried to climb to the top of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, authorities said.      Mason Robison, 38, of Columbia Falls, Mont., was killed after a rock dislodged and severed his rope as he and a partner were about 2,300 feet above the Yosemite Valley floor, Yosemite spokeswoman Kari Cobb said Monday.      The two climbers were about 600 feet from the summit around 9:15 a.m. Sunday when Robison put a piece of gear into what's called a \\"flake,\\" or a deep crack in a large rock that runs along the slope, and it dislodged and severed his line.      Robison fell about 230 feet, with a second line eventually stopping his fall but leaving him dangling and hanging motionless.      A park helicopter flew rangers and search-and-rescue teams to the summit of El Capitan, where rangers, described by Cobb as \\"highly trained\\" in cliff rescues, rappelled down to reach Robison and his climbing partner.      Robison was pronounced at the scene. His partner, who has not been named, was not hurt.      El Capitan is a favorite climbing area for experienced rock climbers. Rising more than 3,000 feet above the valley below, it is the largest monolith of granite in the world, according to Yosemite's website.      Robison's death is the second accidental death at the park this year, Cobb said.      Earlier this month, a 73-year-old Minnesota man died when he apparently fell at the park's Vernal Fall after stopping to take a photo. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A 28-year-old British climber, Felix Joseph Kiernan, was killed by a falling rock on El Capitan at Yosemite National Park.

It also claimed the guidelines would make no difference to wildlife caught up in any future incident. The UK Department of Energy and Climate Change ordered a review of regulations in light of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The resulting Maitland Review was published in December 2011.

Lang Banks, of WWF Scotland, said: \\"While it's only right that oil and gas explorers should be forced to be insured to levels high enough to cover the costs of capping and clean-up, these new rules will do little to prevent future spills. \\"Total's Elgin and Shell's Gannet Alpha platforms were all insured but it still didn't prevent accidents at those facilities. \\"Any level of insurance cover is meaningless to the thousands of marine birds, mammals and other wildlife that would be wiped out by a single deepwater oil spill.\\" He added: \\"The only way to prevent future spills and accidents is to end our addiction to oil, stop giving tax breaks to the oil industry and stop exploration for new oil and gas in dangerous deepwater locations.\\" Summary:","output":"The UK government has announced new guidelines requiring offshore oil and gas firms to demonstrate their financial responsibility for drilling operations before being granted a license.

Background: The Cult are a British rock band formed in 1983. Before settling on their current name in January 1984, the band performed under the name Death Cult, which was an evolution of the name of lead singer Ian Astbury's previous band Southern Death Cult. They gained a dedicated following in the UK in the mid-1980s as a post-punk/gothic rock band, with singles such as \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", before breaking mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s as a hard rock band with singles such as \\"Love Removal Machine\\" and \\"Fire Woman\\". According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the band fuse a \\"heavy metal revivalist\\" sound with the \\"pseudo-mysticism ... of The Doors [and] the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin ... while adding touches of post-punk goth rock\\". Context: In 1991, Astbury and Duffy were writing again for their next album. During the demo recordings, Todd Hoffman and James Kottak played bass and drums respectively. During the actual album recording sessions, Curry was recruited again to play drums, with Charley Drayton on bass, and various other performers. Astbury and Duffy's working relationship had disintegrated by that time, with the two men reportedly rarely even being in the studio together during recording. The resulting album Ceremony was released to mixed responses. The album climbed to US No. 34, but sales were not as impressive as the previous three records, only selling around one million copies worldwide. Only two official singles were released from the record: \\"Wild Hearted Son\\" (UK No. 34, Canada No. 41) and \\"Heart of Soul\\" (UK No. 50), although \\"White\\" was released as a single only in Canada, \\"Sweet Salvation\\" was released as a single (as \\"Dulce Salvacion\\") in Argentina in 1992, and the title track \\"Ceremony\\" was released in Spain.  The Cult's Ceremonial Stomp tour went through Europe in 1991 and North America in 1992. In 1991 the Cult played a show at the Marquee Club in London, which was recorded and released in February 1993, packaged with some vinyl UK copies of their first greatest hits release. Only a handful of CD copies of it were ever manufactured originally, however it was subsequently reissued on CD in 1999. An incomplete bootleg video of this show is also in circulation.  The band were sued by the parents of the Native American boy pictured on the cover of Ceremony, for alleged exploitation and for the unauthorized use of the child's image. This image of the boy is also burned in the video for \\"Wild Hearted Son\\". This lawsuit delayed the release of Ceremony in many countries including South Korea and Thailand, which did not see the record's release until late 1992, and it was unreleased in Turkey until the Cult played several shows in Istanbul in June 1993.  A world tour followed with backing from future Thin Lizzy drummer Michael Lee and bassist Kinley Wolfe, and keyboardist John Sinclair returning one last time, and the Gathering of the Tribes moved to the UK. Here artists such as Pearl Jam performed. The warm-up gig to the show, in a small nightclub, was dedicated to the memory of Nigel Preston, who had died a few weeks earlier at the age of 31. Following the release of the single \\"The Witch\\" (#9 in Australia) and the performance of a song for the 1992 Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie soundtrack entitled \\"Zap City\\", produced by Steve Brown and originally a B-side to \\"Lil' Devil\\", two volumes of remixes of \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", called Sanctuary Mixes MCMXCIII, volumes one and two, and in support of Pure Cult: for Rockers, Ravers, Lovers, and Sinners, a greatest hits compilation which debuted at No. 1 on the British charts and later went to number one in Portugal, Astbury and Duffy fired the \\"backing band\\" and recruited Craig Adams (the Mission) and Scott Garrett for performances across Europe in 1993, with some shows featuring Mike Dimkich on rhythm guitar. This tour marked the first time the band performed in Turkey, Greece, and the Slovak Republic. Question: what was the cult lawsuit? Answer:","output":"The Cult lawsuit was filed by the parents of the Native American boy pictured on the cover of the band's album \\"Ceremony.\\" The lawsuit accused the band of exploitation and unauthorized use of the child's image.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? new york 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief  OPT:  (1). negative  (2). positive","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"New York's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief\\" is positive.  Here's how I arrived at this conclusion: 1. The sentence has two main parts: \\"New York's finest\\" and \\"a nicely understated expression of the grief\\".  2. The phrase \\"New York's finest\\" is typically used to refer to the police department in New York City, and its use here likely refers to something or someone that is considered to be among the best in New York City. Thus, this phrase carries a positive sentiment. 3. The phrase \\"a nicely understated expression of the grief\\" seems to refer to a moderate or restrained expression of grief that the speaker finds effective or appropriate. The word \\"nicely\\" is a positive qualifier, indicating that the speaker approves of this measure of restraint. Therefore, this phrase also has a positive sentiment. Since both key phrases have a positive sentiment, the overall sentiment of the sentence is likewise positive. Hence, the correct option is,  (2). positive"},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What religion is found in the Avesta? Context: The other directly attested Old Iranian dialects are the two forms of Avestan, which take their name from their use in the Avesta, the liturgical texts of indigenous Iranian religion that now goes by the name of Zoroastrianism but in the Avesta itself is simply known as vohu daena (later: behdin). The language of the Avesta is subdivided into two dialects, conventionally known as \\"Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan\\", and \\"Younger Avestan\\". These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region. The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as Rigvedic Sanskrit. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its \\"old\\" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage. Unlike Old Persian, which has Middle Persian as its known successor, Avestan has no clearly identifiable Middle Iranian stage (the effect of Middle Iranian is indistinguishable from effects due to other causes).

Choose from options, is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? We rummaged through the desk for papers. Select from: + unacceptable. + acceptable.","output":"+ acceptable. The sentence \\"We rummaged through the desk for papers.\\" is linguistically acceptable.  In this sentence, the structure, grammar, and word choices are used correctly to convey a clear and meaningful message. Let me break down the sentence structure for a further analysis of its linguistic acceptability: 1. Subject: \\"We\\" - The subject of the sentence refers to the person or people who are performing the action. In this case, \\"we\\" is a pronoun that collectively refers to the speaker and at least one other person participating in the action.  2. Verb: \\"rummaged\\" - The verb in the sentence describes the action being performed by the subject. \\"Rummage\\" is a transitive verb that means to search unsystematically and hastily through a mass or receptacle. Here, it is used in the past tense to indicate that the action has already occurred. 3. Prepositional phrase: \\"through the desk\\" - This phrase provides more information about where the action took place. The preposition \\"through\\" demonstrates a spatial relationship, signifying movement within or by way of the desk.  4. Prepositional phrase: \\"for papers\\" - This last part of the sentence gives further context to the purpose of the action. The preposition \\"for\\" indicates the reason or motive behind the rummaging, which is performed in search of papers.  In summary, the sentence \\"We rummaged through the desk for papers.\\" is linguistically acceptable because it is structured correctly, uses appropriate words for the context, and conveys a clear message."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It spent most of its 21-week chart time bubbling under 100 and 197. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9 of the UK Albums Chart.Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album and controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group ensued. A review in Hit Parader praised the album for \\"probably [having] more a cappella harmony than on any album since the fall of the singing-group era in the late 1950s\\", but that they \\"still like Pet Sounds better\\". NME wrote of the album: \\"By the standards which this group has set itself, it's more than a grade disappointing.\\" Hi Fidelity said: \\"... they are making the psychedelic route ... perhaps in the unforgettable city of Fresno. Until they reach the San Francisco Bay Bridge or return to the shores of Malibu ... their work can only receive partial approval.\\" Rolling Stone referred to it as a \\"disaster\\" and an \\"abortive attempt to match the talents of Lennon and McCartney.\\" On December 14, 1967, the magazine's editor and co-founder Jann Wenner printed an influential article that denounced Wilson's \\"genius\\" label, which he called a \\"promotional shuck\\", and the Beach Boys themselves, which he called \\"one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles\\". He wrote that \\"for some reason, [Smiley Smile] just doesn't make it ... [the songs] just don't move you.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who could not see Ninnis? from the following article ?  On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge. Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet (3.4 m) wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet (46 m), too far for their ropes to reach. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations.

If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you, which seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they can not see it any more, and they believe they were mistaken. However, this mistake happens because the center of the eye, which is very sensitive in daylight, is not as sensitive as the sides of the eye after dark.

Sam decided to get cleaned up in the shower instead of the bath because the","output":"bath takes longer and uses more water. He figured that a shower would be a more efficient and environmentally friendly option for his daily routine. Sam turned on the water, adjusting it to his preferred temperature, and stepped inside the shower. Step 1: Sam gathers all the necessary shower supplies Before starting the shower, Sam collected his shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and a fresh towel. By having everything within reach, he ensured a smoother and more efficient showering experience. Step 2: Sam rinses body and hair Once inside the shower, he let the warm water cascade over his body and hair, relaxing him and allowing any accumulated dirt and sweat to begin loosening. This initial rinse also helped to prepare his hair and skin for the subsequent cleansing stages. Step 3: Sam washes his hair Now that his hair was wet, Sam applied an appropriate amount of shampoo to his palm, lathering it up by rubbing his hands together. He then massaged the lather into his hair and scalp, removing dirt, oil, and any product residue. This step took about 2-3 minutes, during which Sam made sure to cover all areas of his scalp, ensuring a thorough clean. Step 4: Sam rinses off the shampoo Sam then placed his head under the water, allowing the shampoo to wash away. He was careful to keep his eyes closed, protecting them from any soap or water running down his face. He continued rinsing until all traces of shampoo were gone, and his hair felt clean and free of residue. Step 5: Sam conditions his hair Wanting to keep his hair soft and well-nourished, Sam applied conditioner next. Focusing on the mid-lengths and ends of his hair, he distributed the product evenly and gave it a few minutes to penetrate and moisturize the hair shafts. This step is essential for maintaining the health and appearance of one's hair. Step 6: Sam washes his body While the conditioner worked its magic, Sam turned his attention to his body. Using a sponge or loofah, he squeezed a generous amount of body wash onto it and scrubbed his body with gentle, circular motions. This cleansed his skin while also providing a mild exfoliation, removing dead skin cells and leaving his body feeling refreshed and invigorated. Step 7: Sam rinses off Once Sam felt satisfied with the cleanliness of his body, he rinsed off the body wash and went back to rinsing the conditioner from his hair. Thoroughly rinsed and feeling refreshed, he turned off the water, stepped out of the shower, and grabbed his towel. Step 8: Sam dries off Finally, using the clean towel, he patted himself dry, making sure to remove any excess moisture. Drying off properly is crucial, as lingering dampness can lead to skin irritation or fungal infections. In conclusion, Sam opted for a shower as a quicker and more eco-friendly alternative to a bath. By following these steps, he successfully completed his cleansing routine, leaving him feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His work can be found in the National Gallery of Zimbabwe .  - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - Francis Jack \\"Frank\\" McEwen, OBE (19 April 1907  15 January 1994) was an English artist, teacher, and museum administrator. He is best remembered today for his efforts to bring attention to the work of Shona artists in Rhodesia, and for helping to found the National Gallery of Zimbabwe. He was awarded the OBE in 1963.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast.

A country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used.  - Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area.

Summarize this article: The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) is designed to protect against threats from North Korea. The move to begin installing the system comes a day after the North launched four ballistic missiles, breaking international sanctions. But the US-South Korean arrangement has angered many on the Korean peninsula and around the region, including China. South Korean media said operations to install a Thaad battery had begun on Monday, with some parts flown from the US to an air base near Seoul. A statement from the US military confirmed that the \\"first elements\\" of the system had been sent to South Korea. South Korea's Yonhap news agency, quoting a military official, said the system could be operational \\"as early as April\\". Chinese foreign spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday that China opposed the deployment and would \\"resolutely take necessary measures to defend our own security interests\\". What impact will S Korea's expanded missile defence system have? 1. The enemy launches a missile 2. The Thaad radar system detects the launch, which is relayed to command and control 3. Thaad command and control instructs the launch of an interceptor missile 4. The interceptor missile is fired at the enemy projectile 5. The enemy projectile is destroyed in the terminal phase of flight The launcher trucks can hold up to eight interceptor missiles. There is domestic opposition - many South Koreans believe the defence system will itself become a target, endangering people who live around the military sites. Opponents have staged multiple demonstrations. Internationally, both China and Russia have raised concerns, saying the system could affect the regional security balance. Last year, China's foreign minister said the system went \\"far beyond\\" the defence needs of the Korean peninsula. Russia's envoy to Seoul has called it a \\"direct threat\\" to national security. The Thaad system is well-suited to defend South Korean targets against relatively limited range North Korean missiles. But it has no ability to intercept Chinese inter-continental ballistic missiles that target the US. Why then is China so annoyed? What concerns Beijing is the system's powerful X-band radars that can \\"reach\\" far into Chinese territory. The Chinese military worries that these could be used to spot Chinese missile launches and feed the data to cue up other US defensive systems, eg interceptor missiles based in the US, potentially affecting China's deterrent capability. But the US already has powerful radars based in Japan and a Thaad system in Guam. It's not easy to quantify the additional benefit that Thaad radars in South Korea would give the Pentagon. But they will certainly give the South Koreans an important and expanded new layer of defence against missile attack. North Korea threatened last week to fire missiles in response to the start of the Foal Eagle US-South Korean military exercises. The annual drills infuriate the North, which sees them as preparation for an invasion from the South. Then early on Monday, it fired four missiles from the Tongchang-ri region, near the border with China. Three of the projectiles flew some 1,000km (620 miles) and fell into Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The exact type of missile is not yet clear but South Korean officials said they appeared to be an upgraded version of a Scud missile. The US and Japanese leaders held phone discussions after the missile launch and the United Nations Security Council is due to meet on Wednesday in an emergency meeting requested by the US and Japan to discuss the incident. Admiral Harry Harris, commander of the US South Pacific Command, said the launch confirmed \\"the prudence\\" of the decision to deploy Thaad. But the deployment will likely worsen tensions between Seoul and Beijing. In recent days South Korea has accused China of economic retaliation linked to Thaad in areas, including tourism and air travel. There has also been an outpouring of anger by Chinese consumers against the South Korean retailer Lotte, which allowed Thaad to be installed on one of its sites.  Several of Lotte's stores in China have been closed down suddenly. Beijing rejects claims of economic retaliation. Is China retaliating against Lotte missile deal?","output":"The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) is an advanced missile defense system designed to considerably enhance South Korea's defensive capabilities against missile threats emanating from North Korea. The first elements of the Thaad system have been deployed in South Korea, aiming for full operation by April. Thaad's radar system can detect enemy missile launches and respond with an interceptor missile, destroying the enemy projectile during the terminal phase of its flight. However, the deployment of Thaad has raised concerns both within South Korea and internationally. Many South Koreans believe that the presence of the defense system could make military sites targets, putting nearby civilians in danger. Protests and demonstrations have taken place opposing the Thaad system's installation. China and Russia have also expressed concerns about the system's potential impact on regional security. Both countries argue that Thaad goes beyond the defense needs of the Korean peninsula. China objects to the X-band radars, which are capable of detecting missile launches within Chinese territory. The Chinese military is concerned that this information could be relayed to other US defense systems, affecting China's deterrent capability. The US already has powerful radars situated in Japan as well as another Thaad system in Guam. While it is difficult to quantify the advantages the Thaad system in South Korea provides to the Pentagon, it does offer South Korea a new layer of defense against missile attacks. North Korea's recent launch of four ballistic missiles has heightened tensions in the region. Furthermore, the deployment of Thaad has worsened relations between South Korea and China, with South Korea accusing China of economic retaliation in areas such as tourism and air travel. The involvement of South Korean retailer Lotte in allowing Thaad installations on its sites has also led to retaliation from Chinese consumers, with several Lotte stores being closed down in China. Overall, the introduction of the Thaad system in South Korea comes with significant benefits and drawbacks. While it provides an additional defense layer against North Korea's missile threats, it also increases tensions with China and Russia and has caused internal opposition in South Korea. The system's operation could play a critical role in shaping political and security relations in the region, and the potential consequences of its deployment should not be underestimated."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: A four-year-old girl sees three biscuits divided between a stuffed crocodile and a teddy bear.The crocodile gets two; the bear one.\\"Is that fair?\\" asks the experimenter.The girl judges that it is not.\\"How about now?\\" asks the experimenter, breaking the bear's single biscuit in half.The girl cheers up: \\"Oh yes, now it's fair.They both have two.\\" Strangely, children feel very strongly about fairness, even when they hardly understand it. Adults care about fairness too --- but how much? One way to find out is by using the ultimatum   game, created by economist Werner Guth.Jack is given a pile of money and proposes how it should be divided with Jill.Jill can accept Jack's \\"ultimatum\\", otherwise the deal is off, and neither gets anything. Suppose Jack and Jill don't care about fairness, just about accumulating cash.Then Jack can offer Jill as little as he likes and Jill will still accept.After all, a little money is more than no money.But imagine, instead, that Jack and Jill both care only about fairness and that the fairest outcome is equality.Then Jack would offer Jill half the money; and Jill wouldn't accept otherwise. What happens when we ask people to play this game for real? It turns out that people value fairness a lot.Anyone offered less than 20-30% of the money is likely to reject it.Receiving an unfair offers makes us feel sick.Happily, most offers are pretty equitable; indeed, by far the most common is a 50-50 split. But children, and adults, also care about a very different sort of (un)fairness, namely cheating.Think how many games of snakes and ladders have ended in arguments when one child \\"accidentally\\" miscounts her moves and another child objects.But this sense of fairness isn't about equality of outcome: games inevitably have winners and losers.Here, fairness is about playing by the rules. Both fairness-as-equality and fairness-as-no-cheating matter.Which is more important: equality or no-cheating? I think the answer is neither.The national lottery , like other lotteries, certainly doesn't make... Question: Which of the following does fairness-as-no-cheating apply to? Options: A: divisions of housework B: favoritism between children C: banned drugs in sport D: schooling opportunities Answer:","output":"C: banned drugs in sport Explanation: Fairness-as-no-cheating applies to situations where rules must be followed in order to maintain a fair playing field. In the case of banned drugs in sport, cheating occurs when someone uses these drugs to gain an unfair advantage over their competitors. By ensuring that no one uses banned substances, the competition remains fair and within the established rules."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you have anemia caused by an iron deficiency, you need to get more iron in your diet. Men and non-menstruating women need about 10 mg of iron a day. Menstruating women or nursing mothers should have 15 mg of iron a day, while pregnant women need 30 mg. Eat at least 2 to 3 servings of iron-rich foods every day to help get this dosage of iron. Iron-rich foods include:  Red meat, liver, poultry, pork, and fish Spinach, mustard greens, collard greens, Swiss chard, beet greens, all different kinds of lettuce, broccoli, and kale Tofu, soy milk, and other soy products Legumes, such as peas, white beans, red beans, baked bean, chickpeas, and soybeans Dried fruits, such as raisins, apricots, and prunes Prune juice Whole grain cereals and breads that have been iron-fortified Certain foods can cause your body to decrease its iron absorption. If you are trying to up your iron intake, do not drink tea, coffee, or cocoa with your meals because they lower the amount of iron you absorb. You should also not take an iron supplement with your meals. Avoid milk and dairy products for at least an hour after taking iron because the calcium in dairy products may decrease iron absorption. If you are suffering from a vitamin B12 deficiency that is causing your anemia, you need to get more of this nutrient from your diet. You should be getting 2.5 mcg of B12 every day. If you are pregnant, you should get 2.6 mcg per day. If you are nursing, you should be getting 2.8 mcg every day. Eat at least 2 to 3 servings of vitamin B12-rich foods every day to get these daily amounts. Foods rich in vitamin B12 include:  Breakfast cereals fortified with vitamin B12 Beef, liver, poultry, sardines, salmon, tuna, and cod Eggs, milk, yogurt, and cheese Foods with added vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers Deficiencies of folate, another form of vitamin B, can also cause anemia. Men over 13 years old should have 400 mcg of folate per day. Women over 13, pregnant women, and women who are breastfeeding should have 400 to 600 mcg per day. To help with this, you should eat 2 to 3 servings of folate-rich foods every day. These foods include:  Bread, pasta, and rice with added folic acid, which is a form of folate Kale, broccoli, lettuces, spinach, Swiss chard, beet greens, and collard greens Dried beans, such as lentils, black-eyed peas, pinto, garbanzo, and kidney Beef liver Eggs Bananas, oranges, orange juice, and other fruits and fruit juices To make healthy RBCs to keep up your blood supply, your body needs vitamin C. Adults over 19 should get 85 mg of vitamin C per day. Smokers should get an extra 35 mg daily. Vitamin C also enhances iron absorption, so vitamin C-containing foods can be taken with the iron-containing foods to increase your overall absorption. Vitamin C-rich foods include:  Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, lemons, and limes Kiwi fruit, papaya, and pineapple Berries, such as strawberries and raspberries Cantaloupe Vegetables, including broccoli, tomatoes, red peppers, potatoes, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and leafy green vegetables. You should keep track of how much iron, B12, folate, and Vitamin C you get each day. You can do this by keeping track of the serving sizes of the foods you eat and checking online to see how much of each nutrient is in the serving size you eat. You can also determine how much of each nutrient is in the food you eat by using an online Food Advisor, which is a questionnaire that can help determine your overall vitamin and mineral intake. If you find that you can't get enough nutrients from food sources, you can take a supplement to pick up the slack. Try to buy vitamins and minerals derived from organic, whole foods, instead of those that have been chemically synthesized. You can buy supplements for each separate vitamin and mineral, or you can buy a multivitamin that has them all in it.  Make sure any supplement you buy has been tested by an independent lab. It also needs a Seal of Approval from a reputable investigation agency, such as Consumer Labs, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), LabDoor, or the Natural Products Association (NPA).  Always follow your doctor’s instructions and recommendations in regards to supplements. Although these nutrients exist in nature, you can get too much of them. If you are getting too much of them from food and supplements, it can have some adverse effects on your health. For example, there is a condition called hemochromatosis that can be acquired if you are taking too much iron as a supplement. It can be very serious. Once you have been using nutrition for a while, you should get retested to see if your anemia has improved. The general timeline for getting tested again is 6 to 8 weeks. Your doctor may recommend you get retested sooner, so do as they recommend.","output":"Anemia can be improved by increasing iron, vitamin B12, folate, and vitamin C in your diet through iron-rich foods, vitamin B12-rich foods, folate-rich foods, and vitamin C-rich foods, while avoiding certain foods that decrease iron absorption; if needed, consider taking supplements for these nutrients."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film follows two stories, one about the civilians trying to stay alive during the disaster, having to battle both \\"the crazies\\" as well as U.S. soldiers ordered to shoot on sight. The other involves the political and military leaders trying to contain the epidemic. Set in the small town of Evans City, Pennsylvania, the central characters are firefighter David, his girlfriend, nurse Judy, and firefighter Clank. David was a Green Beret and Clank an infantryman, both having served in Vietnam. The town has seen a number of violent events, including arson at a local farm by a demented farmer. Judy and David are very concerned, since Judy is pregnant. Meanwhile, heavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks arrive in town, led by Major Ryder, who takes over the doctor's office where Judy works. Days earlier, an Army plane carrying an untested bioweapon crash-landed in the hills near the town, infecting the water supply with a virus code-named \\"Trixie,\\" causing victims to either die or become homicidally insane. \\"Trixie\\" is highly contagious, with anyone drinking from the Evans City reservoir becoming affected. In Washington D.C., government officials order Colonel Peckem to go to Evans City to help contain the virus, while scientist Dr. Watts arrives to develop a cure before the virus spreads beyond the small town. Officials also deploy bombers armed with nuclear weapons, to destroy the town if necessary.

Pyle, who represents America and its policies in Vietnam, is a CIA operative sent to steer the war according to Americas interests, and is passionately devoted to the ideas of York Harding, an American foreign policy theorist who said that what Vietnam needed was a third player to take the place of both the colonialists and the Vietnamese rebels and restore order. This third player was plainly meant to be America, and so Pyle sets about creating a Third Force against the Viet Minh by using a Vietnamese splinter group headed by corrupt militia leader General Thé (based on the actual Trinh Minh The). His arming of Thé's militia with American weaponry leads to a series of terrorist bombings in Saigon. These bombings, dishonestly blamed on the Communists in order to further American outrage, kill a number of innocent people, including women and children.Meanwhile, Pyle has stolen Fowlers Vietnamese mistress Phuong, promising her marriage and security. When Fowler finds out about Pyle's involvement in the bombings, he takes one definitive action to seal all of their fates. He indirectly agrees to let his assistant, Hinh, and his Communist cohorts confront Pyle; when Pyle tries to flee, Hinh fatally stabs him.

Recognition of financial constraints: The user acknowledges that they don't have enough money, which implies a sense of dissatisfaction with their current financial status. This sentiment highlights the individual's self-awareness and their perception of the importance of money in their life. Lack of financial resources can be disheartening and may curb one's ability to enjoy life to its fullest potential.

Desire for financial stability: When the user states they always have \\"money on their mind,\\" it emphasizes the importance of financial security in their life. This longing for financial stability drives the individual to prioritize and center their thoughts around building up their financial resources.

Aspiration for escapism and relaxation: The user expresses their wish to go on vacation somewhere warm, indicating a desire to escape their current situation – perhaps driven by the stress and monotony of their daily life.

We are big supporters of buying locally and we are here to tell you why it is so important for your family, the community and the environment. The concept of buying locally is simple: buy food produced, grown, or raised as close to your home as possible. Not only will your food be fresher and tastier, but you are helping protect the environment and are supporting businesses within your community and reducing pollution. Better for the environment Sustainability   and global warming are such hot topics at the moment, and many people want to do their bit to help support a healthier environment. Small action carried out by many people can make a big difference. Most materials in an average North American meal have traveled about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate. To cut out a big part of this travel would greatly reduce not only pollution from transportation and refrigeration but also customers' expenses as well. Taste and nutritional content Locally-grown fruits and vegetables are usually sold within 24 hours of being harvested. Because they are picked at the height of ripeness   and travel only a short distance to the market, their freshness, nutrition, and flavor are kept. Produce trucked in from far away may lose both taste and nutritional content.

Warlock is a small Utah mining town of the early 1880s. Cowboys working for Abe McQuown often come into town to shoot the place up, kill on just a whim, beating or humiliating any sheriff who tries to stand up to them. The Citizens' Committee decides to hire Clay Blaisedell, a renowned gunfighter, as town marshal in spite of the misgivings of some, such as old Judge Holloway who insists that the situation should be handled within the law (though a loophole prevents it from being done effectively). Blaisedell, famous for his golden-handled revolvers, arrives in Warlock with his devoted friend, Tom Morgan, his club-footed, right-hand man, who is no slouch with a gun himself. Morgan has a reputation as a heavy-drinking gambler, but Blaisedell insists that Morgan is part of the package. They even take over the local saloon and rename it the \\"French Palace\\" (something they appear to have done in previous towns, since they bring the signboard with them). Their first encounter with McQuown's men is without bloodshed. The cowboys are intimidated by Blaisedell and one, Johnny Gannon, stays behind. Gannon has been put off by their propensity for killing, particularly the shooting of victims in the back, for some time now and resolves to be more law-abiding. Morgan learns that his old flame, Lily Dollar, is coming to town on the stagecoach, and she is accompanied by Bob Nicholson, brother of Big Ben Nicholson, who was recently killed by Blaisedell. Lily had left Morgan for Big Ben and knows that Morgan pushed Ben into challenging Blaisedell, who killed him as a result. She wants Blaisedell dead to punish Morgan. Morgan sets out to meet the stagecoach but it is robbed by some of McQuown's cowboys as he watches from a distance. He takes advantage of the situation to kill Bob Nicholson unseen. Lily arrives in town and sees Morgan there. She believes that he pulled the trigger, although this is based on intuition rather than evidence.

Article: We have entered a new age of embedded , intuitive  computing in which our homes, cars, stores, farms, and factories have the ability to think, sense, understand, and respond to our needs. It's not science fiction, but the dawn of a new age. Most people might not realize it yet, but we are already feeling the impact of what's known as the third wave of computing. In small but significant ways it is helping us live healthier and more secure lives.

Ana tribe lives near the South Pole in Antarctica, while Momu tribe lives in Northern Alaska near the North Pole.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which tribe experienced more ozone depletion?  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the Ana tribe that lives near the South Pole in Antarctica experienced more ozone depletion than the Momu tribe living in Northern Alaska near the North Pole. The paragraph clearly indicates that the loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion is caused by pollutants such as chlorine and bromine gases which are released from aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. As a result of ozone depletion, higher levels of UV radiation reach the Earth, leading to various negative effects on humans and the environment such as increased risks of skin cancers and eye cataracts, disturbance in the nitrogen cycle, killing of plankton, and a disruption in ocean food webs. Although the rate of ozone loss has slowed due to restrictions on pollutants, the ozone layer is still at risk. Since the ozone hole is specifically mentioned to be over Antarctica, it is evident that the Ana tribe living in that region would be affected more by ozone depletion when compared to the Momu tribe living near the North Pole in Alaska. The geographical location of the two tribes substantially influences the difference in the impact of ozone depletion on their respective environments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Giant Octopus Movie plot: Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a sharkâs tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water. A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), who believes it belonged to a Megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago. The duo is visited by Dr. Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao), a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform. The three review a videotape recorded during MacNeilâs submarine voyage, finding images of both the megalodon and a gigantic octopus. MacNeil reflects on the polar ice caps melting due to man-made global warming, and wonders if the creatures are mankindâs âcomeuppanceâ. Meanwhile, a U.S. \\"naval destroyer\\"...

Based on the premise \\"science medical science has prolonged life but they have they haven't really prolonged the quality of it that that's i think that's really the problem they can bring you back bring bring you out of death but they can't\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"There is a lot of money being invested in improving the quality of life in later years.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, it is difficult to make a direct determination whether the hypothesis, \\"there is a lot of money being invested in improving the quality of life in later years,\\" is true or not. The premise states that medical science has prolonged life but not necessarily the quality of life, implying that there are limitations to the advancements made in medical science. To address the hypothesis accurately, we need to examine the ongoing research, allocations of funds, and investor perspectives in the field of medical science and health technology aimed at improving the quality of life in later years. There is evidence suggesting that significant amounts of funding and investment are being directed towards improving the quality of life for aging individuals. Governments, research institutions, and private investors have increasingly recognized the need to direct resources towards research and development in healthcare and medical technologies. The objective of such investment is to enhance the quality of life for individuals as they age, thereby curbing the undesirable implications of diseases and ailments associated with aging. Some examples of areas that attract substantial investment include: 1. Geriatric care and research: Geriatrics is a medical specialty focused on the health and well-being of older adults. With an aging global population, there is increasing recognition of the need for investment in geriatric care, ranging from pharmaceutical development for age-related diseases to research in the prevention and management of common ailments in the elderly. 2. Regenerative medicine: This field explores the potential of regenerating damaged or degenerating tissues and organs, which could lead to significant improvements in the quality of life for individuals suffering from chronic illnesses, disabilities, or age-related conditions. 3. Biotechnology and genetic research: The investigation of genetic factors contributing to the aging process, as well as the development of targeted therapies, can lead to personalized and effective treatments for age-related diseases, thereby improving the quality of later life. 4. Assistive technologies: The development and commercialization of devices and technologies that can assist older adults in performing daily tasks can have a substantial impact on maintaining their independence and quality of life. 5. Funding for aging research institutions: Many governments and private institutions have increased their support for aging research centers and agencies. These investments aim to develop a better understanding of the aging process and translate that knowledge into improved healthcare and quality of life for the elderly. While it is true that advancements in medical science have achieved life extension without necessarily prolonging the quality of life, the hypothesis that a considerable amount of money is being directed towards enhancing the quality of life in later years cannot be dismissed. With the continuous growth of the global aging population and the increasing demand for effective solutions to manage age-related diseases and conditions, it can be posited that substantial funding is being allocated to bridge the gap between life extension and the preservation of a high quality of life for older adults."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write an article based on this summary: The UK voluntary living wage, promoted by the Living Wage Foundation campaign group, is to rise by 20p an hour. Article:","output":"Title: UK Voluntary Living Wage Increases by 20p per Hour Introduction: The United Kingdom's voluntary living wage has seen a recent increase, with a rise of 20 pence per hour. This change has been promoted by the Living Wage Foundation, a campaign group that encourages businesses to pay a fair wage to their workers. 1. What is the UK Voluntary Living Wage? The UK voluntary living wage is an hourly rate that is independently calculated and takes into account the actual cost of living in the UK. This rate is set according to the needs of the workers and their families. It is different from the government's national living wage, which is the legal minimum hourly rate that all employers must pay their workers aged 23 and above. The voluntary living wage, as the name suggests, is not legally binding and comes as a result of the employers' own will to ensure their workers receive a reasonable payment for their work. 2. The Role of the Living Wage Foundation The Living Wage Foundation is a campaign group advocating for a higher wage rate for workers throughout the United Kingdom. The foundation works with businesses of all sizes and sectors to encourage them to implement a voluntary living wage that reflects the cost of living and provides employees with a more comfortable financial situation. By endorsing a socially responsible approach, the foundation aims to raise awareness of the issue and bring about positive change within the business community. 3. The Impact of the Wage Increase The recent 20 pence per hour increase in the voluntary living wage will not only benefit the workers who receive it but also contribute to the overall well-being of the UK economy. Research has shown that when employees are paid a fair wage, they are more likely to feel motivated and engaged in their work, leading to improved performance, loyalty, and retention. The wage increase allows businesses to invest in their staff, which in turn can lead to better customer service, higher productivity levels, and a more loyal workforce. 4. The Benefits for Workers and Employers Alike The benefits of the UK voluntary living wage extend beyond just the employees who are directly affected. Businesses that choose to adopt the voluntary living wage often experience a variety of positive outcomes, including increased staff morale, reduced absenteeism, and a higher retention of skilled workers, thus promoting a more positive and motivated work environment. Moreover, by committing to fair wage practices, employers can create a reputation of being responsible corporate citizens, attracting potential employees and customers who value social responsibility. Conclusion: The recent 20 pence per hour increase in the UK voluntary living wage, as promoted by the Living Wage Foundation, highlights the importance of paying workers fairly and adequately. By adopting these fair wage practices, businesses can create a positive impact on both their employees' livelihoods and the overall economy. It is a sign of progress and an endorsement of responsible corporate citizenship, emphasizing the need for the continuous support of initiatives aimed at improving the working conditions of people in the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The question seems to be asking about the effect of a lesser number of caterpillars forming cocoons on a bigger cake, and how this would influence the second effect mentioned, which is the mixing of ingredients to make the batter. First, it's important to clarify that caterpillars and the process of making a cake are not directly related. Caterpillars forming cocoons is a natural process that occurs in their life cycles, while making a cake is a human activity in the realm of baking and culinary arts. However, if we try to find a connection or analogy between these two concepts, we can say that a decrease in the number of caterpillars forming cocoons could potentially affect the availability of certain ingredients used in making a cake. For example, some caterpillars eat plant parts, and if there are fewer caterpillars, it might lead to a higher availability of plants or plant-based ingredients. This, however, would have a negligible effect on the cake-making process itself, as the core cake ingredients such as flour, sugar, eggs, and water are not directly sourced from caterpillars or affected by the cocoon-forming process. Coming to the second part of the question regarding the supposed perturbation influencing the second effect, which is the mixing of the ingredients. Since the decrease in caterpillars forming cocoons has no direct impact on the availability or quality of the key ingredients for a cake, there would be no effect on the mixing process. The ingredients would still be combined as usual to create the batter, and the overall process of making the cake would remain unchanged. In conclusion, the lesser number of caterpillars forming cocoons would have no effect on the making of a bigger cake nor on the mixing of the ingredients to create the batter. The two processes are unrelated, and the supposed perturbation does not influence the cake-making steps."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If it appears to be hanging, try to look behind it and see a wall. If the mirror seems to be part of the wall itself, there's a good chance it's a two-way mirror, which must be set into the wall rather than hung onto it. That way, people standing on the other side of the wall can observe someone looking in the mirror.  A two-way mirror is a piece of glass coated with a substance called micro pane. If you stand on the treated side, you see your reflection but the untreated side looks like a tinted window. If you see a wall behind the mirror, it's a good bet that it's nothing more than a regular mirror. Look around and determine whether the lighting seems extraordinarily bright. If so, you might be looking at a two-way mirror. However, if the light in the room is relatively dim, and you can't immediately see through the mirror, it's probably just a standard mirror. For a two-way mirror to be effective, the light on the mirrored side needs to be 10 times brighter than the light on the other side. If the lighting is any dimmer, it's possible to see through the glass to the observation area. If you're in a public place and in an area where you'd expect privacy, such as a restroom, it's unlikely and illegal to have a two-way mirror. On the other hand, two-way mirrors are frequently used by law enforcement. For example, two-way mirrors are used in interrogation rooms and for lineups.  The use of two-way mirrors is closely tied to issues of personal privacy and Constitutional rights. Most states have passed additional legislation preventing the use of two-way mirrors in rest rooms, locker rooms, showers, fitting rooms and hotel rooms. If a location has chosen to use two-way mirrors for surveillance, they are required to post signs that notify you.  Many places, such as gas stations, will use one way metal mirrors because glass mirrors can be destroyed by users. If the mirror in question is metal, then it is not a two-way mirror. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses how to identify two-way mirrors and highlights some key characteristics to distinguish them from standard mirrors. A two-way mirror is a piece of glass coated with micro pane, allowing for one side to be reflective while the other side appears as a tinted window. To determine whether a mirror is two-way, one can observe whether the mirror is part of the wall, assess the lighting conditions, and consider the location and legality of two-way mirror usage. The article also notes that two-way mirrors are often used in law enforcement settings and that certain locations are required to post signs if such mirrors are used for surveillance purposes. Finally, the article mentions that one-way metal mirrors are commonly used in places like gas stations, which are not two-way mirrors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I struggled to sound commanding,\\" let's break it down step by step: Step 1: Identify the context. The context here is someone speaking, specifically asking someone to listen, which indicates that they want to convey something important. Step 2: Understand the intention. The intention of the speaker is to sound commanding or authoritative, which means they want to have control over the situation or assert their influence on the listener. Step 3: Determine the outcome. The speaker struggles to sound commanding or authoritative, which implies they are not entirely successful in achieving their desired tone. Step 4: Make an inference. Since we know the speaker's intention was to sound commanding but struggled to do so, we can infer that they tried to assert control or authority in the conversation. Step 5: Conclude. Based on the steps above, we can reasonably conclude that \\"I tried to sound in charge\\" is an accurate summary of \\"Listen. I struggled to sound commanding.\\" The statement captures the intention of wanting to demonstrate authority while also acknowledging the struggle to achieve that goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6]  Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7]  With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7]  Please answer this question : Which city had less child mortality? The answer to this question is:","output":"City Y likely had less child mortality. City Y's hospital had a good disposal site for biomedical waste, which means that the waste was managed properly, reducing the risk of contamination and the spread of diseases. On the other hand, City X experienced groundwater contamination due to poor biomedical waste management, leading to increased health issues for the population. In addition to causing direct health problems, biomedical waste contamination can also negatively impact living conditions. The blockage of drainage systems caused by solid waste leads to flooding in the streets, as well as mosquito infestations and unpleasant odors. These environmental factors can further contribute to a higher prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems. As mentioned in the hint, a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related to this problem.\\" Since City Y's hospital had a proper biomedical waste disposal site and presumably better sanitation practices, it is reasonable to conclude that City Y experienced less child mortality due to a reduced rate of illness related to improper waste management.

Q:This article: Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, David Geffen's Asylum Records (and Island in the UK), when his contract with Columbia Records expired. On his next album, Planet Waves, he used the Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a tour. The album included two versions of \\"Forever Young\\", which became one of his most popular songs. As one critic described it, the song projected \\"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\\", and Dylan himself commented: \\"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.\\"Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively covers), widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label. In January 1974, Dylan returned to touring after seven years; backed by the Band, he embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts. A live double album, Before the Flood, was on Asylum Records. Soon, according to Clive Davis, Columbia Records sent word they \\"will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold\\". Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves. Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums. After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974. Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In the NME, Nick Kent described \\"the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.\\" In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \\"the record has been made with typical shoddiness.\\" Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements.

Question: suppose there are less dirty dishes happens, how will it affect The cut in the skin is larger.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"Although the question seems a bit disjointed, I believe it's asking about the relationship between the number of dirty dishes and the impact on the cut or wound (whether the cut is larger or smaller). Let's explore each option in detail: A: More The relationship between the number of dirty dishes and the size of the skin wound may not be directly connected. More dirty dishes might indicate a potentially unclean environment where bacteria might be more likely to thrive. However, this does not necessarily mean that the size of the cut or wound would be larger. The size of the cut would depend on the mechanism by which the skin is cut or damaged and the severity of the injury. B: Less Similarly, having fewer dirty dishes might result in a cleaner environment overall and lessen the chance that bacteria may enter the wound. However, just as with the \\"more\\" scenario, this does not necessarily translate to the cut being any smaller. The size of the cut would still depend on the circumstances and severity of the injury. C: No effect The number of dirty dishes by itself likely doesn't have any significant effect on the size of the skin wound. The size of the wound is dependent on factors such as the severity of the injury and how it occurred. Although more dirty dishes might contribute to a potentially unclean environment where bacteria may thrive, this does not mean that the size of the cut or wound would directly and explicitly be affected by the number of dirty dishes. Based on the analysis above, the most logical answer is option C: no effect. The number of dirty dishes does not directly impact the size of the skin wound.

Input: Context: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) that may repair vascular injury are reduced in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We reasoned that EPC number and function may be increased by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells in healthy donors.', 'Sixteen CAD patients had reduced CD34(+)/CD133(+) (0.0224+/-0.0063% versus 0.121+/-0.038% mononuclear cells [MNCs], P<0.01) and CD133(+)/VEGFR-2(+) cells, consistent with EPC phenotype (0.00033+/-0.00015% versus 0.0017+/-0.0006% MNCs, P<0.01), compared with 7 healthy controls. Patients also had fewer clusters of cells in culture, with out-growth consistent with mature endothelial phenotype (2+/-1/well) compared with 16 healthy subjects at high risk (13+/-4/well, P<0.05) or 14 at low risk (22+/-3/well, P<0.001) for CAD. G-CSF 10 microg/kg per day for 5 days increased CD34(+)/CD133(+) cells from 0.5+/-0.2/microL to 59.5+/-10.6/microL and CD133(+)/ VEGFR-2(+) cells from 0.007+/-0.004/microL to 1.9+/-0.6/microL (both P<0.001). Also increased were CD133(+) cells that coexpressed the homing receptor CXCR4 (30.4+/-8.3/microL, P<0.05). Endothelial cell-forming clusters in 10 patients increased to 27+/-9/well after treatment (P<0.05), with a decline to 9+/-4/well at 2 weeks (P=0.06). Answer: Despite reduced EPCs compared with healthy controls, patients with CAD respond to G-CSF with increases in EPC number and homing receptor expression in the circulation and endothelial out-growth in culture. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are reduced in coronary artery disease. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF) administered to patients increased: (1) CD133+/VEGFR-2+ cells consistent with EPC phenotype; (2) CD133+ cells coexpressing the chemokine receptor CXCR4, important for homing of EPCs to ischemic tissue; and (3) endothelial cell-forming clusters in culture. Whether EPCs mobilized into the circulation will be useful for the purpose of initiating vascular growth and myocyte repair in coronary artery disease patients must be tested in clinical trials.

Lestrade, or Mr. Lestrade, is a fictional character appearing in several of the Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Doyle used the name of a friend from his days at the University of Edinburgh, a Saint Lucian medical student, Joseph Alexandre Lestrade. In \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\", Lestrade's first initial is revealed to be G. He is described as \\"a little sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow\\" in \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" and \\"a lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking,\\" in \\"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\\".

Article: Watching bison up close is fascinating, like watching a grass fire about to leap out of control. With their huge, wedge-shaped heads and silver-dollar-size brown eyes, the 2,000-pound animals are symbols of another place and time. More than 100 bison now roam the 30,000-acre American Prairie Reserve in eastern Montana -- the first time they've inhabited that region in a century. Direct descendants of the tens of millions of bison that once populated the Western plains, they represent an epic effort: to restore a piece of America's prairie to the national grandeur that Lewis and Clark extolled two centuries ago. During that famous expedition across the Western states to the Pacific, the two explorers encountered so many bison that they had to wait hours for one herd to pass. In order to protect what's here and reintroduce long-gone wildlife (something the World Wildlife Fund is helping with), the American Prairie Foundation began purchasing land from local ranchers in 2004. It now owns 30,000 acres and has grazing privileges on another 57,000. Its goal over the next 25 years is to assemble three million acres, the largest area of land devoted to wildlife management in the continental United States. Already, herds of elk, deer, and pronghorn antelope roam the grasslands, where visitors can camp, hike, and bike. Cottonwoods and willows are thriving along streams, creating habitats for bobcats, beavers, and other animals. Not everyone shares APF's vision. Some residents of Phillips County (pop. 3,904) worry that the area could become a prairie Disneyland, overcrowded with tourists. But the biggest obstacle is the ranchers themselves, whose cattle compete with prairie dogs and bison for grass and space. \\"People like me have no intention of selling their ranches,\\" says Dale Veseth, who heads the Ranchers Stewardship Alliance of 35 families in Phillips County and whose family has been ranching here since 1886. \\"They've been a labor of love through the generations.\\" Instead, he wants APF to pay or ranchers to raise... Question: What measures have been taken to protect the wildlife by APF? Yes or no, is the answer \\"They have bought large land from farmers for bison to live on.\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the American Prairie Foundation (APF) has indeed taken significant measures to protect and reintroduce wildlife in the region, and one of the main actions has been purchasing land from local ranchers since 2004. They have successfully bought 30,000 acres and secured grazing privileges on another 57,000 acres. Ultimately, APF aims to assemble three million acres over the next 25 years, making it the largest land area devoted to wildlife management in the continental United States. This initiative of acquiring land from farmers and ranchers serves the purpose of providing a natural habitat for bison and other wildlife species to thrive. By creating a protected environment, the American Prairie Reserve can reintroduce bison and various other species, including elk, deer, pronghorn antelope, bobcats, and beavers, alongside ensuring the preservation of native plants like cottonwoods and willows. However, it is essential to note that this endeavor has been met with some resistance from local ranchers, who have a deep-rooted history in the area and are concerned about their livelihood. People like Dale Veseth, who leads the Ranchers Stewardship Alliance, prefer the APF to pay ranchers to raise their cattle alongside APF's conservation efforts rather than purchase their land. Overall, the American Prairie Foundation has made substantial efforts to protect and conserve wildlife by acquiring land from farmers and ranchers for bison and other species to live on. While some opposition exists from local stakeholders, the foundation's mission to restore America's prairie to its once-national grandeur is making notable progress."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: Australian half-back Chris Sandow's exit from Warrington was not a shock, says Wolves head coach Tony Smith. Article:","output":"Title: Warrington Wolves Head Coach Tony Smith Unsurprised by Chris Sandow's Departure Introduction: The departure of Australian half-back Chris Sandow from Warrington Wolves was not surprising, according to the team's head coach, Tony Smith.  Background on Chris Sandow: Chris Sandow, the Australian playmaker, has built a reputation as a talented half-back during his career. He began his professional journey with South Sydney Rabbitohs in the National Rugby League (NRL) before moving to the Parramatta Eels. In 2015, Sandow made his way to the Super League, signing with the Warrington Wolves. His skillful displays on the field have earned him several admirers, but his time with the Wolves has now come to an end. Tony Smith's Perspective: Tony Smith, the head coach of the Warrington Wolves, has stated that Sandow's exit from the club was not unexpected. Smith, who has overseen the team's development and performance since 2009, has extensive experience in the rugby league, both as a player and a coach. Throughout his time at the helm, Smith has managed numerous player departures and arrivals, helping guide the team through periods of transition. Possible Reasons for Sandow's Departure: While neither Sandow nor the Warrington Wolves have revealed specific reasons for the player's departure from the club, there could be several factors at play. It is possible that Sandow has received attractive offers from other clubs, either in the Super League or back home in the NRL. Alternatively, personal reasons or the desire for a new challenge could have influenced his decision to move on. Impact on Warrington Wolves: Chris Sandow's exit from the team will certainly leave a void in the Wolves' half-back position. His experience and skill on the field have been crucial in the team's success in recent years. Nonetheless, the Warrington Wolves have faced similar situations in the past and have proven adept at finding suitable replacements. The team will likely be looking for players who can fill the gap left by Sandow and contribute to the team's continued success in the Super League. Conclusion: In the ever-changing world of professional sports, the departure of a key player like Chris Sandow is not uncommon. Warrington Wolves head coach Tony Smith has acknowledged this reality, expressing a lack of surprise at Sandow's exit from the team. As the Wolves move forward without their accomplished half-back, they will surely adopt a proactive approach in seeking a suitable replacement to help maintain their competitiveness in the league."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? genuinely","output":"The phrase \\"genuinely\\" is a neutral term that could be interpreted in a positive or negative context depending on the situation in which it is used and the accompanying words or phrases. However, it frequently has a positive connotation, as it is used to express authenticity, sincerity, and honesty. The adjective \\"genuine\\" means authentic, not fake or counterfeit, and can be used to describe an object or a person's behavior, emotions, or character. When used as an adverb, \\"genuinely\\" describes the manner in which something is done or the degree to which someone expresses a genuine emotion or intention. In a positive context, \\"genuinely\\" is often associated with honesty, sincerity, and true feelings. For example: 1. He genuinely cares about the wellbeing of his employees. 2. I am genuinely happy for your success. 3. She is genuinely remorseful for her actions. In these cases, \\"genuinely\\" adds weight to the statement by reinforcing the authenticity and credibility of the emotions involved, emphasizing that they are heartfelt and sincere. On the other hand, \\"genuinely\\" could also be used in a negative context, when referring to someone's negative emotions, actions, or beliefs. For example: 1. He is genuinely struggling with his mental health. 2. They were genuinely upset about the outcome of the game. 3. She was genuinely appalled by his behavior. In these cases, \\"genuinely\\" conveys that these emotions, actions, or beliefs are authentic and real. While the overall sentiment of these statements may be deemed negative, the use of \\"genuinely\\" as a descriptor remains neutral. In conclusion, the phrase \\"genuinely\\" is not inherently positive or negative, but can take on a positive or negative connotation based on the context in which it is used and the accompanying words or phrases. It is essential to note the surrounding information to determine the intended tone or implication of the phrase. However, \\"genuinely\\" generally emphasizes sincerity and authenticity, which are typically perceived as positive qualities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Detroit Mayor David Bing called Tuesday's 85 fires in the city a \\"natural disaster\\" and defended the fire department's response. \\"I have ultimate confidence in the Detroit Fire Department,\\" he said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference. \\"I think they've done an outstanding job.\\" Asked whether the department was adequately staffed or had enough equipment Tuesday, Bing said the important thing was that no one was hurt or killed. \\"I don't care how much money you have. When something like this happens, all you can do is respond,\\" he said. Fire Commissioner James Mack Jr. said the department is budgeted for about 500 firefighters, about 20 fewer positions than last year. About 236 firefighters fought Tuesday's fires across much of the city and took no breaks, Mack added. The inferno was a perfect storm, and was aggravated by high winds and downed power lines, the officials said. \\"It just created a firestorm where we had fires,\\" the fire commissioner said, adding that at least eight of the fires were linked to downed power lines and two to arson, though he said those numbers may change. He said response times might have been slow because of the volume of calls and officials having to prioritize the fires, especially if some were at vacant residences. Monday morning quarterbacking of resources is always easy to do, Mack said. \\"I have to balance safety of public and the monies the department has.\\" CNN iReporter Joe Wilk, who recorded video of flames and their charred aftermath Tuesday and Wednesday, said that one fire spread to about 10 homes in an hour. \\"It's pretty tragic. How many people just lost their houses and everything they own?\\" he asked. A woman told him that firefighters didn't arrive for an hour to fight the fire, which also destroyed garages. \\"A lot of these fires were due to high winds and downed wires,\\" said Karen Dumas, a city spokeswoman. \\"We had winds from 30 to 50 mph and have a number of downed power wires,\\" Mack said. \\"We are attributing some of the fires to downed power wires, which makes more fires with the wind being so strong.\\" Mack said that between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., the fire department responded to 140 calls of wires down before the evening outbreak. Fire officials said Wednesday that there were still hot spots and downed power lines in the city. Fire departments in the neighboring towns of Warren, Dearborn and Harper Woods helped Detroit firefighters. Mack said perhaps he should have asked for help earlier. \\"It's a matter of public safety,\\" Dumas said.  \\"We have enough resources to manage our daily demands, but that was an unusual and concentrated number of fires.\\" City officials say they will be communicating with DTE Energy about its response to downed power lines. Bing said he was heartened by the community response. \\"I want to thank the residents who came and did what they needed to do,\\" the mayor said. \\"That's one of the cultural changes we are starting to see here in the city. I think our community understands we are all in this together.\\"","output":"A big fire happened in the city of Detroit, and the mayor, David Bing, said it was like a \\"natural disaster.\\" There were 85 fires in the city, but luckily, no one got hurt or died. The firefighters worked very hard to put out the fires, and even though there were a few less firefighters this year, they still did a great job! The fires started because there were high winds and some power lines fell down. This made the fires spread quickly. Firefighters from nearby towns came to help too.

FBWrapper fulfills its aim to provide a fluid and enjoyable alternative to Facebook's standard app and mobile website with a good deal of style and seamless integration. I would like to emphasize that this is an overall positive review and I would recommend that you give it a try, especially if you're fed up with some of the inconveniences associated with the official Facebook app. The first thing I noticed upon installing the app was its appealing and user-friendly interface. The clearly presented options, smooth swiping motions, and minimalist design of FBWrapper is a breath of fresh air as compared to the clutter and confusion some users may have experienced with other Facebook interfaces. It provides easy access to essential Facebook features such as the newsfeed, messenger, profile, friend requests, and notifications, all within one app, eliminating the need to install separate Facebook or Messenger apps, thus conserving precious storage space on my phone. The app's speed and performance are remarkably impressive. FBWrapper is light on the system, using less storage space and consuming noticeably lower battery resources in comparison to the official Facebook app. Its quick load-time and responsiveness are certainly valuable attributes that allow me to stay connected without compromising my phone's overall operational efficiency. Another feature FBWrapper also offers is respect for user privacy. It offers options to block Facebook's tracking capabilities and prevents the collection of personal information which is an important factor for many users concerned with their online privacy. Additionally, the app allows users to customize the appearance with multiple themes, providing a personalized Facebook browsing experience which is appreciated. However, a few issues prevent me from giving the app a perfect score. In certain instances, I have encountered occasional glitches with the in-app messaging feature which can be mildly irritating. Furthermore, the lack of support for voice and video calls using FBWrapper is a limitation that might cause people to rely on the Facebook Messenger app for these functions. Another niggle I have is that some notification alerts can be slightly delayed, causing me to miss out on information as it happens on Facebook's standard app or browser version. In conclusion, I believe com.danvelazco.fbwrapper is a worthy alternative to Facebook's official app. It features an appealing interface, efficient resource usage, and measures to maintain user privacy. Although there are occasional setbacks with messaging and notifications, the overall benefits outweigh the drawbacks, which is why I'm giving FBWrapper a solid 4 stars out of 5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"if a species is rare, harm to it's population increases or decreases?\\" is \\"pesticides\\", given that  the rarity of a species increases harm to population exponentially? A:","output":"Based on the question statement and your given options of Yes and No, it is apparent that \\"pesticides\\" is not a suitable answer to the question: \\"if a species is rare, does harm to its population increase or decrease?\\" However, I can provide you with an explanation that relates rarity, population harm, and pesticides. In general, when a species is rare, harm to its population can be more significant than it would be for a more abundant species. This is because a smaller population size makes the species more vulnerable to various threats such as habitat loss, disease, predation, and, indeed, pesticides. The rarity of a species may increase the harm to the population exponentially due to various factors such as: 1. Reduced genetic diversity: A smaller population is likely to suffer from reduced genetic diversity, which can exacerbate susceptibility to diseases and other threats, making recovery more difficult. 2. Inbreeding: Rare species with small populations are more likely to experience inbreeding, which can result in a higher likelihood of harmful genetic traits being passed on to future generations. 3. Greater vulnerability to environmental disturbances: A smaller population may be less resilient to sudden changes in their environment, including exposure to pesticides or other toxic substances. 4. Allee effect: The Allee effect is a phenomenon in which the fitness and reproductive success of a species decrease as the population size decreases. This can increase the risk of extinction for rare species. Given these factors, it would be more appropriate to answer the question with \\"Yes\\" or \\"increases,\\" indicating that harm to a rare species' population does indeed increase as a result of their scarcity. However, it's important to remember that every species is unique and other factors, such as the specific threats they face, their reproductive rates, and their ability to adapt, will also play critical roles in determining the level of harm experienced by any given rare species."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Her mother met her father, who was twenty years her senior, at age eighteen, and Carlisle was born nine months later. She was named after her mother's favorite film, Johnny Belinda (1948). Carlisle was the first of seven siblings, with three brothers and three sisters. In 2001, The Go-Go's reunited again and released an album of new material, God Bless The Go-Go's. Green Day's lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong co-wrote the only released single \\"Unforgiven\\".  God Bless The Go-Go's received mixed reviews from critics. Peter Fawthrop of AllMusic wrote \\"Every bit as Go-Go's, that is, as their non-hits and less remarkable material. While The Go-Go's sound is intact, there is not a \\"We Got the Beat\\" or a \\"Head Over Heels\\" to be found. It is feasible that in this age of pop rebirth, The Go-Go's decided it was now or never ... The album doesn't attempt to update the band's sound with hip-hop moves or electronic frippery, for which God should bless 'em, indeed. The girls' hold on the current pop world remains so strong that Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong co-writes a song (\\"Unforgiven\\") in impeccable Go-Go's drag\\".  In spite of the mixed reviews, the album charted in the US Billboard 200, peaking at number No. 57. Around the time of The Go-Go's definitive reunion tour, Carlisle appeared nude for the cover feature and a full pictorial of the August 2001 edition of Playboy.  In 2007, Carlisle released her seventh album, Voila, which was her first full-length solo studio album in more than ten years. The album was produced by John Reynolds and included Brian Eno on keyboards. Consisting of a mix of French pop tunes and chanson standards, including covers of Francoise Hardy and Edith Piaf classics, Voila was released via Rykodisc in the UK on February 5 and in the United States the following day, February 6, 2007.  In early 2009, Carlisle was on the eighth season of Dancing with the Stars, paired with Jonathan Roberts. She was the first star to be eliminated from the competition, on March 17. In October 2009, Carlisle took over the role of Velma Von Tussle in London's West End production of Hairspray at the Shaftesbury Theatre.

Options: - bowling alley - city - military base - fashion show - football game  The answer is \\"bowling alley\\" because A:","output":"A gutter in a bowling alley is a narrow channel on both sides of the bowling lane, which is designed to catch a ball that rolls off the main lane surface. If a bowler accidentally throws the ball too far to the left or right, it can land in this gutter and become unable to hit the pins. By having gutters, a bowling alley prevents a ball from rolling out of control or taking an unintended path, ensuring that the game is played fairly and safely. In contrast to the other options mentioned: - A city mostly refers to an urban area where people live and work. The concept of gutters here usually pertains to the drainage system, which helps in managing water flow to prevent flooding and keep the streets clean. It has nothing to do with preventing a ball from becoming runway. - A military base is a place where military personnel are stationed, trained, and live. It focuses on the defense and security of a nation. Gutters or similar channels are not associated with preventing runaway balls in this context. - A fashion show is an event where designers and models showcase their apparel and accessories, usually on a runway. The main purpose is to display new fashion trends. There is no connection between gutters and preventing a ball from becoming runway in a fashion show. - A football game is a sporting event that takes place on a rectangular field, typically with goalposts at each end.

A: Answer:","output":"The term for any way that an animal interacts with other animals or the environment is known as \\"behavior.\\" Animal behavior encompasses a wide range of activities and interactions that occur between animals and their surroundings, helping them navigate various aspects of their lives, including feeding, mating, communication, social interactions, and survival. Animal behavior is a fascinating field of study that integrates various branches of science, such as biology, psychology, ethology (the scientific study of animal behavior), and ecology. Through closely observing and analyzing animal behavior, scientists strive to understand the intricate ways in which animals adapt to their environment and interact with other living things. There are several types of animal behaviors that researchers commonly study: 1. Innate behavior: These are instinctual, genetically predetermined behaviors that an animal is born with and does not require learning or experience. For example, reflex actions like a frog snapping its tongue to catch a fly or a newborn turtle moving towards the ocean are innate behaviors. 2. Learned behavior: These behaviors are acquired or modified during an animal's lifetime based on experience and interaction with their environment. Learning can result from direct experience (like a dog learning not to pull on its leash), observing other animals (such as young birds learning to sing or hunt from their parents), or conditioning (where an animal learns to associate a stimulus with a certain response). 3. Social behavior: This refers to the interactions between animals of the same species, which can include cooperative behaviors (such as meerkats taking turns watching for predators), complex communication (for example, the elaborate dances and songs of some bird species), altruistic behaviors (actions that benefit other individuals at a possible cost to the performer), and competition for resources or mates. 4. Foraging behavior: This describes the strategies that animals use to find, capture, and consume food. There are various foraging behaviors, ranging from hunting and ambushing prey (as seen in lions or spiders) to grazing (like in cows or sheep) and cooperative hunting (observed in wolves or dolphins). 5. Mating behavior: The complex set of behaviors related to reproduction, including courtship displays, mating rituals, and parental care. Examples include the colorful displays of peacock feathers to attract a mate, the extensive nest-building by some bird species, and the protective instincts of mother mammals towards their offspring. 6. Migration behavior: Many animal species undertake seasonal or periodic journeys over long distances in response to factors such as changes in food availability, temperature, or breeding conditions. Some well-known examples include the annual migration of wildebeest herds across the Serengeti or the incredible journeys undertaken by certain bird species like the Arctic tern, which migrates from the Arctic to the Antarctic each year. In conclusion, the term for any way that an animal interacts with other animals or the environment is \\"behavior,\\" a complex and diverse set of actions and responses that helps animals adapt and thrive in their particular surroundings. By studying animal behavior, researchers can gain valuable insights into the way animals communicate, learn, form social structures, and navigate their environment, contributing to our broader understanding of the natural world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we imagine life without paper or print? Paper was first created about 2,000 years ago, and has been made from silk, cotton, bamboo, and, since the 19th century, from wood. People learned to write words on paper to make a book. But in those days, books could only be produced one at a time by hand. As a result, they were expensive and _ . And because there weren't many books, few people learned to read. Then printing was invented in China.

Use pure cassia powder for blonde, or 80% cassia powder and 20% henna powder for strawberry blonde. Use water to transform the powder into a paste, or if you want an extra lightening effect, orange or lemon juice. Add liquid to the powder a little at a time until its consistency is similar to yogurt. Put the mixture in the refrigerator and let it sit for twelve hours.  Use cassia obovata for blonde or gray hair. If you have gray hairs but the rest of your hair is darker than blonde, cassia obovata alone will only brighten and condition your darker hair, not lighten it to blonde. Use one box (100 grams) of cassia powder for short hair. Use two to three boxes (200-300 grams) of cassia powder for shoulder-length hair. Use four to five boxes (400-500 grams) of cassia powder for long hair. Mix into henna powder three teaspoons of amla powder, one teaspoon of coffee powder, and a little bit of curd or plain yogurt. Stir the ingredients well. Slowly add one to two cups of hot water (not boiling) to the henna paste in a bowl until the paste is thick, not runny. Mix the contents. Close the bowl with a lid or tight plastic wrap. Let it sit for twelve hours to twenty-four hours, unrefrigerated before using it on your hair.  Amla (Indian gooseberry) is nondrying and adds coolness to the red so that it is not quite so bright. You can omit the amla if you want a very vibrant orange-red. Amla volumizes hair as well as enhances texture and curls. Use 100 grams of henna powder for hair up to medium length, or 200 grams of henna for long hair. Henna can be drying, so you may want to add a conditioner to the paste the next morning, such as two to three tablespoons of olive oil and 1/5 cup moisturizing conditioner. Once henna paste has sat for twelve to twenty-four hours, mix in indigo powder well. If the paste is not the consistency of thick yogurt, add warm water little by little until you achieve the right texture. Let the paste sit for fifteen minutes.  If you have short hair, use one box (100 grams) of indigo. If you have shoulder-length hair, use two to three boxes (200-300 grams) of indigo. If you have long hair, use four to five boxes (400 to 500 grams) of indigo. Put gloves on. Section your hair and apply the paste to damp or dry hair with your gloved hands, a pastry brush, or a coloring brush from a beauty supply store. Make sure that you cover all of your hair to the roots. You may find it handy to clip sections of hair back once you've finished coating them.  Henna paste is thick, so don't try to rake it through your hair. Apply the paste to the roots of your hair first, since that is typically where the most hue and processing time is needed. If you have long hair, you may want to pull it up first into a clip. Use plastic wrap or a shower cap to protect the dye.  For red hair, leave the paste on for about four hours. For brown or black hair, leave the paste in your hair for one to six hours. You can check the color by scraping off a little bit of the henna to see the result. When you've reached your desired color, you can rinse off the henna. Wear gloves when you're rinsing out the dye, or it will stain your hands. Use a mild shampoo to wash your hair. You can use moisturizing conditioner afterwards if desired. For red hair, you can dry and style as usual. For black hair, you'll follow this with indigo dye. Add warm water to indigo powder little by little until you achieve a yogurt-like consistency. Mix in one teaspoon of salt per 100 grams of indigo powder. Let the paste sit for fifteen minutes. Apply the paste to damp or dry hair. Wear gloves. Put the paste on in sections, starting at the back of your head and moving forward. Coat the hair thoroughly to the roots.  For short hair, use one box (100 grams) of indigo. For shoulder-length hair, use two to three boxes (200-300 grams) of indigo. For long hair, use four to five boxes (400 to 500 grams) of indigo. Once your hair is saturated with the paste, use a clip or hair pin to put your hair up. Wrap plastic wrap or a shower cap over your head. Let the paste sit in your hair for one to two hours. After one to two hours of processing time, rinse the paste completely out. You can use conditioner if desired. Dry and style your hair as usual.

Thomas Celano (c.1190–c.1260), also known as Thomas of Celano, was an Italian friar, theologian, and writer of the Franciscan Order. He is best known for his two biographies of Saint Francis of Assisi: the First Life, or \\"Vita Prima,\\" and the Second Life, or \\"Vita Secunda.\\" Both biographies provide valuable insights into the life and work of Saint Francis, the founder of the Franciscan Order, and the development of the early Franciscan movement. Born in Celano, Italy, he joined the Franciscan Order in 1215, when the Order was still in its infancy, under the guidance of Saint Francis himself. Thomas soon became one of Francis' closest companions and played a significant role in the development of the Order. He was an eyewitness to many of Francis' miracles, making his biographies of the saint a vital historical resource. Thomas was commissioned to write the First Life of Francis by Pope Gregory IX in 1228, following Francis' canonization. The First Life offers a hagiographic account of the saint's life and adheres to the conventions of the medieval genre. It presents Francis' life chronologically, detailing his early life, conversion, founding of the Franciscan Order, his ministry, miracles, and his death in 1226. Despite its hagiographic approach, it remains an essential source of information about Saint Francis' life and the early years of the Franciscan Order. In 1244, Thomas wrote the Second Life, which includes additional information and anecdotes about the saint that was not present in the First Life. The Second Life was written at the request of the Minister General of the Franciscan Order, Crescentius of Jessi, who was dissatisfied with the First Life's lack of detail about Francis' spiritual life and teachings. In contrast to the First Life, the Second Life explores Francis' spiritual growth and development in greater depth, focusing on the emotional and spiritual aspects of his life, while maintaining the chronological structure. In addition to the biographies of Saint Francis, Thomas was a noted poet and author, credited with composing the renowned \\"Dies Irae\\" hymn, a piece used in both the Roman Catholic and other Christian liturgies. The hymn, which reflects on the Day of Judgment, showcases Thomas' skill as a poet and deep religious thinker.  In conclusion, Thomas Celano was an essential figure within the early Franciscan Order and contributed greatly to our understanding of Saint Francis of Assisi and the early development of the Order. Through his biographies and other writings, Thomas has provided valuable historical resources and insights into the spiritual and communal aspects of the Franciscan movement, which have continued to inspire countless individuals for centuries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the urban hubs that are within 6 miles of the ridge that picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge?  The Metacomet Ridge picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge, beginning on Sugarloaf Mountain and the parallel massif of Mount Toby, 1,269 feet (387 m), the high point of the Metacomet Ridge geography. Both Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby are composed of erosion-resistant sedimentary rock. North of Mount Sugarloaf, the Pocumtuck Ridge continues as alternating sedimentary and traprock dominated strata to Greenfield, Massachusetts. From Greenfield north to 2 miles (3 km) short of the Vermont–New Hampshire–Massachusetts tri-border, the profile of the Metacomet Ridge diminishes into a series of nondescript hills and low, wooded mountain peaks composed of sedimentary rock with dwindling traprock outcrops.In Connecticut, the high point of the Metacomet Ridge is West Peak of the Hanging Hills at 1,024 feet (312 m); in Massachusetts, the highest traprock peak is Mount Tom, 1,202 feet (366 m), although Mount Toby, made of sedimentary rock, is higher. Visually, the Metacomet Ridge is narrowest at Provin Mountain and East Mountain in Massachusetts where it is less than 0.5 miles (1 km) wide; it is widest at Totoket Mountain, over 4 miles (6 km). However, low parallel hills and related strata along much of the range often make the actual geologic breadth of the Metacomet Ridge wider than the more noticeable ridgeline crests, up to 10 miles (16 km) across in some areas. Significant river drainages of the Metacomet Ridge include the Connecticut River and tributaries (Falls River, Deerfield River, Westfield River, Farmington River, Coginchaug River); and, in southern Connecticut, the Quinnipiac River.The Metacomet Ridge is surrounded by rural wooded, agricultural, and suburban landscapes, and is no more than 6 miles (10 km) from a number of urban hubs such as New Haven, Meriden, New Britain, Hartford, and Springfield. Small city centers abutting the ridge include Greenfield, Northampton, Amherst, Holyoke, West Hartford, Farmington, Wallingford, and Hamden. Answer:","output":"The urban hubs that are within 6 miles of the ridge that picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge include New Haven, Meriden, New Britain, Hartford, and Springfield.

Read this and answer the question The Xiongnu, a nomadic steppe confederation, defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior partner, but continued their raids on the Han borders. Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC.

Context: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Rock & Rule Context: This plot is for the original Canadian version of the film. Mok, an aging yet legendary rock musician, is on the search for a very special voice that can unleash a powerful demon from another dimension to fulfill his wish of being immortalized as a musician/Magic Man. After traveling around the world looking for the right voice, he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown, a remote, storm-ravaged village famous for its unique power plant. Meanwhile, at a nightclub, Omar, Angel, Dizzy and Stretch perform in a small rock band. As Angel performs a gentle love ballad to a mostly empty audience, Mok hears her sing and his special ring goes off, and he realizes that Angel has the voice he needs. He invites Angel and the band to his mansion outside of town. Omar goads Mok upon meeting him, annoying Mok enough to suggest the band tries \\"Edison Balls\\"- a modern drug, which Omar and Stretch take, incapacitating them. Dizzy sneaks away. Meanwhile, Mok takes Angel on a stroll through his garden and tries to convince her to join him. Initially unaware of Mok's true intentions, she refuses to abandon her band. Unwilling to admit defeat, Mok kidnaps her and takes his blimp to Nuke York, where his summoning, disguised as a concert, will be performed. After Dizzy snaps his band-mates out of their stupor, the trio find out what happened to Angel and they follow the blimp in a stolen police car. Before they reach Nuke York, they are arrested by a border guard. Meanwhile, Angel attempts to escape with the unwitting help of Cinderella, a sister of Mok's goons.

Question 1: Which book is better for physics- Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick and Walker;Physics by Resnick, Halliday and Krane or Feynman Lectures in physics? Question 2: Which is best book for IIT JEE Physics theory HC Verma or Resnick Halliday or university Physics-Zemanasci? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answer: The best book for learning physics depends on the level of preparation, background knowledge, and specific goals of the reader. To provide a comprehensive and detailed answer to both inquiries, I will analyze each book based on its suitability for physics education and the IIT JEE exam. 1. Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick, and Walker: This book is quite popular among students and teachers alike for its systematic approach to building a strong foundation in physics. It covers both theoretical and experimental aspects of the subject, with a focus on problem-solving skills. The well-structured content is easy to comprehend, making it ideal for students who are new to physics or preparing for competitive exams like the IIT JEE. Furthermore, the book includes numerous examples, illustrations, and supplementary information to enhance the learning experience. 2. Physics by Resnick, Halliday, and Krane: This is another excellent book for physics enthusiasts as it provides a detailed explanation of fundamental concepts and theories. Similar to the Fundamentals of Physics, this book emphasizes the development of problem-solving skills, but it delves deeper into the subject matter. The comprehensive collection of examples and problems make it suitable for students with a strong foundation in physics who are aiming for a deeper understanding. 3. Feynman Lectures in Physics: Written by the renowned physicist Richard P. Feynman, this book is an extraordinary resource for those who are passionate about physics. The lectures adopt an unconventional approach to exploring the subject, weaving in practical examples and thought-provoking discussions rather than focusing solely on mathematical rigor. This feature makes the book an exciting read for students with a strong physics background and a thirst for knowledge. However, because the book may not adhere to traditional exam syllabi, it is less suitable for exam preparation. To answer the first question, a choice between Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick, and Walker; Physics by Resnick, Halliday, and Krane, or Feynman Lectures in Physics depends on the readers' individual needs and backgrounds. For a solid foundation and exam preparation, Fundamentals of Physics is the ideal choice. Physics by Resnick, Halliday, and Krane is appropriate for those desiring a deeper understanding, while Feynman Lectures in Physics is perfect for physics enthusiasts interested in a non-traditional approach to learning the subject. For the second question, I will examine the three mentioned books in the context of IIT JEE Physics theory preparation: 1. HC Verma's Concepts of Physics: This book is specifically designed for IIT JEE exam preparations, making it an excellent choice for students focused on competitive entrance exams. Concepts of Physics covers the syllabus in a targeted manner, presenting both the necessary theories and problem-solving techniques. Moreover, the book offers a plethora of solved examples and practice problems, as well as concise descriptions of the fundamentals. 2. Resnick Halliday's Fundamentals of Physics: While this book provides an in-depth understanding of physics concepts, it may not be specifically tailored to the IIT JEE exam. However, due to its clarity and breadth of coverage, it can still be used as a supplementary resource to enhance understanding and problem-solving skills. 3. University Physics by Zemanaski: As a college-level physics textbook, this book covers fundamental concepts from a more advanced perspective. Although it has a strong focus on practice problems and critical thinking, its alignment with the IIT JEE syllabus might not be ideal. Students preparing for the IIT JEE should consider using University Physics as a supplementary resource for a deeper understanding. In conclusion, the answer to both questions might not be the same. For the first question, students should select the book that best aligns with their goals, background knowledge, and learning preferences. For the second question, HC Verma's Concepts of Physics is the most appropriate choice for IIT JEE Physics theory preparation due to its targeted approach and specific focus on the exam syllabus. However, students can also use the other books mentioned as supplementary resources to gain a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Oh, boy, God bless the 1970's, we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade: The Exorcist, Jaws, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and now, Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world, I mean seriously, this movie scared the heck out of me. My sister had this movie in her VHS collection and I was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money. What the heck? It's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970's version of Toy Story, pretty much down to a key, only this was a thousand times scarier, Disney had Alice in Wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children. Whenever Marcella leaves the room, Raggedy Ann, along with her brother Raggedy Andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life. On Marcella's birthday, a new doll, Babette, arrives from Paris, France to the United States of America. Babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll, but the friendly Raggedy Ann does everything she can to make Babette feel at home. However, the pirate Captain Contagious kidnaps her. Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone. Out in the world outside the nursery, the two meet the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees, a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely. After Raggedy Ann and Andy hitch a ride on the Camel, he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking, runs over the edge of a cliff, into a deep pit. In this pit they encounter the Greedy, who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full. The Raggedys and the Camel narrowly escape being consumed by the Greedy and continue their journey to find Babette and believe me, it just gets weirder from this point on. While this movie was certainly disturbing and I just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie, this was actually pretty creative. Back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it, you can tell that they did that with Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This certainly wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, I just don't know who to recommend it too. As scared as I was, I have to admit I'm glad I watched it, sometimes you need a \\"WTF?!\\" movie to spice up your selection, believe me when I say that Raggedy Ann had no problem in doing just that with me. It's official, that doll is just plain creepy, let's just put it this way, there's a giant caramel river that is eating everything, a king who's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs, a bizarre thing that humiliates Raggedy Ann and her brother, a strange almost incest between Ann and Andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs.

Liberal leader Tony Abbott, who will be prime minister, promised a competent and trustworthy government. Outgoing PM Kevin Rudd earlier admitted defeat and said he would not stand again for the Labor leadership. The main election issues were how to tackle an expected economic slowdown, whether to keep a tax on carbon emissions, and how to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat. Mr Rudd had called the election after defeating Julia Gillard in a leadership challenge in June, amid dismal polling figures that showed Labor on course for a wipe-out. Profile: Tony Abbott Under Mr Rudd, Labor initially saw its figures improve. But Mr Abbott, who enjoyed the strident support of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, then widened the gap again. \\"From today I declare Australia is under new management and Australia is now open for business\\", Mr Abbott told a cheering crowd as he delivered a victory speech. He said that he would put the budget back into surplus, and stop boats bringing migrants from Asia. He added that support for Labor was at its lowest ebb for 100 years, and that the results showed the Australian people would punish anyone who took them for granted. Mr Rudd said he had phoned Mr Abbott and wished him well. \\"I gave it my all but it was not enough for us to win,\\" he said. But he was pleased that Labor was preserved as a \\"viable fighting force for the future\\". Mr Rudd retained his seat in the Brisbane constituency of Griffith but said he would not re-contest the Labor party leadership because the Australian people \\"deserve a fresh start\\". \\"I know that Labor hearts are heavy across the nation tonight. As your Labor leader I accept it as my responsibility,\\" he said. The Australian Election Commission confirmed on its website that the Liberal-National coalition had won 88 seats in the House of Representatives, and Labor 57. Three seats were distributed between three small parties, and there were two seats still to return results. In the previous parliament, Labor relied on the support of independents and the Greens for its minority government, with 71 seats to the coalition's 72. Mr Abbott took on the leadership of the flagging Liberal-National coalition in 2009. A Rhodes scholar who once wanted to be a Roman Catholic priest, Mr Abbott has pledged to repeal both the mining and carbon taxes introduced by Labor. He has also promised a raft of budget cuts, including reducing the foreign aid budget by A4.5bn (4bn; Â£2.6bn). But he says he will fund an expanded paid parental leave scheme. British Prime Minister David Cameron was among the first to congratulate him on the victory, writing on Twitter that \\"it'll be great working with another centre-right leader\\". By Jon DonnisonBBC News, Sydney Labor's six years in power are  emphatically over. Australia's economic growth during difficult global financial times should have played well for an incumbent government. But the economy has begun to slow and Kevin Rudd's Labor party has been  undone by disunity and infighting. The rivalry between Mr Rudd and Julia Gillard which saw the leadership of the party and the country switch back  and forth did not sit well with voters. You sense  from voters that Mr Abbott's victory is not so much a ringing endorsement as a rejection of  Labor. He's a conservative who has promised a tough line on immigration and asylum-seekers. He opposes gay marriage and has been a sceptic on climate      change. Kevin Rudd sold himself as the comeback kid. It didn't work. His  party now faces a period of further introspection. Australia largely avoided the recession that hit the UK and other Western nations thanks to a natural resources boom. But the boom is coming to an end, and Mr Abbott will be charged with managing the transition. Ahead of the polls, his coalition highlighted bitter Labor infighting, seeking to portray itself as the more stable party. And former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke blamed the internal divisions for Labor's defeat. \\"I really believe this was an election that was lost by the government rather than one that was won by the opposition,\\" he said. Julia Gillard, meanwhile, congratulated the Labor candidate who succeeded her in her seat, as she bowed out of politics. The outsider candidates had mixed fortunes at the polls. One of the two undecided seats in the House sees billionaire Clive Palmer, famous for his attempt to build a new version of the Titanic based on the original designs, on course for victory. However, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange missed out on a Senate seat in Victoria, where the final place was claimed by Rick Muir of the Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party. More than 14 million people were registered to vote in Saturday's election. Voting is compulsory in Australia. What is a summary of this text?","output":"In an election, one group of people (called the coalition) won 88 seats and another group (called Labor) won 57 seats in the 150-seat parliament. The leader of the winning group, Tony Abbott, will now be the prime minister of Australia. The old prime minister, Kevin Rudd, admitted that they lost and he won't try to be the leader of the Labor group again. The important topics for the election were about money, taxes, and people coming to Australia to live. People in Australia were not happy with the Labor group because they kept changing their leader, so they voted for the coalition group instead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma. After the age of 65 most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD. In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi. However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long acting beta agonists, and smoking cessation. It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.

The text seems to explain the functionality of a card/mechanic in the game. In English, it translates as:  \\"When you cast a creature spell, put X 1/1 black Thrull creature tokens into play, where X is the converted mana cost of that spell.\\" To elaborate, in the context of the game: \\"When you cast a creature spell\\": This refers to the action of playing a creature card from your hand. Casting a spell involves paying a cost, usually in the form of mana, and the spell (in this context, the creature) taking effect on the game. \\"Put X 1/1 black Thrull creature tokens into play\\": This part is explaining what the card effect does upon casting the creature spell. In this case, you place a number of 1/1 Black Thrull creature tokens on the battlefield. In MTG, tokens are typically creatures which aren't represented by regular cards but are created by spells or abilities. \\"Where X is the converted mana cost of that spell\\": This provides the explanation for the value of X — how many tokens you generate. The \\"converted mana cost\\" (CMC) is a system in MTG that describes the total amount of mana needed to cast a spell. The CMC is calculated by adding up all the symbols in a card's mana cost, regardless of color. Therefore, the number of tokens you get equals the total amount of mana you spent to cast the original creature spell."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Reload the page if the film is choppy or stops loading.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Maximizing Your Online Viewing Experience: Streaming vs. Downloading and Efficient Link Management Introduction With an increasing number of people turning to the internet for their entertainment needs, efficient management of streaming and downloading links is crucial in order to optimize the overall online viewing experience. Despite the vast potential of the digital space, a significant number of users face choppiness and lagging issues due to poor preparation and lack of proper knowledge. This article seeks to explore the differences between streaming and downloading, the importance of setting up multiple links, and the steps to ensure smooth film loading for an uninterrupted experience. I. Understanding Streaming and Downloading When it comes to consuming online media, users have two primary options: streaming or downloading. Understanding the pros and cons of each method is essential for making an informed decision about your viewing preferences. 1. Streaming: This involves the real-time transmission of video or audio content via the internet to the viewer's device. In simple terms, streaming allows the content to start playing immediately without needing to download the full file beforehand. The main advantage of this method is instant access, making it ideal for live events and current content. However, streaming requires a stable and fast internet connection, as the quality of the stream heavily relies on the bandwidth. Additionally, if the viewer loses their connection, the stream may buffer, causing interruption and choppiness. 2. Downloading: When downloading content, the user saves the video or audio files directly onto their device. This method enables offline access and prevents connection-based disruptions. While downloading requires more time to gather the entire file upfront, it generally provides a smoother playback experience. However, it's worth noting that downloading requires more storage space and may come with copyright restrictions or legal implications. II. Setting Up Multiple Links for Enhanced Viewing Utilizing several links can significantly boost your online viewing experience, providing the user with alternative options should one link fail or buffer. Here are some practical reasons and steps for maximizing link efficiency: 1. Diversify your sources: To maximize video quality and minimize lag, opt for different sources or websites with separate servers. This technique reduces the chances of facing a bottleneck due to high traffic or server issues. 2. Use multiple browsers: Opening various links in different browsers helps distribute the load, preventing crashes and improving overall performance. This step is particularly useful if the user's device has limited processing power or RAM. 3. Prioritize your content: If streaming multiple episodes or content simultaneously, prioritize your desired viewing order by allocating more bandwidth and processing power to the top-priority video. This method ensures you receive the best quality for the content you are most interested in. III. Ensuring Smooth Film Loading for Seamless Viewing Nothing dampens the online viewing experience quite like lag or buffering. Consider these steps for ensuring your content loads smoothly and continuously: 1. Allow sufficient time for loading: Give your content ample time to load before starting playback, as this helps diminish the chances of stuttering or buffering. Patience is key, so wait for the buffer bar to make significant progress before hitting play. 2. Monitor your internet connection: Make sure your internet connection is stable and strong. If on Wi-Fi, ensure you are within range for the optimal signal. Additionally, refrain from sharing your connection with multiple devices, as this could decrease bandwidth. 3. Clear cache and temporary files: To enhance browser performance, clear your cache and temporary internet files regularly. This tactic frees up valuable resources, allowing for smoother playback. 4. Reload the page when necessary: If your content becomes choppy or stops loading, refresh the page. Sometimes, reconnecting to the server can resolve streaming issues. Conclusion The digital age has ushered in an era of convenience and instant access to video and audio content. By understanding the differences between streaming and downloading, managing multiple links, and ensuring smooth film loading, you position yourself to optimize your online viewing experience. In turn, this allows for seamless enjoyment of your desired content without the distractions of buffering or lag."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These events help shape her perspective and reinforce the importance of obedience and respect towards parental authority, while also giving her a sense of responsibility. The following is a detailed breakdown of the critical milestones in Young Sasha's journey before she becomes aware of the need to obey her mother. 1. Experiencing the consequences of disobedience: Before Sasha understands the importance of obeying her mother, she may have faced several instances where her lack of obedience led to unfavorable outcomes, such as getting scolded or experiencing negative consequences. These situations make her realize that not following her mother's instructions can lead to unpleasant results. 2. Observing her peers: As Sasha interacts with other children, she sees how her friends and classmates fare when they listen to their parents or guardians. She may observe that those who obey their parents tend to have better relationships and lesser conflicts, and this understanding influences her growing awareness of the value of listening to her mother. 3. Learning the concept of respect: Through various channels such as school, media, or family discussions, Sasha starts to grasp the notion of respect and its importance in maintaining healthy relationships with others, including her parents. She learns that respecting one's parents includes listening to them and following their guidance. 4. Building trust in her mother's wisdom: As Sasha encounters various situations and observes her mother's reactions and guidance, she begins to develop trust in her mother's wisdom and judgment. She starts recognizing that her mother has more experience and knowledge than herself, and it would be beneficial for her to adhere to her mother's advice. 5. Developing a sense of responsibility: As Sasha matures, she develops a sense of responsibility towards herself and her actions. She learns that her decisions have consequences, and it becomes increasingly important to make choices that lead to positive outcomes. This realization fosters her need to heed her mother's instructions as they usually guide her towards making better decisions. 6. Receiving praise and encouragement: Sasha might experience instances where she follows her mother's guidance, and as a result, receives praise and encouragement. These positive reinforcements make her feel good about herself, and she learns to associate obedience with positive feelings and outcomes, further reinforcing her resolve to listen and follow her mother's instructions.

His efforts were frustrated by political turmoil and a devastating drought between 1968 to 1974, in which famine killed thousands of people.

He was a Roman Catholic archbishop, which means he was like a leader who helped people understand and follow the teachings of Jesus. Oscar Romero was very sad because there was a big fight going on in his country from 1980 to 1992 called the civil war. During this time, many people were not happy and were fighting with each other. Even though it was a scary time, Oscar Romero decided to help those who were suffering and spoke up for peace and fairness for everyone.  Sadly, because he was trying to make things better, some people who didn't want change decided to hurt him. In 1980, Oscar Romero was killed while he was praying in a church. Many people in El Salvador and all around the world were very sad because they lost a good and loving friend. However, the story doesn't end there! Many years later, in a big and special celebration, Oscar Romero was beatified. What does that mean? Well, when the Roman Catholic Church beatifies someone, it is like giving them a special award that says they were a very good person and they are now in Heaven with God. This is a big honor for Oscar Romero and his family. The celebration for beatifying Oscar Romero was very important and many people from El Salvador and other countries came to remember him. They said prayers, sang songs, and talked about the good things he did for people. This event made many people happy because they could think of Oscar Romero as someone special in Heaven who's watching over them. And so, even though it's a sad story, the beatification ceremony of Oscar Romero helps us remember that he was a very good man who loved and cared for others.

Sarah's publisher, John Bosload, offers her his country house near Lacoste, France for some rest and relaxation. Sarah takes him up on the offer, hinting that she hopes John may come and visit as well. After becoming comfortable with the run of the spacious, sun-filled house, and meeting the groundskeeper Marcel, Sarah's quietude is disrupted by a young woman claiming to be the publisher's daughter, Julie.

Julie's sex life consists of one-night stands with various oafish men, and a competition of personalities develops between the two women.

What type of thing is the question \\"Who was Jinnah ?\\" asking about?","output":"The question \\"Who was Jinnah?\\" is inquiring about a historical figure, specifically Muhammad Ali Jinnah. This type of question is seeking factual information about a person’s life, achievements, beliefs, and their impact on society or history. In this case, it refers to Jinnah's role in history, particularly as it pertains to the nation of Pakistan. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, often known as Quaid-e-Azam, or 'the great leader,' is central to Pakistan's history. Born in Karachi, British India in 1876, he was an important political figure instrumental in the creation of Pakistan as a separate nation from India in 1947. He was the leader of the All India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's establishment on August 14, 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is commemorated in Pakistan as the Father of the Nation.  His birthday on December 25 is a national holiday in Pakistan invoking a wealth of patriotism. Jinnah worked as a barrister in Bombay after studying law in England and rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the twentieth century. In those early years of political life, Jinnah advocated Hindu-Muslim unity, assisting to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League.  However, he became disillusioned by the Congress party's politics and the rising Hindu-Muslim nationalist conflicts, leaving the party in the 1920s. Jinnah subsequently took charge of the Muslim League and proposed a two-nation theory advocating the creation of a separate Muslim nation. His adamant insistence on safeguarding the rights of Muslims within India eventually led to the demand for a separate nation. Jinnah's leadership, negotiating skills, legal acumen, and political strategy led to the creation of the state of Pakistan on August 14, 1947. Jinnah became the newly formed nation's first Governor-General, providing crucial leadership during the country's volatile early years. Despite severe health issues, he worked tirelessly to establish the government and Constitution for the fledgling state before his death on September 11, 1948. Hence, any question asking \\"Who was Jinnah?\\" is requesting details about this significant historical figure, his life, political career, contributions to Pakistan's founding, and his roles and responsibilities as its leader. Furthermore, it may also be seeking information about his beliefs, values, speeches, or decisions that led to the birth of a new nation, and the impacts of such actions on today's geopolitical landscapes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has issued a statement after a preteen from South Carolina and an elderly couple visiting Boone died from carbon monoxide poisoning in the same hotel room two months apart.      \\"My heartfelt condolences go out to the families and loved ones of Shirley and Daryl Jenkins, and young Jeffrey Williams,\\" said Health Department Secretary Aldona Wos on Sunday.      \\"These deaths were a tragedy that should have never happened. The Department of Health and Human Services is continuing to gather the facts. I have instructed my staff to work with local officials to identify measures to ensure tragedies like this never happen again.\\"      On Friday, a source from the NC Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to WBTV News that Dr. Brent Hall, the pathologist in Boone who performed the autopsies on Daryl and Shirley Jenkins has resigned his post.      Documents uncovered by WBTV News show the NC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner discovered two weeks ago that carbon monoxide poisoning may have killed 72-year-old Shirley Mae Jenkins.      That was seven days before 11-year old Jeffrey Williams died from CO exposure while staying in the same room at the Best Western Hotel in Boone.      According to officials in Raleigh, the results of that test were sent to the pathologist in Watauga County who was investigating the deaths.      We don't know why those results were not passed on to local fire or police investigators.      It's also unclear if the Best Western was notified of the potential danger in room 225.      Tests have now also confirmed Jenkins husband Daryl also died from carbon monoxide poisoning.      State medical officials say a preteen from Rock Hill had high levels of carbon monoxide in his system after he died in a hotel room in Boone last weekend.      The levels are consistent with levels found in an elderly couple who died in the same room at the Best Western Hotel in Boone two months ago.      The results came back late Thursday from the State Medical Examiner's Office.      According to the results, 11-year-old Jeffery Williams had a blood concentration of carbon monoxide was greater than 60 percent. Medical officials noted that these CO levels would have caused the asphyxia, which was noted as Williams' cause of death in his autopsy.      Officials say this level of concentration is consistent with the levels found in both Daryl and Shirley Jenkins, a couple in their 70s who died in the same room back in April.      On Wednesday, state and federal inspectors say they traced the source of a carbon monoxide leak to a pool water heater room directly under room 225, where Williams and the Jenkins died.      Fire investigators say the exhaust was being pulled back into the room from a wall mounted vent for the room's HVAC unit.      They also said the ventilation system had several deficiencies as well as corrosion.      According to investigators, Williams body was found Saturday. Jeffrey's mother, 49-year-old Jeannie Williams, was taken to the hospital for treatment.      During the emergency medical response, a presumptive test indicated an elevated level of carbon monoxide in the room, officials told WBTV.      The hotel was evacuated and assistance was requested from North Carolina Emergency Management and the North Carolina Public Health Preparedness and Response Branch.      Samples from Williams were sent to the Office of the State Medical Examiner for toxicological analysis.      Investigators say the bodies of Daryl and Shirley Jenkins were found in the same room back on April 16.      Family members say they waited weeks for test results to come back, but on Monday confirmed that the Jenkins, who were in their early 70's, died from carbon monoxide toxicity.      The couple was visiting from Washington, family members say, and were in Boone for a family reunion.      Family members say if the tests hadn't taken so long, the problem that caused their deaths could have been fixed or the room remained closed so no one, including the boy who died, could stay there.      Investigators said they had been requesting the results from the State Medical Examiner's office for weeks but got no response.      State inspectors arrived at the hotel on Wednesday morning around 10 a.m.      According to documents from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, the pool permit was suspended on March 6. One problem listed in the report was that the chemical/equipment room was required to have natural cross ventilation or forced air ventilation.      \\"This needs to be corrected ASAP,\\" the report states. WBTV has learned that the pool permit has since been re-instated, but can find no records of the problem being fixed.      By pure coincidence, the same health inspector who inspected the pool on March 6th, was at the hotel when the elderly couple was found and helped perform CPR.      Beth Lovette, the director of the Appalachian Regional Health District office said Tuesday when her inspectors looked at that pool room they were only concerned about the pool chemicals.      Lovette said her inspector did not look at any appliances in the room and did not check about combustible or poisonous gases that may be coming from that equipment. That was not part of the health department inspector's duties, she said.      The heater in question hasn't been inspected since the hotel was built in 2000.      Officials say there is nothing that requires the heater to be reinspected, but state licensing experts and one from the consumer product safety commission are looking at it now      Though the report was dated March 6, 2013, health officials could not say if the ventilation work was ever done. \\"We have not received any paperwork back from the hotel,\\" said Lovette.      According to police officials, the police department has been in contact with the District Attorney's Office and police have not ruled out possible charges.      Carbon monoxide detectors are not required in hotels in North Carolina. The hotel remains closed and under the control of investigators.      Investigators ask that anyone that stayed in room 225, contact the Boone Police Department at 828-268-6900 or email Sgt. Matt Stevens at matt.stevens@townofboone.net.

Copyright 2013 WBTV. All rights reserved. ||||| An 11-year-old Rock Hill boy died in a Boone motel over the weekend, just two months after a couple died mysteriously in the same room.      Police said Jeffrey Lee Williams, 11, was found dead in his room at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza. His mother, Jeannie Williams, 49, was listed in critical condition at a Boone hospital Saturday night, but her condition was not known Sunday.      On Sunday afternoon, police said there was no danger to the general public. “The investigation and testing is ongoing,” Sgt. Shane Robbins said in a news release, adding he didn’t expect additional information to be released until Tuesday at the earliest.      Police did not identify the couple, but a Washington state man said his elderly parents died in the same hotel on April 16, and he said he believes that something in the room may have contributed to their deaths. He said he was outraged that the room continued to be rented before the toxicology reports on his parents were returned.      “Do you know how mad I am right now?” asked Doug Jenkins. “Why are they still renting out this room?”      Representatives of the motel could not be reached late Sunday. Throughout the day, calls were being forwarded to the Country Inn and Suites, which shares the same parking lot as the Best Western.      Emergency responders were called to the motel, at 840 E. King St., around 12:30 p.m. Saturday, after getting reports of a medical emergency involving two people, officials said.      The boy was pronounced dead at the motel, and his mother was taken to Watauga Medical Center by ambulance for treatment.      The Williams family’s pastor, Scott Davis of Northside Baptist Church in Rock Hill, said on Saturday that the pair were on a family vacation. Relatives are devastated, he said.      Davis could not be reached on Sunday.      Authorities said they were exploring the possibility that Jeffrey Williams’ death could be linked to the deaths of Jenkins’ parents. Robbins says detectives are testing possible evidence related to the dead boy as well as features of the room.      “While no evidence has been discovered that these incidents are related, investigators continue to explore all possibilities,” Robbins said in a statement on Saturday.      Start of vacation      Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, both of Longview, Wash., died within hours of each other April 16 in hotel room No. 225.      Doug Jenkins said his parents were visiting Boone at the beginning of what was to be a three-week vacation, with the entire family planning to meet in Las Vegas near the end.      He last communicated with his parents around 7:48 p.m.      His parents had said they felt a little chilly when getting off the elevator, Jenkins said. His sister sent a message to their parents around 11:40 p.m., but the message was never read, he said.      His aunt and uncle, who were traveling with his parents, found the pair in a position that would suggest they hadn’t died from a sudden medical condition, he said, although he declined to elaborate.      “They were two healthy people who died within 2 feet of each other. Mom had her cellphone 2 feet away from her,” he said. “Things just don’t add up.”      Lawsuit possible      Doug Jenkins said the family is waiting on the results of the couple’s toxicology reports to come back before filing a lawsuit against the hotel, although they are already working with a lawyer.      The autopsy report proved inconclusive, he said.      About a month after his parents’ deaths, Jenkins said a lawyer representing the family had told the motel not to make any changes to the room before the family could perform an independent investigation.      Jenkins said his family is distraught that another family is going through the kind of pain they experienced. ||||| 11-year-old found dead in Boone hotel identified      BOONE, N.C. -- Boone police confirm that an elderly couple was found dead in April in the same hotel room where an 11-year-old Rock Hill boy died Saturday.            Jeffrey Lee Williams and his mother Jeannie Williams were found unresponsive on the second floor of the Best Western hotel on East King Street in Boone around 12:30 Saturday afternoon.            Jeffrey was pronounced dead. Jeannie, 49, was taken to Watauga Medical Center. Her famlily says she woke up from a coma Sunday and is listed in stable conditon. As of Sunday evening, she did not yet know about her son's death.            Pastor Scott Davis of Northside Baptist Church in Rock Hill said the boy's father is devastated.            Davis said the mother and son were staying in Boone on a \\"family vacation,\\" but they were the only two family members there. There are other children in the family, but they were not at the hotel.            Davis and the boy's father traveled to Boone Saturday afternoon after hearing of the death.            Boone police were still on scene late Saturday, and confirmed that the son and mother were staying in the same room where an elderly couple were found dead on April 16 -- less than two months ago.            \\"It was actually the same room,\\" said Boone Police Sgt. Shane Robbins. \\"But other than that, at this time, we don't have any more links or correlation.\\"            That case is still under investigation, said Sgt. Robbins. Investigators are still awaiting results of toxicology tests, and can't speculate about whether the two cases are connected.            Robbins said there did not appear to be any violence involved in the young boy's death or the mother's illness.            Guests were evacuated from the hotel Saturday. Workers in hazardous materials suits were able to remove some of the guests' belongings for them, so they could find another place to stay.            A regional hazmat team from Asheville was brought in to do forensic tests on the hotel room. Police say there is no danger to the public and tests are still being done. ||||| Summary:","output":"The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services issued a statement after a preteen and an elderly couple died from carbon monoxide poisoning in the same hotel room two months apart. The pathologist who performed the autopsies has resigned, and it is unclear if the hotel was notified of the potential danger in the room. Carbon monoxide detectors are not required in hotels in North Carolina, and police have not ruled out possible charges.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of cooking pasta, I recommend the following method, which makes the most sense due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and adaptability to different pasta shapes and types. This method is appropriate for both fresh and dried pasta varieties. Ingredients: - Pasta (about 4-6 ounces or 100-170 grams per person, depending on serving size) - Water (roughly 4 quarts or 4 liters per pound or 450 grams of pasta) - Salt (1-2 tablespoons) Equipment: - Large pot - Colander - Fork or pasta spoon - Timer Instructions: 1. Choose the right pot: Select a large pot with enough capacity to hold the water, pasta, and allow for expansion as the pasta cooks. Having enough room will prevent the pasta from sticking together and ensure even cooking. 2. Boil the water: Fill the large pot with water according to the ratio mentioned above (4:1 water to pasta). Place the pot on the stove and turn the heat to high. Bring the water to a rolling boil. 3. Salt the water: Once the water is boiling, add 1-2 tablespoons of salt to the pot. This helps flavor the pasta as it cooks, so don't be shy with your measurements. Stir the salt into the boiling water to dissolve it completely. 4. Add the pasta: Slowly pour the pasta into the boiling salted water, making sure to separate any strands or pieces that may stick together. It's crucial to maintain the boil, as adding the pasta may momentarily reduce the temperature of the water. 5. Stir the pasta: Using a fork or pasta spoon, give the pasta a gentle stir to ensure that it doesn't stick to the pot or clump together. Continue stirring occasionally throughout the cooking process to keep the pasta separated and to ensure even cooking. 6. Set a timer: Consult the pasta packaging for the recommended cooking time, which will vary depending on the type and shape of the pasta. If there's a range, for example, 8-11 minutes, start with the lower end to check for doneness. If the pasta is fresh, the cooking time will be significantly shorter (usually around 2-4 minutes). 7. Taste for doneness: As the timer approaches the end of the recommended cooking time, use a fork or pasta spoon to remove a single piece of pasta from the pot for sampling. Taste it to ensure that it's cooked to your preferred texture. The pasta should be cooked to al dente—firm to the bite but not crunchy or overly soft. 8. Drain the pasta: Once the pasta is cooked to your desired level of doneness, turn off the heat. Place a colander in the sink and carefully pour the pasta and water into it to drain the pasta. Give the colander a few shakes to remove any excess water. 9. Sauce or dress the pasta: After draining the pasta, transfer it back to the pot or to a serving dish. At this stage, you can toss the pasta with your sauce of choice or dress it with a simple combination of olive oil, salt, pepper, and grated cheese. 10. Serve immediately: Pasta is best enjoyed right away, so be sure to serve it promptly while it's still warm. You can pair it with a side salad, bread, or roasted vegetables for a complete meal. Remember that this method is versatile and allows for adjustments based on specific pasta types. Enjoy your perfectly cooked pasta!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Early big winners of ObamaCare: investors, lawyers, consultants, tech experts While polling data suggests many Americans remain anxious and skeptical about ObamaCare, the early big winners of the president’s signature law include investors, lawyers, consultants and purveyors of new technology. Since March 23, 2010, when it was signed into law, the health care sector of stocks in the S&P 500 has increased in value by 50 percent. Gilead Sciences, a California-based drug maker with 5,000 workers, has seen its stock price explode by 157 percent in the last three and a half years. Health insurers Cigna, Aetna and United Health have each seen healthy gains since President Obama signed the reform measure. Those companies as well as hospital operators Tenet Healthcare and Health Management Associates have seen stock gains far above the S&P's overall 16.9 percent jump. On a smaller scale, lawyers with expertise understanding ObamaCare are winners, too. Arthur Tacchino grew up near Philadelphia and says he always wanted to be a lawyer. He earned his law degree in 2010 and while some of his fellow graduates struggled to find work, Tacchino says he's fortunate to have stumbled into a job asking him to become an ObamaCare expert. Even though he didn't have an interest in health care, he's now taken his intricate knowledge of the law to the private sector, where he's part of a small team selling software programs to companies needing help managing the new law’s red tape. \\"We're trying to create an aid for people who need to understand the law and might not have the legal education they need to understand it,\\" Tacchino recently explained from his home office in the Philly suburbs. SyncStream Solutions is one of many small niche companies profiting from the complexity of the law and its mandates and Tacchino says most people are surprised to learn about new administrative tasks demanded by ObamaCare. He highlights one that forces businesses to keep close count on the number of hours worked by part-time workers and report that information to the federal government. He likens it to paperwork for taxes or payroll. \\"Business has been fantastic,\\" Tacchino boasts. \\"I mean we've partnered with some major clients all over the country and it seems as we grow and expand our business more people hear about us and realize there is a need for what we're doing.\\" Consultants and lobbyists with ties to ObamaCare have also done well in recent years as large companies struggle with implementing the law while also trying to persuade government officials to tailor rules to their liking. \\"It's no secret to anyone that the mechanics of what has happened with ObamaCare have been driven by some very strong lobbying from the private industry,\\" Dr. Sreedhar Potarazu, founder of VitalSpring Technologies Inc., told Fox News. Some of the key behind-the-scenes players who helped write the law and draft regulations implementing ObamaCare are now lobbying on behalf of corporate clients. Consulting companies, a frequent go-to resource for businesses who want outside expertise, have also beefed up their ObamaCare offerings. \\"The likes of Accenture, Deloit [and] the major consulting firms are really trying to get into the market in terms of helping guide and bring together the chaos by laying out a strategy in terms of how all of these various dots need to connect,\\" Potarazu explained. But he also warns that the constant changes in the law's technical requirements may prove problematic for anyone who doesn't pay close attention to what's happening in Washington. One of ObamaCare's requirements is a mandate forcing doctors and hospitals to move towards electronic record keeping. Shareholders in some of these firms have done quite well in recent years: Athena Health is up 180 percent and Cerner is up 110 percent since ObamaCare became law. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Since the implementation of ObamaCare, investors, lawyers, consultants, and technology experts have experienced significant growth and profits. The health care sector of stocks in the S&P 500 increased in value by 50% since the law was signed. Companies such as Gilead Sciences, Cigna, Aetna, and United Health have seen substantial stock gains. Lawyers specializing in ObamaCare expertise have found success due to the complexity of the law. Consulting companies and lobbyists with ties to ObamaCare have also profited in recent years as large companies navigate the law's implementation. Additionally, companies focusing on electronic record-keeping, such as Athena Health and Cerner, have seen their stock prices surge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to make a chocolate cookie dough cake  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 176 degrees celsius.  Grease three 6 inch (15. 2 cm) round cake pans and dust with cocoa powder.  Combine the dry ingredients together.","output":"Step 1: Combine the wet ingredients together in a separate bowl Justification: Mixing the wet ingredients separately ensures an even distribution of all the elements when they combine with the dry ingredients, leading to a smoother and more homogeneously mixed batter. Step 2: Carefully pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix them with a spatula until well combined Justification: Slowly incorporating the wet and dry ingredients together prevents overmixing, which can result in a tough and chewy final product. Step 3: If necessary, fold in any additional components, such as chocolate chips or nuts Justification: Folding in extra ingredients at this stage ensures their even distribution throughout the batter. Step 4: Divide the cookie dough batter evenly between the three prepared cake pans Justification: Dividing the batter evenly ensures equal baking time for all three layers, leading to a consistent final product. Step 5: Bake the cake layers in the preheated oven for approximately 25-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean Justification: Baking at the specified temperature and time allows the cake to cook evenly and rise properly. Step 6: Remove the cake layers from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10-15 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely Justification: Allowing the cakes to cool slightly in the pans helps set their structure, preventing them from breaking when transferring to a rack. Cooling the layers completely on a wire rack ensures they don't become overly moist or soggy from the residual heat in the pans. Step 7: Prepare your desired frosting or filling for the cake Justification: A good frosting or filling not only adds flavor but also helps hold the cake layers together. Step 8: Assemble the cake by placing one layer on a cake stand or serving plate, topping it with a layer of frosting or filling, then stacking the remaining layers in the same manner Justification: Assembling the cake in this way ensures a secure, even, and balanced end product. Step 9: Finish the cake by frosting the top and sides, if desired, and decorating with additional components like chocolate shavings or fresh fruit Justification: Adding the finishing touches of frosting and decorations enhances the overall appearance and taste of the cake. Step 10: Allow the assembled cake to set in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight before serving Justification: Letting the cake set helps the layers become more cohesive and ensures a neat, clean slice when it's time to serve."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Blank (John Cusack) finds himself depressed and irritable, dissatisfied with his work and the increasing competition from rival assassins, including Grocer (Dan Aykroyd), whose efforts to cartelize the business puts him at potentially lethal odds with the solitary Martin. Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10 year high school reunion in his home town of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his (understandably nervous) therapist (Alan Arkin) and his secretary (Joan Cusack), already booking him for a contract to re-establish ties with a disgruntled client over the botched contract.Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin seeks out Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army. While Debi's visit suggests hope for redemption, Martin's subsequent visit to his family only heightens his depression; his father is dead, his mother is an emotionally disturbed resident of a nursing home and his childhood home has been demolished and replaced with a convenience store. Reconnecting with friends like Paul (Jeremy Piven) is likewise depressing, as many have integrated themselves with the local community through mundane establishment jobs. When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets.

Additionally, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) has decided not to pre-treat the roads due to the expected rain, which might wash off the necessary treatment. However, they have prepared crews to act as necessary in order to prevent icy build-up on the roads. This demonstrates their awareness and concern about the potentially hazardous driving conditions. In summary, while the paragraph does not explicitly say that \\"snow\\" alone will create bad driving conditions, it does highlight that the wintry mix, including snow, and the potential existence of black ice on the roads could lead to dangerous driving circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The clowns, attending an annual convention in Mexico City, chanted: \\"We are clowns, not killers\\". The craze, in which people dress up as clowns and scare people, spread quickly with the help of social media. Scary clowns were first reported in the US in August and quickly spread to the UK, Australia and Brazil. Last week, five teenagers dressed as clowns were detained in the Mexican city of Mexicali after frightening people with bats. Clown sightings were also reported in the city of Queretaro. The hysteria over the past weeks has prompted police in several countries to increase patrols outside schools, and in some areas fancy dress shops were asked to remove clown masks from the shelves. The craze also saw fast food giant McDonald's limiting the public appearances of its well-known clown mascot, Ronald McDonald. But those who earn a living from the profession are fighting back, hoping to reverse the negativity that has cast a shadow on their trade. Hoi Hoi, a professional clown at the Mexico city convention, told Reuters: \\"There is more good than evil. Clowns show we are good people and we do our work in the best possible way.\\" An Argentine clown who went by the name Fluorescent Plug said: \\"I don't see anything funny about it.\\" Others were concerned about the safety of professional clowns. Tomas Morales, president of the Brotherhood of Latino Clowns, said: \\"If [people] see in the news that we are evil, they can take a machete or a gun and kill a clown.\\" Latin American clowns were dogged by controversy in 2013, when they gathered at that year's convention to deny allegations that one of their colleagues was responsible for the killing of a former Mexican drug cartel leader. The clowns argued at the time that their costumes were frequently stolen and then used to commit crimes. The annual clown convention, known locally as the \\"Kings of Laughter\\" convention, brings together professional clowns from across the continent. There are about 10,000 professional clowns registered in Mexico, according to the Latin-American Clown Association. What was that article about?","output":"The article is about professional clowns attending an annual convention in Mexico City, protesting against the \\"scary clown\\" craze that has spread across various countries. The craze, where people dress up as clowns to scare others, has negatively impacted the image and profession of clowns.

Clowns at the convention want to change the negative perception and emphasize that they are good people who perform their work well. The article also discusses concerns regarding the safety of professional clowns, as people might consider them evil and potentially harm them. The convention, known as the \\"Kings of Laughter,\\" unites professional clowns from across Latin America, with around 10,000 registered clowns in Mexico."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine.  suppose there are no solids to be filtered happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"If there are no solids to be filtered, it would indirectly impact a step of the process, leading to LESS waste being removed from the body. Here's an explanation of how the supposed perturbation occurs: The given process describes the general mechanism of waste removal from the blood through the kidneys. Let's break down this process into steps and analyze the possible indirect impacts when there are no solids to be filtered. 1. Fluid waste enters the kidneys: The bloodstream carries both fluid and solid waste matter, such as urea, drugs, and by-products of metabolism. In the absence of solid wastes to be filtered, only fluid waste will still enter the kidneys, and this step will not be directly impacted. 2. Processing moment in the kidneys: If no solid wastes are present to be filtered, the nephrons in the kidneys might function less efficiently. Nephrons are the filtering units of the kidneys, containing a glomerulus and a tubule. The glomerulus filters blood; as a result, smaller molecules like fluid waste and some ions are filtered out, while larger molecules or cells, such as proteins and blood cells, remain in the bloodstream.  3. Fluid goes back to the bloodstream: The fluid that has been filtered will then pass through the tubules, where specific ions and molecules might be reabsorbed based on the body's need. If solid waste is absent or there's an imbalance in waste levels, it may indirectly affect the reabsorption of these ions and molecules, potentially leading to an imbalance in their levels within the bloodstream. 4. Bad waste is removed: If there are no solid wastes to be filtered, the nephrons may not function as efficiently in removing the fluid waste. Consequently, less waste could be removed, indirectly impacting the waste removal process efficiency. 5. The final product is turned into urine: Since only fluid waste enters the kidneys in this scenario, the concentration of waste in the urine might be lower, which could also indirectly impact the osmotic balance in the body. In summary, when there are no solid wastes to be filtered, the waste removal process will not be directly impacted. However, it can lead to indirect impacts on various steps of the process, such as reduced reabsorption of vital ions and molecules, resulting in less waste being removed from the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - accelerate - carry freight - taxi - produce bang - catch on fire  The answer is \\"catch on fire\\" because","output":"The answer is not limited to just \\"catch on fire,\\" as there can be multiple outcomes when airplanes hit the ground depending on various factors such as the angle of impact, the size of the aircraft, speed, and whether it was a controlled or uncontrolled descent. Some of these factors may lead one or more of the following outcomes: 1. Produce a bang: A sudden impact on the ground can result in a loud noise or explosion, especially if fuel tanks are ruptured during the collision. 2. Catch on fire: As mentioned earlier, ruptured fuel tanks can ignite and cause the aircraft to catch fire. Additionally, sparks produced from the metal scraping against the ground can further contribute to the fire. 3. Accelerate: The momentum from a moving aircraft upon impact can cause it to accelerate, especially if it hits the ground at a certain angle. The aircraft slides and skids across the ground, tearing up or tossing debris in its path. 4. Taxi: In the context of an airplane properly landing on a runway, the term \\"taxi\\" refers to when an aircraft moves on the ground under its own power, usually on a taxiway, while preparing to take off or park at the gate. 5. Carry freight: This option is not directly related to what happens when an airplane hits the ground, as cargo planes are designed to carry freight regardless of the ground impact. In summary, what happens to airplanes when they hit the ground can vary depending on numerous factors.

Although this move seemed to solidify Bolshevik power in Central Asia, more troubles soon arose for the Red Army as the Allied Forces began to intervene. British support of the White Army provided the greatest threat to the Red Army in Central Asia during 1918. Great Britain sent three prominent military leaders to the area. One was Lt. Col. Bailey, who recorded a mission to Tashkent, from where the Bolsheviks forced him to flee. Another was Gen. Malleson, leading the Malleson Mission, who assisted the Mensheviks in Ashkhabad  with a small Anglo-Indian force. However, he failed to gain control of Tashkent, Bukhara and Khiva. The third was Maj. Gen. Dunsterville, who the Bolsheviks drove out of Central Asia only a month after his arrival in August 1918. Despite setbacks due to British invasions during 1918, the Bolsheviks continued to make progress in bringing the Central Asian population under their influence. The first regional congress of the Russian Communist Party convened in the city of Tashkent in June 1918 in order to build support for a local Bolshevik Party.

For example, if you have to be at work or school at 8 and it takes you an hour to get ready and a ½ hour to commute, you need to wake up no later than 6:30 am. Build in a cushion in case you run late. Avoid using an alarm that plays loud and banging music or that has annoying high-pitched noises. Open your eyes and let them get used to the light.

Consider putting out most of your belongings the evening before so you don’t forget anything or cause yourself undue stress.
