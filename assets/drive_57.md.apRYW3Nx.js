(A palindrome is a natural number that reads the same both from left to right and from right to left.)","output":"To determine if there exists a natural number that can be represented as the product of two palindromes in more than 100 ways, consider the following approach. 1. Define the palindrome in the form (1_n = underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{n}). 2. We know that if ( n ) is a multiple of ( k ), then (1_n) is divisible by the palindrome (1_k), and the quotient is also a palindrome composed of ones, spaced by groups of (k-1) zeros. 3. Choose an ( n ) such that the number has more than 100 factors. For instance, (2^{101}). 4. **Verification**: When (n) is chosen such that it has more than 100 proper divisors, it serves to construct invariants, and consequent dividers that are indeed palindromes. On verifying the divisor count of (2^{101}), the prime factorization yields 102 factors ((2^0, 2^1, ldots, 2^{101})). Therefore, this will satisfy the requirement of having more than 100 ways to represent the number as a product of two palindromes. 5. **Observation**: The number (6_n) is divisible not only by (1_k) but also by (2_k, 3_k), and (6_k). This can reduce (n) to a number having more than 25 proper divisors. 6. **Example**: Considering ( n=720 = 2^4 cdot 3^2 cdot 5 ), its total number of divisors: [ (4+1) cdot (2+1) cdot (1+1) = 5 cdot 3 cdot 2 = 30 ] Satisfies having more than 25 proper divisors. For further insight, consider the multiplication property of palindromes provided that arithmetic operations do not entail carrying over digits: 7. **Second approach**: Consider (1_{256}): [ 11 cdot 101 cdot underbrace{10 ldots 1}_{3} cdot underbrace{10 ldots 1}_{7} cdot underbrace{10 ldots 1}_{15} cdot underbrace{10 ldots 1}_{31} cdot underbrace{10 ldots 1}_{63} cdot underbrace{10 ldots 1}_{127} = 1_{256} ] 8. **Proof**: On multiplying any chosen pair of these factors, no carry occurs, ensuring that the product remains a palindrome. With 8 factors available, one can generate (2^7 = 128) different ways to factorize (1_{256}) into two groups. Each product represents ( 1_{256} ) in a different way as a product of two palindromes because of the coprimality of the initial factors. 9. **Further observations**: Using similar insights as noted above with (6_{64}) and extending factors in a similar way: [ 11 cdot 101 cdot 1001 cdot 1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{3}1 cdot 1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{4}1 cdot 1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{5}1 cdot 1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{6}1 cdot 1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{7}1 ] We have shown by multiple examples that there exists a natural number that can be represented as a product of two palindromes in more than 100 distinct ways.

Speed of the train in kmph = 72 kmph To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds (since 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds). Speed of the train in m/s = 72 kmph * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Speed of the train in m/s = 72 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of the train in m/s = 72 * (10 / 36) Speed of the train in m/s = 72 * (5 / 18) Speed of the train in m/s = 20 m/s Now that we have the speed of the train in m/s and the total distance covered in meters, we can calculate the time taken to cross the platform using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time taken to cross the platform = Total distance covered / Speed of the train in m/s Time taken to cross the platform = 520.0416 meters / 20 m/s Time taken to cross the platform = 26.00208 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{26.00208} seconds for the goods train to cross the platform."},{"instruction":"Given is a regular tetrahedron of volume 1.

Since (sum_{n geq 1} a_n ) converges by the problem statement and (sum_{n geq 1} frac{1}{n^{2k}} ) converges for ( k > frac{1}{2} ), it follows that the right-hand side of the Cauchy-Schwarz result is a product of two convergent series, hence it converges.

Therefore, for ( k = frac{1}{2} ), ( sum_{n geq 1} frac{sqrt{a_n}}{n^k} ) diverges since (sum_{n geq 1} frac{1}{n log n}) diverges.

Using Lagrange's formula for the ( p )-adic valuation of factorials, we have: [ nu_p(n!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} rightrfloor. ] For ( n = Np^a + x ), we need to evaluate: [ nu_p((Np^a + x)!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{Np^a + x}{p^k} rightrfloor. ] For ( k leq a ), we have: [ leftlfloor frac{Np^a + x}{p^k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{Np^a}{p^k} + frac{x}{p^k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{Np^a}{p^k} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{x}{p^k} rightrfloor, ] because ( p^a > 1000x ) ensures that ( frac{x}{p^k} ) is very small for ( k leq a ). For ( k > a ), since ( p^a mid Np^a ), we have: [ leftlfloor frac{Np^a + x}{p^k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{Np^a}{p^k} + frac{x}{p^k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{x}{p^k} rightrfloor, ] because ( frac{Np^a}{p^k} ) is an integer and ( frac{x}{p^k} ) is very small. Therefore, combining these results, we get: [ nu_p((Np^a + x)!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{Np^a}{p^k} rightrfloor + sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{x}{p^k} rightrfloor = nu_p((Np^a)!) + nu_p(x!). ] This completes the proof of the claim.

Then 10^k cdot frac{m}{n} - X = frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = 0.347 ldots. Since 10^k m - nX is an integer and frac{10^k m - nX}{n} is a fraction between 0 and 1, we can rewrite this as frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = frac{p}{q}, where q le n.

Determine the remainder obtained when N is divided by 1000. (Repeated digits are allowed.)","output":"To solve the problem, we follow these steps closely related to the given solution: 1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are looking for 7-digit positive integers with digits in increasing order. This includes numbers like 1234567 or 1123459, but not 1233210 because the digits must be in increasing or equal order without decreasing. 2. **Representing the Problem**: We can think of each digit as a choice of where to place a ball into one of 9 urns (labeled 1 through 9), where each urn represents a digit. The reason we only have 9 urns instead of 10 is that 0 cannot be the leading digit of the number, making it a 7-digit number. 3. **Using the Ball-and-Urn Argument**: To find the number of ways to place 7 balls into 9 urns, we can use the ball-and-urn method (also known as stars and bars). This method requires us to find the number of ways to distribute 7 identical items (balls) among 9 distinct groups (urns). 4. **Calculating the Number of Ways**: The formula for the ball-and-urn method is given by {n + k - 1 choose k}, where n is the number of urns, and k is the number of balls. In our case, n = 9 and k = 7, so we have {9 + 7 - 1 choose 7} = {15 choose 7}. 5. **Computing {15 choose 7}**: The value of {15 choose 7} is calculated as frac{15!}{7! cdot (15-7)!} = frac{15!}{7! cdot 8!}. This simplifies to 6435. 6. **Finding the Remainder When Divided by 1000**: To find the remainder when 6435 is divided by 1000, we simply look at the last three digits of 6435, which are 435.

Suppose we have two squares (i_1, j_1) and (i_2, j_2) such that the distance between their centers satisfies the equation: [ (i_1 - i_2)^2 + (j_1 - j_2)^2 = r ] If r is divisible by 2, both i_1 - i_2 and j_1 - j_2 must either be both even or both odd. This can be rewritten as, [ i_1 - i_2 equiv j_1 - j_2 pmod{2} ] From (1, 1) to (1, 20): [ 1 - 1 equiv 1 - 20 pmod{2} Rightarrow 0 notequiv -19 pmod{2} ] Since this is not true, it implies that moving from (1,1) to (1,20) is impossible when r is even. 2. **Case When r is Divisible by 3:** Similarly, if r is divisible by 3, { the equation gives: [ (i_1 - i_2)^2 + (j_1 - j_2)^2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Since squares modulo 3 can only be 0 or 1, both (i_1 - i_2) and (j_1 - j_2) must be multiples of 3: [ i_1 - i_2 equiv 0 pmod{3} quad text{and} quad j_1 - j_2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] From (1,1) to (1,20): [ 1 + 1 equiv 1 + 20 pmod{3} Rightarrow 2 notequiv 21 pmod{3} ] Hence, moving from (1,1) to (1,20) is impossible when r is divisible by 3. Therefore, we have shown that if r is divisible by 2 or 3, the task cannot be completed. --- Part (b): Prove that when r = 73, the task can be completed. 1. From given problem constraints, we should have: [ (i_1 - i_2)^2 + (j_1 - j_2)^2 = 73 ] 2. Recognize that: [ 3^2 + 8^2 = 9 + 64 = 73 ] 3. Hence, i_1 - i_2 and j_1 - j_2 must be either 3 or 8.

The derivative of f(x) is: f'(x)=frac{d}{dx}(xln{x})=ln{x}+1. Because the line y=2x+m is tangent to the graph of y=f(x), the slope of the tangent (derivative of f(x)) must equal the slope of the line, which is 2: ln{x}+1=2. Solving for x yields x=e. At x=e, f(e)=eln{e}=e since ln{e}=1. Thus, the tangent point is (e,e), and to find m, we set the equation of the tangent line at this point equal to the function: e=2e+m. Solving for m, we get m=-e. Therefore, the value of m is: boxed{m=-e}. (2) We have that f(x)=(x-a)ln{x}. Taking the derivative gives us: f'(x)=frac{d}{dx}((x-a)ln{x})=ln{x}+1-frac{a}{x}.

Since O is the incenter, angle BOC can be calculated using internal angle bisectors and properties of the triangle: [ angle BOC = 180^circ - left( frac{beta}{2} + frac{gamma}{2} right) ] Using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180^circ, it simplifies to: [ angle BOC = 180^circ - frac{(beta + gamma)}{2} = 180^circ - frac{180^circ - alpha}{2} = 90^circ + frac{alpha}{2} ] 3. **Applying the Sine Law in triangle BOC**: Using the Sine Law in triangle BOC: [ frac{OC}{sin left( angle B right)} = frac{BC}{sin left( angle BOC right)} ] With a = BC and substituting sin (90^circ + frac{alpha}{2}) = cos frac{alpha}{2}, we have: [ OC = frac{a sin frac{beta}{2}}{cos frac{alpha}{2}} ] 4. **Relating OC to r**: The radius r of the inscribed circle is perpendicular to BC and forms a right-angled segment.

Thus, the total number of possible ordered quadruples ((a, b, c, d)) is: [ 3^4 = 81 ] 2. **Criteria for Good Quadruples**: A \\"good quadruple\\" ((a, b, c, d)) must meet the conditions that (a + b), (c + d), (a + c), and (b + d) are all different.

First, observe the difference between consecutive terms: [ a_{n+1} - a_n = b left( left[ sqrt{n+1 + c} right] - left[ sqrt{n+c} right] right) ] Since each a_n is an odd number, and a_{n+1} geq a_n, we have: [ a_{n+1} - a_n in {0, 2} ] This implies: [ b left( left[ sqrt{n+1+c} right] - left[ sqrt{n+c} right] right) = 0 text{ or } 2 ] 3.

Also: [ x = f(2n-1)^{f(2n)} >> text{implies} quad f(2n) < f(2n-1) ] [ x = f(2n)^{f(2n+1)} < f(2n+1) ] hence, f(2n+1) < f(2n-1). 6. **Conclusion of induction:** - We establish that f(2n) < f(2n+1) < f(2n-1) by induction. 7. **Behavior of sequences f(2n) and f(2n+1):** - Since f(2n) is an increasing sequence bounded above, it converges to some limit h. - Similarly, f(2n+1) is a decreasing sequence bounded below, converging to some limit k. - We have h, k > e. 8. **Equating limits:** - From the definitions: [ lim_{n to infty} f(2n)^{f(2n+1)} = h^k = x ] [ lim_{n to infty} f(2n+1)^{f(2n+2)} = k^h = x ] - We get h^k = k^h. By the result (P), h = k. Thus, the sequence f(n) converges to some limit g(x). 9. **Continuity of g(x):** - Since g(x) satisfies g(x)^{g(x)} = x, and y^y is continuous and strictly increasing, its inverse function g(x) is continuous. # Conclusion [ boxed{f(n) text{ converges to some limit } g(x) text{, and } g text{ is continuous}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2 are all nonzero real numbers, and the sets A={x|a_1x+b_1>0}, B={x|a_2x+b_2>0}, then frac {a_{1}}{a_{2}}= frac {b_{1}}{b_{2}} is a(n) ( ) condition for A=B.

[ text{Product of all numbers} = -1 text{ (Initially and Always)} ] 4. **Conclusion**: Since the product remains ( -1 ) regardless of how many operations are performed, it is impossible for all the values on the chessboard to become positive. When all values are positive, the product would be ( 1 ), which contradicts the preserved product of ( -1 ). In conclusion, no sequence of operations can change the signs of the values such that all numbers on the board become positive. [ blacksquare ]"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=|x+2a|+|x1|.

First, we find the range of f(x) when x in [-1, 2]. The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 2x - 2. Setting f'(x) = 0, we get x = 1. Since f''(x) = 2 > 0, x = 1 is a minimum point of f(x).

Since the polygon is regular and has an even number of sides, there exists a central symmetry which the first player can exploit. 2. **Symmetric Strategy**: After making the initial move, the first player adopts a symmetric strategy for subsequent moves. - Suppose the second player draws a segment connecting two vertices. According to the rules, this segment cannot intersect any previously drawn segment and cannot connect two vertices, at least one of which is already connected. - The first player then responds by drawing a segment that is the symmetrical counterpart of the second player's segment with respect to the initial diagonal that was drawn through the center of the polygon. 3. **Play Mechanics**: Here’s how this works in detail: - If the second player connects vertices (A) and (B), where (A) and (B) are vertices on one side of the initial diagonal, the first player connects the vertices (A') and (B'), which are the reflections of (A) and (B) across the initial diagonal. - This ensures that the segment drawn by the first player does not intersect any previously drawn segment because it mirrors the second player's segment. - At each step, the number of free vertices on either side of the diagonal remains balanced due to the symmetrical placements. 4. **Winning Condition**: To win, the first player must ensure that the symmetrical counterpart to any possible move by the second player is always available: - Given the 1968 vertices, initially none of them are connected, meaning the player has the full capacity to start the symmetric strategy. - As long as the first player continues to mirror the second player’s moves relative to the initial diagonal, the second player will be the one who eventually runs out of permissible segments to draw based on the rules provided. # Conclusion Based on this symmetric strategy, the first player can force the second player into a losing position, ensuring that it is always the second player who cannot make the next move according to the rules.

Finally, we find the minimum value of frac{1}{x}+frac{2}{y} under the constraint mx+ny=3. **Step 1: Apply the Law of Sines for condition ①** Given a=7, b=8, and A=30^{circ}, we use the Law of Sines: frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} implies sin B = frac{b cdot sin A}{a} = frac{8 cdot frac{1}{2}}{7} = frac{4}{7} Since frac{4}{7} > frac{1}{2}, and knowing that the sine function takes values greater than frac{1}{2} for angles both in the first quadrant (acute angles) and the second quadrant (obtuse angles) up to 90^{circ}, angle B has two solutions in this case: one acute and one obtuse. Therefore, m=2. **Step 2: Apply the Law of Sines for condition ②** Given a=13sqrt{3}, b=26, and A=60^{circ}, we apply the Law of Sines again: frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} implies sin B = frac{b cdot sin A}{a} = frac{26 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}{13sqrt{3}} = 1 Since sin B = 1, this implies that B = 90^{circ}, which has only one solution (a right angle).

Multiplying both sides of the equation 2x + y = 3 by frac{1}{x} + frac{2}{y}, we get: frac{1}{x} + frac{2}{y} = frac{1}{3}(2x + y) left( frac{1}{x} + frac{2}{y} right) = frac{1}{3}left(2 + frac{2x}{y} + frac{y}{x} + 2right) = frac{1}{3} left( 4 + frac{y}{x} + frac{2x}{y} right) By the AM-GM inequality, frac{y}{x} + frac{2x}{y} geq 2sqrt{frac{y}{x} cdot frac{2x}{y}} = 2sqrt{2}. Thus, the minimum value of the expression is frac{1}{3}(4 + 2sqrt{2}) geq frac{8}{3}. The equality holds when frac{y}{x} = frac{2x}{y}, which corresponds to the minimum value.

In this case, (b_{i1}, b_{i2}, cdots, b_{in}) represents any rearrangement of (b_1, b_2, cdots, b_n). 2. **Step 2: Consider the properties of these permutations.** Given any function that applies to (b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}), if the function is symmetric, the value will remain the same regardless of how (b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}) are permuted. 3. **Step 3: Using inequality properties with permutations.** Let's consider the inequality that holds under permutation for symmetric functions: If (f(x_1, x_2, cdots, x_n)) is a symmetric function, then for any permutation (sigma), (f(x_{sigma(1)}, x_{sigma(2)}, cdots, x_{sigma(n)}) = f(x_1, x_2, cdots, x_n)). 4. **Step 4: Apply specific symmetric function (f(x_1, x_2, cdots, x_n) = x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n).** [ f(b_1, b_2, cdots, b_n) = b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n ] For any permutation (sigma), [ f(b_{sigma(1)}, b_{sigma(2)}, cdots, b_{sigma(n)}) = b_{sigma(1)} + b_{sigma(2)} + cdots + b_{sigma(n)} = b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n ] 5. **Conclusion:** Since the sum (sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i) remains the same under any permutation, we can use properties like symmetric sums or polynomial roots symmetry to prove further properties related to inequalities and permutations.

Since (C) is the point where the line intersects the plane, it serves as a critical point for further analysis. 2. **Tangent Point**: Assume (M) is the point of tangency of one of the sought spheres with the plane (Pi). 3. **Distance Relationship**: Since (M) is a point of tangency, by the Power of a Point theorem, we have: [ CM^2 = CA cdot CB ] From this relationship, we know that the point (M) lies on a circle with radius (sqrt{CA cdot CB}) centered at (C). 4. **Location of Center (O)**: The center (O) of the sphere must lie on a right cylinder whose base is this circle (found in step 3) with radius (sqrt{CA cdot CB}). 5. **Perpendicularity Condition**: Additionally, since the sphere is tangent to the plane (Pi) at (M), the radius (OM) must be perpendicular to the plane (Pi). 6. **Equidistance from (A) and (B)**: Center (O) must also be equidistant from points (A) and (B).

We need to find the values of ( k ) such that the three flies meet at a location different from their starting point. The flies travel at speeds of 2, 6, and ( k ) meters per second, respectively, on a circular track with a circumference of 1000 meters. 2. Let ( t ) be the time in seconds when the flies meet again at a location different from their starting point. The positions of the flies at time ( t ) can be described by the following congruences: [ 2t equiv 6t equiv kt pmod{1000} ] 3. For the flies to meet at the same point, the positions must be congruent modulo 1000. This gives us the system of congruences: [ 2t equiv 6t pmod{1000} ] [ 6t equiv kt pmod{1000} ] 4. From the first congruence, we have: [ 2t equiv 6t pmod{1000} implies 4t equiv 0 pmod{1000} implies t equiv 0 pmod{250} ] This implies that ( t ) must be a multiple of 250. 5. From the second congruence, we have: [ 6t equiv kt pmod{1000} implies t(k - 6) equiv 0 pmod{1000} ] Since ( t equiv 0 pmod{250} ), we can write ( t = 250m ) for some integer ( m ). Substituting this into the congruence, we get: [ 250m(k - 6) equiv 0 pmod{1000} ] Dividing both sides by 250, we obtain: [ m(k - 6) equiv 0 pmod{4} ] 6. For this congruence to hold for any integer ( m ), ( k - 6 ) must be a multiple of 4. Therefore, we can write: [ k - 6 = 4n implies k = 4n + 6 ] for some integer ( n ). 7. Given the constraint ( 7 le k le 2013 ), we substitute ( k = 4n + 6 ) and solve for ( n ): [ 7 le 4n + 6 le 2013 ] Subtracting 6 from all parts of the inequality: [ 1 le 4n le 2007 ] Dividing by 4: [ frac{1}{4} le n le 501.75 ] Since ( n ) must be an integer, we have: [ 1 le n le 501 ] 8.

When the man is moving against the current, his effective speed is ( v - 2 ) km/hr because the current opposes his motion. We are given that the man's speed against the current is 8 km/hr.

There are 5! = 120 different sequences for arranging these five people. After arranging them, there will be 6 spaces where A and B can potentially be placed (before the first person, between any two consecutive people, and after the last person). We choose 2 out of these 6 spaces to place A and B, which can be done in P(6,2) = frac{6!}{(6-2)!} = 30 ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements where A and B are not adjacent is 120 times 30 = 3600.

In the second step, we need to arrange the running order: - If A runs the fourth leg, there are P(3,3) = 3! = 6 ways to arrange the remaining three runners. - If A does not run the fourth leg, then A has 2 choices for the running leg (second or third), B also has 2 choices (first or second if A runs third, or second or third if A runs second), and the remaining 2 places can be filled by the other 2 runners in 2 ways.

Let us assume that the distances from point ( P ) to the vertices ( A ) and ( B ) of the square are equal to 1, and the distance to the vertex ( C ) is equal to 3. 2. Since point ( P ) is on the plane with a square, we can use the triangle inequality to analyze the distances: [ AB < PA + PB = 1 + 1 = 2 ] [ AC > PC - PA = 3 - 1 = 2 ] 3. From the assumption, distance ( PA = 1 ) and distance ( PB = 1 ). According to the triangle inequality, for any triangle with vertices ( A, B, ) and ( P ): [ AB < PA + PB = 1 + 1 = 2 ] This implies that ( AB < 2 ). 4. Now consider ( A ) and ( C ). From the assumption ( AC = d ), ( d ) represents the diagonal of the square. Applying the triangle inequality: [ AC > PC - PA = 3 - 1 = 2 ] This implies that ( AC > 2 ). 5. Since ( AC ) is the diagonal of the square, in a square with side ( s ), the diagonal ( AC ) is given by: [ AC = ssqrt{2} ] We know that for a square side length ( s ): [ ssqrt{2} > 2 ] Solving for ( s ): [ s > frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} ] 6. Notice that the distance ( AC ) which represents the diagonal distance being more than 2 contradicts the previous assertion from triangle inequality ( AB < 2 ). 7. Furthermore, a similar argument can be applied involving other vertices. If ( B ) and ( C )'s distances are to be computed and compared with both distances, analogous inequalities show that a similar contradiction will arise. Conclusion: The assumption that the distances from point ( P ) to the vertices of the square are 1, 1, 2, and 3 leads to contradictions given the properties of the square and the triangle inequalities.

The probability that cavalier j is shorter than his partner is given by: [ mathrm{P}(I_{j} = 1) = frac{j-1}{n} ] This is because there are j-1 cavaliers out of the n that are shorter than cavalier j. 4. The expected value of the random variable X, which represents the number of cavaliers who are shorter than their partners, is calculated by summing the expected values of the individual indicator variables I_{j}: [ mathrm{E}[X] = mathrm{E}[I_{1}] + mathrm{E}[I_{2}] + ldots + mathrm{E}[I_{n}] ] 5. Since I_{j} is an indicator variable, its expected value is equal to the probability that it equals 1: [ mathrm{E}[I_{j}] = mathrm{P}(I_{j} = 1) = frac{j-1}{n} ] 6. Therefore, [ mathrm{E}[X] = sum_{j=1}^{n} frac{j-1}{n} ] The summation sum_{j=1}^{n} (j-1) can be simplified as: [ sum_{j=1}^{n} (j-1) = 0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + (n-1) ] This sum is the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers is given by: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + (n-1) = frac{(n-1)n}{2} ] 7.

Let's denote the sum of all 21 numbers as T. So we have: n = T / 5 Since both expressions equal n, we can set them equal to each other: S / 4 = T / 5 Now, T is the sum of S and n, so we can write: T = S + n Substituting the value of n from the first equation (S / 4) into this equation, we get: T = S + (S / 4) T = (5S) / 4 Now, substituting this value of T back into the equation S / 4 = T / 5, we get: S / 4 = ((5S) / 4) / 5 Simplifying the right side, we get: S / 4 = S / 4 This is a tautology, which means it's always true regardless of the value of S.

A player wins if at any point they hold three cards with a sum of 15; if all nine cards are taken before this occurs, the game is a tie. Does either player have a winning strategy?","output":"1. **Describe the Setup and Winning Condition**: - In the game, there are 9 cards numbered from 1 to 9. - Alice and Bob take turns picking cards, with Alice going first. - The objective is for a player to hold any three cards that sum up to 15. - If all nine cards are picked without achieving this, the game ties. 2. **Represent the Cards**: - Let's arrange the cards in a 3 times 3 grid that corresponds to the standard magic square where each row, column, and diagonal sum to 15: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|} hline 8 & 3 & 4 hline 1 & 5 & 9 hline 6 & 7 & 2 hline end{array} ] - Notice that with this arrangement, any three-in-a-row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) sums to 15. 3. **Observation**: - This transformation means that the goal of achieving a sum of 15 is equivalent to obtaining any three-in-a-row in the grid. - Therefore, the game can be viewed as a game of tic-tac-toe where each choice of a number is akin to marking an X or O in a spot on a tic-tac-toe board. 4. **Relation to Tic-Tac-Toe**: - Tic-tac-toe is a game known to have no winning strategy if both players play optimally. This results in a forced draw—neither player can guarantee a win. - Since our card-picking game can be transformed into tic-tac-toe, the same result applies—neither Alice nor Bob can force a win if both play optimally. # Conclusion: - With the transformation to the equivalent tic-tac-toe grid, it can be determined that neither player has a winning strategy.

Player A replies \\"hot\\" if: - The guess is exactly correct. - The guess is off by exactly 1 in either of the digits, but correct in the other digit. If not, Player A replies \\"cold\\". For example, if Player A picks 29, then Player B receives \\"hot\\" for guesses 28, 19, or 39, and \\"cold\\" for all other guesses. 2. **Exploring Best Case for Elimination:** - There are 90 possible numbers from 10 to 99. - Each \\"cold\\" guess ideally eliminates 5 possibilities (1 correct number and 4 numbers off by one in one digit). 3. **Proving More Than 18 Guesses May Be Required:** - If Player B makes 18 guesses and receives \\"cold\\" for all, the guesses eliminate 18 times 5 = 90 possibilities: [ text{Total possible numbers initially} = 90 ] [ text{Numbers eliminated} = 18 times 5 = 90 ] - Even if B has received \\"cold\\" for all 18 guesses, N must be among the remaining numbers. Therefore, more than 18 guesses may be required. This establishes that player B may need more than 18 guesses to be absolutely sure of the number. 4. **Strategy to Find the Number in at Most 24 Guesses:** - Group the 90 numbers into clusters where each cluster has at most 5 numbers such that a guess eliminates the whole cluster. - Begin guessing numbers such as: [ 23: {13, 22, 23, 24, 33} ] [ 28: {18, 27, 28, 29, 38} ] Continuing, group numbers this way. 5. **Elimination Through 11 Guesses:** - If after the first 11 guesses all results are \\"cold\\", we eliminate 11 times 5 = 55 numbers. - If any of these are \\"hot\\", use further guesses to pin down exactly which number in that cluster is correct. 6. **Next Elimination Through Additional 7 Guesses:** - Make 7 more guesses to eliminate additional clusters: [ 11: {10, 11, 12, 21} ] [ 16: {15, 16, 17, 26} ] Continuing this process eliminates another 7 times 4 = 28 numbers (since each contains 4 numbers). 7. **Final Phase to Pin Down Specific Numbers:** - If after these 18 guesses all were \\"cold\\", make specific additional guesses such as 29, 89 to narrow down the exact number. This proves that you can find the correct number within 24 guesses. 8. **Strategy Using 22 Guesses:** - If all initial 18 guesses elicit \\"cold,\\" only a few numbers remain: [ text{Possible remaining numbers: } {4, 9, 39, 50, 89, 94, 99} ] - The additional 4 guesses to resolve ambiguity involve strategic elimination among these few possibilities. # Conclusion: This detailed strategy reveals that a number can be determined within 22 guesses.

Find the maximum number of diagonals of a regular ( n )gon that can be selected so that any two of them do not intersect in the interior or they are perpendicular to each other.","output":"1. Consider the case when ( n geqslant 3 ) is a positive integer. We need to find the maximum number of diagonals from a regular ( n )-gon such that no two diagonals intersect in the interior, or if they do, they are perpendicular to each other. 2. The solution is separated into examining both the odd and even cases for ( n ). Case 1: ( n ) is odd 3. We claim that no pair of diagonals in an odd ( n )-gon can be perpendicular. Assume for contradiction that ( AB ) and ( CD ) are perpendicular diagonals in an ( n )-gon. 4. Define ( E ) as the vertex lying on the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ), and let ( E' ) be the point on the circumcircle directly opposite ( E ). 5. Since ( EC = E'D ) and ( C, D, E ) should all be vertices of the regular polygon, ( E' ) must also be a vertex of the polygon by symmetry of the regular polygon. 6. However, in regular ( n )-gons where ( n ) is odd, there are no diametrically opposite points. This means that ( E' ) cannot simultaneously be a vertex of the polygon, leading to a contradiction. 7. As a result, no pair of diagonals can be perpendicular in an odd ( n )-gon. This implies that in maximizing the number of non-intersecting diagonals, we must arrange the diagonals to partition the polygon into ( n-2 ) triangles. 8. By selecting all diagonals emanating from a single vertex, the maximum number of non-intersecting diagonals is exactly ( n-3 ). Case 2: ( n ) is even 9. If there is no intersection, similar arguments as the odd ( n )-gon case apply. Now, consider when there are intersections possible between two perpendicular diagonals. 10. Let ( S ) be the set of all selected diagonals that are parallel to a given diagonal and intersect some other selected diagonals. Suppose ( S ) contains ( k ) diagonals and has ( l ) distinct endpoints. 11. Consider the longest diagonal in one of the two directions in ( S ). No other diagonal in ( S ) can originate from either endpoint of that diagonal, as it would lead to an intersection with a longer diagonal in ( S ). 12. This implies ignoring the two longest diagonals and their four endpoints, the remaining ( k-2 ) diagonals pair up in ( l-4 ) remaining endpoints, capable of no more than two diagonals per endpoint. Thus, [ 2(l-4) geqslant 2(k-2) implies k leqslant l - 2 ] 13. Suppose ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_l ) are groups of consecutive vertices of the regular ( n )-gon such that each of the two outermost vertices of a group is an endpoint of a diagonal in ( S ), while the interior points are not. 14. Each selected diagonal outside ( S ) must connect vertices within the same group ( P_i ). Any diagonal joining vertices from different groups would intersect some diagonal from ( S ). 15. Within each group ( P_i ), no perpendicular diagonals exist as vertices belong to the same side of a diameter. Thus, we can select at most ( |P_i| - 2 ) diagonals within ( P_i ), including one joining two outermost vertices if ( |P_i| > 2 ). 16. Therefore, the upper bound on the number of selected diagonals across all groups is [ sum_{i=1}^{l} left( |P_i| - 2 right) + k = sum_{i=1}^{l} |P_i| - 2l + k ] We know ( sum_{i=1}^{l} |P_i| = n ), so [ n - 2l + k leqslant n - 2 ] Hence, the maximum number of diagonals selected is ( n - 2 ). 17. This bound is attainable by selecting all diagonals emanating from a vertex ( A ) and the diagonal connecting two neighboring vertices of vertex ( A' ) (where ( A' ) is at diameter to ( A )) ensuring only perpendicular intersections. 18. Consequently, for ( n geq 3 ): - ( n-3 ) diagonals for ( n ) odd. - ( n-2 ) diagonals for ( n ) even.

First, let's calculate (5!)^2: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 (5!)^2 = 120^2 = 14,400 Now, let's express the condition that x! - 2 * 14,400 is divisible by 100,000: x! - 28,800 ≡ 0 (mod 100,000) Since 100,000 = 2^5 * 5^5, the factorial x! must end with at least five zeros to be divisible by 100,000. This means that x must be at least 10 because 10! is the smallest factorial that ends with at least five zeros. However, we need to find the smallest x such that x! is just enough to be divisible by 100,000 after subtracting 28,800. Since 28,800 ends with two zeros, x! must end with at least five zeros to absorb the subtraction and still be divisible by 100,000.

Since the short axis length is 2, and it corresponds to the minor axis (vertical axis in this case), we have 2b = 2, which implies b = 1. 2. The distance from the left vertex to F_{1}, which is a - c, is given as sqrt{2} - 1.

We denote this common side length by (s). Therefore, (AB = MN = s). 2. The given problem states that the vertex (A) of square (ABCD) is located at the center of square (MNPQ). Let's set up a coordinate system with the center of square (MNPQ) at the origin ((0,0)). 3. Square (MNPQ) will have vertices at (left(-frac{s}{2}, -frac{s}{2}right)), (left(frac{s}{2}, -frac{s}{2}right)), (left(frac{s}{2}, frac{s}{2}right)), and (left(-frac{s}{2}, frac{s}{2}right)). 4. Now, since vertex (A) of square (ABCD) is at ((0,0)), and the side (AB) is aligned such that it divides side (MN) into thirds, we require that the line segment (AB) extends from the center to one-third of the side of square (MNPQ).

Let ( g_k(n) ) denote a set of permutations of ({1, 2, cdots, n}) such that no two permutations share more than ( k-1 ) elements. 2. **Claim:** For any permutations ( p_1, p_2 in f_k(n) ) and ( p_3, p_4 in g_k(n) ), we have ( p_1 circ p_3 neq p_2 circ p_4 ), where ( sigma circ varphi ) denotes the composition of permutations ( sigma ) and ( varphi ). 3. **Proof of the claim:** - Since ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) have at least ( k ) common components, there exists an ( x in X ) such that ( p_1(x) = p_2(x) ). - Since ( p_3 ) and ( p_4 ) have at most ( k-1 ) common components, there exists an ( x in X ) such that ( p_3(x) neq p_4(x) ). - Therefore, ( p_1 circ p_3(x) neq p_2 circ p_4(x) ). 4. **Conclusion:** Since any two permutations from ( f_k(n) ) and ( g_k(n) ) correspond to a unique permutation of ({1, 2, cdots, n}), it follows that ( |f_k(n) times g_k(n)| = |f_k(n)| cdot |g_k(n)| ) is at most the total number of permutations of ({1, 2, cdots, n}), i.e., ( a_{n,k} cdot b_{n,k-1} leq n! ).

This implies ( p mid a(i-j) ). Since ( gcd(a, p) = 1 ), ( p mid (i-j) ). However, ( |i-j| ) is never more than ( p-1 ), so ( i = j ). 3. **Common components:** - For any ( a, b, c, d ) in the given range, unless ( a = c ) and ( b = d ), ( sigma_{a,b} ) and ( sigma_{c,d} ) have at most 1 common component. - If ( a = c ), then ( ax + b equiv cx + d pmod{p} implies b equiv d pmod{p} implies b = d ), which is impossible, so there are no common components. - If ( a neq c ) and ( b neq d ), then ( ax + b equiv cx + d pmod{p} implies x equiv (d-b)I pmod{p} ), where ( I ) denotes the multiplicative inverse of ( c-a pmod{p} ). Hence, ( x ) has only one possibility modulo ( p ), which uniquely determines ( x ). 4. **Conclusion:** - The set of permutations ( {sigma_{a,b}}_{1 leq a leq p-1, 1 leq b leq p} ) has the property that any two elements in it share at most 1 common component. This set has ( p(p-1) ) elements. - From part (a), it follows that ( a_{p,2} leq frac{p!}{p(p-1)} = (p-2)! ). - Considering the set of permutations ( varphi ) that satisfy ( varphi(1) = 1 ) and ( varphi(2) = 2 ), we see that equality must hold (once two elements are fixed, there are ( (p-2)! ) possibilities for ( varphi ) and any two of them share the common components 1 and 2).

We observe that this combination of transformations (homothety followed by rotation) is a rotational homothety centered at some point.

Due to the properties of homothety, mathcal{H} maps the center S to the point symmetric to S concerning O A. Then, the rotation mathcal{R} maps this point back to S. 4. Since S maps to itself under phi, S is a fixed point and consequently the center of phi. Therefore, phi is a rotational homothety with center S, an angle of 60^circ, and a coefficient of 2. 5. We can verify this by examining specific points. The transformation phi must preserve angles of the triangles formed and map segments proportionally.

We are given a zigzag inside a rectangle, with some given angles. We need to find the angle theta. For clarity, we introduce the following notations: - The path of the zigzag is formed by points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. - The angles at vertices B, C, D, E, F are given: angle ABC = 10^circ, angle BCD = 14^circ, angle DEF = 26^circ, angle EFG = 33^circ. 2. Using the property that the sum of the acute angles in a right triangle is 90^circ, we find: - angle ACB = 90^circ - angle ABC = 90^circ - 10^circ = 80^circ. - angle FEG = 90^circ - angle DEF = 90^circ - 26^circ = 64^circ. 3. Next, we use the property that the sum of the internal angles in a triangle is 180^circ: - angle DCE = 180^circ - angle ACB - angle BCD = 180^circ - 80^circ - 14^circ = 86^circ. - angle DEC = 180^circ - angle FEG - angle EFG = 180^circ - 64^circ - 33^circ = 83^circ. 4. Finally, to find theta, which is angle CDE, we use again the property that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180^circ: - angle CDE = 180^circ - angle DCE - angle DEC = 180^circ - 86^circ - 83^circ = 11^circ. 5. There is a simpler verification method by using the intersection property of parallel lines and angles summing up directly: - When parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, alternate interior angles are equal. - The angle at vertex C (14^circ) divides into 10^circ + 4^circ. - The angle at vertex E (33^circ) divides into 26^circ + 7^circ. - Therefore, theta = 4^circ + 7^circ = 11^circ. # Conclusion: [ boxed{11^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"For any integer nge 2 and two ntimes n matrices with real entries A,; B that satisfy the equation A^{1}+B^{1}=(A+B)^{1}; prove that det (A)=det(B) .

Simplifying the left-hand side: [ A A^{-1} B + A B^{-1} B = A (A + B)^{-1} B ] [ B + A = A (A + B)^{-1} B ] 3. Now, multiply both sides by ( (A + B) ): [ (A + B)(B + A) = A B ] 4.

Conclusion: A valid triangle configuration can be confirmed when these constructions hold true. (boxed{} ) II. Alternate Method: 1. **Utilize the theorem**: - The orthocenter reflections over sides lie on the triangle circumscribed circle. 2. **Reflective relations and distances**: - Reflect point (M) over side (a) to find (M'). - (M') must be distant (d) from (F). 3. **Precise construction**: - Place point (F), and identify the circle around (F) with radius (d). - Intersection on the circumscribed circle with this circle pinpoints (M'), giving us (M) as a reflected counterpart. 4. **Implement the same conditions**: - For (alpha < 90^circ), analyze specific circle arcs. - For (alpha > 90^circ), consider perpendicular projections. Conclusion holds consistent with valid construction criteria.

Under this inversion: - The tangent line (e) inverts into the circle (k). - Points (A) and (B) invert to points (A') and (B') respectively. - Circle (k) (the circumcircle of (triangle ABF)) inverts into a line (due to the nature of inversion where circle through center turns into line). 5. **Discuss the fixed point:** Upon inversion, the circle (k) inverts to the line (A'B'). The fixed point in question, under this inversion, remains fixed because the point (E) on (e) being tangent to (k) creates a direct relationship. From the properties of inversion, we know that any inversion image must preserve the mapped geometry. 6. **Leverage power of a point theorem:** By the power of a point theorem applied at (E) with respect to circle (k) (circle through (E) and (F)): [ AE cdot EB = FE cdot EG = constant ] Since this relation holds for any pair ((A,B)), point (G) remains constant. 7. **Explain (A'B') intersection:** Since (G) (the power point) is fixed under the transformation, the intersection of all circles undergoing inversion passing through (F) will remain intersecting at the same point regardless of the specific (A, B) pairs chosen.

Here: - Sum of DE + EF = 1000 + 1001 = 2001 > 1008, true. - Sum of EF + FD = 1001 + 1008 = 2009 > 1000, true. - Sum of FD + DE = 1008 + 1000 = 2008 > 1001, true. The conditions and the perimeter constraint are satisfied (sum being 1000 + 1001 + 1008 = 3009). For these values, FD - DE = 1008 - 1000 = 8. - However, to ensure this is the smallest difference: - Smaller differences may likely violate the triangle inequality or perimeter.

The only division which maintains equal shapes on every face such that all shapes match is when each face is divided into 4 smaller squares. Hence, the first statement is correct. 2.

Let's assume the general equation of the hyperbola to be 4y^{2}-x^{2}=lambda. This form is chosen because the coefficients of y^2 and x^2 are related to the slopes of the asymptotes. 3.

This distance is called the braking distance. To test the braking performance of a certain model of small passenger car (with a speed not exceeding 140 km/h), tests were conducted on this type of car, and the data obtained is as shown in the table below: | Braking Speed v (km/h) | 0 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | ldots | ||||||||| | Braking Distance s (m) | 0 | 2.5| 5 | 7.5| 10 | 12.5| ldots | Please answer the following questions: 1.

Estimate the speed of the car at the time of braking, and explain whether the car was speeding or driving at a normal speed at the time of the accident.

To determine the independent and dependent variables, we analyze the relationship presented in the table. The braking speed v is what we control or vary, and the braking distance s is what changes as a result. Therefore, the independent variable is the braking speed v, and the dependent variable is the braking distance s. Thus, the answers are: - Independent variable: braking speed - Dependent variable: braking distance So, we have boxed{text{braking speed; braking distance}}. 2. Looking at the pattern in the table, we see that for every 10 km/h increase in speed, the braking distance increases by 2.5 m. At 50 km/h, the braking distance is 12.5 m. Therefore, at 60 km/h, the braking distance would be 12.5 m + 2.5 m = 15 m. Thus, the answer is boxed{15}. 3. To find the relationship between the braking distance s and the speed v, we observe that the increase in distance is proportional to the increase in speed. Specifically, for every increase of 10 km/h in speed, the braking distance increases by 2.5 m. This can be represented by the equation s = 0.25v (since 2.5 m for every 10 km/h is equivalent to 0.25 m for every 1 km/h), where v geqslant 0. Hence, the relationship is boxed{s=0.25v , (vgeqslant 0)}. 4. To estimate the speed of the car at the time of braking when the braking distance was 32 m, we use the relationship s = 0.25v. Substituting 32 for s, we get: [ 32 = 0.25v implies v = frac{32}{0.25} = 128 , km/h ] According to the \\"Road Traffic Safety Law\\", the maximum speed allowed on highways for small passenger cars is 120 km/h.

If (10^n - 2) can be expressed as the difference of two squares: [ 10^n - 2 equiv 2 pmod{4} ] Notice squares mod 4 are always 0 or 1.

Then, the value of a^{2002} + b^{2003} is equal to ______.","output":"1. The problem states that we have a set containing three real numbers which can be represented as (left{a, frac{b}{a}, 1right}) and also as (left{a^{2}, a+b, 0}). We need to find the value of (a^{2002} + b^{2003}). 2. First, notice that since both representations describe the same set: [ left{ a, frac{b}{a}, 1 right} = left{ a^2, a + b, 0 right} ] This implies that the elements in both representations must match, though not necessarily in the same order. 3. To equate and solve the sets, we start by matching each element: [ a + frac{b}{a} + 1 = a^2 + (a + b) + 0 ] Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: [ a + frac{b}{a} + 1 = a^2 + a + b ] Subtract (a) from both sides: [ frac{b}{a} + 1 = a^2 + b ] 4. We also need to use the multiplicative property of the elements: [ a cdot frac{b}{a} cdot 1 = a^2 cdot (a + b) cdot 0 ] Since anything times 0 is 0: [ ab = 0 ] This implies that either (a = 0) or (b = 0). 5. Let's check the possible solutions for (a = 0): If (a = 0), (left{0, frac{b}{0}, 1right}) is clearly undefined because (frac{b}{0}) is undefined. 6. Now, check the case where (b = 0): [ left{a, frac{0}{a}, 1right} = left{a, 0, 1right} ] And [ left{a^2, a + 0, 0right} = left{a^2, a, 0right} ] 7. For these sets to be equal to each other, (a) in ({a, 0, 1}) must match (a) in ({a^2, a, 0}): [ {a, 0, 1} = {a^2, a, 0} ] 8. Given (a +0 +1 = a^2+a+0): [ a + 1 = a^2 + a ] Subtract (a) from both sides: [ 1 = a^2 ] Thus (a^2 = 1), which yields (a = 1) or (a = -1). 9. Check these values: - If (a = 1): [ {1, 0, 1} neq {1, 1, 0} ] It does not satisfy the condition. - If (a = -1): [ {-1, 0, 1} equiv {1, -1, 0} ] This satisfies the set equality condition. 10. Conclusion: With (a = -1) and (b = 0): [ a^{2002} + b^{2003} = (-1)^{2002} + 0^{2003} ] Simplifying: [ 1 + 0 = 1 ] Thus, the value is: [ boxed{1} ]"},{"instruction":"Sarah buys a stock that decreases by 15% on the first day, and then on the second day, the stock increases by 25% of its value at the end of the first day.

We are given that points (P, Q, R, S) are symmetric to (M) with respect to the midpoints of the sides (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA) respectively. 2. **Concept of Symmetry and Midpoints**: If (N) is the midpoint of a segment (XY), then point (P) which is symmetric to (M) with respect to (N) will satisfy: [ overline{NP} = overline{NM} ] and the point (P) is in the opposite direction from (M) across (N). 3. **Area Transformation Principle**: By reflection symmetry about the midpoints leading to quadrilateral (P Q R S), each segment of the quadrilateral (A B C D) will be bisected, and the process will lead to a transformation where the area of (P Q R S) is not changed. 4. **Calculation from Properties**: To find the area of (P Q R S), we can use the property of symmetry. Each reflection does not change the area since the segments (A B), (BC), (CD), and (DA) meet at their midpoints and split into smaller symmetric triangular areas of the original quadrilateral. As (M) is inside (A B C D), the central symmetry via midpoints ensures (P Q R S) becomes an affine transformation of (A B C D), maintaining equal areas. 5. **Conclusion**: By symmetry, the area of each segment of the quadrilateral (P Q R S) sums back to the original area since symmetry preserves the area.

The condition (AA' = CC') and (BB' = DD') indicates the necessary and sufficient condition for (ABCD) to be a parallelogram. 7.

Since x can complete the work in 20 days, x's one day work is 1/20 of the total work. Similarly, since y can complete the work in 12 days, y's one day work is 1/12 of the total work. Now, let's calculate the amount of work x does in the first 4 days before y joins him. In 4 days, x does 4 * (1/20) = 1/5 of the total work. The remaining work after x has worked for 4 days is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 of the total work. Now, let's calculate the combined one day work of x and y. x's one day work + y's one day work = 1/20 + 1/12 To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60 (the least common multiple of 20 and 12).

Prove that if quadrilateral ( AB_1 A_1 C_1 ) is cyclic, then ( overline{AD} ) is tangent to the circumcircle of ( triangle DB_1 C_1 ).","output":"\`\`\`markdown We present two solutions. First Solution using Spiral Similarity (Ankan Bhattacharya) First, we prove the part of the problem which does not depend on the condition AB_{1}A_{1}C_{1} being cyclic. Lemma Let ABC be a triangle and define I, D, B_{1}, C_{1} as in the problem. Moreover, let M denote the midpoint of overline{AD}. Then overline{AD} is tangent to left(AB_{1}C_{1}right), and moreover overline{B_{1}C_{1}} parallel overline{IM}. **Proof.** Let E and F be the tangency points of the incircle. Denote by Z the Miquel point of BFECA, i.e., the second intersection of the circle with diameter overline{AI} and the circumcircle (ABC). Note that A, Z, D are collinear, by the radical axis theorem on (ABC), (AFEI), and (BIC). Then the spiral similarity gives us: frac{ZF}{ZE} = frac{BF}{CE} = frac{AC_{1}}{AB_{1}} which, together with angle FZE = angle FAE = angle BAC, implies that triangles triangle ZFE and triangle AC_{1}B_{1} are (directly) similar. (See IMO Shortlist 2006 G9 for a similar application of spiral similarity.) **Angle Chasing:** First, since: angle DAC_{1} = angle ZAF = angle ZEF = angle AB_{1}C_{1} we have overline{AD} tangent to the circle left(AB_{1}C_{1}right). Moreover, to see that overline{IM} parallel overline{B_{1}C_{1}}, write: begin{aligned} angle left(overline{AI}, overline{B_{1}C_{1}}right) &= angle IAC + angle AB_{1}C_{1} = angle BAI + angle ZEF = angle FAI + angle ZAF &= angle ZAI = angle MAI = angle AIM end{aligned} the last step since triangle AID is right with hypotenuse overline{AD}, and median overline{IM}. Now we return to the present problem with the additional condition. Claim Given the condition, we actually have angle AB_{1}A_{1} = angle AC_{1}A_{1} = 90^{circ}. **Proof.** Let I_{A}, I_{B}, and I_{C} be the excenters of triangle ABC. Then the perpendiculars to overline{BC}, overline{CA}, overline{AB} from A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}, respectively intersect at the so-called Bevan point V (which is the circumcenter of triangle I_{A}I_{B}I_{C}). Now, triangle AB_{1}C_{1} has circumdiameter overline{AV}. Given that A_{1} lies on this circle, if V neq A_{1} then overline{AA_{1}} perp overline{A_{1}V}. But overline{A_{1}V} perp overline{BC} by definition, which would imply overline{AA_{1}} parallel overline{BC}, which is absurd. Claim Given the condition, the points B_{1}, I, C_{1} are collinear (hence with M). **Proof.** By Pappus' theorem on overline{I_{B}AI_{C}} and overline{BA_{1}C} after the previous claim. To finish, since overline{DMA} was tangent to the circumcircle of triangle AB_{1}C_{1}, we have: MD^{2} = MA^{2} = MC_{1} cdot MB_{1} implying the required tangency. Remark The triangles satisfying the problem's hypothesis are exactly the ones satisfying r_{A} = 2R, where R and r_{A} denote the circumradius and A-exradius, respectively. Remark If P is the foot of the A-altitude, then this should also imply AB_{1}PC_{1} is harmonic. Second Solution by Inversion and Mixtilinears (Anant Mudgal) As in the end of the preceding solution, we have angle AB_{1}A_{1}= angle AC_{1}A_{1}=90^{circ} and I in overline{B_{1}C_{1}}. Let M be the midpoint of minor arc BC and N be the midpoint of arc widehat{BAC}. Let L be the intouch point on overline{BC}. Let O be the circumcenter of triangle ABC. Let K = overline{AI} cap overline{BC}. Claim We have angle left(overline{AI}, overline{B_{1}C_{1}}right)=angle IAD. **Proof.** Let Z lie on (ABC) with angle AZI = 90^{circ}. By the radical axis theorem on (AIZ), (BIC), and (ABC), we conclude that D lies on overline{AZ}. Let overline{NI} meet (ABC) again at T neq N. Inversion in (BIC) maps overline{AI} to overline{KI} and (ABC) to overline{BC}. Thus, Z maps to L, so Z, L, M are collinear. Since BL = CL and OI = OV, we see that MLIN is a trapezoid with IL parallel MN. Thus, overline{ZT} parallel overline{MN}. It is known that overline{AT} and overline{AA_{1}} are isogonal in angle angle BAC. Since overline{AV} is a circumdiameter in left( AB_{1}C_{1} right), we have overline{AT} perp overline{B_{1}C_{1}}. Thus: angle ZAI = angle NMT = 90^{circ} - angle TAI = angle left(overline{AI}, overline{B_{1}C_{1}}right) Let X be the midpoint of overline{AD} and G be the reflection of I in X. Since AIDG is a rectangle, we have angle AIG = angle ZAI = angle left(overline{AI}, overline{B_{1}C_{1}}right), by the previous claim. So overline{IG} coincides with overline{B_{1}C_{1}}. Now, overline{AI} bisects angle B_{1}AC_{1} and angle IAG = 90^{circ}. So: left(overline{IG}; overline{B_{1}C_{1}}right) = -1 Since angle IDG = 90^{circ}, we see that overline{DI} and overline{DG} are bisectors of angle angle B_{1}DC_{1}. Now angle XDI = angle XID implies angle XDC_{1} = angle XID - angle IDB_{1} = angle DB_{1}C_{1}, so overline{XD} is tangent to left(DB_{1}C_{1}right). **Conclusion.** boxed{overline{AD} text{ is tangent to the circumcircle of } triangle DB_{1}C_{1}} \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"Based on the provided data, calculate the average daily low temperature in Addington from September 15th, 2008 through September 19th, 2008, inclusive.

In this case, since (OP = frac{1}{2}OZ), the set of points (P) covers a region similar to the region covered by points (Z), centered around (O) and scaled by a factor of (frac{1}{2}). 2. **Analysis of Points (P)**: To understand the configuration of points (P), we note that (P) is the midpoint of line segments connecting arbitrary points within (ABC Delta) and (DEF Delta). This implies that the triangles formed by these midpoints are similar to (ABC) and (DEF), albeit scaled down by a factor of (frac{1}{2}). 3. **Triangles and Translation**: For example, if (Y) coincides with (D) and (X) is any point in (ABC Delta), the points (P) cover a triangle that is half the size of (ABC Delta). As (Y) moves along the edges and inside the triangle (DEF), the configuration of triangles formed by the points (P) shifts but covers a larger polygon. 4. **Path Analysis**: Analyzing the paths: - When (Y) moves along edge (DE), the configuration of triangles shifts accordingly while maintaining parallel edges. - Continuing the movement along edge (EF) and further along all interior points, the coverage of triangles eventually fills up the entire region forming a larger polygon. 5. **Conclusion for Part (a)**: Therefore, all points (Z) fill a polygon when the points (P) cover a similar scaled region.

Initially, the drink contains 15% lemon juice. Later, the general manager gives an order to reduce the lemon juice content to 10%. We need to calculate by what percentage the quantity of the lemon drink produced (with the same amount of lemon juice) will increase after the change. # Approach: **First Method:** 1. Initially, the drink contains 15% lemon juice. 2. After the instruction, the drink should contain 10% lemon juice. 3. The reduction from 15% to 10% involves diluting the lemon juice by a factor of (frac{15}{10} = 1.5). 4. Hence, the same amount of lemon juice, when diluted to 10%, will produce (frac{15}{10} = 1.5) times more drink. Thus, the quantity increases by 50%. **Second Method:** 1. Let ( x ) be the quantity of the lemon drink produced initially (with 15% lemon juice content). - The amount of lemon juice in this drink is ( 0.15 cdot x ). 2. Let ( y ) be the quantity of the lemon drink produced after the instruction (with 10% lemon juice content). - The amount of lemon juice in this drink is ( 0.10 cdot y ). 3. Since the amount of lemon juice remains the same, we set up the equation: [ 0.15 cdot x = 0.10 cdot y ] 4. Solving for ( y ): [ y = frac{0.15 cdot x}{0.10} = 1.5 cdot x ] 5. This indicates: [ y = x + 0.5 cdot x = x + 50% cdot x ] Therefore, the quantity of the lemon drink increases by 50%.

The equipment is old, so there may be errors in individual digits of the transmitted subscriber number — each digit can be independently replaced by another random digit with a probability of p=0.02. To reduce the likelihood of incorrect connections, the company uses the following rule: the first digit of the number must always be the remainder when the sum of the other two digits is divided by 10. For example, the numbers 000 and 156 are possible, but the number 234 is not. If the check digit is incorrect during the connection, an error message is issued. Find the probability that, despite the measures taken, an incorrect connection will occur.","output":"1. **Define Correct Numbers:** Numbers that satisfy the company's rule, where the first digit is the remainder of the sum of the other two digits modulo 10, are called \\"correct\\" numbers. We are tasked with finding the probability that despite errors in transmission, the resulting number is correct. 2. **Probability Setup:** Each of the three digits in the number can be independently mistaken with a probability ( p = 0.02 ). If we denote: - ( r_2 ) as the probability of the number being correct with exactly two erroneous digits, - ( r_3 ) as the probability of the number being correct with all three digits erroneous, then we can use the following binomial coefficients and probabilities: [ C_{3}^{2} p^{2}(1-p) quad text{and} quad C_{3}^{3} p^{3} ] where ( C_{3}^{2} ) and ( C_{3}^{3} ) are binomial coefficients representing combinations. 3. **Calculations:** The total probability that an erroneous number turns out to be correct is given by: [ C_{3}^{2} p^{2}(1-p) r_{2} + C_{3}^{3} p^{3} r_{3} ] 4. **Details and Example for Two Errors:** If two digits are erroneous, for any given first erroneous digit, the second erroneous digit must be chosen correctly from 9 possible values (since there are 10 digits total). Therefore, the probability ( r_2 ) is given by: [ r_2 = frac{1}{9} ] Explanation: Fixing two erroneous digits, the number must sum correctly to keep the number as per the rule, within the nine possible values for the second digit. **Example:** For the number ( 376 ), if the 2nd digit becomes 5 by mistake, it results in a number ( 35A ). ( A ) must adjust to make the sum modulo 10 as 3, making ( A = 8 ). 5. **Details and Example for Three Errors:** If all three digits are erroneous, there’s only a ( frac{1}{9} ) chance the first two errors align to maintain the rule, and the final one also needs one out of nine values to align. Therefore: [ r_3 = frac{8}{9} cdot frac{1}{9} ] **Example:** Suppose the number ( 376 ) mistakenly turns into ( 2AB ). ( A ) must be one of 9 wrong values (without the correct digit speed dialing), and finally align ( B ) which too is one out of nine to potentially sum correctly. 6. **Final Combined Probability Calculation:** Combine the probabilities calculated for two and three erroneous digits: [ C_{3}^{2} p^{2}(1-p) r_{2} + C_{3}^{3} p^{3} r_{3} ] Substituting obtained values: [ 3 cdot 0.02^{2} cdot 0.98 cdot frac{1}{9} + 1 cdot 0.02^{3} cdot frac{8}{81} approx 0.000131 ] # Conclusion The probability that the number connected is still correct despite potential digit errors is approximately: [ boxed{0.000131} ]"},{"instruction":"A mother purchases 6 blue plates, 3 red plates, 3 green plates, 2 orange plates, and 2 yellow plates.

The division by the factorial of identical plates gives: frac{15!}{6!3!3!2!2!} Now, calculating the scenario where the 3 green plates are adjacent, we treat these plates as a single entity or block. Thus, there are 16 - 2 = 14 entities to arrange (since 3 green plates count as one block and one plate is fixed). The arrangements are: frac{14!}{6!3!2!2!1!} This counts the total ways to arrange these blocks, and we multiply by 3! to account for arrangements within the green block: frac{14!}{6!3!2!2!1!} times 3!

This relationship is crucial for understanding the function values when x is in the interval [4,6). First, let's determine the values of f(4) and f(6) using the given property: - f(4) = 4f(0) - f(6) = 4f(2) The function f(x) is defined in a piecewise manner for x in the interval [0,2).

For x in [0,1): - The range of f(x) = x - x^2 reaches its maximum when x = frac{1}{2}, giving a maximum value of frac{1}{4}. Since it is a continuous function that decreases as x approaches 0 or 1, its range is [0, frac{1}{4}].

Next, analyse the condition ( |f(x)| geqslant 2 ). This can be rewritten as: [ f(x) geqslant 2 text{ or } f(x) leqslant -2 ] 4. Considering the function ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + 2 ): - The graph is a parabola. - The vertex form of a parabola ( ax^2 + bx + c ) is given by: [ f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k ] where ( (h, k) ) are the coordinates of the vertex. For our function, the vertex (( h, k )) can be determined using the formula ( h = -frac{b}{2a} ). 5. For the given quadratic function, the shift to standard form can be achieved by completing the square: [ f(x) = a left( x^2 + frac{b}{a} x right) + 2 ] - Complete the square: [ x^2 + frac{b}{a} x = left(x + frac{b}{2a}right)^2 - left(frac{b}{2a}right)^2 ] Therefore: [ f(x) = a left[ left( x + frac{b}{2a} right)^2 - left( frac{b}{2a} right)^2 right] + 2 ] [ f(x) = a left( x + frac{b}{2a} right)^2 - frac{b^2}{4a} + 2 ] 6. Since ( |f(x)| geqslant 2 ) must hold for all ( x ), the minimum value of ( f(x)) should be such that it adequately reflects these bounds. - The minimum value of the function occurs at the vertex ( (h, k) ): [ k = -frac{b^2}{4a} + 2 ] 7.

Based on the pattern, 100 will be placed near the edge, likely in one of the corners of the last concentric ring formed. 2. **Determine the numbers in the fifth row**: - Given the counterclockwise direction, we begin the spiral inward from the outermost part of the grid toward the central starting point. Observing the 10 times 10 structure, each side of a ring consists of 10 positions. 3. **Calculate the specific numbers in the fifth row**: - As we are filling counterclockwise, positions in the fifth row are filled somewhat later in the process once the outer and inner subsequent rings are filled. It's mid halfway in filling process. - Deductively, the highest number in the row would be closer to 100 since later numbers are positioned earlier in the row due to the spiraling path. The lowest would be closer to the starting point and positioned toward the end of the row filling. 4. **Calculate and sum the extreme numbers**: - Hypothetically, if 100 is around a corner, counting the entries backward in a counterclockwise spiral from the grid's edges to row 5, we identify the largest number around near 90 (estimation for the sake of explanation). - Smallest number could thus be around 20, given that filling began somewhat centrally and moved outward. - Sum: 90 + 20 = 110 Conclusion: 110 is the sum of the greatest and least numbers in the fifth row of Mrs. Li's numbered grid.

The x values provided are x_{1}=-1, x_{2}=frac{1}{2}, and x_{3}=2. First, let's understand the nature of the quadratic function given. The function can be written as y=-x^{2}+2x+m. The coefficient of x^2 is negative, indicating that the parabola opens downwards. The axis of symmetry of a quadratic function in the form y=ax^2+bx+c is given by x=-frac{b}{2a}. For our function, a=-1 and b=2, so the axis of symmetry is x=-frac{2}{2(-1)}=1. Given that the parabola opens downwards and the axis of symmetry is x=1, the y value increases as x moves closer to the axis of symmetry from either side. This means that among x_{1}, x_{2}, and x_{3}, the x value closest to the axis of symmetry will correspond to the largest y value. Comparing the distances of x_{1}, x_{2}, and x_{3} to the axis of symmetry (x=1): - The distance from x_{1}=-1 to x=1 is 2. - The distance from x_{2}=frac{1}{2} to x=1 is frac{1}{2}. - The distance from x_{3}=2 to x=1 is 1.

In this case, a^2=25 and b^2=9, so c=sqrt{25-9}=4. Thus, the foci are at F_1(-4,0) and F_2(4,0). Now, for the hyperbola with the same foci and an eccentricity of e=2, we recognize that the vertices A_1 and A_2 of the hyperbola will have the same coordinates as the foci of the ellipse, A_1(-4,0) and A_2(4,0). The eccentricity e of the hyperbola is defined as e = frac{c}{a}, where c is the distance from the center to a focus and a is the distance from the center to a vertex.

This is because (O_4) and (O) are circumcenters of (triangle DAP) and (triangle ABCD) respectively, and the line joining the circumcenter to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord. - To show that (overline{O_2P} perp overline{AD}), we use the perpendicularity lemma.

At what speed, in kilometers per hour, is the car traveling?","output":"Let's denote the unknown constant speed of the car as ( v ) km/h. First, we need to find out how long it takes to travel 1 kilometer at 120 km/h. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can rearrange this to find time as distance divided by speed. Time at 120 km/h = Distance / Speed = 1 km / 120 km/h = 1/120 hours. To convert this time into seconds, we multiply by 3600 seconds/hour (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour): Time at 120 km/h = (1/120) * 3600 seconds = 30 seconds. Now, we know that the car takes 5 seconds longer than this to travel 1 kilometer at speed ( v ), so the time it takes at speed ( v ) is 30 seconds + 5 seconds = 35 seconds. To find the speed ( v ), we use the same formula for speed, but this time we need to convert the time back to hours to be consistent with the units for speed (km/h): Time at speed ( v ) = 35 seconds = 35/3600 hours. Now, we can set up the equation for speed ( v ): Speed ( v ) = Distance / Time = 1 km / (35/3600) hours. To solve for ( v ), we calculate: ( v ) = 1 km / (35/3600 hours) = 1 km / (0.00972222... hours) ≈ 102.857 km/h.

Since 3/10 < 1, raising it to any positive power will result in a number less than 1. Thus, 0 < 0.3^{5} < 1. - On the other hand, log _{3}5 is the power to which 3 must be raised to get 5. Since 3^1 = 3 and 3^2 = 9, it's clear that 1 < log _{3}5 < 2. Specifically, log _{3}5 > 1. - Comparing the two, we find that 0.3^{5} < log _{3}5. Therefore, statement ① is incorrect. # Statement ②: ln sqrt{2}＜frac{sqrt{2}}{2} - We can express ln sqrt{2} - frac{sqrt{2}}{2} as frac{1}{2}ln 2 - frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{ln 2 - sqrt{2}}{2}. - Knowing that ln 2 < 1 < sqrt{2}, we can conclude that ln 2 - sqrt{2} < 0. - Therefore, frac{ln 2 - sqrt{2}}{2} < 0, which implies ln sqrt{2} < frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. So, statement ② is correct. # Statement ③: {e}^{frac{2}{3}} gt 2 - Given that e < 2.8 < 2sqrt{2}, we can infer e < 2^{frac{3}{2}}. - This implies {e}^{frac{2}{3}} < 2. Therefore, statement ③ is incorrect. # Statement ④: 2ln (sin frac{1}{8}+cos frac{1}{8}) ＜ frac{1}{4} - Define f(x) = e^{x} - sin x - cos x for x in [0,1]. - The derivative, f'(x) = e^{x} - cos x + sin x, is always non-negative in [0,1] because e^{x} geq 1, 0 < cos x leq 1, and 0 leq sin x < 1. - Since f'(x) geq 0 for all x in [0,1], f(x) is monotonically increasing in this interval. Thus, f(frac{1}{8}) > f(0), leading to {e}^{frac{1}{8}} - sin frac{1}{8} - cos frac{1}{8} > 0. - It follows that sin frac{1}{8} + cos frac{1}{8} < e^{frac{1}{8}}, and thus ln (sin frac{1}{8} + cos frac{1}{8}) < frac{1}{8}. - Multiplying both sides by 2, we get 2ln (sin frac{1}{8} + cos frac{1}{8}) < frac{1}{4}.

One of ( n+2 ), ( n+3 ), ( n+4 ) will always be divisible by 3, and one of ( n ), ( n+2 ), ( n+4 ) will always be divisible by 2, ensuring the product is divisible by 6. # Conclusion: [ boxed{a = frac{k}{6} text{, where ( k ) is any integer.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Chocolate and candies go into a gift set at a confectionery store at the same time.

Similarly, since there are 6 candies left after dividing them into the gift sets, the number of candies that can be divided equally is ( 86 - 6 = 80 ). Now, we need to find a number ( n ) such that: ( 64 ) chocolates can be divided into ( n ) gift sets equally, and ( 80 ) candies can be divided into ( n ) gift sets equally. This means that ( n ) must be a divisor of both 64 and 80. The prime factorization of 64 (which is a power of 2) is ( 2^6 ). The prime factorization of 80 is ( 2^4 times 5 ). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 64 and 80 will give us the largest number of gift sets that can be made, as it will be the largest number that divides both 64 and 80 without a remainder.

Given the area of the quadrilateral (ABCD) is (frac{1}{2}), we can express the area in terms of the sides and the projections: [ e left(m_1 + m_2right) = 1 ] 3. **Combining Inequalities:** Using the projections in combination with the previous inequality: [ m_1 + m_2 leq a + c leq 2 - e ] Substituting for the area formula: [ 1 = e left(m_1 + m_2right) leq e left(a + cright) leq e(2 - e) ] Therefore: [ 1 leq e(2 - e) ] 4. **Solving the Quadratic Inequality:** Simplifying the above inequality: [ 1 leq e(2 - e) implies 1 leq 2e - e^2 implies e^2 - 2e + 1 leq 0 implies (e - 1)^2 leq 0 ] The quadratic equality ((e - 1)^2 leq 0) implies: [ e - 1 = 0 implies e = 1 ] 5. **Determining (m_1) and (m_2):** Given (e = 1): - The inequality (m_1 + m_2 = a + c = 1) - Moreover, for the equality condition to hold, we should have (m_1 = a) and (m_2 = c) 6. **Calculating (AC):** Now we know: [ a + c = 1 implies (a + c)^2 = 1^2 = 1 ] And since (alpha = gamma = 90^circ) as per right-angle triangles the scenario presents: [ AC^2 = (a + c)^2 + e^2 ] Putting the values we get: [ AC^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 ] Hence, [ AC = sqrt{2} ] So the required length of the diagonal (AC) is: (boxed{sqrt{2}})"},{"instruction":"Which of the following statements is correct?

Let the endpoints be (x,0) on AB and (0,y) on AD. Since the segment's length is 4, the equation for the segment is x^2 + y^2 = 16. Using the midpoint formula, the midpoint of such a segment is left(frac{x}{2}, frac{y}{2}right). The distance d from the origin (0,0) to this midpoint is: [ d = sqrt{left(frac{x}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{y}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{x^2+y^2}{4}} = sqrt{frac{16}{4}} = 2. ] Thus, the midpoints for the segments from one vertex form a quarter-circle of radius 2 centered at each vertex. The area of one such quarter-circle is frac{1}{4}pi (2^2) = pi. Since there are four vertices, the entire area enclosed by all midpoints is: [ 4 times pi = 4pi. ] Each quarter-circle overlaps adjacent ones along their radii, so the union is still the full square area (since radius 2 extends halfway across the square).

For x leq -3, f(x) = -(x-1) - (x+3) = -2x - 2. 2. For -3 < x < 1, f(x) = -(x-1) + (x+3) = 4. 3. For x geq 1, f(x) = (x-1) + (x+3) = 2x + 2.

Since the sum of angles in any triangle is pi radians, we have A + B + C = pi. Substituting A + B = 5C into this equation, we get 5C + C = pi, which simplifies to 6C = pi. Therefore, C = frac{pi}{6}. 2. Knowing C = frac{pi}{6}, we can find sin C = frac{1}{2} and cos C = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. 3. Using the identity sin(A - C) = sin A cos C - cos A sin C and given sin(A - C) = 2sin B, we can also express sin B as sin(pi - (A + C)) = sin(A + C) due to the sine function's properties. 4. Thus, sin A cos C - cos A sin C = 2(sin A cos C + cos A sin C). 5. Simplifying the above equation, we get frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sin A = -frac{3}{2}cos A, which implies tan A = -sqrt{3}. 6.

According to the problem, among these sine values, there cannot be four distinct numbers. 4. **Analyzing Sine Values**: Since (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon) are distinct and within ((0, pi)), the sine function is continuous and one-to-one in ((0, pi)) until we consider positive range values only. 5. **Pairs of Equalities**: To meet the condition, we infer that (sin(alpha) = sin(beta)) and (sin(gamma) = sin(delta)).

However, 2^{m+1} - 6 cdot 3^n is always even and thus cannot be pm 2. - If m and n have different parity: - When n is even and m is odd: [ 3^{n+1} - 2^m = 1 implies (-1)^n = 1, , (-1)^m = -1 ] We must have: [ -1 - 2^m equiv 1 pmod{4} implies 2^m equiv -2 pmod{4} ] This is a contradiction since 2^m equiv 0 pmod{4} when m is odd. - When n is odd and m is even: [ 3^{n+1} - 2^m = -1 implies (-1)^n = -1, , (-1)^m = 1 ] We must have: [ 1 equiv -1 pmod{4} implies 1 equiv -1 pmod{4} ] This is a contradiction. Hence, we conclude that for any positive integers m and n, x_m neq y_n.

For each law, a person’s neighbors are considered to be all the people living within a circle of a certain radius centered at that person’s home. Each person can choose their own radius for the first law and a (not necessarily the same) radius for the second law. Can at least 90% of the people in this country play basketball, and at least 90% of the people be entitled to free public transportation?","output":"Let's illustrate the problem with an example where there are 10 people in the country, and their houses on a plane are situated along a straight line, ordered by increasing heights. We assume the distances between consecutive houses are as follows: 1 km, 2 km, 3 km, 4 km, 5 km, 4 km, 3 km, 2 km, 1 km. 1. **Analyzing Free Transportation Eligibility:** - For the free transportation criterion, a person is eligible only if they are shorter than most of their neighbors. Let us assume that the person can choose a circle of radius 100 km to determine their neighbors. - **Shortest 5 persons:** Since they can pick a radius of 100 km that covers all other houses, each of these 5 persons will have 9 neighbors. By our assumption, they are shorter than most of their neighbors (5 out of 9). - **Next 4 persons:** These individuals should choose their radius such that their neighborhood includes only one other person. This way, they are legally shorter than most (0 out of 1) of their neighbors by including only-higher individuals in their circle. - **Tallest person:** This person will have no one taller in any choice of radius and is thus not entitled to free transport. Conclusion: 9 out of 10 people (or 90%) can have free transportation. 2. **Analyzing Basketball Eligibility:** - For playing basketball, a person must be taller than most of their neighbors. - **Tallest 5 persons:** Similar to the shortest ones, these individuals can choose a circle of 100 km, including everyone else as their neighbors, ensuring they are taller than 5 out of 9 neighbors. - **Middle 4 persons:** For these, choosing neighbors to have only one shorter neighbor ensures they are taller than most (1). - **Shortest person:** There isn't any shorter for him. So, he won't qualify for playing basketball. Conclusion: 9 out of 10 people (or 90%) can play basketball. **Conclusion:** The setup confirms that it is possible for at least 90 % of the people to qualify both for basketball and free transportation, while the references ensure inclusion-exclusion criteria and spatial satisfaction are maintained.

A potential candidate with a digit sum of 23 is 599, as this is the smallest combination of digits that sum to 23 and starts with a smaller digit to potentially be the smallest prime. **Step 1**: Verify that 599 is a prime number. - We first check divisibility by 2. Since 599 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. - Next, check divisibility by 3. The digit sum of 599 is 5 + 9 + 9 = 23, which is not divisible by 3, so 599 is not divisible by 3. - Check divisibility by 5. Since 599 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. - For divisibility by 7, 11, and 13, we perform division checks: - 599 div 7 approx 85.571, not an integer. - 599 div 11 approx 54.455, not an integer. - 599 div 13 approx 46.077, not an integer.

Since the width of the foil-covered prism is 10 inches, and the figure of cubes not touching any tin foil is surrounded by the foil, we can express the dimensions of the foil-covered prism in terms of ( l ), ( w ), and ( h ) as follows: Width of foil-covered prism = ( w + 2 ) (since there is a layer of cubes touching the foil on both sides of the width), Length of foil-covered prism = ( l + 2 ), Height of foil-covered prism = ( h + 2 ).

We know that 1 km/h is equal to 1000 meters/3600 seconds (since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 3600 seconds in an hour). Relative speed in meters per second = 135 km/h * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Relative speed in meters per second = 135 * 1000 / 3600 Relative speed in meters per second = 135000 / 3600 Relative speed in meters per second = 37.5 m/s The total distance to be covered for the trains to be completely clear of each other is the sum of their lengths: Total distance = Length of train 1 + Length of train 2 Total distance = 121 meters + 165 meters Total distance = 286 meters Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to be completely clear of each other: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 286 meters / 37.5 m/s Time ≈ 7.62666667 seconds So, it will take approximately boxed{7.63} seconds for the two trains to be completely clear of each other from the moment they meet."},{"instruction":"Joey has 30 pages to read for history class tonight.

Considering the structure, each gear has n gaps and (32-n = 26) teeth remaining. 4. The problem asks us to show that one gear can be rotated relative to the other such that no gaps align with gaps from the other gear. 5. For consideration, define a gap as a position where a tooth has been removed. 6. Let's analyze the total number of positions or configurations we have for placing teeth when one gear is rotated relative to another. 7. There are 32 teeth positions in total. When the gears are aligned in the original position, let's label the positions where gaps (missing teeth) occur in the first gear as G_1, G_2, ..., G_n. Similarly, we'll denote the gaps in the second gear as H_1, H_2, ..., H_n. 8. Consider rotating the first gear by one tooth position (i.e., moving each gap position to the next tooth slot). We can do this successively 32 times until we're back to the original position, giving us 32 distinct configurations. 9. In each rotation, compute the number of gaps from the first gear that align with those from the second gear. Let d_i be the amount of positions at which gap G_i of the first gear aligns with gap H_i of the second gear. 10. There are (n^{2} = 6^{2} = 36 ) possible d_i pairings where gaps can overlap. 11. Out of the 32 configurations, investigate those that have all gaps of one gear aligned with teeth of the other gear. 12. Notice, for a set of configurations, if gaps overlap, they would overlap at specific (G_i, H_j) pairs. Since there are only 32 teeth positions and 36 possible combinations but each combination allows gear placement into distinct places, at least one placement must avoid all the gaps aligning due to Pigeonhole Principle. 13.

So: [ x_1 + x_2 = 6 quad text{and} quad x_4 + x_5 = 12 ] 4. **Finding the Median Number**: We know: [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 22.5 ] Therefore: [ x_3 = 22.5 - (x_1 + x_2) - (x_4 + x_5) = 22.5 - 6 - 12 = 4.5 ] 5. **Finding ( x_5 ) and ( x_4 )**: Since ( x_3 + x_5 ) is smaller or equal to ( x_4 + x_5 ): [ x_3 + x_5 = 11 implies 4.5 + x_5 = 11 implies x_5 = 6.5 ] Then for ( x_4 ), we use: [ x_4 + x_5 = 12 implies x_4 + 6.5 = 12 implies x_4 = 5.5 ] 6. **Finding ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 )**: For ( x_1 ): [ x_1 + x_3 = 7 implies x_1 + 4.5 = 7 implies x_1 = 2.5 ] For ( x_2 ): [ x_1 + x_2 = 6 implies 2.5 + x_2 = 6 implies x_2 = 3.5 ] 7. **Arranging the Numbers**: The numbers arranged in non-decreasing order are: [ x_1 = 2.5, quad x_2 = 3.5, quad x_3 = 4.5, quad x_4 = 5.5, quad x_5 = 6.5 ] **Conclusion**: The numbers Arnold thought of are ( frac{5}{2}, frac{7}{2}, frac{9}{2}, frac{11}{2}, frac{13}{2} ).

This implies symmetry about the point (2,0), leading to the conclusion that f(2) = 0. Therefore, option A, which states f(2)=1, is incorrect. 2. **Analyzing f(2x+4) being an even function:** Given f(2x+4) is even, we have f(2x+4) = f(-2x-4). By substituting variables, we get f(x+4) = f(-x+4), which simplifies to f(x) = f(8-x). Combining this with the result from step 1, f(x) = -f(4-x), we find that f(x+4) = -f(x), leading to f(x+8) = f(x). This indicates that f(x) has a period of 8. From the periodicity, f(2024) = f(0) and f(2020) = f(4). Applying f(x+4) = -f(x), we find f(4) = -f(0), which implies f(2024) = -f(2020).

When y=c, |MN|=|x_1-x_2|=dfrac{2b^2}{a}. According to the problem, the area of triangle MNF_2 is dfrac{1}{2} times |MN| times |F_1F_2| = c|MN| = dfrac{2b^2c}{a} = sqrt{3}. Since dfrac{c}{a} = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we solve to get b^2=1 and a^2=4. Therefore, the standard equation of ellipse C is: x^2 + dfrac{y^2}{4} = 1. (Ⅱ) When m=0, then P(0,0). Due to the symmetry of the ellipse, vec{AP} = vec{PB}, which means vec{OA} + vec{OB} = vec{0}. Therefore, when m=0, there exists a real number lambda such that vec{OA} + lambda vec{OB} = 4 vec{OP}. When m neq 0, from vec{OA} + lambda vec{OB} = 4 vec{OP}, we get vec{OP} = dfrac{1}{4} vec{OA} + dfrac{lambda}{4} vec{OB}.

From vec{AP} = 3 vec{PB}, we get x_1 = -3x_2, and 3(x_1+x_2)^2+4x_1x_2=0. Therefore, dfrac{12k^2m^2}{(k^2+4)^2} + dfrac{4(m^2-4)}{k^2+4}=0, which leads to m^2k^2+m^2-k^2-4=0. It is clear that m^2=1 does not hold, thus k^2= dfrac{4-m^2}{m^2-1}. Since k^2-m^2+4 > 0, we have dfrac{4-m^2}{m^2-1}-m^2+4 > 0, which means dfrac{(4-m^2)m^2}{m^2-1} > 0.

The recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence [ x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + x_n ] has a characteristic equation [ lambda^2 = lambda + 1. ] This hints at possibly working modulo ( m ), i.e., examining the recurrence [ lambda^2 equiv lambda + 1 pmod{m}. ] 2. **Coprime Condition**: We need to find ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( x_n equiv b^n pmod{m} ) has the property ( gcd(b^n, m) = 1 ) for all ( n ).

Let's denote this grid such that lines parallel to the sides of the grid form the x-axis and y-axis. The distance between each pair of adjacent points on the grid constitutes a unit length. 2. **Vertices of the Convex Polygon**: Let T be a convex n-gon satisfying the conditions such that all its vertices lie on the grid points.

We can simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: [frac{z}{2-i} = frac{a+bi}{2-i} = frac{(a+bi)(2+i)}{(2-i)(2+i)} = frac{(2a-2b)+(2b+a)i}{5} = frac{2a-2(-2)+a i}{5} = frac{2a+4}{5} + frac{a-4}{5}i.] For this expression to be real, the imaginary part must be zero, thus: [frac{a-4}{5} = 0 implies a = 4.] Therefore, combining our findings for a and b, we have: [z = 4 - 2i.] So, the complex number z is boxed{4 - 2i}. **(2)** Given z_{1}=overline{z}+frac{1}{m-1}-frac{7}{m+2}i, we substitute z = 4 - 2i to find z_1: [z_{1} = overline{4 - 2i} + frac{1}{m-1} - frac{7}{m+2}i = 4 + 2i + frac{1}{m-1} - frac{7}{m+2}i.] Simplifying, we get: [z_{1} = 4 + frac{1}{m-1} + left(2 - frac{7}{m+2}right)i.] For z_1 to correspond to a point in the fourth quadrant, the real part must be positive and the imaginary part must be negative. Thus, we have the system of inequalities: [left{begin{array}{l}4+frac{1}{m-1}>0,2-frac{7}{m+2}<0.end{array}right.] Solving the first inequality for m gives: [4+frac{1}{m-1}>0 implies frac{1}{m-1}>-4.] Since the denominator m-1 can be both positive and negative, and considering the behavior of the reciprocal function, we conclude that m neq 1 for the inequality to hold. Solving the second inequality for m gives: [2-frac{7}{m+2}<0 implies frac{7}{m+2}>2 implies m+2<frac{7}{2} implies m<frac{3}{2}.] However, for the inequality 2-frac{7}{m+2}<0 to hold, we also need m+2>0 implies m>-2.

This position will have a length of 0 since it only contains one element. 4. **Applying the Template:** Every time we apply the template (S) to the line and align its leftmost boundary with the leftmost burning lamp, we will toggle the state of all the lamps covered by the template. 5. **Finite Number of Positions:** Given that (S) is a finite set and at each step, the length of the current position will be less than the length of the template due to toggling, the number of possible burning positions is limited. 6. **Backward Mapping:** Moreover, each position can be uniquely mapped to its previous state by aligning the rightmost boundary of (S) with the rightmost burning lamp and toggling accordingly. 7. **Cycle Formation:** By the Pigeonhole Principle (or the theorem on finite cyclic states), since there is a finite number of positions, the initial position will eventually repeat itself after several applications of the template. 8. **Tracking the Shift:** If we track the current segment position of burning lamps on the number line, each application of (S) shifts this position usually to the right. 9. **Repetition and Two Lamp Results:** Since the process must return to the original state after cycling through all possible states, and given every application wobbles the state slightly but consistently reduces or changes the segment length, eventually all segments would align or stabilize such that exactly two lamps will burn. 10. **Conclusion:** By applying (S) in different starting positions repeatedly, ensuring to cover all possibilities, we will stably end up with two positions of burning lamps due to the cyclic behavior of positions and the finite length constraints of (S). # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The problem solution shows that applying the template (S) over a series of operations will eventually lead to exactly two lamps being lit.}} ]"},{"instruction":"A small insect climbs from point A to point B along the paths shown in the figure.

Let I be the incenter of the triangle, and M be the midpoint of arc overparen{ABC} not containing C. We introduce point N, the midpoint of AC. Connect AI and IN, and extend BI to intersect circle odot O at point L. Connect AL, NL, and NM. Since I is the incenter, L is the midpoint of arc overparen{AC} not containing B.

We need to prove that for all members to drink exactly the amount of juice they brought in any given evening, it is necessary and sufficient that the fraction of juice brought by each member does not exceed one third of the total amount. Reference Solution: 1. **Necessity of the Condition:** Consider any member of the club. The fraction of the juice consumed by this member should not exceed one third of the total volume of the juice consumed overall. Assuming the total volume consumed by all members is the sum of the volumes each member brought, this directly implies that: [ text{fraction of juice consumed} leq frac{1}{3} text{ of the total volume of juice} ] 2. **Sufficiency of the Condition:** To show sufficiency, we will prove by induction that if the condition is satisfied for ( n ) members, then it is also satisfied for ( n+3 ) members. - **Base Case (( n=3 )):** If there are exactly 3 members, the condition ( frac{1}{3} ) is trivially satisfied since each member drinks ( frac{1}{3} ) of the total juice. Hence, they can drink their brought juice by sitting once at the table as per the rules. - **Inductive Step:** - Assume there are ( n geq 4 ) members in the club and the condition holds for any group of members bringing in up to ( frac{1}{3} ) of the total juice. - The condition ensures that the distribution of juice among any three members remains within permissible limits, facilitating equal sharing in multiple sittings. Let's consider that for a certain setting, if any member brings in more juice than the required fraction, say fraction exceeds ( frac{1}{3} ): - Sit that member with two others with the least amount. They drink equal shares of their brought juice. The initially higher fraction reduces gradually, ensuring equal distribution among all members eventually. As members continue drinking such in cycles, the total consumption aligns proportionally with the brought amounts by ( n ) members. This pattern can continue ensuring the inductive hypothesis that all brought-in juice can be consumed only by sitting in a group satisfying the condition. Conclusively, if ( frac{1}{3} ) of the total brought juice per member is the limit, distribution balances efficiently among any seating of three.

The coordinates of P can be derived from the general form of a parabola. Since P is on the parabola and PF is perpendicular to the x-axis, the coordinates of P are (frac{p}{2}, p). This is because the vertex form of the parabola is (frac{p}{2}, 0), and P being on the parabola with a vertical distance p from the x-axis gives us P(frac{p}{2}, p). 2. **Determining the Slope of OP and PQ:** Given that PQ is perpendicular to OP, we first find the slope of OP, denoted as k_{OP}. Since O is the origin (0,0) and P is (frac{p}{2}, p), the slope k_{OP} = frac{p - 0}{frac{p}{2} - 0} = 2. Since PQ is perpendicular to OP, the slope of PQ, denoted as k_{PQ}, is the negative reciprocal of k_{OP}. Therefore, k_{PQ} = -frac{1}{2}. 3. **Equation of Line PQ:** With k_{PQ} = -frac{1}{2} and knowing that P(frac{p}{2}, p) lies on PQ, we can write the equation of line PQ as y - p = -frac{1}{2}(x - frac{p}{2}). 4. **Finding x When y=0 (Intersection with x-axis):** Setting y=0 in the equation of PQ, we solve for x: 0 - p = -frac{1}{2}(x - frac{p}{2}) Solving this gives x = frac{5p}{2}. 5. **Given |FQ| = 6 and Solving for p:** Since F is on the x-axis and |FQ| = 6, we have the distance from F to Q as 6. Given F is at (frac{p}{2}, 0), the distance |FQ| = frac{5p}{2} - frac{p}{2} = 6. Solving for p, we get p = 3. 6. **Finding the Directrix Equation:** The directrix of a parabola y^{2} = 2px is at x = -frac{p}{2}.

(1) Find the value of tan(A + B). (2) Calculate the area of triangle ABC.","output":"(1) Since tan A + tan B = -tan A tan B, we can rewrite it as tan A + tan B = 1 - tan A tan B. Therefore, using the tangent addition formula: tan(A + B) = frac{tan A + tan B}{1 - tan A tan B} = frac{1 - tan A tan B}{1 - tan A tan B} = 1. So for sub-question (1), we have tan(A + B) = 1, which means A + B = boxed{45^circ} since the tangent of 45^circ is 1.

Rearrange the equation: b^2 + 2sqrt{2} b + 4 - 1 = 0, b^2 + 2sqrt{2}b + 3 = 0. Now we solve for b by factoring: (b + sqrt{2})^2 = 0, b = -sqrt{2}. However, b cannot be negative as it represents a side length, so this equation has no valid solution within the given constraints. There seems to be a mistake in the original setup. Let's reassess the Law of Cosines with correct values: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos C, 1 = 4 + b^2 - 4bcos(135^circ). Firstly, we need the correct value for cos(135^circ) = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, and then we solve for b again: 1 = 4 + b^2 + 4bfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}, 1 = 4 + b^2 + 2bsqrt{2}, b^2 + 2bsqrt{2} - 3 = 0. Solve for b by either factoring or using the quadratic formula, it is apparent that: b = sqrt{2} - 1 quad text{or} quad b = -sqrt{2} + 1. Since side b must be positive, we select b = sqrt{2} - 1.

Let's proceed step-by-step. 1. **Identify Centers and Tangency Points:** Let O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3} be the centers of the circles S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3} respectively. Let A, B, and C be the tangency points of the circles: - A is the tangency point of circles S_{2} and S_{3}, - B is the tangency point of circles S_{3} and S_{1}, - C is the tangency point of circles S_{1} and S_{2}. 2. **Intersection Points:** Consider the lines CA and CB. These lines intersect the circle S_{3} at points A_{1} and B_{1} respectively. 3. **Parallelism to Centers Lines:** According to the previous problem (likely using the principle of homothety or geometry of circles), we have: - B_{1} O_{3} parallel C O_{1} - A_{1} O_{3} parallel C O_{2} 4. **Collinearity of Centers:** Since O_{1}, C, O_{2} lie on a straight line (the line connecting centers of circles that are tangent to each other at C), the corresponding points of intersection on circle S_{3}, namely A_{1}, O_{3}, B_{1}, must also lie on a straight line. 5. **Diameter Assertion:** Because the points A_{1}, O_{3}, B_{1} lie on a straight line, A_{1}B_{1} must be a straight line through the center O_{3} of the circle S_{3}. Thus, A_{1}B_{1} forms a diameter of the circle S_{3}. # Conclusion: Therefore, the points A_{1} and B_{1} are indeed the endpoints of the diameter of the circle S_{3}.

Since ( S ) is a finite subset of ( [0,1] ), ( V ) is a finite-dimensional vector space over ( mathbb{Q} ). 2. **Basis of ( V )**: If ( V = mathbb{Q} ), then all elements of ( S ) are already rational, and we are done. Suppose ( V neq mathbb{Q} ). Then, there exists a basis ( {1, v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n} ) for ( V ) over ( mathbb{Q} ), where ( v_i in S ). 3. **Representation of elements in ( S )**: Each ( x in S ) can be written as a linear combination of the basis elements: [ x = a_0 + a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + cdots + a_n v_n ] where ( a_i in mathbb{Q} ). 4. **Maximal coefficient of ( v_1 )**: Consider the element ( x in S ) whose coefficient of ( v_1 ) is maximal. Let this element be ( x = a_0 + a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + cdots + a_n v_n ) with ( a_1 ) being the maximal coefficient of ( v_1 ) among all elements in ( S ). 5. **Property of ( S )**: By the given property of ( S ), there exist ( a, b in S cup {0, 1} ) with ( a, b neq x ) such that ( x = frac{a + b}{2} ). 6. **Expression for ( a ) and ( b )**: Write ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of the basis: [ a = b_0 + b_1 v_1 + b_2 v_2 + cdots + b_n v_n ] [ b = c_0 + c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + cdots + c_n v_n ] 7. **Average of ( a ) and ( b )**: Since ( x = frac{a + b}{2} ), we have: [ a_0 + a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + cdots + a_n v_n = frac{(b_0 + b_1 v_1 + b_2 v_2 + cdots + b_n v_n) + (c_0 + c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + cdots + c_n v_n)}{2} ] Simplifying, we get: [ a_0 + a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + cdots + a_n v_n = frac{b_0 + c_0}{2} + frac{b_1 + c_1}{2} v_1 + frac{b_2 + c_2}{2} v_2 + cdots + frac{b_n + c_n}{2} v_n ] 8. **Coefficient comparison**: By comparing coefficients, we get: [ a_1 = frac{b_1 + c_1}{2} ] Since ( a_1 ) is maximal, both ( b_1 ) and ( c_1 ) must be equal to ( a_1 ). This implies that the coefficients of ( v_1 ) in ( a ) and ( b ) are also ( a_1 ). 9. **Contradiction**: This process can be repeated for the coefficients of ( v_2, v_3, ldots, v_n ). Eventually, we find that all coefficients must be rational, leading to a contradiction if any ( v_i ) were irrational. 10. **Conclusion**: Therefore, all elements of ( S ) must be rational.

When all three pipes are opened, they fill the cistern in 40 minutes. The combined rate of pipes A and B minus the rate of pipe C equals the rate at which the cistern fills when all three are open, which is 1/40 of the cistern per minute. So, we have the equation: A + B - C = 1/40 Substituting the rates of A and B, we get: (1/60) + (1/80) - C = 1/40 To solve for C, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60, 80, and 40 is 240.

With all these variables, find the original rate of sugar in USD per kg before the sale, discount, tax, and exchange rate fluctuation.","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. The price of sugar decreased by 25 / 4 %, which is 6.25%. 2. This reduction allowed a man to buy 1 kg more for 120. 3. He received a 10% discount on the final cost. 4. There was a 15% tax on the purchase of sugar. 5. The currency exchange rate increased by 5%. First, we need to find the new price of sugar after the 6.25% reduction that allowed the man to buy 1 kg more for 120. Let the original price of sugar per kg be ( P ) USD. After a 6.25% reduction, the new price per kg is ( P - frac{6.25}{100}P = P(1 - frac{6.25}{100}) = P(1 - 0.0625) = P(0.9375) ). With the new price, the man can buy ( frac{120}{P(0.9375)} ) kg of sugar. Since he can buy 1 kg more for 120 with the reduced price, we can set up the following equation: ( frac{120}{P(0.9375)} = frac{120}{P} + 1 ) Now, let's solve for ( P ): ( frac{120}{P(0.9375)} = frac{120}{P} + 1 ) ( frac{120}{0.9375P} = frac{120}{P} + 1 ) ( frac{120}{0.9375P} - frac{120}{P} = 1 ) ( frac{120P - 120(0.9375P)}{0.9375P^2} = 1 ) ( frac{120P - 112.5P}{0.9375P^2} = 1 ) ( frac{7.5P}{0.9375P^2} = 1 ) ( 7.5 = 0.9375P ) ( P = frac{7.5}{0.9375} ) ( P = 8 ) USD per kg (original price of sugar before the reduction) Now, let's consider the 10% discount and the 15% tax: The 10% discount reduces the price to ( 8 times (1 - 0.10) = 8 times 0.90 = 7.2 ) USD per kg. The 15% tax increases the price to ( 7.2 times (1 + 0.15) = 7.2 times 1.15 = 8.28 ) USD per kg. Finally, we need to account for the 5% increase in the currency exchange rate: The original price in USD before the exchange rate fluctuation would be ( 8.28 div (1 + 0.05) = 8.28 div 1.05 ).

According to the problem, each person received 9 apples less after the 45 people joined. So we can set up the following equation: 1430/x - 1430/(x + 45) = 9 To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator and subtract the two fractions: (1430(x + 45) - 1430x) / (x(x + 45)) = 9 Expanding the numerator gives us: (1430x + 64350 - 1430x) / (x(x + 45)) = 9 The 1430x terms cancel out, leaving us with: 64350 / (x(x + 45)) = 9 Now we can multiply both sides by x(x + 45) to get rid of the denominator: 64350 = 9x(x + 45) Expanding the right side gives us: 64350 = 9x^2 + 405x Dividing both sides by 9 to simplify: 7150 = x^2 + 45x Now we have a quadratic equation: x^2 + 45x - 7150 = 0 We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula.

Knowing ( A = 9 ) and ( D = 0 ), let's analyze the remaining sum of the digits: - The sum ( B + C ) also needs to be divisible by 9 (as deduced earlier). 6. Since ( B ) and ( C ) are individual digits and non-equal to 9 or 0 (since digits can't repeat in this problem): - The possible digits for ( B ) and ( C ) must sum to 9, since they’re less than 9 and greater than 0. [ 1 + 8 = 9 2 + 7 = 9 3 + 6 = 9 4 + 5 = 9 ] The pairs that satisfy this condition between ( B ) and ( C ) are ( (8, 1), (7, 2), (6, 3), ) and ( (5, 4) ). 7. Finally, putting all together, we find the sum of the four digits: - For all combinations ( (A, B, C, D) ), the sum of all digits ( (A + B + C + D) ): [ 9 + (B + C) + 0 = 9 + 9 + 0 = 18 ] 8. This verifies no matter what digits ( B ) and ( C ) are as long as they sum to 9, the sum of all digits will always be 18. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{18} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the hyperbola frac {x^{2}}{12} frac {y^{2}}{4}=1 with its right focus as F.

First, we convert their speeds from kmph to m/s by multiplying by (1000 m / 1 km) and dividing by (3600 s / 1 hour): Speed of the first train in m/s = 42 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) = 42 * 1000 / 3600 = 11.67 m/s (approximately) Speed of the second train in m/s = 30 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) = 30 * 1000 / 3600 = 8.33 m/s (approximately) The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds in m/s: Relative speed = 11.67 m/s + 8.33 m/s = 20 m/s Now, we calculate the distance they cover in 20 seconds at this relative speed: Distance = Relative speed * Time = 20 m/s * 20 s = 400 m This distance is the sum of the lengths of both trains. We know the length of the second train is 280 m, so we can find the length of the first train (L1) by subtracting the length of the second train from the total distance: L1 = Total distance - Length of the second train L1 = 400 m - 280 m L1 = 120 m Therefore, the length of the first train is boxed{120} meters."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between the sum of the largest number and the least number written with the digits 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, and 5, when both numbers are squared?","output":"To find the difference between the sum of the largest number and the least number when both are squared, we first need to determine the largest and smallest numbers that can be formed with the digits 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, and 5. The largest number is formed by arranging the digits in descending order: 98765421. The smallest number is formed by arranging the digits in ascending order: 12456789. Now, we need to square both numbers and then find the difference between the two squares. Largest number squared: (98765421)² Smallest number squared: (12456789)² Let's calculate the squares: (98765421)² = 9754610577890641 (12456789)² = 155132821597521 Now, we find the difference between the two squares: 9754610577890641 - 155132821597521 = 9599477756293120 So, the difference between the sum of the largest number and the least number when both are squared is boxed{9599477756293120} ."},{"instruction":"Given that overrightarrow {AB}=(x，2x) and overrightarrow {AC}=(3x，2), find the range of x if ∠BAC is an obtuse angle.","output":"Since overrightarrow {AB}=(x，2x) and overrightarrow {AC}=(-3x，2), If ∠BAC is an obtuse angle, Then overrightarrow {AB}cdot overrightarrow {AC} = -3x^2+4x<0 Solving the inequality gives xin(-∞，0)cup( frac {4}{3}，+∞) However, when x=- frac {1}{3}, overrightarrow {AB}=- frac {1}{3} overrightarrow {AC}, which does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, xin(-∞，- frac {1}{3})cup(- frac {1}{3}，0)cup( frac {4}{3}，+∞) Thus, the answer is xinboxed{(-∞，- frac {1}{3})cup(- frac {1}{3}，0)cup( frac {4}{3}，+∞)} Since ∠BAC is an obtuse angle, we have overrightarrow {AB}cdot overrightarrow {AC}<0. Using the given coordinates of the two vectors, we construct an inequality. However, we must exclude the case where the vectors are in opposite directions, which occurs when x=- frac {1}{3}. Therefore, the final answer is xinboxed{(-∞，- frac {1}{3})cup(- frac {1}{3}，0)cup( frac {4}{3}，+∞)}. This problem tests your understanding of the dot product representing the angle between two vectors. In particular, note that when x=- frac {1}{3}, overrightarrow {AB}=- frac {1}{3} overrightarrow {AC}, which does not satisfy the condition that ∠BAC is an obtuse angle."},{"instruction":"Let a, b, and c be three distinct lines, and alpha, beta, and gamma be three distinct planes.
