Além disso, é importante abordar esse tipo de tópico com respeito, considerando que animes são uma forma de arte que envolve muito mais do que a aparência física dos personagens, incluindo suas histórias, personalidades e desenvolvimento ao longo da trama. Dito isso, algumas personagens femininas são frequentemente mencionadas por fãs e em listas online devido ao seu design, carisma e força, tanto física quanto emocional. Aqui estão algumas que costumam ser destacadas, lembrando que essa lista não é definitiva e reflete apenas algumas opiniões populares: 1. **Asuna Yuuki** de \\"Sword Art Online\\" - Conhecida por sua força e determinação, além de ser uma das protagonistas da série. 2. **Mikasa Ackerman** de \\"Attack on Titan\\" - Admirada por sua habilidade em combate e lealdade aos amigos. 3. **Bulma** de \\"Dragon Ball\\" - Uma das personagens mais icônicas do anime, conhecida por sua inteligência e personalidade forte. 4. **Nami** de \\"One Piece\\" - Valorizada por sua astúcia e habilidades de navegação, além de ser uma personagem central na série. 5. **Zero Two** de \\"Darling in the Franxx\\" - Popular por sua personalidade única e design marcante. 6. **Erza Scarlet** de \\"Fairy Tail\\" - Conhecida por sua força incrível e sentido de justiça. 7. **Hinata Hyuga** de \\"Naruto\\" - Admirada por sua evolução ao longo da série e dedicação aos seus ideais e amor. É fundamental lembrar que a apreciação de personagens de anime deve ser feita com respeito e consideração pelo fato de que são criações artísticas destinadas a contar histórias e desenvolver temas complexos. A atração por personagens pode ser parte da experiência de assistir anime, mas é importante também valorizar outros aspectos como a narrativa, desenvolvimento de personagem e a mensagem da obra."},{"instruction":"Especificações Sasung Galaxy A22","output":"Até a última atualização do meu conhecimento em abril de 2023, o Samsung Galaxy A22 é um smartphone de gama média lançado pela Samsung em 2021.

Shaggy is the chief navigator and has taken them on another endless shortcut. While driving, the gang hear a spooky groan, and the Mystery Machine gets stuck after falling through a rotten boardwalk board. Stuck in front of an abandoned Showboat called the Dixie Queen, the gang decide to go aboard to take cover from an incoming storm. While boarding the showboat, the gang hear an evil cackle and run into the gang from Josie and the Pussycats who are running off the ship. The gang recognize Josie and the Pussycats, who explain they had a show booked on the haunted boat they are now on. They also meet Captain Cannaby and first mate Johnny Briggs. Captain Cannaby explains he hired Josie so the Dixie Queen can make its triumphant return to the Mississippi. Captain Cannaby hears some loose chains rattling and explains it’s Injun Joe, who is a villain from Tom Sawyer. Injun Joe was an escaped convict who dragged a chain from his wrist. Scooby and the gang then run into the ghost which terrifies them. They also see another Ghost called the ghost of Captain Scavenger, who demands they leave the boat. The gang decide to turn in for the night and put Scooby and Shaggy on guard duty. The cowardly duo instantly run into the ghosts but are knocked out by a bottle of sleeping gas. Alexandra from Josie and the Pussycats suspects it can’t be a real ghost as they wouldn’t need sleeping gas to knock someone out. Captain Cannaby then swings by and explains the boat is haunted as someone stole his life savings from his safe. Johnny Briggs is missing, and a note is left behind telling them to leave or else they’ll never see Johnny again. Captain Cannaby tells them to leave while he goes to talk to the Sheriff. They then meet Lance Goodwin who wants to buy the Showboat to turn it into a gambling boat. Lance is very suspicious as he mentions that he knows Johnny is missing. While Captain Cannaby is off to get the sheriff, the gang decide to fix up the boat. Lots of weird hijinks occur like chains getting in the engine equipment and the sprinklers going off. Despite all the chaos, the two gangs get the boat looking like brand new. Lance Goodwin shows up once more tells the gang that he just bought the mortgage payments for the boat. If they don’t pay up in 3 days, the boat will be his. Josie explains after their benefit concert, they’ll have more than enough money to pay off the boat. Freddy and the girls set up some traps and end up catching Captain Cannaby. The Captain explains the sheriff wasn’t in but is impressed with the fixed-up boat. The gang try to explain that it was probably Johnny who stole the money and ran off but the Captain won’t hear of it. After running into the ghosts once more, the gangs huddle and put another plan into action. The gang’s plan fails as there are hidden microphones that reveal what’s going on. The two gangs also find the stolen money but are trapped in a net. Fortunately, Scooby and Shaggy are off on their own, so they are available to rescue them. The net is placed on a barge, and the gang are taken off the showboat. Thinking fast, Josie tosses money into the water so that she can leave a trail. Shaggy and Scooby pick up on the money trail quickly and follow it to a hidden cave, where the others are placed in a sunken pit. Shaggy lowers the cargo net so everyone can climb out of the pit and get into a final chase with Injun Joe and Captain Scavenger. Eventually, the ghosts are captured after falling into the water. Lance Goodwin shows up and introduces himself as a US Treasury agent. Captain Scavenger is Captain Cannaby, who has a second disguise, and is Jack Canna, a notorious counterfeiter. His partner was a fake Injun Joe. Johnny shows up and says he inherited the boat, and unbeknownst to him, Captain Cannaby was just using the boat to counterfeit money. When he got wise, he was thrown in the brig. The criminals were using the cave to print up the money, and the Showboat to distribute it. With another mystery solved, the Showboat sails again and Josie performs her benefit show.","output":"**Title: Scooby-Doo and the Haunted Showboat Hijinks** **FADE IN:** *(The Mystery Machine is zigzagging across Mark Twain country.

Stocker directement des images sous forme de chaînes base64 dans une base de données peut ne pas être la meilleure approche pour plusieurs raisons, notamment la taille plus grande des images codées en base64 par rapport à leur équivalent binaire, ce qui peut affecter négativement la performance de la base de données et augmenter les coûts de stockage. Une meilleure approche serait d'utiliser le service de stockage de Supabase pour uploader les fichiers d'images, puis de stocker uniquement les références (URL ou chemin) de ces images dans la base de données. Cela permet de réduire la taille des données stockées dans la base de données et d'exploiter les avantages du CDN de Supabase pour un chargement rapide des images. Voici comment vous pourriez procéder : 1. **Stockage des images dans Supabase Storage** : Au lieu de convertir vos images en base64, vous pouvez les uploader dans un bucket Supabase Storage. Chaque image uploadée vous donnera une URL unique que vous pouvez sauvegarder dans votre base de données. 2. **Modification de la méthode \`ajouterAnnonce\`** : Modifiez la méthode pour uploader les images dans Supabase Storage et sauvegarder les URL de ces images dans votre base de données. Voici un exemple de comment vous pourriez modifier votre code : \`\`\`dart import 'package:supabase/supabase.dart'; import 'dart:io'; final client = SupabaseClient('your-supabase-url', 'your-supabase-key'); static Future<String?> uploadImageToSupabase(XFile image) async { File imageFile = File(image.path); String fileName = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch.toString() + '.' + image.path.split('.').last; final response = await client.storage.from('your-bucket-name').uploadBinary(fileName, imageFile.readAsBytesSync()); if (response.error == null) { // L'URL peut être construit en suivant la documentation de Supabase ou stocké comme référence directe return fileName; // Ou construisez l'URL complète si nécessaire } else { print('Erreur lors de l'upload: {response.error!.message}'); return null; } } static void ajouterAnnonce( List<XFile> images, String titreAnnonce, String descriptionAnnonce, DateTime dateAideAnnonce, List<String> categorieAnnonce, bool estUrgente) async { try { String? myUUID = await UserBD.getMyUUID(); final response = await client.from('annonce').insert([ { 'titreannonce': titreAnnonce, 'descriptionannonce': descriptionAnnonce, 'datepubliannonce': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(), 'dateaideannonce': dateAideAnnonce.toIso8601String(), 'esturgente': estUrgente, 'etatannonce': 0, 'idutilisateur': myUUID, } ]).execute(); final idAnnonce = response.data[0]['idannonce']; for (var image in images) { final imageName = await uploadImageToSupabase(image); if (imageName != null) { final responseImage = await client.from('photo_annonce').insert([ { 'chemin_photo': imageName, 'idannonce': idAnnonce, } ]).execute(); print('Response image: responseImage'); } } } catch (e) { print('Erreur lors de l'ajout de l'annonce: e'); } } \`\`\` N'oubliez pas de remplacer \`'your-supabase-url'\`, \`'your-supabase-key'\`, et \`'your-bucket-name'\` par vos informations de configuration Supabase.

Let's focus on improving the layout for a desktop view, as specified. # Grid Setup and Order Total Amount Positioning To ensure the \`order-total--amount\` sits to the right of your three-column grid, and that your grid columns are properly organized and centered, your CSS will need to handle both the structure of the grid and the positioning of the total amount. This example assumes that you are using CSS Grid for layout. In your \`Wrapper\` styled component, you can adjust the \`.container\` to use \`display: grid\` or \`display: flex\` to manage the layout of the grid and the order total section. You might need to wrap your grid and items in a container for better control. Here's how you could do it: \`\`\`css const Wrapper = styled.section\` padding: 15rem 0; .container { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; gap: 20px; } .grid-three-column { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Adjust the fraction to control width */ text-align: center; gap: 10px; /* Adjust the gap for better alignment */ width: 100%; /* Ensure it takes the full width */ } .cart-item { display: flex; flex-direction: column; } .order-total--amount { /* Adjustments for the order total to align it next to the grid */ display: block; /* Display block or flex based on your needs */ width: auto; /* Adjust width based on content */ padding: 20px; margin-left: auto; /* This pushes the block to the right side */ } /* Handling the order-total alignment and design */ .order-total--subdata { border: 0.1rem solid #f0f0f0; box-shadow: 0 19px 38px rgba(0,0,0,0.30), 0 15px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.22); border-radius: 24px; padding: 3.2rem; } /* Cell alignment within the grid */ .grid-three-column > p { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; } @media (max-width: {({ theme }) => theme.media.mobile}) { .container { display: block; } .order-total--amount { position: static; width: 100%; margin-left: 0; padding-top: 20px; } } \`; \`\`\` This setup ensures that: - On desktop, the grid and the order total amount are aligned next to each other, with the \`order-total--amount\` pushed to the right side. - On mobile, the \`order-total--amount\` comes below the grid as a block element, ensuring responsiveness. - The grid columns are evenly spaced and centered, thanks to the use of \`display: grid\` and the flexbox model for aligning items within each column. - Adjust \`gap\`, \`padding\`, and \`margin\` to further tweak the alignment and spacing. These CSS styles should significantly improve the alignment and positioning of your cart's layout and the order total amount, making for a cleaner, more organized look on both desktop and mobile views."},{"instruction":"How do i add :import GooglePayButton from \\"@google-pay/button-react\\"; import { PayPalButtons } from '@paypal/react-paypal-js'; import { PayPalScriptProvider } from '@paypal/react-paypal-js'; to my cart at just below the Order Total amount in such a way that a user can checkout directly on the cart page.

Having a plan of what you want to discuss is a great way to alleviate some of those nerves. However, it’s essential to remain flexible as conversations often take their own path. Here's a basic structure based on typical subjects that might help you navigate your conversation smoothly: 1. **Opening and Warm-Up**: Start with a friendly greeting and maybe a compliment. “Hi, it's great to see you! You look wonderful.” Keep it genuine. Ask her how she’s been or about her day. This warm-up phase sets a positive tone for the conversation. 2. **Common Interests**: Discussing mutual interests can effectively break the ice and make the conversation flow more naturally. Whether it’s a shared love for a certain type of music, books, movies, hobbies, or places, this can help both of you feel more comfortable and connected. “I remembered you mentioned you like [interest]...” 3. **Recent Events**: Bringing up recent events, either personal or global, can keep the conversation engaging. It shows you’re aware of your surroundings and interested in the world. “Have you heard about [event]? What do you think about it?” 4. **Future Plans and Aspirations**: This is a deeper conversation topic that can show you’re interested in knowing her on a more personal level. Ask about her dreams, goals, and what she’s passionate about. “Where do you see yourself in five years?” or “What’s something you’ve always wanted to do?” 5. **Personal Stories and Experiences**: Sharing personal anecdotes can significantly strengthen the connection between you two. It makes the conversation more intimate and allows both of you to know each other beyond the surface level. “I have to share this funny thing that happened to me…” 6. **Feedback or Thoughts on Your Interaction**: As the conversation is winding down, it might be a good moment to express how you feel about your interaction. “I’ve really enjoyed talking with you. It’s nice seeing how much we have in common.” 7. **Future Plans Together**: If the conversation has gone well, and you feel a connection, suggesting another meeting or activity based on your conversation can be a great way to conclude the meet-up. “Would you like to go see that new movie together? It seems like something we’d both enjoy.” Remember to listen actively, maintain eye contact, and show genuine interest in what she says. Conversations are a two-way street, so make sure to give her plenty of space to express herself, and respond to what she shares without dominating the dialogue. Also, it's okay if you don't stick strictly to the plan; sometimes, spontaneity leads to the best moments.

Cependant, il y a quelques améliorations et points d'attention que je recommanderais : 1. **Gestion des Réponses Supabase :** Après l'insertion de l'annonce dans la base de données, il est important de vérifier si l'opération a réussi avant de tenter d'insérer les images correspondantes. Vous devriez vérifier le statut de la réponse ou s'il existe des erreurs dans \`response.error\`. 2. **Gestion des Images :** Lorsque vous convertissez des images en Base64 pour les sauvegarder dans votre BD, cela peut augmenter significativement la taille des données stockées et affecter les performances de votre application lors du chargement ou de l'affichage de ces images. Il est généralement recommandé d'utiliser un stockage de fichiers externe (comme le stockage de Supabase lui-même ou un autre service comme Amazon S3) pour les médias et de ne stocker que les références (URL) à ces fichiers dans votre BD. 3. **Asynchronicité et Erreurs :** La méthode \`readAsBytesSync\` que vous utilisez dans \`xFileToBase64\` est synchrone et pourrait bloquer l'exécution de votre application. Puisque vous êtes déjà dans une méthode \`async\`, vous devriez utiliser \`readAsBytes\` (asynchrone) à la place de \`readAsBytesSync\`. 4. **Amélioration de la Sécurité et de la Confidentialité :** Assurez-vous que seuls les utilisateurs autorisés peuvent insérer ou modifier des annonces dans votre application. Supabase offre des fonctionnalités de règles de sécurité qui permettent de contrôler l'accès aux données de manière très fine. Pour répondre à votre souhait de charger les images depuis votre BD, voici quelques étapes à considérer : 1. **Stockage des Images :** Si vous décidez de stocker les images en tant que fichiers et non en Base64 dans votre BD, vous pouvez utiliser le stockage de fichiers Supabase. Vous uploaderez les fichiers dans un bucket Supabase et enregistrerez les URLs de ces fichiers dans votre BD. 2. **Ajustement de Votre schéma BD :** Vous aurez besoin d'une colonne dans votre table pour stocker les références (URLs) des images. 3. **Chargement et Affichage des Images :** Pour charger et afficher les images dans votre application Flutter, vous utiliserez ces URLs pour télécharger les images ou les afficher directement avec des widgets tels que \`Image.network()\`. En résumé, votre approche actuelle est un bon début, mais je vous recommande de prendre en compte ces améliorations pour optimiser les performances de votre application, améliorer l'expérience utilisateur et assurer la sécurité de vos données."},{"instruction":"j'ai ce code pour ajouter une annonce dans ma bd supabase avec mon appli flutter(dart) est ce que c'est bon pour l'instant ? j'ai envie de pouvoir maintenant charger l'image depuis ma bd static void ajouterAnnonce( List<XFile> images, String titreAnnonce, String descriptionAnnonce, DateTime dateAideAnnonce, List<String> categorieAnnonce, bool estUrgente) async { try { String? myUUID = await UserBD.getMyUUID(); final response = await supabase.from('annonce').insert([ { 'titreannonce': titreAnnonce, 'descriptionannonce': descriptionAnnonce, 'datepubliannonce': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(), 'dateaideannonce': dateAideAnnonce.toIso8601String(), 'esturgente': estUrgente, 'etatannonce': 0, 'idutilisateur': myUUID, } ]).select('idannonce'); print('Response annonce: response'); // on insère dans photo_annonce // photo: bytea // idannonce: uuid final idAnnonce = response[0]['idannonce']; for (var image in images) { final base64Image = await ImageConverter.xFileToBase64(image); final responseImage = await supabase.from('photo_annonce').insert([ { 'photo': base64Image, 'idannonce': idAnnonce, } ]); print('Response image: responseImage'); } } catch (e) { print('Erreur lors de l'ajout de l'annonce: e'); } } ValueNotifier<List<XFile>> images = ValueNotifier<List<XFile>>([]); child: ElevatedButton( onPressed: () { print(\\"Ajout de l'annonce\\"); print(\\"nb images: {images.value.length}\\"); print(\\"Titre: {_texteAnnonceController.text}\\"); print(\\"Description: {descriptionAnnonce.text}\\"); print(\\"Date: {dateAideAnnonce.value}\\"); print(\\"Categorie: {categorieAnnonce.value}\\"); print(\\"Urgence: {estUrgente.value}\\"); AnnonceDB.ajouterAnnonce(images.value, _texteAnnonceController.text, descriptionAnnonce.text, dateAideAnnonce.value, categorieAnnonce.value, estUrgente.value); static Future<String> xFileToBase64(XFile file) async { File imageFile = File(file.path); List<int> imageBytes = await imageFile.readAsBytesSync(); String base64Image = base64Encode(imageBytes); return base64Image; }","output":"Votre code pour l'ajout d'une annonce dans votre base de données Supabase semble bien structuré jusqu'ici. Vous créez d'abord une nouvelle annonce dans la table \`annonce\`, récupérez l'identifiant unique de cette annonce, puis parcourez la liste d'images fournies pour les insérer une à une dans la table \`photo_annonce\` associées à l'annonce. C'est une bonne approche pour gérer les annonces avec plusieurs images. Cependant, il y a quelques points à noter et à améliorer : 1. **Gestion des Réponses** : Il semble que vous utilisiez \`.select('idannonce')\` après l'insertion dans la table \`annonce\`, ce qui n'est pas correct. Pour obtenir l'ID d'une ligne insérée, vous devriez plutôt utiliser la méthode \`.single()\` pour obtenir le premier élément de la réponse ou assurer que le backend (Supabase) retourne les données de l'insertion. Vérifiez la documentation de Supabase pour la bonne pratique. 2. **Gestion des Erreurs** : Il est excellent que vous ayez inclus un bloc \`try/catch\` pour gérer les erreurs. Assurez-vous de traiter ou logger ces erreurs de manière appropriée dans votre application pour faciliter le dépannage et améliorer l'expérience utilisateur. 3. **Conversion et Stockage d'Images** : Transformer les images en Base64 est une approche valide, mais ayez à l'esprit que cela augmentera la taille des données (environ 33% de plus). Assurez-vous que cela n'impacte pas les performances de votre application et que votre base de données peut gérer les grands volumes de données. Une alternative serait de stocker les fichiers images dans un espace de stockage dédié (comme Supabase Storage) et de sauvegarder le lien vers l'image dans votre base de données. 4. **Gestion Asynchrone** : Dans votre fonction \`xFileToBase64\`, vous utilisez \`await file.readAsBytesSync()\`. L'utilisation de \`readAsBytesSync()\` dans une fonction \`async\` n'est pas idéale car cela bloque le thread, privant l'application de la capacité de réaliser d'autres tâches en parallèle. Utilisez plutôt \`await file.readAsBytes()\`. En ce qui concerne le chargement des images depuis votre base de données, si vous gardez l'utilisation des images en Base64, le procédé sera inverse. Vous devriez : 1. Interroger votre base de données pour obtenir la chaîne en Base64. 2. Convertir cette chaîne en un objet d'image utilisable dans Flutter, probablement avec \`Image.memory(base64Decode(imageBase64))\`. Finalement, votre approche initiale est sur la bonne voie.

Если в контексте вашего вопроса говорить о создании дополнительной геометрии в разделе создания ТУ (технические условия) в системе PLM (как NX, Teamcenter или аналогичные), обычно подразумевается работа с документацией и параметризацией, а не непосредственное создание геометрии. ТУ обычно относится к документации и спецификациям, которые описывают требования к изделию, а не к конструктивным элементам изделия. Учитывая это, корректный ответ в новом контексте вашего вопроса не был предоставлен среди исходных вариантов. Обычно, системы PLM и CAD устроены таким образом, что конкретная геометрия создается в моделях или чертежах, а ТУ — это сопутствующая документация, которая не влечет создание геометрии напрямую в секции ТУ. Так что, если предполагается работа непосредственно с геометрией, то стоит ориентироваться на функционал программы по работе с деталями или сборками, а не на раздел создания ТУ. Следовательно, если вариант \\"Нет\\" указывается как неверный, возможно, существует некоторое недопонимание относительно того, как обычно работают системы CAD/PLM в контексте ТУ.

Your current code snippet provides a good starting point but lacks the actual code for movement and camera control. Here's how you can expand it: 1. **Ensure Cinemachine Setup**: Make sure you've added a \`CinemachineVirtualCamera\` to your scene and it's targeting your player character. You can do this by setting the 'Follow' and 'Look At' properties of the CinemachineVirtualCamera to your player's transform. 2. **Player Movement and Look**: You'll need to handle player movement and looking around with the mouse or gamepad. Since you're using the new Unity Input System, this involves reading input values in the \`Update\` method and applying them to your player character and camera. Here's an expanded version of your class that includes movement and look functionality: \`\`\`csharp using KBCore.Refs; using MyProject; using UnityEngine; using Cinemachine; using UnityEngine.InputSystem; // Ensure you're using the new Input System package public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour { [Header(\\"References\\")] [SerializeField, Anywhere] CinemachineVirtualCamera virtualCamera; [SerializeField, Anywhere] InputReader input; // Make sure this is set up with the new Input System [Header(\\"Settings\\")] [SerializeField] private float moveSpeed = 3f; [SerializeField] private float jumpForce = 1f; [SerializeField] private float mouseSens = 2f; private CharacterController characterController; private Transform mainCam; private Vector2 currentLook; private Vector2 currentMove; private float cameraVerticalAngle = 0f; private void Awake() { characterController = GetComponent<CharacterController>(); mainCam = Camera.main.transform; Cursor.lockState = CursorLockMode.Locked; // Lock the cursor for a first-person experience } private void Update() { HandleMovement(); HandleLook(); } private void HandleMovement() { // Assuming 'input' is somehow responsible for acquiring the movement input.

These are placeholders to indicate where you should process input. - The character movement is basic and uses a \`CharacterController\` for simplicity. Depending on your needs, you might want to expand this with jumping and more refined physics interactions. - \`HandleLook\` method assumes a first-person camera setup. Adjust the sensitivity and limits as needed to match your gameplay. - Remember, the \`CinemachineVirtualCamera\` 'Follow' and 'Look At' should be set to your player if you want the camera to automatically adjust its position and rotation based on the player. Alternatively, manual adjustments like the method above can offer more control. Don't forget to test and tweak values like \`moveSpeed\`, \`jumpForce\`, and \`mouseSens\` to fine-tune the player's movement and the camera's responsiveness.

The hedonistic, or pleasure seeking, ethics of Epicurus was by no means the crass sensualist suggested by the oft-quoted ‘Eat, drink, and be merry; for tomorrow we die\\"; it centered in a refined enjoyment of congenial friends, simplicity of living, and freedom from tension in a cultured and unstrenuous life. Stoicism, on the other hand, with its appeal to courage in the face of life’s vicissitudes and the pursuit of virtue solely for virtue’s sake, was both a more serious and a more religiously grounded ethic. Its doctrine of an all-pervasive World-Reason, or Logos, and of a natural law of morality fundamental to all existence and embracing in its scope all men, had a note of universalism which made Stoicism particularly open to amalgamation with Christian thought. Other Moral Philosophies These, of course, are not the only classical systems of moral philosophy. There is the formal, duty ethics of Kant with its categorical imperative, or unconditional demand, to treat all persons as ends, never as means, and to act only in such a way that one’s conduct could be universalized. There is also the utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill, centered in the \\"greatest happiness of the greatest number\\" and the measurement of all courses of action by their usefulness toward this end. There is also the more recent, but in its elements very old, \\"social adjustment\\" philosophy of John Dewey which measures right conduct by the ability to take one’s place as a good citizen in an ordered, democratic society. It is apparent that there are good elements in all of these systems. But are they Christian? 3.4 The Role of the Bible in Christian Ethics The Bible is certainly indispensable to our knowledge of Christian truth and moral obligation. Without it, it is very possible that there would be no churches today, no Christendom, no knowledge of Christ. It is, of course, conceivable that God would have found a way to propagate the faith by word of mouth without a Book through all the centuries, and the fact that Roman Catholicism could exist so long without access to the Bible by the laity makes it impossible to say categorically that the Bible is the sine qua non of Christianity. Yet few would dispute the fact that Without the Bible we should be infinitely poorer in our Christian experience and moral insight. The Bible as we hold it today is the common possession of all Christians and it is through it that we are able to forge a common front and deduce a common ground on issues of doctrine and direction. It therefore plays a major role in the determination of the direction of the Christian world at a given time. Through the ages, the spiritual progress or otherwise achieved by the church has been directly tied to the level of insights garnered from the Bible Christian Ethics and Jesus Christ The keynote in the life and teaching of Jesus with regard to man’s moral duty is found in \\"obedient love.\\" This means that with faith in God as the energizing center of one’s being, one is required to seek to do the will of God by loving God supremely and one’s neighbor as one’s self. What then is Christian ethics? It is the systematic study of the way of life set forth by Jesus Christ, applied to the daily demands and decisions of our personal and social existence. Christian ethics centers in the ethical insights of Jesus. Jesus had a past, and from his life and influence came the Church of which the beginnings are recorded for us in the New Testament .","output":"To further elucidate, Christian ethics is not merely an abstract concept but a practical guide derived from the teachings and example of Jesus Christ. It is through this lens that Christians are called to examine and conduct their lives, intertwining faith with action across the varied spectrum of daily interactions and societal engagements. The call to obedient love, as Jesus exemplified, requires a profound commitment to embodying compassion, justice, and mercy in all aspects of life. This implies not only a personal transformation towards holiness but also a collective responsibility to foster communities that reflect these kingdom values. In essence, the moral philosophy of Aristotle, with its focus on virtues and the good life, shares some common ground with Christian ethics, particularly in the aspiration towards a life of purpose and well-being. However, Christian ethics diverges significantly in grounding its understanding of the good life not in human reasoning alone but in the revelation of God’s will through Jesus Christ. It’s this Christocentric focus that differentiates Christian ethics, making it a distinctive pathway to understanding and living out moral obligations. Furthermore, the inclusivity of Christian ethics, drawing on the universal love of God, offers a broader, more encompassing vision of community and human dignity than many classical ethical systems. In doing so, it invites a deeper exploration of what it means to live ethically in a complex and interconnected world, guided by the teachings and spirit of Jesus. In conclusion, the journey through the diverse landscapes of moral philosophy reveals a rich tapestry of thought and insight. From Aristotle to Kant, from Utilitarianism to the Stoicism, each offers a unique perspective on the ethical life. Yet, for those in the Christian tradition, it is the life and teachings of Jesus Christ that provide the ultimate framework for understanding and engaging with the moral questions of our time. Christian ethics, rooted in love, offers a transformative vision for individuals and communities alike, challenging us all to live out the values of the kingdom of God in every aspect of our lives.

Christians regard humanity as uniquely created in the image of God, a belief that imbues human life and social institutions with inherent dignity and purpose. This perspective is rooted in the biblical narrative that describes the creation of man and woman in God's image and their placement in the Garden of Eden to live in harmony with creation and each other (Genesis 1:26-28). The family, from this perspective, is not merely a sociological unit but a sacred institution designed by God for the well-being and flourishing of humanity. On the contrary, a more secular or atheistic worldview, which is prevalent among modern sociologists according to the initial statement, perceives humans primarily as advanced animals, a result of evolutionary processes. This view tends to regard biblical accounts of creation, including the narratives of Adam and Eve and the divine institution of the family, as pre-scientific myths without substantive relevance to contemporary sociological analysis. As a consequence, the sacredness attributed to social institutions like the family and marriage by Christianity is often replaced with a more functionalist and pragmatic approach to understanding human relationships and societal structures. This fundamental disagreement over the nature and origin of humanity and its social institutions leads to differing analyses of societal issues and challenges. Christians argue that the reduction of human identity to mere biological or evolutionary explanations contributes to a superficial understanding of social problems like drug abuse, crime, and poverty. From a Christian perspective, these issues are not only social or economic in nature but are deeply spiritual, rooted in the brokenness of human relationships with God, with one another, and with the created world. Consequently, solutions to these problems, according to the Christian worldview, require an approach that recognizes the moral and spiritual dimensions of human life. The failure to address the deeper moral and spiritual underpinnings of societal issues, as observed by Christians, leads to inadequate and ineffective solutions. For Christians, the restoration of human dignity and the proper functioning of societal institutions begin with a recognition of humanity's special status as bearers of God's image and the re-establishment of relationships based on biblical principles of love, justice, and mutual care. In conclusion, the debate over the origins and nature of social institutions reflects broader worldview differences that have significant implications for the analysis and resolution of societal issues. The Christian belief in humanity's creation in the image of God offers a distinct perspective on the value of human life and the purpose of societal institutions, challenging the predominantly secular orientation of modern sociology.

This critical function of the church is central to its mission, one that would indeed lose its significance if \\"Christ were shut out\\" from its core activities. The church's responsibility extends to enlightening society about the nature of sin and the possibility of salvation, thereby encouraging individuals and communities towards repentance and spiritual renewal (Schaeffer, 1976). Without the recognition of sin, society faces the risk of judgment; however, the church plays a pivotal role in redirecting society's focus towards God by emphasizing that both individuals and collective entities are accountable for their actions. Moreover, the church possesses the unique capacity to exemplify what true community looks like, predominantly through living out the commandment to \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\" (Mark 12:31). By doing so, it sets a profound example for the rest of society, showcasing the feasibility of harmonious living grounded in love and mutual respect (Bonhoeffer, 1954). Schaeffer (1976) strongly believes that the effectiveness of the Christian message in the modern world hinges profoundly on the church's ability to demonstrate genuine community. He asserts that in the 21st century, the world will remain indifferent to the church's teachings if it fails to exhibit a tangible sense of community, regardless of the correctness of its doctrine or policy. This assertion is scripturally buttressed in Ephesians 4:11-16, which highlights the church's role in equipping the saints for works of service, thereby building up the body of Christ (The Holy Bible: New International Version, Biblica, Inc., 2011). This passage underscores the importance of unity, maturity, and the acknowledgment of Christ as the cornerstone of all relationships within the church. By fostering a community that reflects these values, the church not only strengthens its internal bonds but also serves as a model for the broader society, inviting others to recognize and embrace the transformative power of living in accordance with God's will. In conclusion, the church's role in society is indispensable, serving as both a herald of sin and salvation and as a living testament to the power of genuine community based on Christ's love. By fulfilling these roles, the church has the potential to inspire significant positive changes in society, guiding individuals and communities towards spiritual awakening and a deeper relationship with God.

And yet if one does not submit its nature entirely to the moral absolutes founded God’s character logically the only ethical authority residing over mankind is our own impulses it is important for the Christian to understand the fallacies of secular ethics so that He can avoid inconsistencies of unfounded ethical ideas All secular ethical cods are an aberration of God’s code and should be recognized a such","output":"In engaging with the complexities of secular ethics, Christians are faced with the challenge of discerning the underlying flaws within speculative approaches to morality. Central to Christian ethics is the belief that morality serves as a means to glorify God, providing a foundation for healthy moral living that eschews lazy intellectual attitudes, which condone relativistic or \\"new\\" moralities as excuses for laissez-faire behavior. The historical repercussions of such ethical ambiguity have been stark, with rampant immorality resulting in widespread suffering and death—a direct consequence of behaviors detached from absolute moral standards (Schaeffer, 1976). Secular moral philosophies often rely on human notions of right and wrong as the sole arbiter of ethics, eschewing any need for an absolute standard beyond the individual's or society's judgement. As Schaeffer (1976) pointedly critiques, the absence of an absolute benchmark for morality leaves humanity amidst a sea of conflicting opinions and moral judgements, devoid of a reliable mechanism to reconcile these differences. This critical shortfall, characteristic of ethical realism and other relativistic ethical frameworks, produces a societal landscape marked by moral ambiguity, where subjective value judgments reign supreme and genuine morality is obscured. C.S. Lewis (1943) articulates the perils of such moral relativism, highlighting the dangers inherent in a system where subjective impulses, unchecked by any universal moral standard, guide actions. In a world devoid of absolute truth, those in power may exploit their position, wielding authority without accountability to a higher moral code. This prospect underscores the inherent flaws of ethical systems that dismiss the necessity of absolute moral values. For Christians, God represents the ultimate source of morality, with divine standards serving as the benchmark for right living. To replace divine authority with human judgment—or, worse, to elevate human desires above God's moral absolutes—is considered a fundamental misstep, tantamount to blasphemy (Schaeffer, 1976). Christians are thus called to wholly align themselves with the moral absolutes that reflect God's character, recognizing that any deviation towards self-reliance for moral guidance ultimately leads to ethical bankruptcy. Understanding the fallacies embedded within secular ethical propositions is imperative for Christians in order to navigate a world rife with conflicting and unfounded moral ideologies. By recognizing the inadequacies of secular approaches to ethics—which essentially distort or outright reject God's moral framework—Christians can better articulate and live out a coherent, God-centered moral philosophy that stands in stark contrast to the relativism pervading contemporary culture.

Slavery unversal and inseparable from the teture of society it has been stimated that in the time of Paul there were many slavery as free people in Rome. And the proportion of slavery to free people in Italy has been put as high as these to one in the future of war the proportions of entire cities were sold in to slavery and slavery were often more educated and cultured than their masters While they were often treated with kindness and considration legaly they were the property of their owners – things and not human being their feat rested altogather on the whim and fency of their masters Pauls has no word’ of criticism for the institution as such in this sens was unconcerned about “ social Ethics” the impact of the gospel on social structures , in fact he admonishes slaves to be in diffrent to their social status ( 1 corin 7:21) because a human slaves is really a freedom of the Lord the christian faith is to be lived out with in the contxct of existing social structurs for they belongs to the form of this world which is passing away ( 1 corin 7:33) There for slaves as the christians are to be obdient and loyal to their masters giving a full measyres of service ( colssians 3:22-25, Ephesians 6:5-8 while masters are to treat their slaves with justice and considration ( Col 4:1, Ephesians 6:9 ) when a runawy slave Onesmoses met Paul in Rome and become a christian Paul sen him back to Philemona , his owner with instruction toPhilemona to welcome him as the brother in christ (Philm 16 ) there is no explict word of the slave free however with in the felloship of the church such social distnictions have been transcended ( 1 Cor 12:13 Gal 3:28 even through they canot be avoided in society Paul’s attitudes towards the state is set forth in the letter to the Romans even to through it was authoritarian structure in whose functioning pagan religion played an important role it was the agent of Law and order and as such is “ the servant of God to excute his wrath on the wrongdoer “ ( Romans 13:5) – even christian indeed specially christian – must be subject to the state because it is divinely ordined and support it by paying the duly levied taxes support of Law and order rests upon physical force “ he does not bear the sword in vain “ ( Rome 13 :4) it is probably that paul’s refrence to a restraninig power holding back the lawlessures of Antchrist ( 2Thesalonia 2:6 ) is to the Roman government as an instrunments of Law and order It is clear that Paul was not concerned about social structures but only with how the christian should live out the christian life with the contemporary social situation . he did indeed introduced christian principles that if faithfully practiced would inevitable , make a profound impact on social structures once christian become an influential people in society But in his view social structurs belongs to the old age that is passing away . There is no evidance that Paul’s looked upon the church as a structure that would take it’s place with other social structurs and change them for good","output":"In examining the social ethics outlined by Paul, it's clear that he positioned the Christian response to prevailing social institutions through a unique lens, largely shaped by an eschatological worldview. This urgency, stemming from the belief in the imminent return of Christ and the passing away of the current world order, influenced his guidance on how Christians should interact with the structures of their day. For instance, his counsel on remaining in one's social state, whether married, Jewish, Gentile, or a slave, was not born out of indifference but rather a prioritization of spiritual readiness over societal change (1 Cor 7:20, 26, 31). This perspective, as argued by historians and theologians, highlights early Christianity's focus on internal transformation and readiness for the kingdom of God rather than revolutionary social change (Dunn, 1998; Wright, 1992). When exploring Paul's teachings on marriage, it's essential to recognize his pragmatic approach to celibacy and marriage. While Paul esteemed celibacy, acknowledging it as a gift not shared by all, he regarded marriage as a legitimate and necessary institution for those unable to embrace celibacy, fundamentally to avoid immorality (1 Cor 7:9). Within marriage, Paul promoted a dynamic of mutual respect and unselfishness, a counter-cultural stance in a society where women and their desires were often marginalized (Thiselton, 2000). Paul's directives on divorce reflect a nuanced understanding of marriage’s sacredness alongside the complex realities faced by converts to Christianity. His allowance for separation in the case of mixed-faith marriages underscores the challenges early Christians navigated in maintaining familial and religious identities (1 Cor 7:10-15). These teachings, when considered holistically, underscore a revolutionary ethic that valued the sanctity of marriage and the well-being of both partners within the cultural and religious context of the time (Keener, 1991). Concerning the status of women, Paul's declaration in Galatians 3:28 marked a radical departure from the societal norms of both Judaism and the Greco-Roman world, asserting an equality in Christ that transcended gender divisions. However, his adherence to contemporary cultural norms regarding women’s roles in public worship (1 Cor 11:3-7) reflects a complex interplay between divine ideals and societal expectations—an area of ongoing debate among scholars (Fee, 1987; Wire, 1990). Regarding slavery, Paul's letters reveal a pragmatic acceptance of the institution as a reality of the time, while simultaneously sowing the seeds of a transformative ethic that transcended social hierarchies within the Christian community (1 Cor 7:21; Phlm 16). His instructions to masters and slaves aimed to infuse existing social relations with Christian principles of justice, kindness, and mutual respect, thus undermining the dehumanizing aspects of slavery from within (Eph 6:5-9; Col 3:22-4:1). In his engagement with state authority, Paul's acknowledgment of the Roman government's role as an instrument of law and order (Rom 13:4-5) did not equate to an uncritical endorsement but rather an appeal for Christians to live peaceably within existing political frameworks while maintaining their primary allegiance to God’s kingdom (Wright, 1992; Jewett, 2007). Paul’s social ethics, therefore, provide a blueprint for living a Christian life within the constraints of contemporary social structures. While primarily concerned with the internal transformation and readiness for the kingdom of God, his teachings offered principles that, if fully embraced, could fundamentally alter societal norms and structures—anticipating the transformative impact Christianity would have as it grew to influence broader society.

Doesnot enter in to this battel againes the flesh then the flesh becomes lord over faith and kills it. Only christian become involved in the battel for the very life of faith this kind of conflict does not exist in the natural life as long as faith and the Holy Spirit do not yet dwell in a man such a man follows his evill desire with out resisting . But faithand Holy Spirit resist the desire of flesh. The christian life is formed and shaped by this sruggle . the marks of christian existance is that one no surended to the flesh with out resistance but now struggle againest it How is this struggle carried on ? luther some timesays;- that man himself is sumoond to do battle for luthe these asentions are based on our Baptism. He makes this particularily clear in his blessed and holy sacrment of Baptism Bapitism means not only God has made a promise but also that man has taken an obligation upon himself . God promised a person who is Baptised that he will put his old man to deth through his life and we who are Baptized there by obligate ourselves for the rest of our lives to fulifil , The meaninig of our Baptism in all that we do and every things that happens to us. This make Us active participators in God’s work of mortifying inour old man. God’s word puts the old man to death in the hard school of life, particularly in the context of our vocation and our suffering when God sends suffering He works with in the context of the dielection relationship of his “ aline” and proper work ( Isaiah 28:21) God lead us into precisely those situation thatwill stimulate and tempt our old man to sin He does that in order to set Us free from sin ‘ Luther Emphasizes God’s therapeutic against action the pride and ambition that are so common among pious people He sees this is most God’s urgent actions against man’s sin This corrsponds to Luther’s basic understanding of the nature of human sin the Bible gives many illustrations of Godly people who have asked God to discipline them in order to preserve them againest this hiddene evile of pride . “ againest this secret villian we must pray God daily to oppose our selfsteem “ Thus the christian the cross in order to carry on struggle against his old man. God will lay upon us the cross we need Luther warns against laying upon ourselves across that we have ourselves chosen thinking it will be good for us we could “take heaven by storm” through unusual measure of self discipline in such efforts authnous reason is onec again at work God does not want this we should wait for God’s leading and guidance and accept what he lays upon us we are not to take the initiative and force suffering upon ourselves Luther statements on these matters are determined by the basic themes of his preaching of justification all autonomous human activity in matters relating to salvations is rejected ,instead we are to wait for and completely trust in what God does . God disciplines the Christian but He does it in a such away that He also summons the Christian to discipline himself and to struggle actively with his old man throughout his life as way of subduing the old man watching fasting praying and working clearly Luther’s is not thinking physical lusts of the flesh refers to more than man’s physical nature –although he empathically includes them thus faith struggle against the old man by mortifying the body and by disciplining sensuality for our physical desires are powerful and as I( 1 peter 2:11 ) The” wage war” are against your souls “ we should fast pray and work in order to subdue support lust The Luther seriously encourages physical ascetism but in contrast to practice of Roman monotism he emphasis first that asceti cism is not meritorious not a goal in itself but only a means to the end of controlling and killing the desires of the flesh all asceticism is to be regulated and limited interms of this goal asceticism that is practical for its own sake ,as a mertitorious work is not controlled but goes far beyond any thing that is neccessary for the struggle with sensulity , Luther encourages asceticism only insofar as it is helpful in that struggle beyond this all outward discipline and asceticism are limited by the fact that they can controle the body but can’t make the soul pure hear outward abstance is of no avail man must be cleansed from the inside out and only faith can do that. Luther’s second points of Emphasis is that ascetic discipline can never beregulated by a unversal law of the church rather the individual must be dicid what is neccessary and helpful for him since every man is diffrent from every other determain the right form of discipline is anindividual task The third way which Luther understanding of asceticism differ from the Roman understanding christian life is in general ;-to be completely oriented to the services of our fellow mans we need to keep in shape to help ourneigbor. Every egoistic attampt to gain salvation for ourselves is rejected and condemed The christian does make prograss in the struggle of the spirit against the flesh but this battel never finished in this earthly life the battle ends only with physical death no one becoms a saint hear on earth “ as long as flesh and blood remain so long sin also remains consequently constant warfar is neccessary in this struggle orginal sin can indeed be subdued but it can not be eliminated “ Thou shalt not covert” remain a goal which we do not reach hear on earth there for the christian longs to be rid of himself through physical death He desire to die where as the world “ can not get enough this life “ However he can not get rid of this life , what it seek he fees from and what he fees from it seeks The world has an instable desire for this earthly life The christian However desires the end of this life because it will set his whole person free to serve God with perfect ,purity heart","output":"The ethical struggle within the Christian life is emblematic of an ongoing battle between the spirit and the flesh, a conflict deeply entrenched within the fabric of Christian anthropology and theology. This struggle, as encapsulated in the writings of Martin Luther, reflects the dual nature of the Christian as both ‘simul justus et peccator’—at once justified and sinner (Luther, 1957). Luther’s exegesis of Romans 7 underscores the lamentation inherent in the Christian life due to the persistent presence of the 'old man'—the sinful nature which, despite being crucified with Christ, remains active and at odds with the new, regenerated self. This dialectical existence within the believer is not merely a confrontation between two aspects of the self but is a manifestation of the comprehensive reality of living under God’s grace while grappling with inherent sinfulness. Luther’s understanding of the Christian life as a continuous battle against the flesh is anchored in the sacrament of Baptism. Baptism symbolizes not just divine promise but also a personal vow to struggle against sin for life (Luther, 1957). This battle is not an abstract theological concept but a tangible, daily reality. Luther asserts that God’s discipline, often experienced through suffering and trials, serves a therapeutic function, aiming to erode pride and self-reliance, which he identifies as the root of human sin (Luther, 1957). The active struggle against the 'old man' involves ascetic practices like fasting, praying, and working. Yet, Luther differentiates his advocacy of asceticism from monastic asceticism by emphasizing its non-meritorious nature, viewing it not as an end but a means to control fleshly desires (Elert, 1962). Luther contends that while external disciplines can regulate the body, purification of the soul—true sanctification—can only be achieved through faith (Elert, 1962). Importantly, Luther situates individual ascetic discipline within the context of the Christian’s vocation to serve others. The goal of restraining the flesh is not self-salvation but the enhancement of one’s capacity to love and serve one’s neighbor in accordance with Christ’s commandment (Matthew 22:39). This orientation towards service underscores the inherently communal and relational aspect of Christian sanctification. In conclusion, the ethical struggles inherent in the Christian life reflect the ongoing tension between the indwelling presence of sin and the transformative power of grace. The battle against the flesh, characterized by both divine discipline and personal ascetic practice, is framed by Luther as an indispensable aspect of the Christian journey towards sanctification. However, ultimate victory over sin, and the complete fulfillment of God’s moral demands, remain eschatological promises—realized not in this life but in the life to come. References: Elert, W.

This can be likened to the 8 Christian conduct or moral code. In another sense, ethics is used to signify a set of rules of conduct or moral code. Here, ethics is relevant to other fields in professional and applied ethics. The third sense of ethics is seen as an inquiry into the measuring of ethical terms and its relation to ways of life and rules of conduct. This sense relates to meta-ethics which is a branch of moral philosophy. Philosophy in its written and systematic form is attributed to the Greeks and hence ethical philosophy traces its origin to the Greeks too. Ethics is said to have started in the fifth century B.C and it was given its philosophical texture by Socrates who jostled men of his time into a living consciousness of their duty to live a life guided by rational criticism of their beliefs and practices. In his life and teachings, Socrates showed exemplary character. He displayed an uncompromising stand for what is upright and moral. It was for the cause of making good men out of ordinary men that he incurred the envy of people who subsequently plotted his death. He lived a strictly moral life. The same can be said of men in every culture who became great examples and inspirations for a viable moral life in the midst of a corrupt and misguided society. The teachings of Buddha Confucius and other great moral teachers readily come to mind. Socrates believed that a sound body should house a sound mind; he saw the soul as the proper entity that rises above the pettiness of the body. The soul must transcend custom and tradition. The soul should accept only those rules of conduct that are in accord with objective moral principles. To him, an unexamined life is not worth living. Ethics however acquired its meaning as a universal science of good conduct from Aristotle. 3.2 The Origin of Christian Ethics It is important that we examine certain important facts in our study of the sources of Christian ethics. The first is the light that the Old Testament can throw upon Jesus as we note what he retained, consciously or unconsciously from his heritage and what he set aside in response to higher insights. The second is the need to understand the Old Testament as a whole and to see it in perspective, since it also form a part of the Christian’s Bible. The third arises from the fact that the social teachings 9 of the prophets supply a degree of concreteness and of social application to specific circumstances which appears only marginally in the teachings of Jesus 3.2.1 The Covenant The concept of covenant occupies an important place throughout the Old Testament. From the creation story to the closing pages of the Old Testament, it permeates the very essence of the relationship between Israel and her God. It is the most basic and distinctive idea in the Old Testament, affecting as it does, the total religious and moral outlook of Israel. In it, are the nature of their God, his relationship with them and to the stream of history, the framework within which they conceived their moral obligation, the grounds of divine judgment, and the hope of salvation which was to grow into the expectancy of the promised Messiah and the kingdom of God. This is not to say that in the initial establishment or acceptance of the covenant the people foresaw all this, but it laid the groundwork on which all the rest could be erected. This relationship centers in a covenant voluntarily initiated by God, offering Yahweh’s protection and support in return for obedience to his will and law. Israel’s covenant relation foreshadows in a number of ways what was to become more explicit in Christianity. The most obvious connection is, of course, the \\"new covenant\\" and the establishment of Church as the \\"new Israel\\" with Christ as its center and head. But this is not all. Both judgment and redemption on God’s part rest the foundation of the covenant idea; likewise the demand for obedience and hence for unremitting moral responsibility on man’s side. So does the hope of the coming of the Kingdom, not as something earned by man’s good works nor yet as a state in which God can be indifferent to human effort, but rather as a consummation in which the condition of the covenant would be fully met. The apocalyptists of later Judaism distorted the covenant idea into an expectancy of the salvation God’s elect solely by the direct intervention of God; those Jews who envisaged Israel as a holy commonwealth whose holiness was to be tested and proved by moral obedience came closer to its meaning. 3.2.2 The Law The Law became Israel’s understanding of what is expected of them in the bilateral relationship with their God. There were two basic tests of being a Jew. One was circumcision; the other was the more general requirement of the keeping of the law. The first was clearly repudiated by Christianity, as became evident in the very important decision recorded in the fifteenth chapter of Acts. What Christianity did with the 10 law is a much more complex question, and the answer depends on what aspect of the law is being considered and in what context it is understood. The Covenant Code, which is affixed to the Exodus Decalogue, illustrates admirably the blending of moral with religious considerations, and within religion the mixture of adoration and gratitude with ceremonial observance, which characterizes Israel’s faith as a whole. It begins with an injunction to imageless worship, provisions for altars and sacrifices, and assurance of the divine presence and blessing. Then follow nearly three chapters of very explicit provisions concerning slaves, punishment for deeds of violence and theft, restitution for injury to property, family relations, and helpfulness to the stranger and to the poor, observance of the Sabbath as a day of rest for servants and even for the animals. They are not provisions for our day, but in the setting of agrarian society in the tenth century B.C. they show an admirable sense of justice, moral responsibility, and humane concern for the underprivileged. In between are stern warnings against sacrifice to strange gods and firm injunctions as to the modes and times of sacrifice to Yahweh. The law was by no means the barren and external thing that the legalists of Jesus’ time or the literalists of ours have too often made. It was founded on bedrock - the righteous, sovereign rule of a protecting, gracious God who demanded its observance. It took on concreteness from the circumstances of the times - social, political, and economic - as ours inevitably must. Yet its basic frame of reference is timeless 3.2.3 The Prophets It is the almost universal consensus of serious students of the Bible that in the message of the prophets is the high-water mark of the Old Testament. The first observation to make is that the prophets, like the compilers of the law, proceeded from the assumptions of the covenant. This made their messages both religious and ethical, with an intertwining which makes it impossible to withdraw either element without losing the heart of their message. They never doubted that Israel was the chosen people of God and that a righteous, gracious, but exacting God demanded obedience of his people. What they objected to, as the burden of their message, were the misunderstandings of God’s will which substituted ceremonialism for justice, mercy, and faith, and the apostasies whereby the people persistently violated their side of the covenant. Did the prophets reject the cultic side of Israel’s religion? Their invectives against the substitution of ritualistic correctness for 11 righteousness leaves open this possibility, and of the greater prophets Ezekiel alone, standing on the threshold of the postexilic period, expressly calls for a purified ritual as an integral part of the worship of Yahweh. Opinions differ as to whether the others rejected out rightly the sacrificial cult. It seems more probable; however, that what they protested was not its existence, deeply embedded as it was in the covenant relation, but its perversion through exaltation to a place of primacy. Comparably, no Christian today needs object to the ritual and traditional observances of the Church when these contribute to the worship of God, but every Christian ought to protest when \\"doing things right\\" in the Church becomes a substitute for righteousness. Second, the prophets must be understood in both an individual and a social context. This is true whether what is being considered is the source or the object of their message. They were for the most part lone figures assailing the popular mores, and hence misunderstood. But to assume that they were solely individual religious geniuses is to miss the fact that they emerged out of a religious community and spoke to a religious community. They were Hebrew prophets, not Greek philosophers or Buddhist Bodhisattvas, and they never dreamed of stepping outside of this framework. Furthermore, though we are accustomed to think of a progressive growth in a sense of individual responsibility from Amos to Ezekiel, the difference at this point is probably overstated. The message of every prophet, Moses, Samuel, Nathan, and Elijah as well as those who came later, was to every individual within the community of Israel, and neither king nor humblest subject was exempt from the obligation to obey the will of Yahweh. The application of this fact to mistaken modern notions of an \\"individual\\" versus a \\"social\\" gospel is obvious. Third, though explicit monotheism and universalism were a late development, their nucleus is implicit in all prophetic preaching. The ceremonialism of Israel, though understood by the people as the mark of Israel’s particularity, had actually much in common with other primitive religious rites. This similarity was one reason why they found it so easy to take over Canaanite worship. It was in the ethical insights of Israel, as these were seen most clearly by the prophets, that the greatest distinctiveness lay, and in their vision of the God of righteousness was the germ cell of monotheism. The gods of the nations were many because the nations were many; the God of righteousness was one, and in his hand laid the destinies of nations. As we noted earlier, no sharp distinction was drawn between nature and history; God was the Maker and sovereign Ruler in both spheres. From this conviction, implicit in the whole idea of the covenant but seen with fullest clarity by the prophets, it was a logical step to the conclusion that God had given to Israel special privileges in 12 order to be the special servant of all mankind. This insight, glimpsed by Amos, was destined to come to full expression in the second Isaiah. Fourth, the prophets saw with utter clarity the persistent fact of sin, and saw it not as maladjustment or even as failure to \\"hit the mark\\" of some objective human standard, but as sin against God. It was rebellion against God and disloyalty to God that made the self-centered luxury of the rich, the exploitation of the poor, bribery, drunkenness, and harlotry such evils. This is not to depreciate the prophets’ sense of social justice; they had it in splendid measure. But it was grounded in something more basic than human law or tribal standards. And fifth, in everything the prophets said, they spoke to the current situation. They spoke from a perspective that was more than \\"current,\\" but they never spoke in abstractions. Where they enunciated general principles, they spoke to the people as they were in terms of what ought to be. The prophets saw and set forth visions that still stir us, but they were not \\"visionaries.\\" It is because of their utter realism as they spoke within the conditions of a social and political community - or to adopt a current term, a responsible society - that next to the teachings of Jesus we find in them our firmest basis of social ethics. 4.0 CONCLUSION An examination of both the philosophical and Christian ethics points to the role of ethics in affecting positively the way people live and relate with each other. All over the world and in every culture, men have genuinely sought for the right form of behavioral pattern that will make the society a better place to live for all. 5.0 SUMMARY This unit has examined the sources of ethics in a general sense and Christian ethics with the purpose of ascertaining the factors that brought about their existence and the way these sources have affected what today has come to be known as Christian ethics.","output":"In summary, the exploration of the origins and influences on philosophical and Christian ethics offers valuable insights into how these ethical systems have shaped societal behaviors and interpersonal relationships across different cultures and historical periods. # 4.1 Philosophical Ethics: From Socrates to Aristotle The genesis of philosophical ethics is deeply rooted in ancient Greek civilization, with Socrates' method of critical inquiry paving the way for a more structured examination of moral values and ethical conduct. Socrates' challenge to individuals to live a life informed by rational assessment of their beliefs and actions underscored the intrinsic link between morality and the pursuit of a virtuous life. This philosophical endeavor was further advanced by his disciple Plato, and subsequently, Aristotle, who formalized ethics as a branch of philosophy concerned with the character of a 'good life' and the foundation of moral virtues (Aristotle, n.d.). # 4.2 Christian Ethics: Covenant, Law, and Prophets Christian ethics, while distinct in its foundational beliefs and salvific orientation, has intersections with philosophical ethics, particularly in its concern for virtuous living and moral responsibility. The Old Testament's emphasis on the covenant relationship between Israel and Yahweh introduces a divine dimension to ethical conduct, underscoring obedience, justice, and compassion as reflections of God's character (Exodus 19-24). Jesus' ministry, as recorded in the New Testament, built upon and transcended this covenant framework, emphasizing love as the fulfillment of the law and the basis for ethical living (Matthew 22:37-40). The moral and social teachings of the prophets further enrich the tapestry of Christian ethics, combining rigorous religious devotion with a profound commitment to social justice and individual responsibility. The prophetic tradition's critique of ritualism in favor of moral integrity presents a compelling call to ethical authenticity that resonates with Jesus' teachings on righteousness (Amos 5:21-24, Micah 6:6-8). # 4.3 Integration and Application Both philosophical and Christian ethics address the perennial human quest for meaning, purpose, and moral coherence in the conduct of life.

This exploration reveals that both traditions, despite their distinct origins and objectives, converge on the essential human endeavor to delineate a path towards a virtuous, just, and fulfilling life. # 4.1 Philosophical Ethics: From Socrates to Aristotle Philosophical ethics, inaugurated in the intellectual salons of ancient Greece, provides a cornerstone for Western moral philosophy. Socrates, with his unwavering commitment to the examined life, laid the groundwork for a tradition that seeks to align human conduct with rationality and virtue. Through dialogues and dialectics, Socrates imparted a moral methodology that encourages introspection and self-scrutiny in pursuit of ethical living (Plato, n.d.). Plato, Socrates’ most famous pupil, expanded on these ideas, exploring the nature of virtue and the ideal state, thereby extending the scope of ethical inquiry beyond the individual to the societal level (Plato, n.d.). Aristotle, in turn, enriched the discourse with his comprehensive treatise on ethics, where he delineated a blueprint for achieving eudaimonia—a flourishing life attained through the cultivation of virtues (Aristotle, n.d.). Together, these thinkers established a legacy of ethical inquiry that emphasizes the indispensability of virtue, reason, and the pursuit of the good life. # 4.2 Christian Ethics: Covenant, Law, and Prophets Christian ethics, deeply embedded in the biblical narrative, introduces a transcendent dimension to the discourse on moral behavior, anchoring ethical conduct in the divine will and covenantal relationship between God and humanity. The covenantal framework articulated in the Old Testament furnishes a moral landscape marked by duties to God and fellow humans, encapsulated in the Decalogue and the Levitical code (Exodus 20; Leviticus 19). Jesus Christ, in the New Testament, reinterprets this tradition, advocating a radical ethic of love, forgiveness, and inclusivity, which transcends legalistic adherence to ritual and law (Matthew 5-7). The prophetic tradition, with its fervent call for justice, compassion, and faithfulness to God’s commandments, further amplifies the social and communal dimensions of Christian ethics, challenging adherents to embody these principles in their interactions with others (Isaiah 1:17; Micah 6:8). # 4.3 Integration and Application The dialogical encounter between philosophical and Christian ethics offers fertile ground for reflecting on the enduring questions of moral philosophy and theology. This conversation elucidates the common human yearning for a meaningful and ethically guided life, highlighting the centrality of virtues, ethical principles, and the pursuit of the good, both individually and collectively. As societies continue to navigate complex moral dilemmas, the insights gleaned from these rich ethical traditions provide invaluable resources for addressing contemporary challenges, fostering dialogue, and guiding moral action in the quest for a just and harmonious world. # References Aristotle.

There for Christians ought to work to persuade others of their obligation to the commandments of God includes the evil magistrates of his duty to enforce the penal sectional of God’s Law against criminal activity in society without God’s law the Christian may take an interests in politics but he has nothing to contribute in the way of concrete guidance that could not just as well be contributed by anonymous social wisdom God’s law is the key then to the Christian attitude towards sociopolitical morality A complain which is often heard in our secularized society ( and even heard from Christian what have succumbed to the pressures of secularization ) that we cannot recognized God’s law as the standard for political morality because of the separation of Christian and state we need to explain this complains from many angles in order to see just how weak it is The scripture in the Old Testament First of all there are people who reject God’s Law as the standard for present day political Ethics because they believe that the Old Testament social arrangement did not as we do today recognize of any separation of church and state the thought seems to be this since the Mosaic Law was intended for a situation wherein church and state were merged those commandments would be Ethically inappropriate for a different situation like out church and state separated This line of thought may be common but it is invalid nonetheless we can began by taking non of the fact the the Old Testament surely did recognize many kinds of separation between the cultic religious and civil political aspects of life . Kings were not priests in the Old Testament Iserael and priest were not civil leaders ( as in the pagan cultures around Iserael ) indeed when a king like Uzziah presumepd to take upon himself the religious task of a priest he was struck with leporosy from God daring to break doom the recognize the separation of “ church” and “ state” ( 2 chronicle 26:16-21 ) there was Clear diffrence between the office and progatives of Moses and Arone between those of Neimiah and Ezera The Old Testament. social arrangments did not then “ merge” the religious cult and the civil administration . We need that Johoshaphat set the cheif priest over the people in all the king matters ( chronicle 19:11) a functional separetion between the king and the priest both answerable to the God was known and followed thus kings and priest have diffrent houses and diffrent officers and diffren tresires diffrent regulation and diffrent forms of discipline to impose the aleged merged of church and state in the old testament realities as presented in scripture. Recently it has been suggested by one old testament seminary instructor that membership of the Old Testament Jewish state was coexstansive with that of Old Testament Jewish church for ( he claims) circumicistion and partcipation in the pass-over were required of all citizins in iserael. Dispaite prima faire force in this suggestion we will find it acceptable only if we neglect to read the actual bibilical account of the Old Testament social situation. As a matter of fact there were indeed citizen of Iserael ( memebers of the state ) who were not circumicised ( bearing the marks of belonging to the covanent comunity ) , namely the women but even more importantly, there were men in Iserael who enjoyed the privilage and protection of citizenship yet who were not members of ” church “ who were notcircumicised and did not partake of redmptive meal of passover these were the “ sojourners “ in Iserael they had the same law ( Lev 24:22 ) and some privilages (Lev 19:33-34) as the native Iseraelaite but unless they were willing to undergo circumcision and joins the religious community they did not take passover ( Exodous 12:43,45,48,) In many ways this parallels situation todays all men live under the same law and privilage in our state but only those assume the covanent signs ( Baptism in the New Testament ) would be members of the church and free to take Lord’s supper ( the redemptive meal ) even at this level we do not find a situation in a ancient Iserael that is altogather diffrent from our own church and state were not merged in any obvious ways in Old Testament times Ofcourse there were many unique aspects situation enjoyed by Old Testament Iseraelaite is many ways their social arrangment was not what ours today . And the extraordinary chracter of Old Testament Iserael may very well have pertained to some aspects of the relation between religious ,cult and civil rule in the Old Testament Neverthless we will serch in vain to find any indication in the scripture that the valdity of the Mosaic Law for society somehow depended upon any of these extraordinary features of the Old Testament social arrangment dispaite the uniquness of Iserael its Law code was heald forth as the Modale for other nations to imitate ( Detru 4:6-8) what was not extraordinary or unique was jus imboded in the Law of God its validaiaty was universal applaying even to nations which did not every respect parallel the social ( church state ) situation inIserael consequently even if we were point that today our social arrangement differs somewhat from that of old testament Israel’s we would not thereby be justified in concluding that the Law revealed to the Israel is not morally yield for our present day society whatever the prices church state realization was in Israel the Law reveled to Israel ought to be obeyed even by societies which have a slightly different church state relation today A consideration of the separation of church and state ( lack thereof ) in Old Testament Israel does not then invalidate the authority of the old testament Law for current African society Christ taught that we should renders unto Cesar the things that are Caesars and unto God’s that the things to God’s ( Matt 22:21) there is a different between Caesar and God to be sure and we must obey both with that distinction in mind And yet we owe obedience to the powers that be ( Rom 13:1-2) the civil magistrate owes allegiance to God’s reveled will for he is the “ Ministry of God” ) ( Rom 13:4) To admit that the church is separate from the state is not the same as saying that the state is separated from obligation to God Himself and His rule both church and state as separate institution with separate function the church mercifully ministers the gospel while the state justly ministers public Law by the sword ) serve under the authority of God the creators sustainer king and judge of all mankind in all aspects of lives Different senses of this” Separation “ When people today speak of their commitment to be separation of church and state, we need to realize that this commitment can be taken or interpreted in many ways I believe in the separation of church and state may be the answer to one or more logically distinct questions for instance we might ask whether the church should dominate the state for example the Pop dictating to the Kings or the state would dominate the church ( for Example congress dictating church policy ) and the answer might very well be that we should hold to the separation of church and state – Namely that neither institute dominate the other we should have free church in free state Secondly question might be whether the state should be establish one denomination over others as the state church ( or tax the population for the financial support of the ministers of one particular church or denomination and the answer again might very well be that we should hold to the separation of the church and state namely that all churches should be supported simply by voluntary offering and one denomination should not be fevered above others by state .This as matter of historical fact. In what the first Amendment of the U.S Constitution laide down when it prohibited the establishments of religion it did not prohibit the expresions of religiously based views by poloticians or their suporters nor did it prohibit obidiance to the Bible by public officials. It merly prohibited the establishments of one denomnation as the state church Finally as the recent day’s it has come to be asked whether distinictive religious system or revelation should be the standard for individual Lawmakers as they ditermine public policy in previous ages people would have been wise enough to see through such a question for it is in fact impossible not to have same religious presupossions whenever Alaw maker takes standerds one way or another on an issue the only question should be which religious beliefs ought to guide him not whether religious beliefs should guide him how ever today those who fever the pesudo –Ideal of religious neutrality when it comes to politics tend to Express their possisions as a commitment to the separation of church and state .By this they mean the separation morality ( or religious based morality ) from the state they faverd instead secular or outonomous Laws in society . Those who believe in magistrates are bond to the Law of God ( Mistakenly ) acusing of vaiolating of the separation of the church and state – Which should mean the separations of the institutions and functions","output":"The discussions around the Christian attitude towards the state, particularly in the context of law, politics, and the separation of church and state, necessitate a nuanced understanding of the interplay between religious beliefs and societal governance. There is a profound assertion within Christian thought that acknowledges the sovereignty of Christ over all aspects of life, including politics and governance. This perspective not only emphasizes the universal lordship of Christ but also underscores the belief that Christian principles, as revealed through Scripture, should inform and guide societal norms and policies (Frame, 2010). # 6.1 Old Testament Perspectives and Church-State Separation A common objection against applying Scriptural standards to contemporary political ethics stems from the perceived indivisibility of church and state within the Old Testament context. However, this view overlooks the distinct roles and functions fulfilled by kings and priests in ancient Israel, where, despite their interconnectedness, a functional and role-based separation was maintained (2 Chronicles 26:16-21). This separation, underscored by instances where kings were punished for overstepping into priestly duties, highlights the nuanced understanding of governance within the Old Testament framework, countering the argument that biblical law is inapplicable in societies with defined church-state separation (VanDrunen, 2010). Furthermore, the presence of \\"sojourners\\" within Israelite society, who, despite enjoying civil protections and privileges, were not mandated to participate in covenantal rites unless they chose to integrate fully into the covenant community, exemplifies a societal structure accommodating both civic and religious pluralism (Exodus 12:43,45,48). This Old Testament model, therefore, provides a precedent for contemporary societies whereby individuals live under a common legal framework while religious observance remains a matter of personal conviction and covenantal commitment. # 6.2 Implications for Modern Societal Governance The assertion that Christian ethics and the principles derived from God's law have no place in modern political discourse due to the separation of church and state misinterprets both the nature of biblical law and the intent behind the constitutional principle of church-state separation. The prohibition against establishing a state religion or church does not equate to the exclusion of moral and religious considerations from public policy and governance. Indeed, legislators and public officials, like all individuals, operate from a set of moral and ethical presuppositions informed by their worldview and beliefs (Frame, 2010). The contention, then, is not whether religious beliefs should influence political decisions, but rather which moral and ethical framework provides the most just, humane, and beneficial foundation for societal laws and governance. The Christian perspective advocates for the application of biblical principles as a means to promote justice, peace, and the common good, recognizing the authority and sovereignty of God over all aspects of human life, including the realm of politics and governance (Wolterstorff, 2011). # 6.3 Navigating the Separation of Church and State The commitment to the separation of church and state, rightly understood, should ensure that neither institution unduly interferes in the essential functions of the other, while not precluding the influence of religious and moral convictions within the public square. The challenge lies in fostering a society where diverse convictions can respectfully coexist, and where policies and laws are shaped by a pursuit of justice, equity, and the welfare of all citizens, informed by the rich moral and ethical heritage of the Christian faith (Wolterstorff, 2011). # References Frame, J.

The Bible presents them again and again, always vitally and not schematically, but with a consistency that makes the picture clear. Let us look at some of the greatest of these portrayals. In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus analyzed certain Christian virtues that lead the righteous to the kingdom of heaven. The mood and spirit to refrain from anger and lustfulness and the severing of the marriage bond, positive injunctions to straightforward speech, outgoing and uncalculating service, and love of all men including one’s enemies as befitting sons of the God whose love is limitless are the basis for attaining such kingdom. Again, the Christian virtues are epitomized in the Beatitudes. Who are the blessed ones - not simply the happy ones who have satisfied their desires, but those who have found their supreme happiness in God? They are those who are humble in spirit; comforted by God in their mourning; un-possessive, yet possessing God’s richest gifts; eager and persistent in the quest for righteousness; merciful; pure in heart; peacemakers, as the Sons of God ought to be; faithful to duty even under persecution; able to endure misunderstanding and scorn for the Kingdom’s sake. In the immortal words of Matt. 5:3-11 there are nine affirmations which cannot be run into a list of virtues, if virtues are conceived abstractly, yet no clearer picture of Christian character was ever drawn. Turning to the words of Paul, we have the Christian virtues again stated, not this time in nine sentences, but in nine words. The fruit of the Spirit, says Paul in Gal. 5:22, is \\"love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.\\" Several points beyond the words themselves must be noted. First, these virtues are not the product simply of human cultivation; they are the \\"fruit of the Spirit,\\" the result of the indwelling presence of God as he comes to us in Christ. Second, the verb is \\"is\\" and not \\"are\\"; they make a constellation of personality, not a collection of nine traits joined at random. And third, Paul disclaims legalism, as we must, when he adds after this inclusive picture of the Christian life, \\"against such there is no law.\\" There are other portrayals of the Christian virtues in the New Testament. Rom. 12, as a whole, is devoted to this portrayal, as is I Cor. 13. Doubtless the reason why the twenty-third psalm and the Corinthian ode to love, with the Lord’s Prayer, are the most familiar passages in the Bible is that they gather up so perfectly the faith and love which lie at the base of Christian character The Believe in God As the primary note in the ethical outlook of Jesus, we noted the inseparable union of faith in God and obedient love for God with his attitudes towards men. The Old Testament is God-centered in its moral perspectives, though in a more limited sense in terms of the covenant with Israel, and so also was the early Church, though in identification of God with Christ himself as redeeming love. At the very threshold of Christian character stands belief in God as that faith comes to us through Jesus Chris The Christian Character Belief in God, even as ascent of the mind, is not irrelevant to Christian character. The postulates of naturalism and humanism may be held by good men, but to be a \\"good man\\" does not make a person a Christian. To see why, let us look briefly at these assumptions. In general, they are: 1. The universe is self-existent and self-contained, within which man has evolved to the position of the highest form of animal life. 2. Man has intelligence and the capacity for social adjustment and control, but is essentially a part of nature. 3. There is no purpose in the universe except that which man gives it. 4. Right and wrong have no objective validation beyond group standards. 5. The good life is that which is expedient for happiness and the satisfaction of man’s desires. 6. Evil and maladjustment exist, but sin is an outmoded concept. 7. All improvement comes through education and the application of various forms of social pressure, psychological, economic, or political. 8. Man has no source of support, for either the good life or the conquest of suffering, except the resources in himself and his group. 9. Each man’s personal existence ends with his biological death. 10. Jesus has no special significance except as an influential historical figure around which the church, as a social institution and phase of culture, has been organized (Harkness, 1948) These postulates, so widely held that they might be regarded as the new Ten Commandments of our time, are radically at variance with the Christian view of God and of man. One who holds them as his basic convictions may be a respectable, law-abiding, and even altruistic person, but he is not a Christian. 1. It is the Christian’s faith that God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe, the \\"Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.\\" In the creation of the world through long evolutionary processes, God has made man \\"in his own image\\" — that is, with spiritual qualities akin to those of God. Christian ethics presupposes a God-centered view both of the physical world and of the worth of human personality. 2. Man’s biological life is embedded in nature, and in a more complex form he shares many attributes with the animal world. He is, however, essentially a \\"living spirit,\\" with a soul that is capable of worship, faith in God, and outgoing, uncalculating love for one’s fellow man. Through these endowments of the Creator man is free to make moral choices. Christian ethics, therefore, cannot be deterministic in its view of man’s moral life. 3. The Christian doctrine of creation implies neither a static perfection nor automatic progress. Yet it is the Christian’s faith that both the goodness and the power of God are dependable and that a divine purpose underlies all existence. In this faith he can work with courage and hope as the servant of God for the conquest of evil. Life as a whole therefore becomes meaningful. 4. Man’s ideas of right and wrong are greatly influenced by group standards. Yet it is the will of God as this is revealed in Jesus Christ that, for the Christian, is the ultimate point of reference. To the degree that this is discerned and lived by, social standards are transcended by agape love. 5. The good life is neither determined by, nor is it indifferent to, human happiness. The good life is the \\"blessed\\" life portrayed in the Beatitudes, the \\"abundant\\" life Jesus said he came to bring. It is the life of obedient love towards God and selfless service to men disclosed in the words and deeds of Jesus. 6. Sin, as self-centeredness with regard to both God and other persons, is man’s most persistent evil. It is expressed both in moral dullness to the love commandment of God and in positive acts of rebellion against God and injury to one’s fellow men. It is \\"original\\" in the sense that human nature, if undirected or unchanged, is always self-centered 7. Self-discipline and social forces contribute to the achievement of maturity, and these are important elements in the development of Christian character through Christian nurture. However, to be brought up in a good home or a good society does not automatically make one a Christian. The process of becoming a Christian occurs only through personal decision and the acceptance of divine help. The will then becomes unified, motivated, and consciously directed toward the effort to be a follower of Christ. 8. Neither sin nor suffering can be fully eliminated from human existence. Yet through the power of God in Christ, moral victories over temptation are won, often to an amazing degree, and suffering can be borne with courage and inner enrichment through trust in God’s providential care. 9. The Christian lives in the hope and in the vista of eternal life as the gift of God. This enormously transforms his perspective upon the present life, less through hope of future reward or fear of punishment than through a sense of the enhanced worth of the present as preparatory to eternal life in the presence of God 10. To the Christian, Jesus is more than a great, good man who has exerted an influence upon the course of Western civilization. He is the supreme revealer of God, through whom God is known, personal salvation comes to men, and society is changed in the direction of a fuller embodiment of the principle of love. The Church, as the community of his followers united by his living presence as Holy Spirit, is more than a social institution; it is a divinely grounded fellowship. Even so, a brief survey of the affirmations of Christian faith in contrast with the assumptions of naturalism should make it apparent that the viewpoint from which the Christian looks at life is different. The Bible, as the framework from which this faith is derived, becomes a primary source of insight, and the structure of life to which it points has an orientation and a quality not to be derived from naturalistic or humanistic assumptions. 3.3 The Christian Virtues The Christian virtues are the qualities of a God-centered life as one seeks, in the totality of his being, to follow the pattern of faith and love set forth by Jesus. The Bible presents them again and again, always vitally and not schematically, but with a consistency that makes the picture clear. Let us look at some of the greatest of these portrayals. In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus analyzed certain Christian virtues that lead the righteous to the kingdom of heaven. The mood and spirit to refrain from anger and lustfulness and the severing of the marriage bond, positive injunctions to straight forward speech, outgoing and uncalculating service, and love of all men including one’s enemies as befitting sons of the God whose love is limitless are the basis for attaining such kingdom Again, the Christian virtues are epitomized in the Beatitudes. Who are the blessed ones - not simply the happy ones who have satisfied their desires, but those who have found their supreme happiness in God? They are those who are humble in spirit; comforted by God in their mourning; un-possessive, yet possessing God’s richest gifts; eager and persistent in the quest for righteousness; merciful; pure in heart; peacemakers, as the Sons of God ought to be; faithful to duty even under persecution; able to endure misunderstanding and scorn for the Kingdom’s sake. In the immortal words of Matt. 5:3-11 there are nine affirmations which cannot be run into a list of virtues, if virtues are conceived abstractly, yet no clearer picture of Christian character was ever drawn. Turning to the words of Paul, we have the Christian virtues again stated, not this time in nine sentences, but in nine words. The fruit of the Spirit, says Paul in Gal. 5:22, is \\"love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.\\" Several points beyond the words themselves must be noted. First, these virtues are not the product simply of human cultivation; they are the \\"fruit of the Spirit,\\" the result of the indwelling presence of God as he comes to us in Christ. Second, the verb is \\"is\\" and not \\"are\\"; they make a constellation of personality, not a collection of nine traits joined at random. And third, Paul disclaims legalism, as we must, when he adds after this inclusive picture of the Christian life, \\"against such there is no law.\\"There are other portrayals of the Christian virtues in the New Testament. Rom. 12 as a whole, is devoted to this portrayal, as is I Cor. 13. Doubtless the reason why the twenty-third psalm and the Corinthian ode to love, with the Lord’s Prayer, are the most familiar passages in the Bible is that they gather up so perfectly the faith and love which lie at the base of Christian character. 4.0 CONCLUSION To return to the question raised at the beginning of this unit, is this type of character, which means this total structure of personality, just as evident among those who are not Christians as among those who are? After one has finished citing cases of \\"fine people\\" who are not Christians and some who \\"profess Christ\\" but are not very attractive, the answer is clear. Christian character, though not flawless in any person, is a self-validating witness to the power of Christ to transform human nature. To the degree that a person is genuinely - not merely nominally or institutionally but actually – a Christian, his total life bears witness to the fact that Christian character is a reality. 5.0 SUMMARY This unit has examined the basic and the over-encompassing roles played by believe in God as the pivot of Christian ethics. No one can deny God as postulated by the Christian faith and claim to be genuinely embracing the Christian moral standard. Also, the basic teaching of Christ on the behavioral pattern of lifestyle of a Christian is also examined","output":"The exploration of Christian virtues and the foundational belief in God as essential aspects of the Christian ethical framework underscores a distinct way of life that significantly diverges from purely secular moral systems. This divergence is predicated on a God-centered way of life, deeply rooted in the teachings and example of Jesus Christ, and delineated through various biblical texts which collectively portray a vivid image of Christian character and virtue. # **7.1 Sermon on the Mount: The Beatitudes** The Sermon on the Mount is a prime example of Jesus outlining the virtues that define the Christian life. Here, Jesus not only addresses specific behaviors but delineates a spiritual and moral disposition that characterizes the kingdom's citizens. The Beatitudes (Matt. 5:3-11) encapsulate these virtues, portraying the blessed life as one marked by humility, mercy, purity, peace, and a readiness to endure persecution for righteousness's sake. This portrayal challenges prevailing notions of happiness and virtue, inviting believers to find supreme joy and fulfillment in alignment with God's will. # **7.2 Pauline Epistles: The Fruit of the Spirit** In his letters, the Apostle Paul provides further elucidation of Christian virtues, notably in Galatians 5:22-23, where he introduces the concept of the \\"fruit of the Spirit.\\" This metaphor highlights the transformative effect of the Holy Spirit's indwelling presence, resulting in a life characterized by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Paul's emphasis on these virtues as a singular \\"fruit\\" rather than individual traits underscores the holistic transformation envisaged in the Christian life—a transformation that reflects the divine presence and counters legalistic approaches to morality. # **7.3 Christian Character and Belief in God** Central to the Christian ethical perspective is the inseparable union of faith in God and a life of obedient love. This framework contrasts sharply with naturalistic and humanistic assumptions, which often view the universe as self-sufficient, morality as socially constructed, and human life as devoid of spiritual dimensions and divine purpose. The Christian perspective, however, affirms the created order's theistic underpinnings, viewing humans as bearers of the divine image with inherent spiritual capacities and moral responsibilities. # **7.4 The Distinctiveness of Christian Character** The distinctive nature of Christian character emanates from a personal and transformative relationship with God through Jesus Christ. This character is not merely an adherence to a set of ethical guidelines but a comprehensive orientation towards God and others, marked by a commitment to love, service, and the pursuit of righteousness. While imperfect, the Christian's life serves as a testament to the power of Christ to reform and redeem human nature. The validation of Christian character, therefore, transcends mere institutional affiliation or nominal identification with Christianity; it is evidenced in the life of a person genuinely committed to embodying Christ-like virtues. # **Conclusion** In summary, Christian ethics, grounded in a profound belief in God and expressed through a life of virtue as taught by Jesus and expounded upon by the apostles, offers a distinctive moral compass. This ethical orientation challenges both believers and the broader society to reconsider the foundations of moral behavior and the ultimate purpose of human existence. Ultimately, the Christian virtues and the character they mold serve not only as an ideal but as a compelling witness to the transformative potential of the Christian faith. # **References** The Holy Bible, New International Version.

Taditional insistance that the spiritual life exists only where God possess the believer becomes rather an Emphasis that the christian life is not in any sens the believer’s possissions Barth by way of illustration opposes Agustine’s view that the believers becomes bearer of salvation through the infusion of righeousness . Barth rather stress both the spirit presences and schatological nature of the christian life the convection however that we canot be christian here becaus sin dings to our temporal existance seems contrary to the New Testament concept of christian growth .. Birth’s view with it’s emphasis on eschatology tends to minimize the spirit as the qualifire of the present christian life. Benath this life detects a speculative conforming of the Biblical doctorine of sanctification to that absolute discontinuty which Barth aserts to exist between the anthropological exprience even of the redemed and the divine claim which impings on them Doubtles the Believer’s life springs from God alone as the gift of grace and only in and through the spirit is this new life prepetuated the new nature more over is maintained and nourished through a living faith and hence bounded by life in God by an existance dependent upon and didicated to him where genuine faith exist personal descision and ratification are indisputable essential without obedience there is assurdely no saving faith But this emphasis do not require the denial christian life in some manner is continning possissions of Believer. That except for the actual moment existatial descision the Believer ceses to exist as the Believer or that faith exist only in the actuality descision so that the Belivers must be continually werstle himself in to existance is too much a surrender to daynamic psychology that the new Birth is no sens a “ given entity “ that the Believers participation an eternal life is only “ for the moment” that the christian life is only a “ becoming “ rather than” being “ that the believer is always at the same time an unbeliever are emphasis which reflect all to obviously the stand point of a speculative philosophy and which do not grasp fact that behind the daynamic act of faith in the believer’s life stands the continous disposition of faith born of regeneration the constant exercise of this faith gradually stablished it in to a habit the christian life however important is the neccessty of growth has as abiding existance on the basis of regeneration and not merrly on the prospect of punctuated renewals. This continuity of the life in christ may be defended without dependance onthe objectionable notion that a new nature is magically infused in to the Believer . The protest in recent dogimatic againest perfectionies theories of sanctification involves in the services of existential theology a fallacious reconstraction of Biblical view of sanctification so as no deny to the Believer any permanent possission of christian life . Dehn even sets himself over against a specific Biblical passage ( 2 pter 1:4 ) to dismiss the possiblity of the Believers participation on the Divine nature more over to meet the requirments of existetial theology , he depreciats the concept of the “holy man “ as contrast to New Testament and reduces christian life to such perpetual struggle as to both minimize the work of Holy Spirit and to sacrifice a Biblical view of the Believer’s walk “ the christian is never in state but continually in actu “ we are told “” to be achristian is forever process of becoming it is never a state of having become but this reduces the believer to an important existance . The denial that sanctification involves an “ infused grace” need not involve the denial of any permanant status to believer as believer dispite the fact that the christian life is a confilict as well as a walk The denial of all permanent character to the christian life does less than justice to those passege which assert that Believer alrady has eternal life ( Joh 3;15, 6:54) that His judgment has been commanded as view of this ( 5:24, 10:28 ) that he has peace ( Rom 5:1 ) and stand in grace ( 5:2) and is recociled ( 5:10) and a to yield himself to God as ....... alive from the dead ( 6:13 ) Doubtless some modiration of the exercise optimism of recent modren thical theory was called for especially of panthestics and of idealistic views which located sin outside the human will and concieved man as essentially or as perfectable without supernatural grace The tendency of current theological ethics is not content to emphasis the effect of original sin upon all human action both in the world generally and exprience of regenerate specifically all ethical tthought and action is tainted so it is emphasized with a compromise which vitiates its purity with in the sphere finte and historical effort even the noblest moral aspiration falls undr the judgment of nature a mood of pessimism hangs over theological ethics which one does not discover to be the chracterasitic New Testament Emphasis The scripture beyond question diallows ethics of sinnes perfection in this life only they who dilute the hearty flover of New Testament concept of sin Page 461 chrisian life as possission Christian personal Ethics page 558 Biblical attitude you will be like paul, willing to stay to in this world serving the Lord but yerning for the day when you will be united with Him either through death or His return ( 2 corin 5:8) and ( philippians 1:23-24) A sens of yerning is chracterstics of those who live with an eternal prespective. It can be found expressed throughout the Bible The patriarch Job states that he looked forward to the day when his redmer would stand upon the earth because he knew that when that happend he ..Job would recieve anew body and would see that Lord He added that the very through was enough to cause him to faint ( Job 19:25-27) Abraham “ Lived as an alien in the land of promise “ because he yearned for” the city which has foundations whose architect and builder is God “ ( Hebr 11:9-10) Moses through it was better to be ill-treated for the promise messiah’s sake than to own all the riches of Egypt becaus he was looking forward to his heavenly reward ( Hebr 11:26) David relished the promis of God that one day he will send His son to terrify the nation with His wrath and rign as king on Mt.Zion (Psalm 2:5-6) Isaiah’s heart was so filled with desire to be with the Lord that he cried out. “ oh that you would rend the heaven and come on down...to make yourname known to your advrsaries that the nations may tremble at your presence ‘ Isaiah 64:1-2) Jeremiah dremed of when the Lord would “ror from on high and utter His voice from His holy habitation ( Jeremiah 25:30) Ezekiel spent nine chapters ( 40-48) describing glorious Millinial Temple of the Lord , obviously yearning for the day it would be built He concluded the description with the resons for his yearning He reveald for that the city will have a new name “ Yahweh Shammah” which means the Lord is three”( Ezekiel 48:35) Daniel had vission about the Lord returning to reign over all the earth togather with His saints Daniel 7:13-14. 18,27,) Micah cried out for the day when the Lord will dowell once again in Jerusalem and “ will teach about His way “and “ we will walk His paths” Micah 4:20 The Old Testamend ends with Malachi loocking forwaerd to the day when the sun of righeousness will raising with blessing in its wing” He says his response will be to ” go forth and skip about” like a calf released from a stall ( Malachi 4:2) This yearning to be the Lord continues throught the new testament peter exorted us to live with our hope fixied confidatally on the return Jesus ( peter 1: 13 -16) Paul agead us to live with the love of Lord appearing in our hearts ( 2 Timothy 4:8) He also told the church to pray “ Maranatha” meaninig “ our Lord come” ( 1 corin 16:22) The new Testament ends with the words of Apostle John saying “ Amen come Lord Jesus’” (REVELATION 22:20)","output":"The Christian attitude towards possessions and the overarching perspective of living a godly life amidst material wealth or poverty is deeply intertwined with the broader ethos of Christian ethics. This involves an understanding of life's temporal nature and an eternal perspective that prioritizes spiritual over material wealth. # **8.1 Christian Life as Possession** Theologically, the concept of Christian life as a possession juxtaposes the reality of the believer's ongoing sanctification against the backdrop of sin's pervasive influence. While acknowledging the depth of sin's impact, Christian doctrine underscores the transformation brought about by sanctification—a process integral to the believer's life. The New Testament envisions a growing Christian life, challenging views that restrict ethical achievements to eschatological realization alone or that perceive the Christian life merely as an unattainable ideal (Packer, 1994). # **8.2 Sanctification and the Presence of the Spirit** Sanctification, as portrayed in Scripture, involves both an already realized and a continually unfolding aspect of Christian life. Notably, this challenges perspectives such as those presented by Barth, who emphasized the eschatological nature of the Christian life to the point of possibly minimizing the Spirit's role in the believer's present experience (Barth, 1957). The New Testament affirms that believers are endowed with the Holy Spirit, enabling a life that bears the fruit of spiritual virtues—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Gal. 5:22-23). # **8.3 The Continuous Experience of Faith** The concept of Christian life as a continuous possession of the believer stands in opposition to notions that sever faith from sustained spiritual growth. The New Testament does not present faith as a fleeting or episodic experience but as a sustaining force that shapes the believer's existence. This enduring aspect of faith is evidenced by promises of eternal life, peace, and reconciliation with God through Christ (Rom. 5:1, 5:10; John 3:15). # **8.4 Yearning for the Eternal Presence** The biblical narrative, from the Old Testament patriarchs to New Testament believers, reflects a profound yearning for God's eternal presence. Figures like Abraham, David, Jeremiah, and Paul expressed this anticipation of God's kingdom and the fulfillment of His promises. This yearning is not only a characteristic of personal piety but also a defining feature of the Christian ethical stance, marked by a living hope in the return of Christ (1 Peter 1:13-16; Revelation 22:20). # **Conclusion** The Christian approach to life, including attitudes towards possessions and material wealth, is fundamentally shaped by an eternal perspective. This orientation emphasizes the transformative power of faith, the ongoing process of sanctification, and the believer's yearning for God's kingdom. The Christian life is thus seen not merely as an ideal to be aspired to but as a present reality and possession, characterized by continuous growth in virtue and deepening relationship with God. # **References** - Barth, K.

It apparently never occurred to him to give ethical injunctions derived from any other source. The biblical view (both Old Testament and New) makes obedience to the will of God the final criterion of the good life. Did Jesus accept the idea of the covenant and with it Israel as God’s chosen people? This question is crucial for the universality of his message. Apparently, at the beginning of his ministry he conceived his mission as to the \\"lost sheep of the house of Israel.\\" It was to this group and not to the Gentiles that he commissioned the twelve (Matt. 10:5-6), and his encounter with the Canaanite woman (Matt. 15:21-28) is significant in the fact that he both at first demurred and then yielded to her entreaty for the healing of her daughter. This gives the key to Jesus’ attitude. His own people were precious to him, and he never expressly repudiated the covenant relation. Yet to him so universal was the covenant with its exclusive bounds was left behind. It remained for his followers in the early Church to make concrete the break which his acts and attitudes foreshadowed. 3.1.2 He Practiced Judaism The ethical principles of Jesus were those of Judaism, yet with a difference in emphasis which makes their impact new. Point for point, it became new. 3.1.3 His Eschatology Depicted the Ethics of His Time Jesus took the eschatology like the ethics of his time and made it into something different. His inheritance from the prophets affected his expectancy of divine intervention; his own sense of relationship to God gave a new turn to both eschatology and ethics. Probably because of a conviction of the nature of his own messiahship, but certainly because of his conviction that the kingdom of God meant the righteous rule of God in a redeemed community for this world and the next, he made the kingdom of God and not the triumph of Israel the supreme note in his teaching. With all the ambiguities that surround the records of his teaching regarding the Kingdom, it is clear that it embodies the goal of God’s reign over the hearts and lives of men, and thus sets forth the great hope of a better world both now and in the world to come. To make Jesus conception of the Kingdom solely into a better society on earth is to lose its great overtones and foreshorten its vista; to deprive it of ethical content is to emasculate it into something Jesus himself would never have recognized. Thus it comes about that Jesus, the greatest of the prophets, the fulfillment of the law, inaugurated a new covenant for the redemption of mankind. It is to him, and not to any other teaching or teacher, that we must look for our basic moral insights. It is with good reason that one is reported as saying of old, \\"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.\\" 3.2 The Ethics of Jesus 3.2.1 Jesus Taught an Ethics Completely Integrated with His Religion This is seen in its clearest expression in the two Great Commandments, where the duty of love of neighbor is not an addendum to the obligation to love God without reservation, but it rather implies it. It appears’ repeatedly both in Jesus’ words and in the total tenor of his life. It was his sense of calling by God that led him at the beginning of his ministry to read in the synagogue the words of Isaiah to announce that the spirit of the Lord is upon him. 3.2.2 Jesus Laid Primary Stress on Ethical and Spiritual Inwardness This is not to say that he was indifferent to outward acts, or to the way men conducted themselves toward one another. On the contrary, his most stinging words are directed toward those who \\"preach, but do not practice\\"; to those who \\"bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger\\"; to those who \\"devour widows’ houses and for a pretense. . . make long prayers\\"; to those who are \\"blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel\\" (Matt. 23:3, 4, 14, 24). Yet the same passage, as well as many others, indicates that his chief concern was with right attitudes from which right acts might proceed. Jesus was completely opposed to the substitution of either ceremonial acts or correct outward behavior for humble obedience to God and loving concern for one’s neighbor. This is the main burden of his indictment of the scribes and Pharisees. 17 3.2.3 Jesus set Forth a Clear Pattern of the Demands of the God-Centered Life What is meant by clear pattern is not, of course, a blueprint or easily applicable to set of rules. But that we can today speak of \\"Christian virtues\\" is due to the fact that one who reads the Gospels seriously is left in no doubt as to the general structure of what a life lived in obedient love would embody. We see it in Jesus himself; we find it on every page of the record; it is epitomized in the Beatitudes. Its primary qualities are a God-centered faith and love. Its preference of spiritual to material treasure and compassion towards those in need. The good life is that of generous and self-giving service to derivative aspects purity of heart, sincerity, humility, forgiveness, love toward enemies, mercy, charity in judgment, honesty in speech and action, sexual purity, renunciation of worldly aims with all men and unbroken, unworried trust in the goodness of God. 3.2.4 Jesus Had a Realistic Knowledge both of Human Sin and of the Possibilities of the Redeemed Life It is significant that Jesus does not talk about sin nearly as much as Paul. A concordance shows that the word \\"sin\\" as a noun appears in his recorded sayings very few times in the Synoptic Gospels, though more in John, and with one exception (the sin against the Holy Spirit, Matt. 12:31; Mark 3:29), when he uses the term, it is in the plural. The Lord’s Prayer in Luke contains the petition \\"Forgive us our sins (11:4), and it is perhaps unfortunate that we do not commonly use this form instead of \\"debts\\" or \\"trespasses.\\" To the paralytic (Matt. 9:2-6; Mark 2:5-10; Luke 5:20-24) and to the woman who brought the alabaster flask of ointment (Luke 7:47-49) he said, \\"Your sins are forgiven.\\" 3.2.5 Jesus Declared the Supreme Worth of Every Person to God Every person was of supreme worth to Jesus because every person was beloved of God. His total ministry was a ministry of the redemption of persons - whether it was redemption from physical illness, mental disturbance, error, or sin - because he shared the love of God for every person and so gave himself completely to a ministry of helpfulness to all. 3.2.6 The Central Teaching of Jesus was the Kingdom of God There are both great clarity and great ambiguity in the records as to the message of Jesus with regard to the Kingdom. Everybody agrees that it was his central message, yet there is nothing in the New Testament interpretation and scarcely anything in Christian theology about which opinions differ more. The disputed elements center mainly in the bearing 18 of the Kingdom on the ethical demands of the present life in relation to what lies beyond it in a realm that transcends human history - that is, in the relations of ethics to eschatology. Fortunately, the matters most directly related to the practical requirements of the Christian life are those most fully agreed upon. 4.0 CONCLUSION The ethics of Jesus may not be adequately understood if it is not examined in the light of the way Christ understood it and its relation to the prevailing world –view of his time. 5.0 SUMMARY This unit is dedicated to the understanding of not only the ethics of the Old Testament as Christ understood it, but also to the ‘new’ ethical standards as promulgated by him. This is done by examining his view on the human person, the religion that is acceptable unto God, his understanding of sin, ethical and spiritual inwardness, the kingdom of God and the acceptable way of relationship with others","output":"The teachings of Jesus Christ introduce a profound ethical framework that redefines traditional understandings of morality, virtue, and human relationships underpinned by a God-centered worldview. This foundation not only resonates with the covenantal ethics of the Old Testament but also transcends them through a universal message of love, compassion, and redemption. # **9.1 Jesus and Old Testament Ethics** Jesus’ ethical teachings, while deeply rooted in Judaism, introduced a transformative emphasis that expanded the covenantal relationship to embrace a more inclusive vision of God's kingdom. His ministry, initially focused on \\"the lost sheep of the house of Israel,\\" gradually revealed a universal scope, evident in His interactions, such as with the Canaanite woman, indicating a more expansive mission that transcended ethnic and religious boundaries (Matt. 15:21-28). # **9.2 Jesus' Ethical Teachings** The ethical teachings of Jesus, characterized by adherence to two Great Commandments—love for God and love for one’s neighbor—underscore a complete integration of ethical conduct with religious devotion. These commandments, far from being separate injunctions, are presented as inseparable aspects of a life lived in accordance with divine will. Jesus' emphasis on ethical and spiritual inwardness critiqued mere external adherence to laws and rituals without corresponding inner transformation. His teachings underscored the importance of right attitudes, humility, sincere obedience to God, and genuine concern for others as foundational to ethical living. This focus on the heart's condition contrasts sharply with the legalistic righteousness criticized by Jesus in His encounters with the scribes and Pharisees (Matt. 23). # **9.3 The Kingdom of God** Central to Jesus' ministry was the proclamation of the Kingdom of God—a realm characterized by God's righteous rule manifested in both present experiences and future hope. This kingdom ethic interweaves ethical demands with eschatological expectations, urging a life of righteousness, mercy, and peacemaking as signs of alignment with God's reign. The ambiguity surrounding the kingdom's nature does not obscure its significance as the framework within which Jesus articulated His ethical vision. # **9.4 Realism and Redemption** While aware of human sin's reality, Jesus affirmed the possibility of redemption and transformation through God's grace. His interactions and teachings demonstrated a profound belief in every person's worth to God and the potential for redemption. This perspective informed His ministry of healing, forgiveness, and restoration, emphasizing God’s desire for reconciliation with humanity. # **Conclusion** Jesus' teachings present an ethical vision deeply integrated with His religious convictions, centered on a transformative relationship with God and characterized by love, mercy, and justice. This ethical framework challenges followers to embody the virtues of the kingdom in their lives, advocating for a community where God’s will is realized through acts of compassion, righteousness, and peace. # **Summary** Jesus' reinterpretation of Old Testament ethics and His proclamation of the Kingdom of God offer a radical vision of ethical living that remains foundational for Christian moral understanding. By examining His teachings, believers are invited to follow a path marked by spiritual inwardness, universal love, and commitment to God's redemptive work in the world."},{"instruction":"continue to expand while keeping all citations and find the sources of ideas cited with a reference list in Havard style at the end. Include in-text citations for all sources in the reference list: 9 The use of the teaching of Christ Jesus and the Old Testament Ethics 3.1.1 Jesus as a Jew Jesus shared with the Old Testament thought the general structure of God-centered moral living. It apparently never occurred to him to give ethical injunctions derived from any other source. The biblical view (both Old Testament and New) makes obedience to the will of God the final criterion of the good life. Did Jesus accept the idea of the covenant and with it Israel as God’s chosen people? This question is crucial for the universality of his message. Apparently, at the beginning of his ministry he conceived his mission as to the “lost sheep of the house of Israel.” It was to this group and not to the Gentiles that he commissioned the twelve (Matt. 10:5-6), and his encounter with the Canaanite woman (Matt. 15:21-28) is significant in the fact that he both at first demurred and then yielded to her entreaty for the healing of her daughter. This gives the key to Jesus’ attitude. His own people were precious to him, and he never expressly repudiated the covenant relation. Yet to him so universal was the covenant with its exclusive bounds was left behind. It remained for his followers in the early Church to make concrete the break which his acts and attitudes foreshadowed. 3.1.2 He Practiced Judaism The ethical principles of Jesus were those of Judaism, yet with a difference in emphasis which makes their impact new. Point for point, it became new. 3.1.3 His Eschatology Depicted the Ethics of His Time Jesus took the eschatology like the ethics of his time and made it into something different. His inheritance from the prophets affected his expectancy of divine intervention; his own sense of relationship to God gave a new turn to both eschatology and ethics. Probably because of a conviction of the nature of his own messiahship, but certainly because of his conviction that the kingdom of God meant the righteous rule of God in a redeemed community for this world and the next, he made the kingdom of God and not the triumph of Israel the supreme note in his teaching. With all the ambiguities that surround the records of his teaching regarding the Kingdom, it is clear that it embodies the goal of God’s reign over the hearts and lives of men, and thus sets forth the great hope of a better world both now and in the world to come. To make Jesus conception of the Kingdom solely into a better society on earth is to lose its great overtones and foreshorten its vista; to deprive it of ethical content is to emasculate it into something Jesus himself would never have recognized. Thus it comes about that Jesus, the greatest of the prophets, the fulfillment of the law, inaugurated a new covenant for the redemption of mankind. It is to him, and not to any other teaching or teacher, that we must look for our basic moral insights. It is with good reason that one is reported as saying of old, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.” 3.2 The Ethics of Jesus 3.2.1 Jesus Taught an Ethics Completely Integrated with His Religion This is seen in its clearest expression in the two Great Commandments, where the duty of love of neighbor is not an addendum to the obligation to love God without reservation, but it rather implies it. It appears’ repeatedly both in Jesus’ words and in the total tenor of his life. It was his sense of calling by God that led him at the beginning of his ministry to read in the synagogue the words of Isaiah to announce that the spirit of the Lord is upon him. 3.2.2 Jesus Laid Primary Stress on Ethical and Spiritual Inwardness This is not to say that he was indifferent to outward acts, or to the way men conducted themselves toward one another. On the contrary, his most stinging words are directed toward those who “preach, but do not practice”; to those who “bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger”; to those who “devour widows’ houses and for a pretense. . . make long prayers”; to those who are “blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel” (Matt. 23:3, 4, 14, 24). Yet the same passage, as well as many others, indicates that his chief concern was with right attitudes from which right acts might proceed. Jesus was completely opposed to the substitution of either ceremonial acts or correct outward behavior for humble obedience to God and loving concern for one’s neighbor. This is the main burden of his indictment of the scribes and Pharisees. 17 3.2.3 Jesus set Forth a Clear Pattern of the Demands of the God-Centered Life What is meant by clear pattern is not, of course, a blueprint or easily applicable to set of rules. But that we can today speak of “Christian virtues” is due to the fact that one who reads the Gospels seriously is left in no doubt as to the general structure of what a life lived in obedient love would embody. We see it in Jesus himself; we find it on every page of the record; it is epitomized in the Beatitudes. Its primary qualities are a God-centered faith and love. Its preference of spiritual to material treasure and compassion towards those in need. The good life is that of generous and self-giving service to derivative aspects purity of heart, sincerity, humility, forgiveness, love toward enemies, mercy, charity in judgment, honesty in speech and action, sexual purity, renunciation of worldly aims with all men and unbroken, unworried trust in the goodness of God. 3.2.4 Jesus Had a Realistic Knowledge both of Human Sin and of the Possibilities of the Redeemed Life It is significant that Jesus does not talk about sin nearly as much as Paul. A concordance shows that the word “sin” as a noun appears in his recorded sayings very few times in the Synoptic Gospels, though more in John, and with one exception (the sin against the Holy Spirit, Matt. 12:31; Mark 3:29), when he uses the term, it is in the plural. The Lord’s Prayer in Luke contains the petition \\"Forgive us our sins (11:4), and it is perhaps unfortunate that we do not commonly use this form instead of “debts” or “trespasses.” To the paralytic (Matt. 9:2-6; Mark 2:5-10; Luke 5:20-24) and to the woman who brought the alabaster flask of ointment (Luke 7:47-49) he said, “Your sins are forgiven.” 3.2.5 Jesus Declared the Supreme Worth of Every Person to God Every person was of supreme worth to Jesus because every person was beloved of God. His total ministry was a ministry of the redemption of persons - whether it was redemption from physical illness, mental disturbance, error, or sin - because he shared the love of God for every person and so gave himself completely to a ministry of helpfulness to all. 3.2.6 The Central Teaching of Jesus was the Kingdom of God There are both great clarity and great ambiguity in the records as to the message of Jesus with regard to the Kingdom. Everybody agrees that it was his central message, yet there is nothing in the New Testament interpretation and scarcely anything in Christian theology about which opinions differ more. The disputed elements center mainly in the bearing 18 of the Kingdom on the ethical demands of the present life in relation to what lies beyond it in a realm that transcends human history - that is, in the relations of ethics to eschatology. Fortunately, the matters most directly related to the practical requirements of the Christian life are those most fully agreed upon. 4.0 CONCLUSION The ethics of Jesus may not be adequately understood if it is not examined in the light of the way Christ understood it and its relation to the prevailing world –view of his time. 5.0 SUMMARY This unit is dedicated to the understanding of not only the ethics of the Old Testament as Christ understood it, but also to the ‘new’ ethical standards as promulgated by him. This is done by examining his view on the human person, the religion that is acceptable unto God, his understanding of sin, ethical and spiritual inwardness, the kingdom of God and the acceptable way of relationship with others","output":"The teachings of Jesus offer a comprehensive ethical framework that deeply integrates religious convictions with moral living, setting a profound example for both contemporary followers and the broader ethical discourse. Through His life and teachings, Jesus redefined the boundaries of ethical behavior, emphasizing love, compassion, and internal transformation over ritualistic adherence to law or mere external acts of piety. # **9.1 The Universal Call of Jesus’ Ministry** Jesus’ ministry, though rooted in Judaism, was marked by an inclusive vision that extended God’s covenant beyond the ethnic bounds of Israel to encompass all humanity (Wright, 1996). His interactions, such as with the Canaanite woman, showcase a progressive revelation of His mission’s universal scope, challenging the existing paradigms of covenant and chosenness and setting a precedent for a more inclusive understanding of God’s kingdom (Matt. 15:21-28). # **9.2 Ethical Principles and Practices of Jesus** The differentiated approach Jesus took towards Judaism's ethical principles underlines a significant departure towards a reinvigorated ethical stance characterized by love (Agape) as the pivotal virtue guiding human actions (Wink, 2006). This transformative perspective breathes new life into traditional ethical paradigms, situating love for God and neighbor at the heart of moral living. # **9.3 The Kingdom of God and Ethical Living** The proclamation of the Kingdom of God stands as the cornerstone of Jesus' teachings, articulating a future hope anchored in the present reality of a life led by God’s righteousness (McKnight, 2011). This eschatological vision implores believers to embody kingdom values in the here and now, mirroring the ethics of the kingdom through acts of love, mercy, and peacemaking. # **9.4 Jesus’ Realism About Human Sin** Contrary to Paul’s more frequent discourse on sin, Jesus focused more on redemption’s possibilities and the transformative power of forgiveness (Morris, 1992). His recorded encounters and parables underline a compassionate understanding of human frailty and the capacity for spiritual renewal and redemption. # **9.5 Affirmation of the Individual’s Worth** Central to Jesus' teachings is the unwavering declaration of every person’s worth to God, reflecting a divine love that seeks the redemption and restoration of individuals irrespective of their social, moral, or spiritual state (Jeremias, 1966). This radical affirmation of individual value challenges societal norms and encourages an ethic of inclusivity and compassion. # **9.6 The Ethical Demands of the Kingdom** Jesus’ message on the Kingdom of God intricately links ethical living with spiritual eschatology, insisting on righteousness as a present commitment that anticipates the eschatological fulfilment of God’s promises (France, 1985). This dual focus underscores the importance of ethical behavior not as an end in itself but as a testament to the in-breaking of God’s kingdom in the world. # **Conclusion** The profound integration of Jesus’ religious convictions with His ethical teachings offers a unique moral insight that continues to challenge, inspire, and transform individuals and communities. By embracing the ethical principles exemplified in Jesus’ life and teachings, believers are called to live out the values of the kingdom, marked by love, justice, and compassion. # **References** - France, R.T.

Yet, why we make such decisions has been widely debated. Are we motivated by feelings of guilt, where we don't want to feel bad for letting the other person down? Or by fairness, where we want to avoid unequal outcomes? Some people may rely on principles of both guilt and fairness and may switch their moral rule depending on the circumstances, according to a Radboud University -- Dartmouth College study on moral decision-making and cooperation. The findings challenge prior research in economics, psychology and neuroscience, which is often based on the premise that people are motivated by one moral principle, which remains constant over time. The study was published recently in Nature Communications. \\"Our study demonstrates that with moral behavior, people may not in fact always stick to the golden rule. While most people tend to exhibit some concern for others, others may demonstrate what we have called 'moral opportunism,' where they still want to look moral but want to maximize their own benefit,\\" said lead author Jeroen van Baar, a postdoctoral research associate in the department of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown University, who started this research when he was a scholar at Dartmouth visiting from the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior at Radboud University. \\"In everyday life, we may not notice that our morals are context-dependent since our contexts tend to stay the same daily. However, under new circumstances, we may find that the moral rules we thought we'd always follow are actually quite malleable,\\" explained co-author Luke J. Chang, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences and director of the Computational Social Affective Neuroscience Laboratory (Cosan Lab) at Dartmouth. \\"This has tremendous ramifications if one considers how our moral behavior could change under new contexts, such as during war,\\" he added. To examine moral decision-making within the context of reciprocity, the researchers designed a modified trust game called the Hidden Multiplier Trust Game, which allowed them to classify decisions in reciprocating trust as a function of an individual's moral strategy. With this method, the team could determine which type of moral strategy a study participant was using: inequity aversion (where people reciprocate because they want to seek fairness in outcomes), guilt aversion (where people reciprocate because they want to avoid feeling guilty), greed, or moral opportunism (a new strategy that the team identified, where people switch between inequity aversion and guilt aversion depending on what will serve their interests best). The researchers also developed a computational, moral strategy model that could be used to explain how people behave in the game and examined the brain activity patterns associated with the moral strategies. The findings reveal for the first time that unique patterns of brain activity underlie the inequity aversion and guilt aversion strategies, even when the strategies yield the same behavior. For the participants that were morally opportunistic, the researchers observed that their brain patterns switched between the two moral strategies across different contexts. \\"Our results demonstrate that people may use different moral principles to make their decisions, and that some people are much more flexible and will apply different principles depending on the situation,\\" explained Chang. \\"This may explain why people that we like and respect occasionally do things that we find morally objectionable","output":"Making moral decisions is a complex and nuanced process, often underpinned by various ethical principles and influenced by changing contexts. The study by van Baar and Chang (2019) explores this intricacy by delving into how individuals navigate moral decision-making, particularly within the framework of reciprocity. The discovery of moral opportunism, as outlined in their research, provides a compelling lens through which to view the adaptability of moral principles. # **11.1 The Complexity of Moral Decision-Making** Moral decision-making is not a one-size-fits-all process; it is dynamic and multi-faceted. The conventional understanding based on static moral principles like the golden rule has been challenged by findings that suggest individuals' moral orientations can be fluid (van Baar & Chang, 2019). This fluidity underscores the importance of considering the contextual factors that influence moral decisions. # **11.2 Guilt Aversion and Inequity Aversion** According to the study by van Baar and Chang (2019), individuals employ different moral strategies, such as guilt aversion and inequity aversion, to navigate the landscape of moral decision-making. While some people might be motivated by a desire to avoid feeling guilty (guilt aversion), others might be driven by a pursuit of fairness and equal outcomes (inequity aversion). The intriguing aspect of this differentiation is the distinct patterns of brain activity associated with each moral strategy, affirming the neurobiological basis for these ethical stances. # **11.3 Moral Opportunism: A New Ethical Strategy** Moral opportunism, as identified in the study, posits an adaptive approach to moral decision-making, where individuals switch between guilt aversion and inequity aversion based on what maximizes their benefit in a given context (van Baar & Chang, 2019). This strategy highlights the malleability of moral rules and principles, suggesting that ethical behavior is more context-dependent than previously believed. # **11.4 Brain Activity Patterns and Moral Strategies** The research conducted by van Baar and Chang (2019) delves into the neural correlates of moral decision-making, offering insights into how different moral strategies are reflected in unique patterns of brain activity. The ability to identify these patterns enriches our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying ethical judgments and further illustrates the complexity of moral cognition. # **11.5 Implications of Moral Flexibility** The concept of moral opportunism and flexibility in applying moral principles has profound implications, especially when considering scenarios that deviate significantly from everyday contexts, such as wartime situations (van Baar & Chang, 2019). Understanding that moral behaviors can shift according to changing circumstances invites a reevaluation of judgments concerning individuals' ethical decisions. # **Conclusion** The study by van Baar and Chang (2019) sheds light on the dynamic nature of moral decision-making, challenging traditional notions of static moral principles. By introducing the concept of moral opportunism and exploring the neural underpinnings of moral strategies, this research expands the discourse on ethical behavior, emphasizing the significance of context and the adaptive capacity of individuals in navigating moral dilemmas. # **References** van Baar, J.

As a result, we may be able to make choices that fit with our personal beliefs and consider the impact our actions could have. Here's a simple step-by-step guide that may help you use ethical decision-making in your day-to-day life. Step 1: Recognize the ethical dilemma The first step is to identify when there's a moral choice to be made. This could come up in everyday situations or when you are addressing public opinions, laws, or social rules. Once you realize there's an ethical issue, you can start to think about your values and the possible outcomes of your decision. Step 2: Gather information The next step is to understand all the facts and details around the ethical issue. This means thinking about different viewpoints, your own feelings, what society generally thinks, and how your decision might affect others. If you are dealing with a situation concerning the law or social policies, try to understand the relevant rules, laws, ordinances, and statutes. Step 3: Evaluate alternatives Think about all the different actions you could take and the ethical consequences of each one. Look at the pros and cons of each option and think about how each one fits with your values. Additionally, consider how each potential action might impact others. Step 4: Make a decision After you've looked at all your options, consider choosing the one that fits best with your values and seems to have the best ethical outcome. Keep in mind that ethical dilemmas may not always have a clear-cut solution; sometimes, a compromise or trade-off must be made. Step 5: Reflect on the decision and learn After making the decision, reflect on its ethical implications and consequences. Look at what happened and think about what you can learn for next time. Doing this may help you get better at making ethical decisions. Following these steps may help you make well-thought-out, ethical decisions in everyday life. As a result, you may be able to improve how you make choices that match your personal beliefs and are considerate of others THE IMPORTANCE OF ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING Any management position involves decision-making. “Even with formal systems in place, managers have a great deal of discretion in making decisions that affect employees,” says Harvard Business School Professor Nien-hê Hsieh in the online course Leadership, Ethics, and Corporate Accountability. “This is because many of the activities companies need to carry out are too complex to specify in advance.” This is where ethical decision-making comes in. As a leader, your decisions influence your company’s culture, employees’ motivation and productivity, and business processes’ effectiveness. It also impacts your organization’s reputation—in terms of how customers, partners, investors, and prospective employees perceive it—and long-term success. With such a large portion of your company’s performance relying on your guidance, here are seven ways to improve your ethical decision-making.","output":"Practicing ethical decision-making in everyday life and within management roles underscores the importance of ethical considerations in fostering a positive culture, enhancing employee motivation, and ensuring an organization's long-term success. The guidance provided by Harvard Business School Professor Nien-hê Hsieh illuminates the crucial role of ethical decision-making in leadership and organizational management (Hsieh, N.-h., n.d.). Here is an expansion on improving ethical decision-making within personal and professional domains. # **Recognizing the Ethical Dilemma** Realizing when one encounters an ethical dilemma is pivotal, whether in personal life scenarios or within organizational decision-making. This recognition phase is fundamental in aligning subsequent actions with moral values and ensuring decisions contribute positively to both individual and organizational ethics. # **Gathering Information** A comprehensive understanding of the context surrounding an ethical issue is essential for informed decision-making. This involves considering multiple perspectives, social standards, legal implications, and potential effects on stakeholders. Acknowledging the complexity of situations and the diverse factors at play highlights the necessity of well-informed decisions that are both ethical and effective. # **Evaluating Alternatives** Evaluating the ethical ramifications of potential decisions is paramount. This includes weighing the pros and cons and considering the alignment with one's values and the organizational ethos. Understanding the broader impact of each alternative on various stakeholders reinforces the significance of thorough ethical evaluation in decision-making processes. # **Making a Decision** Choosing the most ethically sound option, consistent with personal and organizational values, is the crux of ethical decision-making. This step often requires navigating complex dilemmas without clear resolutions, underscoring the importance of thoughtful consideration and the willingness to engage in difficult trade-offs or compromises. # **Reflection and Learning** Post-decision reflection allows individuals and leaders to assess the outcomes and ethical implications of their choices. This reflective practice fosters learning and growth, enhancing one's ability to make ethical decisions in the future. It also contributes to the development of a reflective and ethically conscious organizational culture. # **The Importance of Ethical Decision-Making** Ethical decision-making is indispensable in leadership and management roles. It influences organizational culture, employee well-being, and the perceived integrity of the company among external stakeholders. As Hsieh points out, the discretionary nature of managerial decisions, especially in complex scenarios, necessitates a grounding in ethical principles (Hsieh, N.-h., n.d.). Adopting a structured approach to ethical decision-making can significantly improve leadership effectiveness and the ethical caliber of organizational practices. # **Conclusion** Ethical decision-making is a critical competency in both personal and professional contexts. By adhering to a structured approach and continuously reflecting on the outcomes of decisions, individuals can refine their ability to navigate ethical dilemmas and contribute to the creation of ethical environments in their personal lives and within organizations. # **References** Hsieh, N.-h.

Include in-text citations for all sources in the reference list: THE IMPORTANCE OF ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING Any management position involves decision-making. “Even with formal systems in place, managers have a great deal of discretion in making decisions that affect employees,” says Harvard Business School Professor Nien-hê Hsieh in the online course Leadership, Ethics, and Corporate Accountability. “This is because many of the activities companies need to carry out are too complex to specify in advance.” This is where ethical decision-making comes in. As a leader, your decisions influence your company’s culture, employees’ motivation and productivity, and business processes’ effectiveness. It also impacts your organization’s reputation—in terms of how customers, partners, investors, and prospective employees perceive it—and long-term success. With such a large portion of your company’s performance relying on your guidance, here are seven ways to improve your ethical decision-making. 7 WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING 1. Gain Clarity Around Personal Commitments You may be familiar with the saying, “Know thyself.” The first step to including ethics in your decision-making process is defining your personal commitments. To gain clarity around those, Hsieh recommends asking: • What’s core to my identity? How do I perceive myself? • What lines or boundaries will I not cross? • What kind of life do I want to live? • What type of leader do I want to be? Once you better understand your core beliefs, values, and ideals, it’s easier to commit to ethical guidelines in the workplace. If you get stuck when making challenging decisions, revisit those questions for guidance. 2. Overcome Biases A bias is a systematic, often unconscious inclination toward a belief, opinion, perspective, or decision. It influences how you perceive and interpret information, make judgments, and behave. Bias is often based on: • Personal experience • Cultural background • Social conditioning • Individual preference It exists in the workplace as well. “Most of the time, people try to act fairly, but personal beliefs or attitudes—both conscious and subconscious—affect our ability to do so,” Hsieh says in Leadership, Ethics, and Corporate Accountability. There are two types of bias: • Explicit: A bias you’re aware of, such as ageism. • Implicit: A bias that operates outside your awareness, such as cultural conditioning. Whether explicit or implicit, you must overcome bias to make ethical, fair decisions. Related: How to Overcome Stereotypes in Your Organization 3. Reflect on Past Decisions The next step is reflecting on previous decisions. “By understanding different kinds of bias and how they can show themselves in the workplace, we can reflect on past decisions, experiences, and emotions to help identify problem areas,” Hsieh says in the course. Reflect on your decisions’ processes and the outcomes. Were they favorable? What would you do differently? Did bias affect them? Through analyzing prior experiences, you can learn lessons that help guide your ethical decision-making. 4. Be Compassionate Decisions requiring an ethical lens are often difficult, such as terminating an employee. “Termination decisions are some of the hardest that managers will ever have to make,” Hsieh says in Leadership, Ethics, and Corporate Accountability. “These decisions affect real people with whom we often work every day and who are likely to depend on their job for their livelihood.” Such decisions require a compassionate approach. Try imagining yourself in the other person’s shoes, and think about what you would want to hear. Doing so allows you to approach decision-making with more empathy 5. Focus on Fairness Being “fair” in the workplace is often ambiguous, but it’s vital to ethical decision-making. “Fairness is not only an ethical response to power asymmetries in the work environment,” Hsieh says in Leadership, Ethics, and Corporate Accountability. “Fairness–and having a successful organizational culture–can benefit the organization economically and legally as well.” It’s particularly important to consider fairness in the context of your employees. According to Leadership, Ethics, and Corporate Accountability, operationalizing fairness in employment relationships requires: • Legitimate expectations: Expectations stemming from a promise or regular practice that employees can anticipate and rely on. • Procedural fairness: Concern with whether decisions are made and carried out impartially, consistently, and transparently. • Distributive fairness: The fair allocation of opportunities, benefits, and burdens based on employees’ efforts or contributions. Keeping these aspects of fairness in mind can be the difference between a harmonious team and an employment lawsuit. When in doubt, ask yourself: “If I or someone I loved was at the receiving end of this decision, what would I consider ‘fair’?” 6. Take an Individualized Approach Not every employee is the same. Your relationships with team members, managers, and organizational leaders differ based on factors like context and personality types. “Given the personal nature of employment relationships, your judgment and actions in these areas will often require adjustment according to each specific situation,” Hsieh explains in Leadership, Ethics, and Corporate Accountability. One way to achieve this is by tailoring your decision-making based on employees’ values and beliefs. For example, if a colleague expresses concerns about a project’s environmental impact, explore eco-friendly approaches that align with their values. Another way you can customize your ethical decision-making is by accommodating employees’ cultural differences. Doing so can foster a more inclusive work environment and boost your team’s performance. 7. Accept Feedback Ethical decision-making is susceptible to gray areas and often met with dissent, so it’s critical to be approachable and open to feedback. The benefits of receiving feedback include: • Learning from mistakes. • Having more opportunities to exhibit compassion, fairness, and transparency. • Identifying blind spots you weren’t aware of. • Bringing your team into the decision-making process. While such conversations can be uncomfortable, don’t avoid them. Accepting feedback will not only make you a more effective leader but also help your employees gain a voice in the workplace","output":"Ethical decision-making in the professional and personal realms involves navigating complex situations with care, insight, and accountability. The recommendations by Harvard Business School Professor Nien-hê Hsieh (Hsieh, n.d.) provide a structured approach to refining ethical decision-making processes. Improving these processes necessitates introspection, bias mitigation, reflective learning, compassion, fairness, a tailored approach, and openness to feedback. # **Gain Clarity Around Personal Commitments** Identifying one’s core values and boundaries is essential for ethical leadership and decision-making. Understanding what fundamentally drives you allows for ethical guidelines that can serve as reference points during challenging decision-making scenarios (Hsieh, n.d.). # **Overcome Biases** Bias—whether explicit or implicit—can significantly influence decision-making. Recognizing and actively addressing bias is crucial for ensuring fairness and equity in decision outcomes (Hsieh, n.d.). Overcoming bias requires awareness, education, and a concerted effort to consider perspectives divergent from one's own. # **Reflect on Past Decisions** Reflective practices enable leaders to evaluate previous decisions critically, learning from both successes and failures. This continuous learning process is vital for refining ethical discernment and guiding future decision-making (Hsieh, n.d.). # **Be Compassionate** Ethical dilemmas often involve decisions that impact individuals’ lives. Approaching these decisions with empathy and understanding is critical for maintaining dignity, respect, and care throughout the decision-making process (Hsieh, n.d.). # **Focus on Fairness** Fairness is a foundational principle of ethical decision-making, encompassing legitimate expectations, procedural fairness, and distributive fairness. Ensuring fairness promotes a positive organizational culture and mitigates the risk of conflict and litigation (Hsieh, n.d.). # **Take an Individualized Approach** Recognizing the diversity of values, beliefs, and cultural backgrounds among employees can enhance ethical decision-making. Tailoring approaches to align with individuals’ perspectives fosters inclusion and maximizes team performance (Hsieh, n.d.). # **Accept Feedback** Being receptive to feedback is crucial for ethical leadership, fostering a culture of openness, learning, and transparency. Encouraging feedback allows for broader perspectives in the decision-making process and promotes a sense of shared responsibility and engagement among team members (Hsieh, n.d.). # **Conclusion** Ethical decision-making is paramount in navigating the complexities of leadership and interpersonal relationships. By adopting a principled approach, reflecting on past actions, addressing biases, and remaining open to feedback, leaders can enhance their ethical discernment and decision-making effectiveness.

God gave Adam a life long companion and helper and a sextual partner for marraige through the physical union of Adam and Eve. God planned for the human race to be continued ( Ge 1:27-28, Gen 2:24) Marriage the first institution in human society Marraige was established by God before all other human institutions . This shows Us that marraige is the foundation of human society . marriage was stablished before man’s fall in to sin This shows us that marraige is holy God is pleased with marriage . The miracle by which Jesus changed water in to wine at the wedding feast in cana of Gelilee ( John 2:1-11) shows us that God wants people to Enjoy marriage to the full. He wants men and women to exprience love and acceptance and to be complete . Marriage was made for this purpose In God’s plane marriage is the basis fo a morality and sociality stable society. This is part of the reasons why God heats adultry ( Exdo 20:140 ) sextual immorality ( 1 Thesalonia 4:3-60 incsst ( Lev 18:6) and homosexuality ( Rom 1 :24 -28). This things disrupt and twist God’s plan for stable Human society The bible warns us , God will judge the Adulter and all the sexual immorality ( Hebr 13:4) Part of the reasons why many society today are morally and socially unstable is because people have determined to live without regard for sins God’s Law unfortunately there are sever consquences for sexual sins . the great increas in divorce and broken homes and the worlidwide epdemic of AIDS are just two of comsequences Marriage in God’s plan for all people and all culture in the world ( Genesis 2:24 , Gen 12:3, Matt 19;3-9) the familiy can not be replaced by any other institution in God’s plan for mankind if someone corrupt familiy life he is interfering with God’s plan for the whole human race . it was God who performed the first marriage in in the garden of Eden ( Gen 2:21-25) it is people who have spoiled marriage through there immorality and unfaithfulness .

How should christian couple deal with the problems of childrens BIBLICAL CHRISTIANITY IN AFRICA PRESPECTIVE PAGE 276 All of this leaves us with christian marriage us the only other opetion Daunting peraphes but less so if we seek to see from scripture how it is ment to work. We have to affirm reaffirm discover and rediscover with out loss of nerve the Bible’s way for marriage and sextuallity. First we have to understand that marriage fulifil God’s orginal creation ordinance and plane and it is the fundamental buliding block of society inded the first chapters of Genesis show us that God instituted the home even before the state school or church it is a divine creation ordinace and has nothing to do with human kind design or plane its fourfold purposes COMPANIONSHIP MUTUAL HELP SEXTUAL FULIFILMENT AND PROCREATION There fore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife and they become one flesh and the and his wife were both naked and were both with out ashemed Genesis 2:24- 25 we are here that God’s divine patterne for marraige stableshment as part of creation produced somethings extra ordinarry and in away almost unimaginable Two people the man and the women become one . This is some things more and grater simpliy than togather . it is mystre indeed which no thinkers theologians or teachers have ever been able to aduqutable explain two people become” one flesh” how it takes place we cannot fully fathome or plumbe we just know it happens And of course if the two are becoming one in this very deep sense then it rules out all adultery unfaithfuliness and promisecuity if the two have become one that can’t then keep happeninig in a half a dozen direction in fact the Bible is quite clear on the dreadful consequences of adultery thus for example proverbs 6:32 says He who commits adultery has no sense He who does it destroy himself Having insight that Biblical marriage has to be both monogamous and heterosextual , Ed Wheat writes Although it goes far deeper than the physical becoming one flesh involves intimate physical union in sexual intercourse and this with out shame between marriage partners shame in marital sex was never imparted by God instead Biblical expression for sexual intercorse betwen husband and waife is to know anexpressions of profound diginity “ Adam new Eve his waife and she conceved ( Genesis 4:1) “ Then Joseph .... took un to him his waife and new her not till she had brought forth her first born son”( matt 1:24-25 kjv) This word know is the same word used of God’s loving personal knowledge of Abrham in Genesis ( 18:19 kjv ) “ For Iknow him that he will comand his children and his house hold after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment “ Thou in the patrn of divine marriage sexual intercorse between husband and waife includes both intimate phsical knowledge and a tender intimate personal knowledge so the leaving cleaving and knowing each other results in a new identity in a wich tow individuals Merege in to one one in mind, heart, body, and spirit this is why divorce has such a devastating effect not two people but two fractions of one Here then is marriage design as ordinary by God at the very beginig – alove relationship so deep tender pure and intmate that it is patterned after that of christ for His church . This is the foundation for the love life you can exprience inyour owen marriage a foundation in which you can safely build so we see God afresh as the outher and giver of our sexuality we did not buy it in a drugstore It is given to Us by God as integral to our humanity and as we reciev the Genesis word that Adem ” Knew “ Eve ( 4:1) so we embrace profoundly a deeply spritual and emotional comunications of one persone to another at the deepest possible level All this says marriage and sexuality, inherently good in and of themselves , are given by God to fulifile our various needs as humans they fulifil our sexual needs and social needs for companioneship and our chracter needs when by we can grow and develope as the people christian marriage also fulifils the fundamental needs of children only a healthy home with a happy married father and mother will provide with children with the proper feelings of security to allow for normall psychological and emotional development Wesly in speech that;-“ THE FAMILIY IS THE CORNER STONES OF OUR SOCIETY MORE THAN ANY OTHER FORCE IT SHAPES THE ATTITUDES, HOPES, AMBITIONS AND VALUES , OF THE CHILD when the family collaphses it is the children that are usually damaged when it happens on a massive scale the wider comunity itself is cripped “ I believe this is true much modren evidance conforms it however the making of a good marriage is a demanding interprise and will elude us unless we seek earnestly with the Lord’s help, to follow some key guading biblical principles 13.1 CHRIST MUST BE AT THE CENTRE OF THE MARRIAGE Marriage is bassically spritual relationship and while it does adress many of our physical, social emotional needs here on earth , Agustine rightly prays;- “ thou haste made us for theyself and our hearts are reastless till they find their rest in thee “No spouse can fill God shaped vocum designed only for our Lord Himself if we expect husband or waife so meet our deepest spritual needs he or she will always disapoint us infact such an effort is entairelly unfair to our paretner and can only lead to disolutionment , frustration and disapointment often people will leave a spouse to find some one else whome they think will fill the vacum . but they can’t only the Lord can do it why? Because the vacume is God shaped . In a sense then we could say that a successful marriage is really made up of three good marriage the first to christ the second to oneself for we have to love and value ourselves and the third to our husband or waife 13.2 BOTH PARTNERS HAVE TO SEEK BY THE SPIRIT TO ACT IN LOVE TO EACH OTHER Love is not just a feeling but naction a way of behaving in fact a commitment in other words , love does certain things and make usbecome certain kind of peoples the problems of marriage is not just finding the right parent but being the right partner by both words and deeds . demanding yes but highly rewarding when we successed and certainlly penful when we fail 13.3 THE FOURE LOVES Now we must not some thing very key The “marriage carriage is drawn not by one hourse but foure as capturd by four Greek words Erose , which speks of Romatic and sexual love Philla which is love as friendship having fun and sharing common intersts Storage which is affection wormth and tender familiarity Agaphe , which is God’s in spite of love i.e love as action behavioure and commitiment 13.4 PRAYER MUST BE INTEGRAL TO OUR MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIPS Prayer is amighty marital bondage force as we togather brings our problems, sorrows , joys, and tenssions to the Lord also as we bring to him the spritual and other needs of our children loved ones and friends inprayer we also confess our hurts or offences to one another and seek forgivness infact mutual forgvness has to becomes a way of life and we should seek to heed the injuction “ do not let the sun godown on your anger ‘( Ephesian 4:26) two of the the thoughest but sweets words in any good marriage are “ I am sorry “ and we can even say them while praying togather . 13,5 MUTUAL SUBMISSION Although scripture assigns a servant sacrifical and deeply loving and caring headship in marriage to the husband (Colossian 3:18, Ephesian 5:23-24) were by the husband has unaltimate accountablity to God for his familiy and specially it’s spiritual life this does not mean that in all details and aspects the husband leads and decides . Indeed in the day today affairs and process of marriage , who decides and and leads in this or that we depend both on the persons and situations involved in the life of the couple. The key things here is that the husband’s leadership is clearly set in the context first husband sacrificially loving his waife with the deepth and sacrifical care that “ christ loved the church and gave himself up for her “ ( Ephesians 5:25) and secondly both of them living mutual submission “ to one another” (Ephesians 5:21) There is to be a caring and mutual submission give and take in the godly interplay of husband and waife in christian life Anobvious corollary of the above there fore is that it is a transvesty and abuse of the” headship “ principle when ungodly men use sensitivily tunde principle to abuse their waives dominate or lord it over them or inflict damege on them This is a million light –years from what the scripture on about when they says “ The husband is the head of the waife “ ( Ephesians 5:23) for husband to grasp the true meaninig of this requires revisting calvary , sitting at the foot of the cross and drinking in the spirit of sacrifice 13.6 WE HAVE TO BE RIGHT KIND OF PARENTS AND THE RIGHT KIND OF EXAMPLE Agrement on how to raise our children Ephesians 6:4 and also how to be good parents 1Timothy 3:12 is also crutial not to mention the example we set them individually time is also a must for our kids Delinquent and over busy fathers need specially for register this the emotional and sexual development of a daughter is generally greatly influenced by how well her father’s love and tendereness are expressed toher and dads taking quality times with their sons is a sources of immense blessing to both . indeed children growing up in a healthy and happy from home where their is love and mutual care all round can caunt blessed theselves indeed CONCLUSION","output":"The exploration of God's plan for marriage and the pivotal role of ethical decision-making in family life unpacks a rich tapestry of relational and moral concerns fundamentally rooted in biblical teachings. The synthesis of these understandings provides a comprehensive guide for navigating familial relationships and making ethical decisions in everyday life. # **God's Design for Marriage** Marriage is depicted as a celestial ordinance, designed to fulfill human needs for companionship, love, mutual encouragement, sexual satisfaction, and the nurturing of children within the secure and loving confines of a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:18; 1 Corinthians 7:1-2; Psalms 127:3; Malachi 2:14-16; Matthew 19:6). The sanctity of marriage, established as the fundamental institution of human society, underscores its central role in fostering a morally and socially stable society (John 2:1-11). # **Ethical Decision-Making in Family Life** Implementing ethical decision-making in family life involves introspection, recognizing personal biases, learning from past decisions, exhibiting compassion, focusing on fairness, engaging in individualized approaches, and embracing feedback. These steps, derived from Hsieh's insights (n.d.), offer a blueprint for navigating the complexities of familial relationships with integrity and empathy. # **Principles for a Flourishing Family Life** The principles for building and sustaining a flourishing family life resonate with the call for Christ-centric marriages, mutual love, understanding the multifaceted nature of love, prioritizing prayer, advocating mutual submission, and embodying exemplary parenthood (Ephesians 4:26; Colossians 3:18; Ephesians 5:23-25, 5:21). These principles, deeply embedded in scriptural teachings, serve as a foundational guide for Christians seeking to cultivate healthy, loving, and spiritually enriched family dynamics. # **Conclusion** Christian family life, as ordained by God, is a profound commitment to nurturing relationships that reflect divine love, mutual respect, and ethical integrity. Through adhering to the biblical directives and principles outlined, believers are equipped to foster family environments that honor God's design for marriage and exemplify Christ's love to the world. # **References** - Genesis 2:18, 1:27-28, 2:24. - 1 Corinthians 7:1-2. - Psalms 127:3. - Malachi 2:14-16. - Matthew 19:6. - John 2:1-11. - Exodus 20:14. - 1 Thessalonians 4:3-6. - Leviticus 18:6. - Romans 1:24-28. - Hebrews 13:4. - Ephesians 4:26, 5:21, 5:23-25. - Colossians 3:18. - 1 Timothy 3:12. - Ephesians 6:4. - Hsieh, N.-h.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"describe how to tach ai","output":"Teaching artificial intelligence (AI) involves a combination of computer science principles, data management, and ethical guidance. The process often depends on the type of AI being developed: rule-based systems, machine learning, deep learning, or other advanced models. Here’s an overview of how you might teach AI, focusing mainly on machine learning and deep learning methods, which are the most common in contemporary AI development: # 1. Understanding the Basics - **Foundational Knowledge:** It’s crucial to start with a deep understanding of the mathematical and computational principles behind AI. This includes linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, and programming concepts. - **AI Principles:** Learn about the history of AI, its different types, applications, and the ethical considerations involved in developing and deploying AI systems. # 2. Data Preparation - **Data Collection:** Gather a diverse, high-quality dataset relevant to the problem you want the AI to solve. - **Data Cleaning:** Preprocess the data to remove errors, handle missing values, and ensure it’s in a usable format for the AI model. - **Data Augmentation:** In cases where data is scarce, data can be synthetically augmented or expanded to improve model learning. # 3. Choosing the Right Model - Understand different AI and machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks) and select one based on your specific problem, the nature of your data, and the expected outcome. # 4. Training the AI - **Feeding Data:** Divide your dataset into training and testing sets. The training set teaches the AI about the problem, while the testing set evaluates its performance. - **Learning Process:** Use algorithms to adjust the parameters of the model during the training process to minimize errors in predictions or classifications. - **Evaluation:** Assess the model’s performance using the testing set and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Adjust the model as needed. # 5. Refinement and Deployment - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the model by tuning its parameters to improve performance. - **Cross-validation:** Employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation for a more reliable evaluation of the model’s performance. - **Deployment:** Once satisfied with the model’s performance, deploy it for real-world use. This might require integration into existing systems or applications. # 6. Continuous Learning and Ethics - **Monitoring and Updating:** The AI system should continue learning from new data and be regularly updated to maintain its relevance and accuracy. - **Ethical Considerations:** Ensure that the AI system is transparent, fair, and respects privacy. Be aware of and address any biases in the data or model. # Tools and Resources - **Programming Languages:** Python and R are widely used because of their extensive libraries and frameworks for AI and machine learning (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn). - **Online Courses and Tutorials:** There are many free and paid resources available to learn AI, from universities or platforms like Coursera, edX, and Udacity. - **Community and Collaboration:** Engage with AI communities online (such as forums, GitHub, or social media groups) to stay updated on best practices and emerging trends. Teaching AI is an iterative, multidisciplinary process that evolves with technological advances. Continual learning and adaptation are key to staying current in the field."},{"instruction":"create test project showing how multithreding works in python","output":"Here is a simple test project demonstrating how multithreading works in Python: \`\`\`python import threading import time def print_numbers(): for i in range(1, 6): print(f\\"Printing from thread 1: {i}\\") time.sleep(1) def print_letters(): for letter in ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']: print(f\\"Printing from thread 2: {letter}\\") time.sleep(1) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers) t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters) t1.start() t2.start() t1.join() t2.join() print(\\"Multithreading example in Python finished.\\") \`\`\` In this test project, we create two threads: one that prints numbers from 1 to 5 at a 1-second interval, and another that prints letters ('a' to 'e') at the same interval.

В ответ на эту угрозу среди обычных людей появляются охотники со специальными силами или способностями, которые борются с этими существами. Эта сюжетная линия является центральной для многих произведений в жанре фэнтези или супергероической манхвы. Одним из наиболее популярных примеров манхвы, соответствующей описанному сюжету, является \\"Solo Leveling\\" (или \\"Only I Level Up\\"). В этом комиксе главный герой, Сон Джин-Ву, превращается из слабейшего охотника в самого сильного благодаря способности повышать свой уровень в одиночку. Главная особенность – не только битвы с монстрами, выходящими из порталов, но и подробно разработанная система прокачки и развития персонажа, что добавляет уникальности рассказу. Эта тематика популярна в корейских комиксах за счет своей способности сочетать мотивы современного фэнтези, элементы RPG (ролевых игр) и динамичные сцены боя, что делает их интересными для широкой аудитории."},{"instruction":"Опиши как могли бы быть организованы структуры и объединения этих охотников в следующих страны, учитывая социальные особенности этих стран (но не надо включать культурно-исторические особенности, только современные социальные особенности): 1.

Бразилия","output":"Взглянем на то, как могли бы быть организованы структуры охотников на монстров, ориентируясь на социальные особенности современных обществ в разных странах и регионах: 1. **Южная Корея**: Здесь структура охотников может быть похожа на организацию стартапов или крупных корпораций, таких как Samsung или LG, с чёткой иерархией и конкурентоспособностью. Охотники, подобно сотрудникам, могут проходить стрессовые тесты и оценки для повышения в ранге. Команды охотников напоминают департаменты, каждый со своей специализацией. 2. **Япония**: В Японии объединения охотников могут быть структурированы в духе крупных конгломератов и синдикатов с уклоном в налаживание долговременных отношений и упором на коллективизм. Важна гармония внутри коллектива и взаимопомощь. Существуют сильные традиции менторства и стажировок для начинающих охотников. 3. **Китай**: Организации охотников могли бы быть тесно связаны с государством и интегрированы в государственную структуру, работая рука об руку с официальными органами. Это могло бы обеспечить высокий уровень организации и координации, а также строгий контроль за деятельностью охотников. 4. **Россия**: Структуры охотников могли бы развиваться в форме своеобразных кланов или сообществ с сильными лидерами и ярко выраженной вертикалью власти. Возможно, существовали бы частные военные компании, преобразованные в организации охотников. 5. **США**: В США структуры охотников могли бы быть очень диверсифицированными, от частных военных компаний и безопасности до государственных агентств и некоммерческих организаций с высоким уровнем индивидуализма. Вероятно, были бы значительные инвестиции в технологии и инновации в борьбе с монстрами. 6. **Евросоюз**: Объединения охотников здесь могли бы быть хорошо регулируемы и стандартизированы с упором на сотрудничество между государствами-членами. Вероятно, существовал бы общий фронт в обмене информацией, ресурсами и технологиями. 7. **Индия**: Объединение охотников могло бы совмещать государственную поддержку с индивидуальной инициативой, отражая принципы фамильного бизнеса и стартап-культуры. Такие структуры могли бы также учитывать кастовую систему при распределении ролей и обязанностей. 8. **Бразилия**: В Бразилии структуры охотников могли бы иметь тесные связи с местными сообществами, опираясь на сильные социальные сети. Это могло бы привести к формированию гибких и адаптируемых групп с децентрализованным управлением, способных эффективно реагировать на угрозы в различных регионах страны."},{"instruction":"можешь придумать шутку про рисование с помощью нейросетей?","output":"Конечно, вот: — Как нейросеть доказывает, что она умеет рисовать? — Она просто берёт и создаёт портрет, который так похож на хозяина, что даже его собака начинает вилять хвостом, когда видит картину на экране!"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Ghalib's poetry is deeply philosophical and reflects his keen observation of life. Below are a couple of his famous couplets (sher) in Roman Urdu, along with a brief explanation of their meanings: 1. **\\"Hazaron khwahishein aisi ke har khwahish pe dam nikle, Bahut niklay mere armaan lekin phir bhi kam nikle.\\"** This couplet expresses a profound longing and insatiable desires. It translates to, \\"I have thousands of desires, each worth dying for. Many of them I have realized; yet I yearn for more.\\" Ghalib talks about the unending nature of human desire, indicating that no matter how many wishes are fulfilled, we always long for more. 2. **\\"Dil hi toh hai na sang-o-khisht dard se bhar na aaye kyun, Royenge hum hazaar baar, koi hamein sataye kyun?\\"** This couplet can be translated as, \\"It's only a heart, not stone or brick, why wouldn't it be filled with pain? I will cry a thousand times, why would someone trouble me?\\" Here, Ghalib speaks to the vulnerability of the human heart, emphasizing its capacity to love and feel pain deeply. He questions the nature of suffering and the reasons behind it, expressing a sentiment of anguish mingled with resignation. 3. **\\"Ibne Maryam hua kare koi, mere dukh ki dawa kare koi.\\"** Translated, this means, \\"Would that someone were the son of Mary, to heal my sorrows.\\" In this couplet, Ghalib alludes to Jesus Christ (referred to as the son of Mary) as a healer. Through this, he expresses a deep yearning for someone to come and alleviate his suffering, subtly hinting at the divine or miraculous intervention as the only remedy for his existential pains. Ghalib's poetry is multi-faceted, often layered with meanings that delve into the complexities of life, love, and philosophy. The beauty of his work lies in its universality and the timeless relevance of his themes, which continue to resonate with readers around the world."},{"instruction":"Hii GPT!!!

At the end Telling her that I really like to spend time with her and her nature is great, it's that she has a curiosity for learning. Or Told her that after going home whenever I learn something new I think In my head as I explain it to you very simply.","output":"Having a genuine and engaging conversation with someone you like is crucial for building a good rapport and possibly deeper connections. Given the topics you've outlined, here are some suggestions on how to approach each point smoothly and considerately: **1. Why She Should Choose FSC:** Start by asking her about her interests and what she hopes to achieve in her future career. Then, explain the benefits of FSC (Faculty of Science), focusing on how it could align with her goals and interests. Highlight the comprehensive curriculum, diverse research opportunities, and supportive academic environment. Make it a two-way conversation by also asking what she thinks about it. **2. Her Trip to Lahore:** Express genuine interest in her experience. Ask open-ended questions like what places she visited in Lahore, what she enjoyed the most, and if there was anything that surprised her. Sharing a story of your own about a memorable trip could make the conversation more reciprocal. **3. Evolution, Ghosts, and Objective vs. Subjective Truth:** This can be a sensitive topic as it delves into personal beliefs. Preface the conversation by stating you're interested in discussing these concepts from a perspective of curiosity and learning, not to challenge or change her views. Emphasize that you're sharing information and not necessarily your personal beliefs. This could lead to an intellectually stimulating conversation, but be ready to change the topic if it gets uncomfortable. **4. Favourite Subjects:** Simply ask her about her favorite subjects and why she likes them. Share your own favorites, too, and if there are any common interests, delve deeper into those. This can show mutual understanding and shared passions. **5. Thailand and Love for Australia:** Share your experiences or what attracts you to Thailand, but ensure you're also inviting her thoughts on the country. When talking about your future plans and why you love Australia, focus on what aspects of the country excite you the most — be it the lifestyle, educational opportunities, nature, etc. Ask if she has any countries she feels drawn to and why. **6. Tricky Questions and Mimicking Activity:** This should be approached with a playful tone. Pick light-hearted and fun questions that can spark intriguing conversations without making her feel uncomfortable. The mimicking game should also be done in good humor to ensure it doesn't come off as mocking. **7. Expressing Your Feelings:** At the end of your meet-up, be sincere and direct about your feelings. You can say something like, \\"I've really enjoyed our time together today. Your curiosity and eagerness to learn are qualities I admire. I find myself thinking about our conversations and looking forward to sharing new things I've learned with you. I hope we can spend more time together in the future.\\" Remember, the most important part of any conversation, especially with someone you're interested in, is to listen actively, show genuine interest in what they have to say, and be respectful of their views and feelings. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"Well I done know if she likes me or not and she is my first cousin I done know what todo","output":"Navigating feelings for a first cousin can be quite complex due to cultural, social, and familial dynamics. Here are some thoughts on how to proceed thoughtfully with your situation. # Reflect on Your Feelings First, take some time to really understand your feelings. Are they fleeting, or have they been consistent over a significant period? Sometimes, especially when we're close to someone or when they are one of our few close contacts, we might confuse deep affection and familiarity for romantic love. # Consider the Cultural and Legal Context In many cultures and places, romantic relationships between first cousins are viewed differently. In some, it's perfectly acceptable and even encouraged. In others, it might be legal but socially frowned upon, and in some cultures or jurisdictions, it's both illegal and culturally unacceptable. Assess the context you're in, as this should inform your decision on whether or not to disclose your feelings. # Assess the Potential Impact on Family Dynamics Think about how your family might react if they knew about your feelings, regardless of whether or not they are reciprocated. Families can have strong opinions about relationships between cousins, and it’s important to consider the potential consequences your actions might have on family relationships. # Communication If after careful consideration, you decide your feelings are worth exploring, the key is communication, but tread very carefully. Rather than expressing your feelings directly at first, you might want to start by strengthening your bond, spending time together, and gauging her interest in you - does she seek you out, enjoy spending time with you, engage in deep conversations with you? If you sense that she might share your feelings, you could consider opening up about your emotions, but ensure to do so in a way that is respectful, acknowledging the complexity of the situation, and giving her ample space to process and respond without pressure. It's vital to be prepared for any outcome, including her not sharing your feelings or deciding that acting on them isn't wise considering your familial relationship. # Prioritize Emotional Well-being Regardless of what happens, prioritize your emotional well-being and hers. Finding someone to talk to, like a trusted friend or counselor, about your feelings can provide a valuable outlet and perspective. # Moving Forward Finally, prepare yourself for all possible outcomes. If she doesn’t share your feelings, or if either of you decides not to pursue a relationship due to the familial context, it will be essential to focus on healing and moving forward. Remember, it’s possible to maintain a meaningful and fulfilling relationship as cousins without it being romantic. Given the nuances of this situation, taking slow and thoughtful steps is key."},{"instruction":"Is there's some test that we can do which tells that how much our genetic is same and how likely it is that our children born disabled or with some disease common in our family","output":"Yes, individuals who are closely related or have concerns about inherited conditions, including prospective parents from the same family, can undergo genetic testing to assess the risk of passing certain genetic conditions to their offspring. This type of genetic testing usually involves one or more of the following: # Genetic Counseling Before any genetic tests are conducted, it's highly recommended to meet with a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors are healthcare professionals with specialized training in medical genetics and counseling. They can provide valuable insights into potential genetic risks and guide you through the process of testing. They help evaluate family history, discuss the implications of various genetic tests, and interpret test results in the context of familial relationships. # Genetic Screening Tests - **Carrier Screening:** This test assesses whether an individual carries a gene for certain genetic disorders that could be passed on to their children. When both parents carry a recessive gene for the same condition, their children have a higher risk (typically 25% per pregnancy) of inheriting the condition. - **Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD):** For couples considering in vitro fertilization (IVF), PGD allows for the genetic testing of embryos before they are implanted. This can help ensure that only embryos without specific genetic conditions are selected for implantation. - **Prenatal Genetic Testing:** If pregnancy is already underway, tests like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can diagnose many genetic disorders in the fetus. However, these tests carry some risk to the fetus and should be discussed with a healthcare provider. # Factors to Consider 1. **Specific Conditions:** The decision to undergo genetic testing might be influenced by the presence of specific inherited conditions within the family or the desire to assess the risk of more common conditions. 2. **Ethical and Emotional Implications:** Genetic testing can have significant emotional and ethical implications. It's essential to consider how the knowledge of genetic risk might affect you emotionally and psychologically, and how it might impact family dynamics. 3. **Privacy and Discrimination:** Consider the implications of genetic testing on privacy and the potential for genetic discrimination by insurance companies or employers, although laws like the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) in the United States provide some protections. Given the complexity of genetic testing and the interpretation of its results, engaging with healthcare providers and genetic counselors before making decisions is crucial. They can provide the most current and comprehensive advice tailored to your specific situation and help navigate the emotional and ethical considerations involved."},{"instruction":"","output":"I noticed your submission is blank.

It was about a girl named Lila, who, beneath the facade of normalcy, harbored a secret as vast as the sky itself—she could fly. Meadowfield was a place where the extraordinary hid behind the curtains of the mundane. The townsfolk went about their lives, none wiser to the fact that among them lived a girl who could soar above their neatly lined houses and cobblestone streets. Lila’s life was a delicate balance between the ordinary and the extraordinary. By day, she was just another face in the crowd, her feet firmly planted on the ground. But as dusk fell and the world around her slept, she would spread her wings, invisible to all but the stars that watched over her. It was in these stolen moments of freedom that Lila felt most alive, the cool night air caressing her face as she danced between the clouds. Yet, with each flight, she carried the weight of a secret that grew heavier with time. For in Meadowfield, where nothing out of the ordinary was supposed to happen, Lila’s gift was a spark waiting to ignite a story of suspense and uncharted skies. Stay tuned as this tale of wonder and whispers unfolds, where every turn is laced with the unexpected, and every chapter promises to keep you hooked until the very end. The tale of Lila’s secret began on an afternoon that shimmered with the haze of summer. She was perched high in her favorite tree, a silent observer to the world below. It was here, amidst the whispering leaves, that her life took a fateful turn. A misstep sent her tumbling towards the earth, but instead of the harsh embrace of the ground, she found herself suspended in mid-air, her heart a wild drumbeat in her chest. In that breathless moment, Lila discovered she could fly. The revelation was as terrifying as it was exhilarating. Lila knew that her newfound ability was a gift that could turn into a curse if revealed. So, she tucked it away like a secret melody, a tune only she could hear and dance to. She walked the familiar streets of Meadowfield with her feet firmly on the ground, her flights reserved for the solitude of night when only the moon could bear witness. It was during one of these nocturnal escapades that she first saw Noah. He was the enigma, the boy who had appeared in town as suddenly as a storm cloud on a clear day. With his quiet demeanor and thoughtful gaze, he seemed to be hiding secrets of his own. Their paths crossed under the cloak of twilight, and a silent understanding flickered between them. In Noah, Lila found an unlikely confidant, a friend who looked at the world from a different angle. As their friendship deepened, Lila felt the walls around her secret crumble. Noah, with his gentle curiosity, never prodded, but Lila sensed a kindred spirit in him. It was this unspoken bond that eventually led her to share the truth of her flights. Noah’s reaction was a mix of awe and disbelief, but beneath it all, Lila saw a spark of something else—acceptance. Together, they navigated the complexities of a friendship built on trust and the extraordinary. But as they would soon discover, some secrets have a way of escaping into the world, and the tranquility of Meadowfield was about to be disrupted in ways they could never have imagined. As the bond between Lila and Noah grew, so did the trust between them. It was during a moonlit rendezvous that Lila, with a heart full of hope and fear, revealed her secret to Noah. She took to the skies, her silhouette a graceful shadow against the luminescent orb above. Noah watched in silent wonder, his eyes reflecting a world of possibilities that Lila’s gift could bring. Their newfound closeness, however, was soon to be tested. One fateful evening, as they walked through the dimly lit streets of Meadowfield, they became unwitting witnesses to a crime—a burglary at the local jeweler’s. Without a thought for her own safety, Lila soared into the night, her eyes sharp as she tracked the fleeing figure. In her haste to help, Lila inadvertently led the authorities to Noah. The evidence, circumstantial as it was, pointed to him, and whispers of suspicion began to spread like wildfire. The townspeople, who had once greeted Noah with friendly nods, now looked upon him with distrust. Lila was torn. To clear Noah’s name, she would have to reveal her secret to the world, a secret that had become as much a part of her as the very air she breathed while aloft. The thought of being grounded, of being seen as an oddity, frightened her more than she cared to admit. Yet, the thought of Noah suffering for a crime he did not commit was unbearable. The drama unfolded as Lila grappled with her conscience. The town’s suspicion was a heavy shroud that threatened to suffocate the truth. Lila knew that only she could lift it, but at what cost? The stage was set for a revelation that would shake the very foundations of Meadowfield, and Lila stood at its center, her decision poised to change everything. The story continues, each sentence weaving a tighter web of suspense, drawing you, the reader, into the heart of the drama. Stay tuned as the tale of Lila and Noah unfolds, where every second is laced with the unexpected, and every choice comes with a price. The day of reckoning had arrived, and the town of Meadowfield was abuzz with anticipation. The courthouse was packed, the air thick with tension and whispered theories. Noah, the boy with the mysterious past, sat quietly, his fate in the hands of those who did not understand the truth. Outside, Lila took a deep breath, the wind whispering encouragements as she prepared to reveal her secret to the world. With a determined leap, she took flight, her form rising gracefully into the sky. The townspeople poured out of buildings, their eyes tracking the impossible sight. A collective gasp filled the air, followed by a cacophony of reactions—fear, awe, disbelief. As Lila soared above the rooftops, her mind was focused on a singular goal—to find the evidence that would clear Noah’s name. She flew beyond the town’s borders, her eyes scanning the ground below. Time was slipping away, and with each passing moment, Noah’s chances dimmed. Finally, her persistence paid off. Hidden in the underbrush, away from prying eyes, lay the discarded mask of the true culprit. With the evidence secured, Lila raced back to the courthouse, the proof of Noah’s innocence clutched tightly in her hands. She descended amidst the chaos, her arrival stirring a whirlwind of questions and camera flashes. But Lila’s eyes were on the courtroom doors. She pushed through the crowd, her resolve as strong as the beating of her wings. The trial resumed with a hush, all eyes on the girl who defied gravity. Lila presented the mask, her voice steady as she recounted her discovery. The evidence was undeniable, and as the truth unfolded, the room erupted into murmurs of shock and realization. Noah’s name was cleared amidst a flurry of apologies and disbelief. But the impact of Lila’s flight had only just begun to ripple through Meadowfield. Her bravery had saved an innocent, but the consequences of her revelation were yet to be seen. The climax of “A Girl Who Could Fly” leaves us on the edge of our seats, the lines between fear and wonder blurred. As we turn the page, we brace ourselves for the fallout, the story of Lila and Noah forever etched into the annals of Meadowfield’s history. The dust of revelation settled over the town of Meadowfield like a fine mist, and Lila found herself at the heart of it. The secret of her flight, once a treasure she held close, was now a spectacle for all to scrutinize. The courtroom had been a stage, and her act of salvation for Noah had been the performance that changed everything. In the days that followed, Lila walked through Meadowfield under the weight of countless stares. Some were filled with wonder, others with fear, and a few with something akin to envy. But it was the look of gratitude in Noah’s eyes that reminded her why she had chosen to reveal her secret. Noah, once a suspect, was now free, but his freedom came at the cost of his anonymity. The bond he shared with Lila was forged in the fire of their trials, and though he was exonerated, the whispers of the past clung to him like shadows at dusk. Lila’s moral dilemma had been a tempest, and her decision to act had been the eye of the storm. Now, as the winds calmed, she was left to navigate the aftermath. The girl who could fly was now the girl who had flown in the face of fear, and in doing so, had altered the course of her life and the lives around her. The falling action of our story sees Lila coming to terms with her new reality. She had chosen to act, to save a friend, and now she must face a world that knew her secret. It was a world that was both larger and smaller than before, and as Lila looked to the skies, she knew that her flights would never be the same. But there was a strength in her, a resolve that had been tempered like steel in the forge of her experiences. As the story of “A Girl Who Could Fly” nears its end, we are left with a portrait of courage and the poignant truth that sometimes, the greatest act of bravery is simply the act of standing up for a friend.

As the curtain falls on the current chapter of Lila’s life, the stage is quietly being set for her next grand adventure. In the stillness that follows the storm, a new breeze begins to stir in Meadowfield, carrying whispers of change. Lila, once the girl who soared in secret, now finds herself the keeper of countless mysteries that the skies have yet to reveal. In the coming days, a series of enigmatic dreams will visit Lila, each more vivid than the last, hinting at a heritage that transcends the very town that fears her. Noah, though miles away, discovers an ancient tome that speaks of a society of skywalkers—protectors of the balance between earth and the heavens. His findings will compel him to return to Meadowfield, setting the stage for a reunion that could alter the fabric of their reality. The next part of the story promises to take Lila and Noah on a journey that will challenge the limits of their courage and the depth of their friendship. As they stand on the precipice of the unknown, one thing remains certain—their tale is far from over, and the sky is merely the beginning.","output":"# Section 1: The Whispering Tale of Meadowfield **Prompt**: Imagine a quaint little town named Meadowfield, bathed in the soft glow of sunset, where cobblestone streets and neatly lined houses exude an aura of timeless tranquility.

Fred asks Jeannie's gang to join them, and they leave off driving. Jeannie causes Scooby to float along with her, but when Babu tries to do the same with Shaggy, he makes the whole Mystery Machine ascend to the sky. Jeannie puts it back on the ground. They stop, at a fork in the road. Babu receives a message from the Great Hajji for Jeannie to come to Persia to help a Prince Abin, a friend of his.

In his room, Scooby sees a veiled ghost in a closet, who comes after him, and then after Babu and Shaggy. Babu tries to make him disappear, but only makes the bed they're hiding under disappear. He then calls for Jeannie who makes the ghost disappear. Shaggy thinks it was a joke, but Jeannie says it was a \\"dangerous game\\" being played by someone. Henry is grooming himself in a mirror and then his reflection begins acting funny, moving differently than he is. He tries to explain to Cory who doesn't understand.

Fred and Jeannie point out that whoever released him was the big master, and therefore the cause of all the trouble. Jeannie makes him appear, and it is Uncle Abdullah. He felt the power and wealth of the sultanate was rightly his because Abin's father ruled with love and not by force \\"as a sultan should\\".

Scooby howls, breaking the bottle; Jeannie is now free and kisses Scooby. Soon she, sensing her master, finds him and the others from on the other side of a solid rock wall. Jeannie recognizes Velma's bottle as being 10,000 years old. Jadal appears and duels magically with Jeannie. But Jeannie, knowing all his tricks, defeats him, forcing him back into the bottle. Fred and Jeannie point out that whoever released him was the big master, and therefore the cause of all the trouble. Jeannie makes him appear, and it is Uncle Abdullah. He felt the power and wealth of the sultanate was rightly his because Abin's father ruled with love and not by force \\"as a sultan should\\". Jeannie cannot judge mortals, so she imprisons him in the bottle with Jadal for the Great Hajji to take care of.

Your Spring Boot application can consume these APIs directly, thus indirectly utilizing DataWeave capabilities through API calls. This approach is more about integration at the service layer rather than embedding DataWeave directly into Spring Boot. 2. **Direct Usage (Advanced and Not Straightforward):** At the time of writing, there isn't a direct, supported library or SDK provided by MuleSoft to use DataWeave standalone in Java applications like Spring Boot. DataWeave is a powerful transformation language primarily designed for use within Mule applications. However, theoretically, you can include Mule runtime in your Spring Boot application to leverage DataWeave, but this is not a common or recommended practice due to potential issues with library conflicts, overhead, and the complexity of managing Mule runtime within a Spring Boot application. Given the second option is complex and generally not recommended, the best approach is to abstract the transformation logic you need into a Mule application, expose it as a microservice (API), and interact with it from your Spring Boot application. Here's a conceptual overview of how you can achieve this: # Leveraging Anypoint Platform (Recommended Approach) 1. **Create Mule Application:** Use Anypoint Studio to create a Mule application. Utilize DataWeave along with other Mule components to implement your integration logic and data transformations. 2. **Expose as API:** Once your transformation logic is implemented using DataWeave, expose this functionality as a RESTful API using Anypoint Studio's built-in capabilities (APIKit, HTTP Listener, etc.). 3. **Deploy Mule Application:** Deploy your Mule application to CloudHub, Mule Runtime, or any supported environment. 4. **Consume API in Spring Boot:** In your Spring Boot application, you can consume the exposed API the same way you would with any other RESTful service. Use RestTemplate, WebClient, or any HTTP client of your choice to make HTTP requests to your Mule API. \`\`\`java // Example using RestTemplate to consume the API RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(); String resourceUrl = \\"http://your-mule-api-endpoint/resource\\"; ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity(resourceUrl, String.class); System.out.println(response.getBody()); \`\`\` # Summary Integrating DataWeave directly within a Spring Boot application isn't straightforward and isn't officially supported directly by MuleSoft as of my last update. The practical and supported way to leverage DataWeave in your data transformation needs is by creating Mule applications and consuming their functionalities through APIs exposed to your Spring Boot application. This approach keeps your transformations modular, lets you leverage the full power of MuleSoft's ecosystem, and maintains the separation of concerns."},{"instruction":"I have this code as below, this code reads a 10K ohm High power LED driver board, in the past I read the value and it is between 65 to 337 through ADC0 pin, and based on value turn 1 to 6 LEDs; I'm using 6 pcs of 2N2222 transistors collector pin of it connected to (-) pin of LED and (+) is connected to 100 ohm resistors and bases are connected to PD1 to PD6 pins of AVR ATmega328P U through 6pcs of 220 ohm resistors; I had this code as below which was for ATmega32A 40 pin; know I want to use 28 pin ATmega328P; take all necessary changes so it can be compatible with ATmega328 #define F_CPU 16000000UL // 16 MHz clock #include <avr/io.h> #include <util/delay.h> // Define potentiometer ADC channel (PA0 = ADC0) #define potPin 0 // Define digital I/O pins for LEDs - changed to use PD1 to PD6 #define led1 PD1 #define led2 PD2 #define led3 PD3 #define led4 PD4 #define led5 PD5 #define led6 PD6 #define SAMPLES_TO_AVERAGE 10 // Number of samples to average for ADC void adc_init() { // Initialize ADC ADMUX = (1<<REFS0); // Select AVcc as reference voltage and ADC0 as input channel ADCSRA = (1<<ADEN) | (1<<ADPS2) | (1<<ADPS1) | (1<<ADPS0); // Enable ADC and set prescaler to 128 } uint16_t adc_read(uint8_t ch) { // Select ADC channel with safety mask and without changing the reference voltage selection ADMUX = (ADMUX & 0xF0) | (ch & 0x0F); // Start single conversion ADCSRA |= (1<<ADSC); // Wait until conversion is complete while (ADCSRA & (1<<ADSC)); return ADC; } uint16_t adc_read_average(uint8_t ch) { uint32_t sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i < SAMPLES_TO_AVERAGE; ++i) { sum += adc_read(ch); } return (uint16_t)(sum / SAMPLES_TO_AVERAGE); } int main(void) { // Set up the LED pins as output - updated for PD1 to PD6 DDRD |= (1<<led1) | (1<<led2) | (1<<led3) | (1<<led4) | (1<<led5) | (1<<led6); // Initialize ADC adc_init(); while(1) { // Read the value from the potentiometer and average it uint16_t potValue = adc_read_average(potPin); // Map the potentiometer value from the given range (65 - 337) to (0 - 1023) uint16_t mappedValue = (uint32_t)(potValue - 65) * 1023 / (337 - 65); // Define thresholds based on the number of LEDs uint16_t threshold1 = 170; // First threshold uint16_t threshold2 = 341; // Second threshold uint16_t threshold3 = 512; // Third threshold uint16_t threshold4 = 683; // Fourth threshold uint16_t threshold5 = 854; // Fifth threshold // Turn off all LEDs to start with - updated for PD1 to PD6 PORTD &= ~((1<<led1) | (1<<led2) | (1<<led3) | (1<<led4) | (1<<led5) | (1<<led6)); // Determine which LEDs to light up based on the mappedValue - updated for PD1 to PD6 if (mappedValue >= threshold5) { PORTD |= (1<<led1) | (1<<led2) | (1<<led3) | (1<<led4) | (1<<led5) | (1<<led6); } else if (mappedValue >= threshold4) { PORTD |= (1<<led1) | (1<<led2) | (1<<led3) | (1<<led4) | (1<<led5); } else if (mappedValue >= threshold3) { PORTD |= (1<<led1) | (1<<led2) | (1<<led3) | (1<<led4); } else if (mappedValue >= threshold2) { PORTD |= (1<<led1) | (1<<led2) | (1<<led3); } else if (mappedValue >= threshold1) { PORTD |= (1<<led1) | (1<<led2); } else { // Ensure led1 is always turned on regardless of the value PORTD |= (1<<led1); } // Small delay to reduce flickering _delay_ms(30); } }","output":"Your code snippet is originally written for the ATmega32A microcontroller and you wish to port it to the ATmega328P. Both microcontrollers are quite similar in many respects but have different pinouts and feature sets that might require attention during porting. However, for the core functionalities you've described (ADC reading, digital I/O for LEDs control), these two models are compatible enough to make the porting process straightforward. The code you provided already seems ready for the ATmega328P in terms of the functions used for ADC and digital I/O operations, as these are quite standard across AVR microcontrollers. However, there are a few considerations and confirmations you'll need to address or be aware of: 1. **Pin Mapping:** Ensure that the pin mapping (PD1 to PD6 for LEDs) is appropriate for your target application and circuit design with the ATmega328P. The ATmega328P has a different pinout from the ATmega32A, but your code's logic for controlling the LEDs should remain functionally the same since it relies on manipulating port registers directly. Just confirm the physical pins correspond correctly to your design. 2. **AVR Libc and Toolchain:** Ensure that the AVR GCC toolchain and AVR Libc you're using are up to date or compatible with the ATmega328P. This should generally not be a problem, but it's good practice to check, especially if you encounter unexpected issues during compilation or runtime. 3. **Fuse Bits:** When moving from one microcontroller to another, it's important to review and configure the fuse bits correctly for your specific needs (e.g., clock source settings). This code assumes a 16 MHz external crystal or resonator as the clock source (\`F_CPU 16000000UL\`). Ensure your ATmega328P system is configured to use a compatible clock source and that the fuse bits are set accordingly. 4. **ADC Reference:** The ADMUX setup for the ADC uses AVcc as the reference voltage (\`ADMUX = (1<<REFS0);\`). This is a common and convenient choice, but ensure it fits your hardware setup. If your system uses a different voltage reference, adjust this setting. 5. **Bootloader (if applicable):** If you're using the ATmega328P with a bootloader (e.g., for Arduino-based projects), remember that the bootloader occupies some of the flash memory space, and the reset vector will jump to the bootloader entry point after each reset. This does not directly impact the provided code but is part of the system setup to be aware of. Considering the points above, your code should be compatible with the ATmega328P as it focuses on features (ADC readings, GPIO operations) that are largely consistent across these AVR chips. The most critical aspect will be ensuring that your hardware design and pin assignments match the ATmega328P pinout and capabilities."},{"instruction":"I don't know why, but it just lighting up 1 leds and dose not change LEDs based on maped value","output":"If your setup is only lighting up one LED and does not change based on the mapped value from the potentiometer, there could be several areas to investigate for potential issues. Here are some steps and considerations to help you troubleshoot and fix the problem: # 1. Verify Hardware Connections - **Potentiometer Connection**: Confirm that the potentiometer is correctly connected to the ADC0 pin and is providing varying voltage as you change its position. - **LEDs and Transistors**: Double-check the connections between the LEDs, 2N2222 transistors, resistors, and the ATmega328P pins. Ensure that the LED polarity is correct, the resistors are correctly placed, and that the transistors are functioning as intended. - **Power Supply**: Ensure that your power supply is stable and sufficient for your circuit. # 2. Debug ADC Value - **Serial Debugging (if possible)**: If you have UART to USB converter, implement UART debugging to print out the ADC values read by the ATmega328P. This will help you confirm if the potentiometer readings are being correctly captured. - **Check ADC Initialization**: Make sure that the ADC initialization code is correct and that the ADC is properly configured to read from the expected pin (ADC0 in your case). # 3. Validate the Mapping Logic The mapping logic you have implemented scales the ADC reading (assumed range 65-337) to a new range (0-1023). Verify that this mapping is working as expected. You could temporarily replace the potentiometer reading with fixed values to simulate different levels and observe the LED behavior. # 4. Review the LED Control Logic Your LED control logic turns on various LEDs based on the thresholds. Temporarily hard-code different \`mappedValue\` values to check if the correct LEDs light up as you would expect. This can help determine if the issue is in the mapping or in the control logic itself. # 5. Software Delays Although unlikely to be the root cause for not changing LEDs based on the mapped value, confirm that the delay (\`_delay_ms(30);\`) is suitable. If the delay is too short or too long, it might affect how changes in the LED's state are perceived. # Example UART Debugging Code If you decide to use UART for debugging, you would need to initialize the UART and then send debugging messages to observe the ADC values. Here's a simple example of how you might send data over UART (ensure to configure UART appropriately for your system's clock and baud rate settings): \`\`\`c void uart_init(uint16_t ubrr) { UBRR0H = (unsigned char)(ubrr>>8); UBRR0L = (unsigned char)ubrr; UCSR0B = (1<<RXEN0)|(1<<TXEN0); UCSR0C = (1<<UCSZ01)|(1<<UCSZ00); } void uart_transmit(unsigned char data) { while (!(UCSR0A & (1<<UDRE0))); UDR0 = data; } void uart_println(const char* str) { while (*str) { uart_transmit(*str++); } uart_transmit('r'); uart_transmit('n'); } // Initialize UART: Example call with 9600 baud for a 16MHz system clock uart_init(103); // 103 comes from the formula for 16MHz and 9600 baud // Usage within your loop or function uart_println(\\"ADC Value:\\"); // Convert ADC value to string and print... \`\`\` This debug approach assumes you have an understanding of UART communication and the tools to view serial output on your computer. # Conclusion Carefully step through each of these areas. It's likely that the issue is either a simple oversight in the hardware setup or a logical error in mapping and controlling the LEDs based on the potentiometer's ADC values."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Самая правая часть доменного имени, следующая после последней точки, называется доменом верхнего уровня (Top-Level Domain, TLD). Домены верхнего уровня подразделяются на две основные категории: общие (gTLD) и национальные (ccTLD). 1. **.com** — один из общих доменов верхнего уровня (gTLD). Изначально он обозначал \\"commercial\\" и использовался для коммерческих организаций, но в настоящее время его может регистрировать любой желающий без ограничений. 2. **.ru** — национальный домен верхнего уровня (ccTLD) для сайтов, связанных с Россией. Он используется компаниями, организациями и частными лицами, желающими подчеркнуть свою связь с этой страной. 3. **.it** — национальный домен верхнего уровня (ccTLD) для Италии. Он служит аналогичным образом, чтобы указать на связь с Италией, причём его могут регистрировать как местные, так и иностранные компании и частные лица, соответствующие определённым условиям. Сочетания вроде **site.br.it.com** отражают иерархию доменных имен, где каждый уровень располагается слева от предыдущего и отделяется точкой. В данном примере: - **.com** — домен верхнего уровня (gTLD), который чаще всего используется для коммерческих организаций. - **.it** — поддомен второго уровня, который может использоваться для указания на географическую или другую спецификацию внутри домена .com, но в данном контексте может казаться необычным, поскольку обычно ожидается, что ccTLD (как .it) будет в конце. - **.br** — поддомен третьего уровня, возможно, дополнительная спецификация внутри .it.com. В некоторых контекстах домены третьего уровня используются для указания на конкретный регион или город. - **site** — фактическое имя домена (называемое также \\"второстепенным доменным именем\\" или \\"SLD\\" для доменов второго уровня как .ru, .it и .com). Однако указанный пример **site.br.it.com** не является типичным и может вызвать путаницу. Он может быть попыткой представить сложную структуру поддоменов или специфическое наименование в рамках проекта.

DNS преобразует удобные для человека доменные имена, такие как site.com, в IP-адреса, которые используются для идентификации устройств в сети Интернет. Это позволяет пользователю вводить имя сайта в браузере и подключаться к нужному серверу. # Присвоение IP-адресов 1. **Одинаковый IP-адрес для разных доменов и поддоменов**: Возможно, чтобы разные доменные имена (например, \`site.sale.com\` и \`site.com\`) указывали на один и тот же IP-адрес. Это распространённая практика, особенно при настройке алиасов или при использовании одного физического сервера для размещения нескольких сайтов. Такой подход упрощает управление веб-хостингом и может эффективно использоваться для создания дополнительных сайтов, маркетинговых кампаний или тестирования без необходимости приобретения дополнительных IP-адресов. 2. **Разные IP-адреса для разных доменных имен**: Это также распространённая ситуация, особенно когда речь идёт о больших организациях или когда для разных сервисов требуются разные хостинговые среды. В этом случае каждый домен или поддомен может указывать на свой уникальный IP-адрес, отражая размещение на разных серверах или в разных центрах обработки данных. # Техническая реализация Присвоение IP-адресов осуществляется через DNS-записи, в частности через записи типа A (для IPv4-адресов) и AAAA (для IPv6-адресов). Когда администратор домена настраивает DNS-записи для домена и его поддоменов, он указывает в записях A или AAAA соответствующие IP-адреса. Эти записи затем хранятся на DNS-серверах и используются для перевода доменных имен в IP-адреса при запросах к сайту. # Пример Допустим, у нас есть сайт \`site.com\` и поддомен \`sale.site.com\`. - \`site.com\` может иметь DNS-запись A, указывающую на IP-адрес 192.0.2.1. - \`sale.site.com\` может иметь отдельную запись A, ссылающуюся либо на тот же IP-адрес (192.0.2.1), либо на другой IP-адрес (например, 192.0.2.2), в зависимости от требований и настроек хостинга. Таким образом, возможность присвоения одинаковых или разных IP-адресов зависит от конкретных нужд и настройки инфраструктуры владельца домена."},{"instruction":"Hi!

One key approach to understanding intentional acts within this framework is through the use of formal models and theories that attempt to break down the complexity of mental states and their intentional character. A seminal work in this area is Daniel Dennett's \\"The Intentional Stance\\" (1987), although it's more conceptual than strictly formal in a mathematical sense. For a more explicitly formal approach, you might explore works in the area of \\"belief-desire-intention\\" (BDI) models, which are prominent in artificial intelligence and are used to simulate practical reasoning and decision-making processes in agents. While BDI models originate in computer science, philosophers have also engaged with them to understand human intentional states: 1. **Michael Bratman's Work**: Michael Bratman's theories on intention, particularly his book \\"Intention, Plans, and Practical Reason\\" (1987), have profoundly influenced the BDI model. Although Bratman's work is not purely formal, it lays the conceptual groundwork that has been formalized in various BDI models. 2. **Anand S. Rao and Michael P. Georgeff's Formalization**: For a more technical and formal approach, Rao and Georgeff have made significant contributions with their papers on BDI agents. One of their foundational papers, \\"Modeling Rational Agents within a BDI-Architecture\\" (1991), presented at the 2nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, provides a formal framework for understanding intentional actions in the context of BDI agents. 3. **Formal Semantics for Mental States**: Another formal approach can be found in the work on the semantics of mental states, where philosophers and logicians use modal logic to model belief, desire, and intention. A reference work in this area is \\"Reasoning about Knowledge and Action\\" by Joseph Y. Halpern and Yoav Shoham (1986), which, while concentrating on knowledge and action, also touches on the foundational aspects that can apply to modeling intentions. 4. **Logic and Philosophy of Action**: John McCarthy, a prominent figure in artificial intelligence, has also contributed to the understanding of actions and intentions from a logical perspective. His paper \\"Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machines\\" (1979) and subsequent works delve into formal mechanisms for understanding intentional actions. These references come from different backgrounds, combining philosophy, computer science, and logic to address the modeling of intentional acts. The field is inherently interdisciplinary, bridging the gap between analytical philosophy and formal methods to better understand the structure and dynamics of intentional states."},{"instruction":"do you think intentional acts can be model in a multi level hierarchical causal network where intentional acts are downward causation ?","output":"The idea of modeling intentional acts within a multi-level hierarchical causal network where intentional acts are understood as a form of downward causation is both intriguing and plausible. This conceptual framework aligns with several theories and discussions in both philosophy of mind and cognitive science, reflecting the complex way in which mental states can influence physical states and behaviors. Let's explore the conceptual underpinnings and some challenges of this approach. # Conceptual Underpinnings 1. **Hierarchical Organization**: The human mind and brain exhibit a hierarchical organization, with higher cognitive functions built upon more basic neural processes. In this context, intentional acts can be seen as emerging from higher levels of cognitive organization, influencing and guiding lower-level processes (e.g., neural activity, motor responses). 2. **Downward Causation**: This concept refers to the idea that causal relationships can flow from higher-level systems (e.g., mental states) to lower-level phenomena (e.g., physical actions). In the context of intentional acts, this means that our intentions can causally influence our behavior and the neural processes underlying those behaviors. 3. **Compatibility with Cognitive Science**: Cognitive science often models mental processes using hierarchical frameworks, including computational models where higher-level cognitive algorithms direct lower-level processes. Viewing intentional acts as a form of downward causation fits well within such models. # Philosophical Considerations and Challenges 1. **Mind-Body Interaction**: The notion of downward causation in intentional acts raises age-old questions about the nature of the mind-body interaction. How can non-physical mental states exert causal influence over physical states? This question touches on debates between dualism, physicalism, and emergentism in philosophy of mind. 2. **Emergentism**: One way to reconcile the hierarchy and downward causation is through emergentism, the idea that higher-level properties (such as intentions) emerge from and cannot be reduced to lower-level physical processes, yet can exert causal influence. This approach attempts to bridge the explanatory gap between mental states and physical phenomena. 3. **Complex Systems Theory**: The idea of downward causation is also compatible with views from complex systems theory, where complex behaviors emerge from the interaction of simpler components. Intentional acts can be modeled as emergent phenomena within this multi-level hierarchical structure that, in turn, influence the system’s dynamics. 4. **Operationalization Challenges**: A significant challenge in modelling intentional acts as downward causation is operationalizing and quantifying these concepts in a scientifically rigorous manner. While the theoretical framework is appealing, developing empirical methods to test and validate such models remains a challenge. 5. **Free Will and Determinism**: This model also intersects with debates on free will and determinism. The idea of intentional acts as downward causation might suggest a form of compatibilism, where free will can coexist with a deterministic understanding of physical processes, provided we properly understand the levels of causation. In conclusion, modeling intentional acts within a multi-level hierarchical causal network involving downward causation presents an elegant and compelling way to integrate mental states into our understanding of causal interactions. Nonetheless, this approach also faces substantial philosophical and empirical challenges that require careful consideration and further development."},{"instruction":"there exist model of intentional will determination that take into account only rationality but not take physical biological and physiological factors into account ?","output":"Yes, models that focus primarily on rationality while largely abstracting away from physical, biological, and physiological factors do exist, especially within the fields of philosophy, decision theory, and artificial intelligence. These models typically aim to understand and predict intentional acts based on the principles of rational choice theory, logical reasoning, or formal frameworks for representing belief, desire, and intention. This approach can be seen as trying to capture the \\"pure\\" aspect of intentional will determination, grounded in reason and logic rather than the complexities of human biology. # Rational Choice Theory Rational choice theory, a fundamental concept in economics and political science, presumes that individuals make decisions by weighing the expected utility of different courses of action. This model assumes rational agents choose the option that maximizes their utility, based on their preferences and beliefs. Within this framework, the factors considered are the agent's beliefs, desires, and the logical implications of their actions in a context where physical and biological factors are not explicitly modeled. # Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) Models In artificial intelligence, BDI models represent agents based on their beliefs, desires, and intentions as key components driving their actions. Michael Bratman's philosophical theory of intention and planning has been influential in this area. BDI models focus on how an agent can decide on a course of action based on rational processes involving their mental states, without directly considering the underlying biological or physiological mechanisms. # Game Theory Game theory, another domain where such modeling occurs, explores how rational agents interact in situations that involve multiple decision-makers. Each agent's strategy is determined by their preferences and beliefs about other agents' strategies, aiming to maximize their own payoff. While game theory can be applied to biological contexts, at its core, it’s a mathematical abstraction focused on rational decision-making. # Logic-Based and Formal Epistemology Models Logic-based models in philosophy, particularly in formal epistemology and action theory, aim to dissect and understand the structure of rational belief, action, and intention through formal languages. These models use logical systems to represent how rational agents should update their beliefs in light of new evidence (belief revision), make decisions, or commit to intentions, often without direct reference to the underlying physical or biological reality. # Challenges and Criticisms While these models provide valuable insights into the nature of rational decision-making and intentional action, they also face criticism. One significant critique is the abstraction from physical, biological, and physiological realities, which are essential aspects of human existence and decision-making. Critics argue that ignoring these factors can lead to oversimplified models that fail to capture the complexity and nuances of real-world behavior. Furthermore, these models often presume a level of rationality that human agents do not consistently exhibit due to cognitive biases, emotional influences, and other non-rational factors. In summary, models that focus exclusively on rationality offer important tools for understanding aspects of intentional will and decision-making. However, integrating these with interdisciplinary approaches that consider the full spectrum of influencing factors—rational, emotional, physiological, and contextual—is crucial for developing a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior."},{"instruction":"give me all possible in-intentional acts, like \\"when i was sick, when i have tic and toc\\", ...","output":"Understanding in-intentional acts or unintentional acts requires distinguishing between actions performed with deliberate intention and those that happen without a specific conscious intention or as a result of involuntary processes. Unintentional acts can occur in various contexts and due to different reasons. It's challenging to provide an exhaustive list, but here are some examples that illustrate the breadth of unintentional acts: 1. **Physiological Reflexes**: Actions like sneezing, coughing, or blinking are automatic responses to certain stimuli and are not typically considered intentional. 2. **Habitual Actions**: Actions done out of habit without conscious thought, such as drumming fingers, habitual fidgeting, or automatically using a familiar route while driving, even if you intended to go somewhere else. 3. **Sleep-Related Behaviors**: Actions like sleepwalking or talking in one's sleep are performed without conscious awareness or control. 4. **Involuntary Motor Tics**: Sudden, brief, involuntary movements or sounds, such as those seen in Tourette Syndrome or other tic disorders. 5. **Slips and Accidents**: Actions like tripping, slipping, or accidentally dropping an object are unintended and often result from a lack of coordination or attention. 6. **Freudian Slips**: Unintended slips of the tongue, which, according to Freud, might reveal an unconscious thought or feeling, but considered more broadly can simply be errors in speech or memory. 7. **Subconscious Imitations**: Unintentionally mimicking someone else's accent, speech patterns, or gestures after exposure. 8. **Automatic Responses**: Responding to a question with a standard reply without actively thinking about the answer, such as automatically saying \\"fine\\" when asked how you are. 9. **Actions Under Influence**: Behaviors influenced by alcohol, drugs, or medications that might not reflect one's intentional decision-making process. 10. **Emotional Reactions**: Laughing, crying, or blushing in response to stimuli without the explicit intention to express those emotions. 11. **Startle Reactions**: Jumping in response to a sudden, unexpected sound or movement. 12. **Side Effects of Medical Conditions**: Movements or behaviors that are side effects of neurological conditions like epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, or the impact of a stroke. 13. **Distraction-Induced Actions**: Actions taken while distracted, such as unconsciously playing with your hair while reading or eating popcorn while watching a movie. All these examples demonstrate actions and behaviors that occur without a deliberate intention to act in such a way. Understanding the distinction between intentional and unintentional acts is crucial in various disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and law, as it touches upon the nature of agency, control, and responsibility."},{"instruction":"Quel est le mode d'action du gaz hilarant d'un point de vue biologique, neurophysiologique et chimique","output":"Le gaz hilarant, également connu sous le nom de protoxyde d'azote (N₂O), est un gaz incolore avec des effets euphorisants et analgésiques. Depuis des siècles, il est utilisé dans divers contextes, notamment en médecine pour ses propriétés anesthésiques et en tant que drogue récréative. L'action biologique, neurophysiologique et chimique du protoxyde d'azote est complexe et n'est pas encore entièrement comprise dans tous ses détails. Cependant, plusieurs mécanismes d'action ont été proposés pour expliquer ses effets sur le corps humain. # Mécanismes d'action : 1. **Modulation des Récepteurs NMDA** : L'un des principaux modes d'action du gaz hilarant est lié à son interaction avec les récepteurs N-méthyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) dans le cerveau. Le N₂O inhibe l'activité de ces récepteurs, qui jouent un rôle crucial dans la transmission des signaux de douleur, l'apprentissage et la mémoire. L'inhibition des récepteurs NMDA est l'une des raisons pour lesquelles le protoxyde d'azote possède des propriétés analgésiques et peut altérer la perception et la cognition. 2. **Libération de Catécholamines** : Il a été suggéré que le protoxyde d'azote pourrait stimuler la libération de catécholamines (comme l'adrénaline et la noradrénaline), ce qui contribuerait à ses effets analgésiques et à l'euphorie. 3. **Interaction avec le Système Opioidergique** : Certaines recherches indiquent que le N₂O pourrait interagir avec le système opioidergique du cerveau, renforçant les effets analgésiques par la libération d'endorphines, peptides agissant comme des analgésiques naturels. 4. **Effets sur les Autres Récepteurs Neurotransmetteurs** : Le gaz hilarant agit également sur d'autres systèmes de neurotransmetteurs, y compris les voies du GABA, de la sérotonine et du glutamate. Ce faisant, il peut influencer une myriade de fonctions cérébrales, allant de l'humeur à la perception de la douleur. # Effets Neurophysiologiques et Chimiques : - **Dépression du Système Nerveux Central** : Par ses multiples interactions avec les récepteurs et les neurotransmetteurs du cerveau, le N₂O produit une dépression légère du système nerveux central, entraînant une sensation de détente, d'euphorie et parfois de somnolence. - **Réduction de la Perception de la Douleur** : L'effet analgésique du gaz hilarant est particulièrement utile en médecine dentaire et lors d'accouchements, aidant à gérer la douleur sans provoquer une perte complète de conscience. - **Altération des Fonctions Cognitives et Sensorielles** : Les utilisateurs peuvent expérimenter des changements dans leur perception auditive et visuelle, ainsi que des perturbations dans le jugement et la coordination motrice. Bien que le protoxyde d'azote soit largement utilisé et considéré comme relativement sûr lorsqu'il est administré de manière contrôlée dans un cadre médical, une utilisation inappropriée ou récréative peut entraîner des risques pour la santé, notamment l'hypoxie (manque d'oxygène), la neurotoxicité, et la perturbation de la synthèse de la vitamine B12 pouvant mener à des complications neurologiques. Il est donc crucial de comprendre les mécanismes d'action du N₂O ainsi que ses potentiels effets secondaires."},{"instruction":"Voici une reformulation du modèle en tenant compte de vos suggestions : Considérons un ensemble de facteurs F_1, ..., F_n qui sont positivement corrélés à l'occurrence du rire. Chaque facteur F_i peut être soit binaire (0 ou 1), soit pondérable entre 0 et 1. Les facteurs binaires représentent des conditions qui sont soit présentes, soit absentes, tandis que les facteurs pondérables représentent des conditions qui peuvent être présentes à des degrés divers. Parmi ces facteurs, certains sont purement neurophysiologiques (N_1, ..., N_k) et ne peuvent être modifiés que par des interventions endogènes (ex : inhalation de gaz hilarant). D'autres facteurs (E_1, ..., E_m) peuvent être influencés par des interventions exogènes (ex : contexte social, stimuli humoristiques). Pour chaque facteur F_i, on peut déterminer une valeur optimale O_i qui maximise la probabilité du rire. Par exemple, pour un facteur binaire, O_i serait 1 si la présence de ce facteur favorise le rire, et 0 sinon. Pour un facteur pondérable, O_i serait la valeur entre 0 et 1 qui est la plus fortement associée au rire. Définissons maintenant une fonction P qui agrège les valeurs des facteurs F_1, ..., F_n en une probabilité globale de la propension du sujet à rire, étant donné l'état de ces facteurs : P(F_1, ..., F_n) = agrégation(F_1, ..., F_n) où \\"agrégation\\" est une fonction qui combine les valeurs des facteurs de manière à obtenir une probabilité globale.

L'occurrence du rire (R = 1) ou son absence (R = 0) peut alors être déterminée par la comparaison entre P(F_1, ..., F_n) et I : R = 1 si P(F_1, ..., F_n) > I R = 0 si P(F_1, ..., F_n) ≤ I Autrement dit, le sujet rira si la propension au rire, telle que déterminée par l'état des facteurs F_1, ..., F_n, est supérieure à la force de l'inhibition volontaire I. Un point clé de ce modèle est que plus P(F_1, ..., F_n) est proche de P(O_1, ..., O_n), c'est-à-dire plus on est proche des conditions optimales du rire, plus la valeur de I nécessaire pour empêcher le rire est élevée. En d'autres termes, plus les facteurs neurophysiologiques et contextuels sont favorables au rire, plus l'inhibition volontaire doit être forte pour contrecarrer cette propension. Ce modèle offre une vision quantitative de l'opposition entre la propension physiologique au rire et le contrôle volontaire, tout en prenant en compte la diversité des facteurs qui influencent le rire et la possibilité d'interventions endogènes et exogènes sur ces facteurs.

De plus, la conceptualisation de l'inhibition volontaire (I) comme une variable médiatrice qui peut empêcher ou réduire la manifestation du rire ajoute une autre dimension intéressante à la dynamique du processus. Pour peaufiner davantage votre modèle, voici quelques suggestions et points de réflexion : 1. **Fonction d'agrégation** : La fonction d'agrégation que vous envisagez, telle qu'une moyenne pondérée, est un bon point de départ. Cependant, il pourrait être intéressant d'explorer des fonctions non linéaires ou des modèles basés sur la théorie des réseaux neuronaux pour capturer plus fidèlement la complexité des interactions entre facteurs. Les réseaux neuronaux, par exemple, peuvent modéliser des interactions non linéaires et des effets de seuil qui sont probablement présents dans le mécanisme du rire. 2. **Interaction entre facteurs** : Votre modèle traite actuellement les facteurs F_i de manière plutôt indépendante, avec une agrégation finale pour estimer la probabilité de rire. Envisager explicitement les interactions entre les facteurs pourrait enrichir le modèle. Par exemple, certains facteurs contextuels (E) pourraient amplifier ou atténuer l'effet de facteurs neurophysiologiques (N). 3. **Rôle de l'apprentissage et de l'expérience** : Les individus apprennent au fil du temps ce qui est susceptible de les faire rire et adaptent peut-être leur niveau d'inhibition (I) en fonction de ces apprentissages. Intégrer un mécanisme d'apprentissage ou de mémorisation dans le modèle pourrait permettre de rendre compte des changements dans la propension au rire en fonction de l'expérience. 4. **Variabilité interindividuelle** : Bien que vous mentionniez la variabilité interindividuelle et intra-individuelle, le modèle pourrait être enrichi en incluant explicitement des paramètres ou des variables qui représentent des traits de personnalité ou des états psychologiques (par exemple, l’anxiété ou la dépression) susceptibles d'influencer les poids des facteurs ou la force de l'inhibition (I). 5. **Validation empirique** : Pour tester la validité de votre modèle, envisagez des méthodes empiriques permettant de mesurer ou d'estimer les paramètres du modèle, tels que les valeurs optimales (O_i), les poids dans la fonction d'agrégation, et le niveau d'inhibition volontaire (I).

It considers how similar elements from the two distributions are oriented with respect to each other. 2. **Interpretation**: - A lower Wasserstein distance implies a closer match or similarity between the two distributions, as less mass needs to be moved to transform one distribution into the other. - The Wasserstein distance takes into account the geometry of the underlying space, providing a more meaningful measure of dissimilarity compared to other distance metrics. 3. **Applications**: - In optimization and logistics, the Wasserstein distance is used to model transportation costs and optimal transport plans between two probability distributions. - In machine learning and GANs, the Wasserstein distance is employed to compare the generated distribution of data samples (e.g., images) with the real data distribution.

The generator loss in cGAN can be formulated as: [ text{Generator Loss} = -log(D(mathbf{x}, mathbf{y})) ] Where: - ( D(mathbf{x}, mathbf{y}) ) represents the output of the discriminator when the generated sample ( mathbf{x} ) and the conditioning information ( mathbf{y} ) are input together. - The generator aims to minimize this loss by generating samples that not only deceive the discriminator into classifying them as real samples, but also align with the conditioning information provided during training. 2. **Discriminator Loss in cGAN**: In a cGAN, the discriminator's goal is to differentiate between real data samples and generated samples, taking into account the additional conditional information. The discriminator loss in a cGAN involves evaluating the discriminator's ability to correctly classify the real and generated samples along with the conditioning variables. The discriminator loss in cGAN can be formulated as: [ text{Discriminator Loss} = -log(D(mathbf{x}, mathbf{y})) - log(1 - D(G(mathbf{z}, mathbf{y}))) ] Where: - ( mathbf{x} ) represents real data samples, ( mathbf{y} ) denotes the conditioning information, and ( mathbf{z} ) is the noise input to the generator. - ( G(mathbf{z}, mathbf{y}) ) is the generated sample by the generator with conditioning information. - The discriminator is trained to maximize this loss by correctly classifying real samples as real and generated samples as fake, considering both the samples and conditioning variables. By optimizing the generator and discriminator using the combined adversarial and conditional losses, cGANs can generate data samples that are not only realistic but also tailored to specific conditions or attributes, allowing for controlled and targeted generation."},{"instruction":"Explain controllable generation in cGAN during inference and challenges in controllable generation in cGAN","output":"Controllable generation in Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) refers to the ability to manipulate and control specific attributes, features, or conditions of the generated data samples during the inference stage. This control allows users to steer the generation process to produce outputs with desired characteristics, such as modifying the appearance of images, generating text with specific attributes, or creating content with predefined styles. Here's an explanation of controllable generation in cGAN during inference and the challenges associated with it: 1. **Controllable Generation in cGAN during Inference**: - During inference, controllable generation in cGANs enables users to interactively adjust or specify certain attributes, conditions, or constraints to influence the output of the generator. - By providing conditioning information or input variables, users can control the characteristics of the generated samples, such as changing the style, pose, color, or other attributes of the generated content. - In conditional image generation, for example, users can input specific class labels or attribute vectors to guide the generator in producing images of a certain class, style, or with particular features. - Controllable generation in cGANs allows for on-the-fly manipulation and customization of the generated data outputs based on user-defined constraints or preferences. 2. **Challenges in Controllable Generation in cGAN**: - **Disentangled Representation Learning**: Learning truly disentangled representations of attributes in the latent space is a challenging task in cGANs. Ensuring that different attributes are represented independently in the latent space may require sophisticated techniques and architectures to disentangle features effectively. - **Mode Collapse and Sample Diversity**: Controllable generation in cGANs may face challenges related to mode collapse, where the generator produces limited varieties of outputs. Ensuring diverse and realistic samples across different attribute settings without sacrificing quality remains a significant challenge. - **Interpolation and Style Mixing**: Enabling smooth interpolation or blending between attribute representations and allowing style mixing are complex tasks that require careful latent space manipulation and architectural considerations in cGANs to achieve seamless transitions between desired attributes. - **Limited Conditioning**: The effectiveness of controllable generation in cGANs heavily relies on the quality and informativeness of the conditioning information provided during inference. Incomplete or inadequate conditioning may lead to suboptimal or unrealistic outputs. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing research efforts in developing advanced techniques, architectures, and optimization strategies tailored to controllable generation tasks in cGANs. By improving disentanglement, diversity, interpolation capabilities, and conditioning robustness, cGANs can offer enhanced control and versatility in generating data samples with specified attributes and characteristics."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\"","output":"\\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\""},{"instruction":"Давай представим, что в мире в 2007 седьмом году открылись порталы с монстрами, а люди начали пробуждаться как охотники.

Даты: - 2007, в день появления первого портала - 2007, даты после первого портала - 2008 - 2009 - 2010 - 2011 - 2012 - 2013 - 2014 (начало года) - 2014, пробудился пару дней назад","output":"# Охотник, пробудившийся в 2007 году, в день появления первого портала Этот охотник – один из первых, кто получил свои силы, и, следовательно, имеет огромный опыт борьбы с монстрами. К середине 2014 года он стал одним из ведущих охотников, возможно, лидером одной из команд или даже гильдии. У него богатый арсенал сил и оружия, специально предназначенного для борьбы с монстрами. Возможно, он принимал участие в крупных операциях по очищению от монстров и разведке неизведанных территорий. Он высоко уважаем среди новичков и опытных охотников. # Охотник, пробудившийся после первого портала в 2007 году Этот охотник быстро осознал изменения, произошедшие в мире, и начал активно тренироваться и сражаться. К 2014 году он набрал достаточно опыта, чтобы считаться опытным бойцом, хоть и уступает первопробудившимся в знаниях и навыках. Возможно, он специализируется на определённом типе монстров или предпочитает определённый стиль боя. Также может занимать должность помощника лидера в команде или малой группе. # Охотник, пробудившийся в 2008 году Этот охотник уже имеет шесть лет опыта к середине 2014 года. Он достаточно опытен и обладает хорошо развитыми способностями. Скорее всего, он активно участвовал в зачистках и экспедициях и сейчас является надёжным членом своей команды. Может быть, он также начал обучать младших охотников. # Охотник, пробудившийся в 2009 году К середине 2014 года этот охотник достигает среднего уровня силы и опыта. Он уверенно сражается с монстрами и участвует в операциях, но ещё ищет своё место в иерархии охотников. Возможно, он начинает специализироваться на каком-то одном аспекте охоты. # Охотник, пробудившийся в 2010 году К 2014 году этот охотник ещё ощущает себя относительно новичком, но у него уже достаточно опыта, чтобы самостоятельно выполнять миссии и быть полезным в команде. Он продолжает учиться и совершенствоваться, искать свой путь среди более опытных охотников. # Охотник, пробудившийся в 2011 году По 2014 году этот охотник всё ещё развивает свои навыки и изучает мир монстров. Он вовлечен в активные действия против монстров, но ему может не хватать опыта для самых опасных заданий. Однако, его энтузиазм и стремление к обучению делают его ценным активом. # Охотник, пробудившийся в 2012 году За два года до середины 2014 года охотник набрался необходимого первоначального опыта и начал показывать потенциал. Он активно участвует в операциях и учится у более опытных охотников, чувствуя себя частью команды. # Охотник, пробудившийся в 2013 году Этот охотник ещё очень свеж в мире охоты, однако к середине 2014 года он уже прошёл базовое обучение и начал участвовать в боевых вылазках. Его опыт ограничен, но желание учиться и стать сильнее позволяет ему быстро прогрессировать. # Охотник, пробудившийся в начале 2014 года По середине 2014 года этот охотник всё ещё находится в начальной стадии своей охотничьей карьеры. Он активно обучается и адаптируется к новой реальности, пытаясь как можно скорее научиться защищать себя и других от монстров. Его опыт ограничен, но энтузиазм и желание защищать мир делают его перспективным новичком. # Охотник, пробудившийся пару дней назад в 2014 году Этот охотник едва начал осознавать свои новые способности и столкнулся с опасностями, которые таит мир монстров. Его знания и опыт крайне ограничены, и он в первую очередь нуждается в защите и обучении от более опытных охотников.

This period marked a significant move of the party towards the center of the political spectrum, characterized by the adoption of more centrist policies compared to the party's traditional socialist stance. The emergence of New Labour was formally announced in 1994, following the death of John Smith, the previous Labour Party leader, and Tony Blair's subsequent election as leader. One of the most symbolic changes under Blair's leadership was the amendment of Clause IV of the party's constitution, which originally committed the party to the nationalization of industry. This amendment signified a break from the party's traditional socialist policies and an acceptance of a market economy, albeit with regulatory oversight and social welfare provisions. Key characteristics of New Labour included: 1. **Third Way Politics**: New Labour was associated with the \\"Third Way,\\" a political position that purported to transcend the traditional left-right political spectrum, combining market-based approaches with traditional social democratic values. 2. **Economic Policy**: Under New Labour, the UK saw the embrace of neoliberal economic policies, including the deregulation of the financial sector and encouragement of private sector involvement in public services, while also maintaining a commitment to social justice and investment in public services. 3. **Social Policy**: The administration implemented significant investments in health and education, introduced the minimum wage, and increased public spending on welfare, albeit with an emphasis on welfare-to-work programs and the introduction of measures aimed at reducing dependency on state benefits. 4. **Foreign Policy**: Internationally, New Labour's tenure is often remembered for its interventionist foreign policy, most notably the controversial decision to participate in the Iraq War in 2003 alongside the United States, based on the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was subsequently discredited. 5. **Constitutional Reform**: The period saw substantial constitutional reforms, including the establishment of devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, reforms to the House of Lords, and the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law through the Human Rights Act 1998. The legacy of New Labour is mixed. The party enjoyed significant electoral success, winning three successive general elections (1997, 2001, and 2005), and many credit it with modernizing Britain's economy and social services. However, the policy directions pursued under New Labour, particularly in the realm of privatization, deregulation, and foreign military intervention, have also been subjects of considerable criticism, both within the Labour Party and from the broader public. The aftermath of the Iraq War and the global financial crisis of 2008 significantly tainted the reputation of New Labour, leading to debates within the Labour Party about its future direction and ideological stance."},{"instruction":"\\"Video: Richard Curtis - \\"I Rewrote 'Four Weddings' 19 Times!\\" | BAFTA Guru – YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3u9mR9qy_k&t=107s&ab_channel=BAFTAGuru Transcript: “GETTING INTO THE FILM INDUSTRY Question: How did you get started in the industry? Richard Curtis: Actually in terms of getting into the industry at all my dad who was quite a serious man said that I had one year of fooling around and then I had to enter the marketing department at Unilever and in my first year I and I think 546 pounds or something like that but I then luckily got my first TV commission and that got me through the door as far as he was concerned and I got an agent actually by someone seeing me performing up in Edinburgh I got very lucky just that some lovely keen American woman who was living in London liked my jokes I got started in television by hanging onto the coattails of Rowan Atkinson who when he was 20 was a genius and it was obvious that he was going to be a TV star and I was his closest friend and wrote things for him and so we drifted in as comedians tend to by doing stage stuff of our own up in Edinburgh and then did a radio show which the traditional radio for which was pretty poor and then started writing sketches for a sketch show which became not the local news and then I wrote for that for for series so it was a very traditional route and then from a sketch show I went into a sitcom and then from a sitcom I went into films. INFLUENCES Question: What film or programme has influenced you the most? Richard Curtis: John Cleese in many ways weirdly is the most influential person in my career because when I was young Monty Python was all there was 50% of your conversation with friends was just quoting Monty Python sketches so as it were like a generation before would have had the goons and the generation after might have had you know the young months as it were for me it was Monty Python and that's what made me interested in humor and started me writing sketches and then strangely the reason we wrote Blackadder was because Fawlty Towers have been so extraordinary that when I tried to write a modern sitcom it just looked so pathetic in comparison to 40 does that we only wrote historical one to avoid Fawlty Towers but the big influence on my films would probably have to be Woody Allen just because I so loved his films when I was young and he made films changed style and developed so quickly so you were always interested by what he was going to do next and he gave me the confidence to try different things and it was particularly for me had written silly sketches and a silly sitcom so Woody Allen did silly films when he started out at Scotland from sketches and ended up writing Annie Hall which was much closer to what I loved and the first film of his that I really loved so me then having the confidence to arrive for weddings may have been based on my passion for our confidence gained from Woody Allen. ADVICE Question: What advice would you give to someone starting out? Richard Curtis: My obvious piece of advice is to make sure you write or do what you really like there was a bit of a pressure on me when I started they would say you know British rails funny or you know dreadful sandwiches that you buy and M&S a funny write joke about that and I think it's really important to do what you think is interesting not what other people tell you might be interesting for me writing to sort of get work because you know that sort of work is popular as a disaster so I would say right from the heart and hope that somebody likes it as a sort of person in films I suppose my obvious thing would be to take every stage of the process incredibly seriously and I would say to get very involved so I had a script editor who's also my girlfriend who made me rewrite “Four Weddings” 19 times so I didn't just handed something that I thought might be okay it would be ruthlessly dealt with I then worked with a director who was obsessed by casting and the casting process took forever so actually once the movie had been cast it was almost made and then I think the final thing is that when you're editing you can fix most films I mean at least three of my films have been when finished the first really careful cut of being spectacular disasters really really bad failed movies and we managed just by determination and thinking you know things through in a different way to make them eventually work by hook or by crook so those are some of my pieces of advice.” Video: Script to Screen Red Carpet: LOVE ACTUALLY with Richard Curtis | Matt Ryan – YouTube https://youtu.be/NbYecUZHgy4 Transcript: “Interviewer: I have question for you when you when you take something like “Love Actually” which i love dearly uh when you have like a multiple protagonist how do you balance like you know the screen time could you you have to cut some things you probably really cared about you know because you have multiple characters to explore. Richard Curtis: Well “Love Actually” of all the films i've written is the one that turned out most wrong after we'd shot it so in fact i think it's very hard to judge what you've got to try and do is write good stuff for all of them and then actually remake the order and remake the dynamic of it once it's shot that's what we did on “Love Actually” the the script i wrote had all the same contents but in a completely different order to the finished film. Interviewer: So something like “Notting Hill” was a little easier for you basically two characters Richard Curtis: She walks into the room she kisses him she goes away but in this one it was like playing three-dimensional chess because after every scene you could put any scene from any of the other 10 stories. Interviewer: So and maybe on uh when you do an ensemble piece and it's more the director on set which we directed of course has a lot more to do trying to rework the script at the same time Richard Curtis: no no i think they've got a lot to do in the edit that would be what i have to say i think they've got a lot to do in the edit in some ways they're great fun to do because you only have to work for a week or two with each actor so they never see through you and realize what a bad director you are.” Video: Richard Curtis On Creating A Classic Rom-Com | Fast Company - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FENpwVe14MA Transcript: “INTRO: (00:00) - Seeing as how love is quite a big subject. And I often think about serial killers. There've only been about eight of them. And yet, there are about 100 movies about them. And yet, every day a million people are in love, so I can't believe that romantic films won't, sort of, stay at the core of cinema, in one way or another. (00:17) (cheerful music) NOTTING HILL - I do solemnly declare. - I do solemnly declare. - [Priest] That I know not of any lawful impediment. - That I know not of any lawful impediment. - Why I, Lydia. - [Groom] Why I, Bernard. - \\"Four Weddings,\\" which is thought of as a romantic comedy, I didn't see as that. I thought of it as a semi-autobiographical film about love and friendship. (00:51) I wasn't really aware that there was genre or a rule book. Then I became more aware, with \\"Notting Hill,\\" that that was what I was up to. Every Thursday, I used to go and have dinner with my friends, Piers and Paula. And I just thought, if I turned up at Piers and Paula's, if Madonna was my date, how would they react? Helen Fielding, who then wrote Bridget Jones, obsessive Madonna fan. (01:16) She would scream a lot and lose her cool. And neither Piers, nor Paula, would have any idea who she was. And that exact scene actually happens in \\"Notting Hill\\". - Last film you did, what'd you get paid? - 15 million dollars. - Right. - The curious thing about \\"Notting Hll\\" is that, even though Hugh had been the star, Hugh Grant had been the star of \\"Four Weddings,\\" I didn't want Hugh Grant. (01:40) I very specifically didn't want him. Because I thought it would so fantastic to have a complete unknown, which would really have made the movie be like a perfect mirror to the story itself. But we auditioned about 10 people, and I thought, oh god, I'll never find anyone who's any good. We might as well cast Hugh. (01:59) I'm quite embarrassed by \\"I'm just a girl, \\"standing in front of a boy,\\" because I clearly thought it was a good line. Because in the next scene, one of the characters says to Hugh Grant, \\"what did she say?\\" And he says, \\"oh, she's just--\\" - A girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. (02:17) - So I obviously thought, I better repeat it, like it was going back to the chorus, or the hook, in a song. BRIDGET JONES (upbeat music) Well, the terrifying thing about being involved in \\"Bridget Jones\\" was actually Helen Fielding, because she was my best friend; it was her book. And I'd actually read \\"Bridget\\" seven times before it came out because she gave it to me with every extra 50 pages. (02:40) We cast Renee, and we made the film. And then we had trouble editing the film. And Helen was full of, \\"that's not quite like Bridget. \\"This isn't quite right.\\" And then you realize the big revelation to making movies, that there comes a point where you've gotta stop thinking about your source, as it were, stop thinking about the script you've written, or the book that the script you've written is based on, and say our Bridget is Renee. (03:04) And the moment that we accepted that, and all the wonderful qualities that she brought to the film, some of which might not be the exact representation of the book, but was a fully-fledged, fabulous human. You then edit the movie towards what you've got, and that means that, in some ways, it's better for that, because you've got an embodiment of a special, cinematic Bridget, rather than an attempt to just reproduce what was in the book. LOVE ACTUALLY (03:33) ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ Where no one's ever gone ♪ - Yeah. - I mean, \\"Love Actually\\" was partly inspired by the fact that I had done these three romantic comedies before, and I, in fact, didn't want to write another one. The plot in that movie, of Hugh and Martine, was a whole film I thought of doing. (03:54) And the plot of Colin Firth's story was a whole film that I had intended to write. So, what I was trying to do was, it was push the romantic comedy genre as far as it could possibly go. And just take the three best scenes of 10 different films and shove them all together. The big inspiration was \\"Nashville,\\" a Robert Altman movie, and \\"Short Cuts,\\" a Robert Altman Movie. (04:17) Which are very standards to be aiming for, because these are two of my favorite movies of all time. These movies with a lot of plots are tough to do. \\"Love Actually,\\" in its first edit, was the third worst film of all time. I mean it was really the worst example I can remember of something which had worked brilliantly in a read-though, not working well. (04:39) So it was like playing three-dimensional chess, because any scene could go after any other scene, from any other point, in any of the other stories. So, that was very, very hard work. I was a new director. And if it had been a movie in which there was a cast who would've had 10 weeks to get used to me, maybe they would've got used to me. (04:58) But we only had one week per plot. So I felt I was auditioning for the actors every single week. What I realized was quite how unfair I'd been on the directors that I'd worked with beforehand. Because there's this terrible contradiction in movies, that a writer's got two years to fix absolutely everything, and then the director's got one day in which to shoot it. (05:21) And suddenly I understood why sometimes the directors had rushed through things I thought was important or been happy when they got it. Because I was always saying, oh, let's have another go, let's try it another way. - I'd only give one piece of advice to anyone marrying: try and marry someone kind. (05:39) - The original inspiration for \\"About Time\\" is the scene that most people talk to me about, which is the scene on a beach, when the leading character travels back to just spend an afternoon with his dad who's just died. And, almost for the first time in the movies, the idea I had was based on a visual thing. (05:58) And I remember starting now, at last, as a writer, to start to sort of think, well, what really matters about that scene isn't so much all the words that they're saying, but where they're standing, that it's a lonely street. So I think, at last, by \\"About Time\\" I was gaining a bit of visual confidence. (06:17) And I hired the cameraman from my favorite visual movie, called \\"Like Crazy,\\" that Drake Doremus made. And I started to think, if you want to fall in love with a character, then the words can do two-thirds of it, but if you can shoot it well, then maybe that's gonna be the thing which, as it were, goes into your heart without knowing how it got there. (06:42) ♪ Oh, I believe in yesterday ♪ - Oh my, when did you write that? - I didn't write it; Paul McCartney wrote it, the Beatles. - Who? - I mean I've been obsessed by the Beatles for the whole of my life. That's the real inspiration. But then, of course, the inspiration that the Beatles gave me was that a lot of their stuff was about love. (07:08) We got permission, fabulously, to use, I think, 18 Beatles' songs, and they didn't say which. It was a wonderful thing to write, because I'd be typing along and think, okay, he's having a crisis. And then I'd go through the Beatles catalog and think, well, \\"Help\\" is clearly, if he's gonna sing any song now, it should be \\"Help. (07:26) \\" It was a wonderful thing 'cause they've got such a range that, as I told this tale, there was always a perfect Beatles' song to go in. I think that the curve of my career is to realize that love doesn't end at the first kiss or as you walk down the aisle in wedding. That's where some of my movies did end. (07:46) When I went to \\"Love Actually,\\" which had brothers and sisters, and fathers and sons, and married couples. And then, \\"About Time\\" was a romantic comedy for half of it and then a film about death and family and marriage. And that \\"Yesterday\\" is a movie about love of music and love. (08:03) I think I've learned that love's a big subject that the traditional shape of a rom-com doesn't quite cover.” Video: \\"When I write about love I'm accused of being untrue\\" | Richard Curtis | Google Zeitgeist - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjOACVD4cJw Transcript: (00:02) Interviewer: good morning everyone I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and I lead google.org Google's philanthropy and I'm so pleased to be here with Richard today so Richard I was gonna wear those shoes for you yeah I'm sorry I didn't well I'm not sure where to go with that but so Richard as we saw from the introduction you are known in your creative world in for capturing in one scenes sort of the whole zeitgeist er essence of a film as we saw with I'm just a girl so translating that over to your work with the global goals how would you what's that scene how would you translate for this audience the 15 year Odyssey that's been the global goals Richard Curtis: I think we would have to by the way it's very good to be here and I do get sort of nervous thinking about the potential that you all have changing the world in many ways so it's a great pleasure - real pleasure to be here I think when you're thinking about these goals which are a plan from 2015 to 2030 the the sequel as it were to the MDGs I think you're talking you talking in (01:20) terms of sort of massive endless Netflix series so as it were think of the sustainable development goals as the game of Thrones there are some there are some there are some baddies who will you know get elected and then over the time people who you don't think are gonna be very powerful and strong will grow to huge strength and take on power and new alliances will be forged I mean it's a decade of delivery that we're now looking for it's 11 years so I think it's not one line it's like every (02:00) person in a room like this thinking well where does my particular power lie outside just the work that I do in order to try and sort of change up the world then a very interesting fact the other day that just about the importance of a sort of interrelationship between business and and the goals that someone said to me that if temperature were to rise by 4% the insurance industry would cease existing there could be no more insurance because they're all insurance companies would go bankrupt with the extent that they had to pay back things (02:38) so the interrelationship between climate and business and sustainability is so crucial Interviewer: well the idea behind the goals are so brilliant right it's it's hey let's do this together let's set our ambition our strategy our objectives as a global human family and they're ambitious around poverty and climate change and health but they can also feel overwhelming and challenging and a bit hopeless sometimes so how do you stay optimistic as you as you're thinking about rallying the world rallying all of (03:14) us to take on these these goals Richard Curtis: well I don't I mean I don't know how much all of you know about the goals they were negotiated in after a loan negotiation by a hundred and ninety three countries there are seventeen of them I think they break down into 169 targets and the idea behind them was to be comprehensive you know I think that one of the things that is sometimes hard for all of us is you say well I'm gonna really commit to this issue you know I'm gonna support Amnesty International or I'm going to worry (03:47) about plastic in the oceans and everything you think well while I'm committing to that one should I be committing to other things and to you know is is am I in conflict with people who believe those when we did the Make Poverty History campaign which led to Live Aid there was an extraordinary moment when climate stormed out of the room I remember he was wearing shorts and carrying a bicycle and we just decided it was too complicated a mixture of things to deal with and the point about these goals is they really do say (04:20) that everything is interdependent and that actually extreme poverty is a massive Vishu in terms of climate and that injustice will also lead to extreme poverty so that all of those things are tied together so I think the idea really is that it does give it's really useful to have a big plan I mean all of you run companies you have a very very complex agenda towards absolutely everything that you do you're used to complexity and the idea that you could solve the problems of the world by sort of three simple nice phrases would be ridiculous (04:54) so the goals do actually give you an opportunity to put everything next to everything so that you actually can align the policies of a government or the policies of a business next to it and see really how you're doing and I think that makes us feel very safe and very you know United Interviewer: but do you ever do you ever feel that the challenges are just you know too far away and that we're not making the kind of progress that we should as a globe or do you see hope and some of the indicators that we're seeing at this point where we're (05:28) going Richard Curtis: yeah I'm naturally an optimist and I mean there are clearly a lot of very dark things in the world but that that speech you just saw President Obama say you know he said if there was one moment in the history of the world in which you would be best to be born that moment is now I saw an astonishing graphic of mortality in African countries between 1950 and 1920 20 the other day which was you know all in lines and they just went to just getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and you do see (06:12) extraordinary I mean you just have to look out for things to be optimistic about when I write my romantic films I'm sometimes accused of being sentimental and and untrue and I don't understand that at all so if someone someone makes a film about a serial killer they've only ever been four of them and it's called a you know searingly realistic portrait the problems facing modern society and I write a film about love and probably at least 60% of you are in love with someone at the moment and there are 7 (06:50) million people in love in London then for some reason it's called sentimental and unrealistic and untrue and I think that it just depends which way you know which way you look and my experience when I started comic relief you know I was depending on comedians many of the least nice people in the world and certainly were those selfish and I was saying to them will you do what you can for charity and we've raised whatever it is 1. (07:20) 3 billion and and and the what's happening in terms of diseases is extraordinary and I remember I wrote a film about malaria and I had a very angry phone call from the director of it saying and it took a while to make an effort and he said you haven't even checked your facts he said you know there's only 250,000 children died of malaria this year not as I had in the script five hundred thousand and it was because in the four years since I'd originally written it the number had gone down so dramatically I said to you by the way this is good news I said no (07:53) if I'm about 5 million accurate writing that's good news but I do look around me and I think that I mean you must all feel that there is power and technology to do bad but astonishing power and technology to do good there's you know terrible worries about climate change but an astonishingly empowered younger generation that has suddenly started to get the message it tremendous questions of you know inequality in terms but you know particularly of men and women but you know we are also the me two (08:28) generation things ignite things change so I think you have to sign off and say you know cynics knows days never made any money yet not a single dollar and I think that if you're optimistic and if you view the things that are working and I think then the goals provides a plan for that there is no reason not to think that you can't change the world magnificently Interviewer: well you have been obviously so successful in getting your films out globally people know and love them everywhere as you think about this part of your life where you're trying to get (09:04) the world the globe to know about and think about and care about the global close how do you think you know what's the best way to do that how do you inspire people to to be involved and reach people Richard Curtis: well I mean I've taken rather a sort of when you make films the people you hate most of the people you make the posters from the trailers particularly the posters and ghastly retouched photograph poster makers probably probably not even with your stars actual bottom probably somebody else's bottom of the photograph and then (09:43) and then you know a line you didn't write so this whole thing that you've made that you've put so much effort into well I'm the poster guy for the goals I'm trying to make them we came up with this graphic we're trying to make them simple we argued about you know trying to keep the names of them short and I'm just trying to get the word out there because what you want is that when people you know go to their employees and say let's do something about the goals you want them to have just glimpse (10:12) them come across them in some way when you make a film there's a big tradition now of you know trying to sort of get some shot of the making of the film into the newspapers so that when people see the poster it's the second time they've heard about it and when they see the trailer it's the third time and then they may be tempted to go to see the film so what we're trying to do is to spread the word in as many ways as we can through pop music through concerts through graphics through this thing we (10:41) could do called the world's largest lessons through partnership through businesses you know to try and get the idea of them out there so that when people actually you know in companies and in politics focus on them they believe that it's something that the public will endorse and possibly feel passionate about Interviewer: And one of the things that we've chatted about backstage is just you know the role of Technology so how are you seeing technology advancing and being able to help us to get get to these goals Richard Curtis: I think you probably I mean I (11:17) think that you know there's an enormous amount that technology can do I mean well I'm really you know you do look for technology just have some of the you know actual answers but certainly we have never been in a world where there's more possibility for a message going virally and hugely and then once you get that message as it were being able to press on the button of each of these and see what are the things that you can do because by the way I'm a huge believer that we can do things individually in (11:51) our lives and I think that is a very good way of as it were starting with meatless Monday and giving Tuesday and change your pension scheme Wednesday and what but no but tell me Jacqueline what's your sense about what Google could do and what technology can do for the goals because that's the world in which as it were my kids are living and most people are referring to that for their information in their… Interviewer: well you know I think like you were saying we've we've seen great progress and in some ways you know we've we've have (12:26) child poverty and great advances in health but the rest of the gap is really gonna take new solutions and I think that's where technology especially AI can be really helpful we just you know at Google we've been trying to think about how can we inspire the world especially young technologists people who are researching nonprofits social businesses to align their work with with the global goals and so one of the things that we did is we we actually launched a competition this last year an open call where we put out 25 million (13:00) dollars in a pool of funding and then expertise from our AI professionals and then said okay right tell us your idea align it with the global goals tell us how you're going to use AI and the winners which we just you know they're doing incredible work for example a team in Africa in Uganda is using really low-cost sensors that they're putting on the backs of motorcycle taxis and they're using that to map and track air pollution which is one of the silent killers and then using that to measure what's being effective (13:35) in fighting that air pollution a team in India for example is using AI to help diagnose what the the pests and the diseases are that subsistence farmers are facing and then put the right pesticide against that and that's gonna help not only the farmers to earn more income but it's going to help reduce pesticide use which is gonna help the environment that's also frontiere was one of our winners here in europe and they're doing amazing work on antibiotic resistance so they have a smartphone app (14:04) that an untrained community worker in the field could use in a low resource environment to read whether the bacteria that someone has is resistant that way they're gonna do better health for the individual but they're also going to help the globe with this kind of resistance so there's all sorts of ideas many of them being led out at the global South on how we can apply AI so we we are just trying to think about how can we seed and support inspire those kinds of technologies so we also published (14:38) some research on our site you know a lot of people think AI is just sort of magic pixie dust and don'tyou know they know it's super powerful and has so many opportunities but don't know exactly how that could apply to their cause the issue that they care about so we published some research on our site a eyes for social impact people and you can see there how what are all the AI technologies that are showing the most promise for each of the global goals so I think this kind of building the ecosystem and and building up partners (15:09) who are working on this issue is is the way that we're gonna get technology to help us accelerate and close that gap Richard Curtis: well that’s so exciting to me I do think that this idea that we may have a generation now and I hope it applies to everyone here that thinks what is my work for if it's not for tried to make the world better I believe that they be making this up Paul Palmer told me that they they did two ads for the same job at Unilever and they tested one which stressed what Unilever does for the world and it's sort of sustainable commitments and (15:48) the other one that stretched the perks and the wages and many many more people applied through the ad on the sustainability and what they do and I think the idea that you can point a generation in the direction of thinking that it's a both/and you don't need to say well I'm either gonna make a lot of money and sell my patent for millions or I'm gonna change the world you can make yes okay yes it changes the world and then you can also make a lot of money Interviewer: Well I think you're right that many (16:18) people are motivated and many people just want to know what can I do so what would you say Richard to this audience if they want to get behind the global goals and help with the work that you're doing Richard Curtis: Well I mean I think there there is an enormous number of things that you can do one just in your own lives as I was saying think about the things which could make a difference I'm really finding that helpful I will now buy an electric car because I just think that it's important to know that in the (16:48) texture of your own lives you're actually doing the things that you're meant to do because that's what you know and then inspires you textually I think that it is really it would be brilliant to communicate something about the goals to your employees because I do think this is a sort of bounce thing the moment that you say to the people who work for you we're interested in these things have a look at them check them out yourselves and then as it were counter check with us I think that you will find an amazingly interesting (17:21) dialogue between you on all the areas of your behavior on your supply chains on you know gender equality on how you're affecting the environment I think that would be an amazingly helpful dialogue check your pension fund I think this is a really interesting idea you know someone said to me the other day they're like a third of the world's money's owned by governments a third of it's owned by rich people and a third of it's owned by us as it were you know we the way that we're gonna get (17:50) more investment in all the extraordinary projects like the ones that you're describing is by pension funds and investment investing increasingly and sustainability and an impact and in those things that will change the world and I would love the feeling that when you start to talk to your employees they will say well how's our pension fund invested where's our money going and that will increasingly go into all the best projects that they can do and that some of those projects will of course be things that you yourselves are working (18:20) on now so I think it's just to introduce it into the environment of the place that you work and then really check out whether or not the things that you do are in accordance with it it'll be helpful if it hadn't been for the ten commandments I would have been committing adultery and murdering people every day of the week but I was definitely so so I just think that it's a really useful purpose and plan and if you don't know them this is the time by the way because in 2005 when we did the (18:57) Make Poverty History campaign Live Aid I couldn't the meetings with people in business were so ghastly they really just thought this is a bunch of dangerous lefties who want to give away all their money and now business as you know as there were you talking about the things that you're backing they're actually ahead they're the ones you've seen that there's a whatever business from betterworld said twelve trillion advantage in actually working for an investing of the goals people can (19:26) see that that's the way that business should go so this is exactly the moment and if we can create a dialogue between business and government because governments much prefer talking to businesses than they do talking to charities they hate charity people they always just go on repeating themselves but if you can start a dialogue 2020 is the moment to kind of start the second phase of the and so anything that any of you can do and what to have a conversation without some project everyone you know would be (19:55) dreaming.” Video: Richard Curtis | Wiki4All – YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5gMq1nmjBE

Video: \\"Richard Curtis And His Very Limited Experience Of Life\\" - Notting Hill Screenwriter Criticised - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQnQC8vGdo Transcript: (00:00) well comedian Ria Lena joins us in the studio now Ria what do you reckon um do you reckon that that the Richard Curtis should be regretting these jokes that he's made in the past or do do you think he's learned his lesson do you know I think it is about whether he should or he shouldn't I think it's the fact that he is he is looking back and he is seeing in his old work through current eyes and I think there's a lot of people that agree with him are they looking at their work through current eyes um and (00:27) regretting what they did is there not just an acknowledgement that really the world's changed I mean this is a really inter my gosh that is the most leftwing question you've ever asked I've been watch for a while I'm being serious I know the world's changed but you can't apologize for everything listen to this this is interesting Tina we've got loads of respon to this section there was no one more loved or more relevant than Robin Williams nothing was off limits he was comedic genius that's why we loved (00:51) him he must be turning in his grave to see what's happening to Comedy now because they look back the whole time I think it's a very relevant point I and I'm trying to think of of something that Robin Williams said that that in any way was was offensive he did Cover a wide range of topics he wore a fat suit for Mrs dfire was that disrespectful no that was Mrs Doubtfire he was pretending to be a Scottish nanny I don't are we implying that all Scottish nannies are we didn't have enough time in this (01:17) segment to discuss Mrs delire what a film in itself uh but well the thing is is that if you want to be successful you're going to want to make most of the people laugh most of the time all right nobody's really said that anything's per se of limits but it might limit who's going to enjoy your artwork so Ava Santina and I were talking about this earlier in our pay-per review uh the fat jokes that he would make about Bridget Jones uh and about Marty McCutchen's character in Love Actually where car (01:46) another character called her the chubby one which she wasn't at all we were led to believe at me as a young girl that Bridget Jones was overweight or even fat and I look at her now with Modern Eyes and go she hardly had on it no but I think a film but part of that part of that was the fact that the actress are suffer El wagger it was a whole publicity compan how much weight she had to put on for it because they didn't even cast somebody you know that that would fit that would fit that role I think the Bridget Jones thing is (02:19) interesting I don't think that I mean yes there were a lot of fat jokes but what I think that was if you look at the original Helen Fielding books you know he didn't completely rewrite the books this was a character that was sad to be single she was obsessed about her weight uh I think the issue was is that it was it was screen written by a straight white male instead of perhaps a woman that could understand exactly what Helen Fielding was getting at with that character and then just portray that the (02:43) way that we women would understand give you Steven both of you understood this it's ridiculous apologizing for a joke written 30 years ago if it was funny then in my mind it's funny now I'm sick of being expected to accept that everything I've ever learned loved and laughed at is wrong it is not wrong simply a reflection of my life and time no I'm sorry about the reflection of your life and time Stephen but but he has a right to that opinion and I have a right to have an opinion on his opinion (03:07) um so when we move to the the the topic of minorities in Richard Curtis films there's no doubt you watch Notting Hill there's not a single black character in it you watch Love Actually there are very few black characters in it and that's you know London in the naughties OR Notting Hill in the '90s OR that's Richard Curtis and his very limited experience of life he said himself he went to her and then he went to Oxford and he never looked outside of that and that really is a question about who are (03:35) we allowing to write art and who are we turning to and that is you know brings us on to the diversity question I know a lot of people going why do we have so much diversity so that we can have a wider range of authentic artwork put in front of us comedy or otherwise in terms of what's on or off limits I mean we we cover all things in drama all things are covered what what why you're you're she got a lovely Tour on rear Awakening I get that to 2023

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4XaYbQlKxI Transcript: Richard Curtis: (00:04) hello my name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and this is apparently my career in four minutes [extract from a movie] my dear son this is going to sound strange but there's this secret but the men in this family can travel in time Richard Curtis: Wow I mean I think of anything the secret of my films has been alive still tried to keep writing sketches and many of them if you look at “Four Weddings” it's it's in a funny way sketch movie really this these two jokes of this wedding these two jokes of the next wedding and if you look at “Notting Hill” (00:36) those seen when in the junket where is being interviewed that's like a sketch about somebody misunderstanding a film or not have you seen a film so I think they're sketch writing definitely informed and was crucial to the movie career I think the magic of sitcom is probably still writing sketches in sitcom but the plot structure of sitcom which is so crucial I don't think resembles the structure of movies very much so I think this it's harder to see the line between the sitcoms and the films. “The Tall Guy” was a very happy (01:07) film Jeff gobble a very funny man and I particularly remember just roaring with laughter in a scene where Rowan was having a party when he'd sacked Jeff go from and he for the party just bought a mini bottle of champagne because at the end of my tour with Roman we did 72 dates and Roland had a party and he bought one bottle of champagne and one pizza not one pizza for all of us one pizza so I remember having a very good time on that the successful forwards and femur was a complete surprise to everybody I got a piece of paper from (01:43) MGM or whoever owned the movie and Paula Graham who at the movie and next to America of the expected earnings that said naught so it was a great shock to everybody the strange thing was I remember thinking of the plot of Notting Hill on a very wet afternoon sitting in a waiting room with corin redgrave who played and in the dalles husband and James fleet on for wedding so I actually thought of knotting here while we were making for wedding so it was lucky for me that that coming out of the success of for weddings I already knew what I (02:19) was going to do rather than thinking oh god what's next the thing about Love Actually is it was a curious film because everybody was only on it for a week or for two weeks so that nobody could see quite how bad I was about it because just when they were thinking of my god really doesn't know what he's doing they were off so it was it was it was it was nerve-racking but it was like I could start 12 times you know every time we've got a new bunch I would be a little bit better one of the reasons I (02:46) wrote that film was because there's a whole chunk of it was particularly the Robert Altman ones but I love Nashville as a movie called smooth and I love they loved pulp fiction so there were a lot of a multi-storey for shortcuts it was a genre i love the strange thing about the cast of the boat rocked as they were almost all in every single scene so that was when i started directing just with the camera on people's shoulders so that instead of saying a single of him a secured him a single of helena chemicals (03:16) go like that and find whoever was talking I think what I learned was the sort of negative lesson which is that I didn't like the formal structures moving making I did not like doing the wide shot followed by a two-shot follow back because he just get locked in at the beginning of the day into one performance and one geography so I think that I in this in the boat the rod and now in about time the cameras very fluid and flexible and just waiting to catch good things rather you know being part of a verse of a (03:43) formal shooting straight working with earl morris with students berber was absolute joy because steven is a sultan it really is storytelling genius so you would come up with a scene and he would say what that sounds great how about this and suddenly he would imagine 10 minutes of cinema that you can completely see if you said well I'm not sure that's right because this character wouldn't do that he'd imagined another whole 10 minutes of cinema I mean he was fantastic like someone who could go on (04:09) writing brilliant Tunes one after anot her well it's funny I have already written to time travel thing said there was time traveling in a black and a special that we do and I did a doctor who which was fun time traveling back to him Vincent van Gogh so I obviously am interested in it I didn't research time travel movies before I made my wanted to go back and watch I mean at the moment I'm not intending to direct something again the moment the message of about time is just do stress do less stressful (04:40) things and enjoy yourself and so the next time i work with bill will be working on a walking holiday rather than a movie.” Video: Richard Curtis and His Start with Four Weddings and a Funeral - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YutcjLfHVRI Transcript: (00:04) Interviewer: the film that we first got to know you with As Americans uh was “Four Weddings and a funeral” was it the first film you wrote Richard Curtis: second I wrote a film called “The Tall Guy” which was Emma Thompson's Emma Thompson and Jeff Goldblum MH that that smatter is an exact proportional representation um of how much money that movie made in comparison to Four Weddings Interviewer: okay so “four weddings and a funeral” um introdu gave us Hugh Grant in America that's sort of what all sold us on Hugh Grant um would you like to apologize to anyone right now Richard Curtis: (00:39) the answer the official answer is only to Divine Brown isn't it that's the that's the official answer to the question but no no I mean I didn't I tried not to allow Hugh to audition because I thought he was too handsome and I thought it would… Interviewer: he wasn't he wasn't you didn't think he was right for that part Richard Curtis: no no and in fact in the end were me the director and the producer and it came down to choosing between Hugh and Alan Rickman and I voted for Alan wow so I I I was so wrong um but would have been a very (01:14) different part yeah and the thing is I'd imagined it like breaking away in a film called Gregory's girl a very great English movie where uh I thought that that the the guy had to be not attractive particularly that had to be the explanation and then he found true love I didn't realize that by making him attractive it would make the film sort of three times as successful but Hugh was uh Hugh was the only but Hugh was the only person who could do the lines of all the 70 people we auditioned and he was extraordinarily on point he was (01:47) completely accurate he he did everything as exactly as I'd dreamt it I was I was very lucky.” Video: ‘Love Actually’ writer Richard Curtis on film’s legacy - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNspva0W3xY Transcript: Interviewer: (00:00) 20 years Richard Curtis: yeah I know I think the 20 years shows what a youthful optimist I probably was when I wrote it Interviewer: he says he still wants to write about our Humanity the surprising ways we are good to each other in a world that has so many movies filled with trauma and violence Richard Curtis: we get thousands of films about serial killers and there's only ever been about nine of them and yeah there'll be a million people falling in love feeling it's the most interesting moment of their lives Good Deeds inside families and Good Deeds inside (00:38) communities if you look at what happened during covid and the extraordinary sort of bravery and heroism I do think the way to think about life is that every day has the potential in all its Simplicity just to be just to be gorgeous.” Video: (1) Richard Curtis explains why he likes to set his films in Britain - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvBZnc_Wbg Transcript: (00:03) and I wrote the script and it was set in Boston and I went to see the people at MGM and they said this is amazing this is a fantastic script I said oh I'm so thrilled and they said except the two leading characters we don't like I said why and they said well it's sort of weak no one's gonna admire them we'll want to spend time with them I said no and they said the dialogues very English it doesn't really read American so you'll have to work on that and I said oh right and then they said which means that most (00:38) of the jokes don't work because people won't get their humor so I said that only needs the title that's the only thing we've got and they said we hate the time and I I flew home two weeks later and I swore I'll never do a film that's not set actually where I live. Video: Richard Curtis Fellowship tribute - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dWYjDuaRBg Transcript: (00:17) Person 1: Richard Curtis is the most splendid bandy utter knob head i've ever met Person 2: I congratulate BAFTA on giving Richard Curtis this award I can't think of anyone who deserves it more if if only because he makes the world a better place to be Person 3: and I think Richard Curtis is the greatest living Briton who happens to be from New Zealand Person 4: five words to describe Richard Curtis: funny, saintly, didn't write Angels. Person 5: all his work is as seamless thing that the Vicar of Dibley and Blackadder and Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a (01:00) funeral and comic relief and Love Actually and Make Poverty History are all part of who he is as a man and also as this incredibly talented writer and creative artist Person 6: well he's an enigma and rather like the character of Charles and Four Weddings when I was sent that script I never really understood the character because I thought no one in England is both funny and nice you know you can't or not the sort of a servic and nice but Richard does bring off that strange balancing act Person 7: no I think what he he's a master of is the apparent (01:35) inability of people to communicate certainly that was true of the character I played in Love Actually and I think it's very true of the character that Hugh Grant plays in Notting Hill Person 1: Richard’s funniest lines are undoubtedly Hugh Grant's lines which are always ““t…th…er…d…um..t..th…s..er…” Person 7: what's actually happening is that he's expressing something very very precisely in this apparent breakdown of language in this district Person 1: ““t…th…er…d…um..t..th…s..er…” I love those Person 2: the trademarks I suppose of a Richard Curtis script apart from the fact that it will always be intelligent clever and (02:28) purposeful is the fact that every minute and a half or so he'll deliver a world-class joke Person 5: the thing that marks our Richards work from it everyone else's is that it's a seamless part of who he is as a person and so that he didn't write Love Actually in order to make a crowd-pleasing film he wrote it because that's his philosophy of life Person 6: basically yeah I'm afraid to say he actually does quite like people you know he's the exact that's what makes it makes me laugh that I play these (03:00) characters which are basically him in his films because he is basically nice and full of benevolence and I am basically nasty and full of hatred Person 7: if one is right in thinking that Richards view of the world is very focused on love as a force in common with all humanity and love and all its difficulties in that it's the thing that somehow drives us all which is the thesis of Love Actually I think that does lie at the root of his work for Africa Person 8: I mean we all saw the Michael Burke films from that came out of (03:35) Ethiopia but instigated live oh but we should actually went on his own money to go and look and to see what he could do to help Person 9: he invented Red Nose Day I mean it's not given to many people who invent a day there's a man Jesus I'm not sure how many others I can name Person 3: the Red Nosed they affect is extraordinary the level of knowledge about issues around poverty is so high in Britain compared to the rest of Europe or America Person 8: is immensely generous with his time you know when it's a comic relief here he'll give up (04:05) six months of his life sometimes twelve eighteen months to make sure something will happen properly Person 4: couple of years before the Gleneagles g8 summit we were in desperate need of the best storyteller we could find to communicate these rather dull issues of debt and trade to the British public so he asked Richard to take a year off and make poverty history Person 7: looking back at the Live 8 (concerts) I think it's quite remarkable that his efforts together with Bob Geldof got people talking in a way that had never happened before never would (04:39) have been possible Person 2: “The Girl In the Café” was a great opportunity for me and it was something that I'm extremely proud to have been associated with it's a perfect amount of of entertainment and information and it made a big impact all over the world particularly in America where it was extremely well received Person 3: his work with Comic Relief and Make Poverty History is responsible for saving the lives literally countless mothers daughters fathers and sons across the world Person 7: when looking at what he's achieved I think (05:14) it's very very important to remember that he is also very largely responsible for Hugh Grant and I think that has to be taken into consideration when looking at the good side of Richard Person 4: Richard congratulations mate you're an absolute national treasure Person 1: I think it's very important that Richard Curtis should own this fellowship because otherwise how will he return the ring to Mordor Video: Richard Curtis, What's Funny? | MontclairFilm – YouTube https://youtu.be/-UqyVPGVM_8?list=LL Transcript: Interviewer: I understand, and tell me if I got this right, is that when you first started writing a wrote for the BBC, and that you were given a list of things that were funny. Richard Curtis: Yes, that's absolutely right, yeah. Interviewer: Okay, that's a difference between American comedy and British comedy. No one gives us a list of things that were funny when we started writing job. What was this list? The government had officially determined. Richard Curtis: No. I didn't like that list, but they were, and they were in a funny way, summed up by Cambridge, an Oxford when I was there. Cambridge had a real sort of system. You've probably heard of the Cambridge Footlights, and you kind of auditioned for it. They had a show up in Edinburgh. So they'd almost sort of math and math-ish-sized comedy. Time you saw a sketch of theirs. You thought, oh, that's very highly wrought and very clever, but there was very little humanity in it. And actually, you see a lot of that in Monty-Python. Not that much humanity. And that had sort of crept into the BBC. And so when you went there, they said, well, we're doing a satirical program, and the funny things are trade unions, British rail sandwiches. You know, the chancellor's eyebrows. And I thought the funny things were someone who's a bit uneasy with the person sending next door to them, because they're taller than they are. Do I mean, everything I thought was funny, was to do with human beings interacting, and nothing to do with politics and preconceptions. So that was the reason I failed failed so badly on weak ending the satirical radiation.

Richard Curtis: nobody knows I don't even I don't know I can't remember I can't remember how it's done that's the strange thing is it is a sort of organic organic process so one of the things is to make sure that you really do believe in the story that it keeps coming back to you so that as it (00:35) were there's a purpose to it I then I mean I used to be the most ill-disciplined writer I would get up at one watch some television have some tea make some phone calls have some dinner big oh I should probably start now but since I've had kids and a family I actually do try and go to a quiet place and write a lot Interviewer: have you had a favorite character? Richard Curtis: I'd I liked the stupid ones I like the stupid characters so there was baldrick and Blackadder and Emma chambers in The Vicar of Dibley and Rhys Ifans and Notting Hill it's just so nice (01:14) to have someone who gets a laugh Interviewer: and any advice for young screenwriters of today Richard? Richard Curtis: my advice is to work with people you genuinely admire I think that it can be a real mistake and this goes back to what you know we're doing here which is you find the people who are passionate and you work with them and you find the companies who are passionate the politicians who are passionate and I think sometimes young writers will make a mistake of saying well this is a famous name if that person wants to make my film that would be fantastic and (01:53) that's a famous actor and if they want to be in my film that's fantastic but if you don't like that directors work and if that actor is not the right actor for the part it will the whole thing won’t you know won't work so I think trying to keep your sense of integrity even in the face of more shiny objects Video: Exclusive Insight from Rowan Atkinson & Co-Creator & Writer, Richard Curtis | Happy Birthday Mr Bean - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt8agz7jipY Transcript: Person 1: (00:06) what was usually funny was just the process of of how he gets out of a difficult situation or how he gets into a difficult situation [Extract from Mr Bean] Charcter 1: done your revision? Bean: oh yes i've concentrated on trigonometry Character 1: i've done calculus mainly Bean: i believe they concentrated on calculus last year Character 1: oh dear Character 2: quiet ladies and gentlemen please the exam starts now [end of extraction] Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson): bodily expression particularly with mr bean is so very very important it's sort of screaming at you you know there may be no words but you're being shouted at i think very loudly by the (00:59) bodily expression the word compelling is quite good because i think that's what draws you into a lot of mr bean sketches Richard Curtis: you only have to have the starting point of the idea he gets locked out of his room or he's going to a swimming pool or something like that and then you could be pretty confident that we would be able to to make it work [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: with those who answer the green calculus papers please put them in the green box and those who answer the white trigonometry papers please put them in the white box [End of extract] Richard Curtis: what i've always done on the mr beans is (02:09) it where i've done the charcoal outline and then rowan adds all the color and the texture and i laughed at him while he's doing it [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: i said stop writing will you stop writing Narrator: it is 30 years since the first mr bean was shown on british television and it became an instant hit between 1990 and 1995 the team went on to produce 14 episodes in total Person 3 (Sir Tony Robinson): i didn't know until this moment there were only 14. (02:49) i thought there were probably 114 and that roman had been coining in for years and years making this never-ending flow of mr beans Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson) : we did the other 14 episodes in drips and drabs we didn't make 14 at once we made two and then we made three more and then we made one one and we made four more and eventually we got to this rather poultry sum of 14. (03:16) they were always given a sort of prime spot and and they keep that and suddenly you know people realize that visual comedy could actually hold a large audience Narator: after the overnight success of episode 1 the team was in need of new material and comedy writer robin driscoll was hired he would also feature in various sketches as a straight man to rowan Richard Curtis: i would say in the story of mr bean it's rowan, robin, and then possibly me i was thinking away rowan and i did the obvious ones we got the low hanging fruit and what was brilliant about robin (04:08) is that he's just kept as it were squeezing the lemon finding new things finding different ways taking a little thread be it to do with the car or with the teddy or anything like that. Video: Richard Curtis | BAFTA Screenwriters' Lecture Series - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMcXrAPmchk Transcript: Video: Richard Curtis Talks ABOUT TIME with AMC - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqQJK3xXDrc Transcript: Interviewer: (00:05) so now you came up with this premise over a pretty simple conversation right about what you would do with the last 24 hours liv Richard Curtis: yeah actually i i came up with the idea that i wanted to write a film about how to be happy and about appreciating a normal day that actually your happiest day wouldn't be some exotic day in las vegas with winning a million dollars and hearing you'd be nominated for an oscar that'd be tense and nervous but uh the idea my first idea was in fact to write a really simple film about (00:35) a normal day and then i thought that'll be dull so i then thought i'll write a huge science fiction time travel movie where the person finally decides that all he would do with this gift is simply lead a normal day and travel back to the beginning of each day and just live it again and enjoy it Interviewer: and i felt like you really wrote that in bill nye's character out of all of them because you know even with this gift it kind of goes back to that simplicity of just the beauty of our everyday life Richard Curtis: right yeah that's so true and bill and I (01:06) talk about this a lot now i mean i think we're we're both saying to each other are you sticking to the moral of the movie we're trying to make sure we're holding to it because both of us feel as though we should you know be more happy just with the normal day and not worry so much Interviewer: so what i love so much about your films is that all these characters they're witty and intelligent but very very relatable i feel like we can all relate to at least one of them and the same goes with gleason and mcadams characters (01:35) their chemistry on screen was amazing what was it like watching you know these characters come alive in the two of them again with chemistry that can't be taught it's there or it's not Richard Curtis: no it's so interesting i'm not i i until my films are well cast they're no good at all it would you would be interested how in the casting sessions i just lose confidence with every single person who comes in and it's only when you actually get the perfect person like as there were love in life suddenly when donald came in for the (02:04) first time the part was funny and i think that you tend to cast people who kind of appeal to your heart and then once you've done that they are likely to have some chemistry they are likely to get on with each other you know i could tell that both donal and rachel were basically sweet people with a naughty twinkle and i think that's why they got on so well Interviewer: i like that naughty twinkle so out of all the amazing characters that you have created and there are so many of them who do you think from a past film would (02:35) have been a good addition in this film Richard Curtis: oh what an interesting question um i don't know if you i mean that's an interesting question because spike you remember who Hugh lived with in notting hill if you see course very bad he wouldn't have fitted into this movie at all but there was a character in “four weddings” a very sweet character played by james fleet who was the not very clever posh rich friend yeah i can imagine him fitting into this movie and then Bill's character in love actually could just have been on the (03:06) telly because i think it's ten years since the movie came out and i'm sure he would be re-releasing the movie the dodgy song for christmas to try and make a few extra Interview: i think you should throw him in every movie that character the rock star Richard Curtis: on the radio Interviewer: yes so why do you think amc theater audiences and audiences everywhere are going to love this movie Richard Curtis: i hope that they will get slightly more than they bargained for i mean i it is quite a romantic film but i hope there are lots of jokes in it there actually (03:34) is some time travel and some of the normal chaos that time travel chooses and then i think in the end the movie turns out to be a little bit more emotional than expected i've known a lot of people who say that the moment they walked out they rang their dad or ran their son so i hope it'll be a movie that actually leaves something in your mind when you've seen. Video: Richard Curtis Interview: Love, Actually, Genie, Notting Hill, and Pirate Radio | Collider Interviews – YouTube https://youtu.be/8DSE5a0Xvyc Transcript: When I spoke to you for yesterday, you told me you had a five-hour cut of Pirate Radio. My question is, when can I see it? You can never see it. No one will ever see it. But it's a funny thing with Pirate Radio. Now I think about it, I think if I'd written it now, I would have done it as a TV series. Actually, it was very kind of episodic, and we should have done one where they raid another boat, one where they start to drown, one where the electricity goes down. But it was fun at five hours, but I don't think for human consumption. Well, you never know. I mean, Baz just released his Australia cut on Hulu as a miniseries. So maybe you want to revisit that as a... Anyway, that's just a hypothetical. So I read a few years ago that Hugh Grant revealed Notting Hill was maybe based on a friend of yours. And I wanted to know if it's possibly time for the truth to come out. No. I wouldn't go to Hugh Grant for the truth, if you're searching for it. It was really based on a kind of fantasy I used to have. I used to go for dinner every week with the same people and have the same conversation. And I remember when I was an obsessive Madonna fan, I thought... what would it be like if at last I managed to walk in with with a woman instead of just on my own with a warm bottle of white wine and kind of so the movie started with that kind of dream scenario of what would it be like if you could and you know I was thinking about Madonna and one of my friends at that dinner was an obsessive Madonna fan and the other one would definitely never have heard of her so it was based on a on a dream rather than on a on a fact. So it's the 20th anniversary of Love Actually and it's now become a Christmas classic you know people love the movie I love the movie and if it comes on it means I have to keep watching. When did you realize wait a minute this film has become something special to a lot of people? It was it was when I started getting texts from people I didn't know very well saying we're watching it again you know it was it did take a while and it's still a bit of a mystery to me I mean I've got a theory I think the reason people watch it again is they can never remember what's going to happen next you know normally when you watch a movie you know they've robbed the bank they're going to get in the car drive away and then they're going to get shot by the police whereas even I when I watch Love Actually don't have any idea what the next scene is so I think it kind of it's bearable to watch it again because it's always surprising you but you know it's a once in a lifetime bit of luck when you make something particularly Christmas. I used to so love watching Charlie Brown's Christmas every Christmas and White Christmas every Christmas. So I'm, it's a real little, it's a real little boost for me. Did you ever think the Andrew Lincoln storyline might be a little too weird? I am very often told it's a little too weird. It didn't occur to me at the time, but you know times change. And I remember someone once saying they would like to interview me about it and they would be focusing on the stalking scene. And I said, \\"Oh, I didn't know there was a stalking scene.\\" And they said, \\"Yeah, yeah, no, you know, the Andrew Lincoln, that's like top notch stalking.\\" So, you know, slowly but surely I've realized what a dreadful mistake I made. I don't think it's a mistake as much as, you know, it's a little different than the rest. But anyway, there's a new 4K release that's about to come out. What are you actually most excited for people to see on it? Well, it is very pretty now. I mean, it is interesting. You know, one of the things I do like about Love Actually is I love how kind of it looks. I think actually the kind of texture of it is very, has a sort of magic to it. And we've really added to that. The 4K, you know, where there were fuzzes in the background, you can see chandeliers and candles and everything like that. So I think it's just a sort of general feeling that the movie somehow got. a little bit better, that it's even more cheerful than it was before. That, so the grade is really lovely and then we've also remixed it and that's fun as well because, you know, technical things do improve as time goes by. If you can imagine watching a brighter version of White Christmas, what joy that would be. You've directed, you've written a lot, but you've only directed a few things. Do you have plans for directing something else or you, no? No, I found directing quite tricky. And I mean, this movie is a great example. I wrote a movie set in New York, which is such a pleasure for me, but I would have felt really insecure as a non-American directing it. And also, you know, I'm getting old and Sam Boyd who directed it is not only an American, but young. So I think I'll always find someone who's better than me now. I don't necessarily better than you, I'd just say different than you. Also, I'm trying to keep my weight down. And when you direct movies, you have to eat a certain number of donuts and bacon sandwiches. And I think that's, you know, that's a heavy price to pay. I don't think people realize, actually, the one thing is there's a lot of food on movie sets, not in the UK. The UK is a little stingy, but in America, forget it. Whatever they call it, that service table. It's the most dreadful temptation. Making a movie is like going to Willy Wonka. Yes. It's just sweets everywhere. Unless you're in the UK. I've done UK set visits and you're lucky to get a cup of tea. No, it's true. American movies are better. Just on craft service. On craft service. Right, exactly. So a lot of people with Genie will not realize this is a remake of something you made many years ago. And so I'm just curious, how did it come about to remake this? Well, it's funny. Not long after I made the original movie, which is only an hour long, I thought this would have been fun as a movie movie. But time goes by, you have children and all that kind of stuff. And then just a couple of years ago, I thought I will go back and look. And my circumstances, that's about kind of a sad singleton who's just lost his girlfriend. And I thought, well, I'd love to make a movie about families on Christmas. And I can actually write a really different movie. I can set it in America. We can have a female Genie. And then, you know, the dream came true and we got Melissa. So there was just enough, you know, a lot of extra things. And then I do love Christmas movies. And if I can, you know, do another one, that makes me happy. One of the things about a film where you have a Genie and they can wish for anything is it can get expensive very fast. So how much in the writing of this, of the remake, are you thinking we can't afford that? So let me not even write it. you know, what normally happens is you write a movie and then people tell you, you can't afford it. So I don't remember thinking, I've got to, I can't do this or that. And then I think there were moments of realism, you know, we couldn't get a real cap. But I think that on the whole, my imagination is pretty modest. So most of it happens, you know, in a pretty realistic environment. And then once in a while they say, you know, change a, you know, Christmas market to, you know, a coffee stall. Sure. You have a number of references to Tom Cruise in the film. And I'm curious, did you need permission when she's wearing that shirt? Like how did that all come about? We did need permission from Tom. It was so sweet that he gave it, you know, because there's an element of teasing. I once worked, tried to do a film with Tom and he was always so delightful and friendly to me. And I don't know whether the reason he said yes is because, you know, he was so chummy then. But I love the fact that I have eventually written a Tom Cruise movie. Just so happens Tom's not in it. Exactly. But he's on the t-shirt. He's on the t-shirt and we've got like a three second clip from Mission Impossible. Yeah. When I saw that, I was like, oh, wow. I mean, you need permission for this. This is a, you know what I mean? So one of the things about this is that it's more of a family film. And I'm curious, how did the balance of that come about in terms of how much, no, actually, let me skip that question altogether. I'm fascinated by the editing process 'cause it's where it all comes together. How did this possibly change in the editing room in ways you didn't expect? Or was this all Sam and you just saw the finished film? - No, no. I mean, editing is my favorite part of the process because it's just so interesting. You write a film, it reads really well. You shoot the film, you watch it, you think it's the worst film you've ever seen. And it's really interesting. And one of the thing, you know, how you have to take out bits, change bits, stress bits. You know, one of the great things about Melissa in this is she's both magical, but very normal. And the first time I thought it, about an hour in, I thought, \\"Oh, I've forgotten she's a genie.\\" You know, she's just a lovely woman. And then you have to build up, put scenes where she does magic closer together. And then the great thing about Christmas movies is just the wealth of wonderful Christmas songs. You know, you suddenly can, if it's getting a bit weak, you throw in the OJs or Otis Redding or a bit of Anvil and suddenly the movie perks up. So, no, just like all my movies, it was a bit of a struggle. But. Particularly because the two leads, well, I say the two leads and Mark Maron and Louise Guzman, because the cast was so strong, we had very firm foundations. But as always, it was a it was a journey. What do you think would surprise soon to be fans of Genie to learn about the making of Genie? Well, I think they shouldn't be surprised that some of the funniest lines were written by Melissa McCarthy and Mark Maron. You know, I'm quite a tyrant in terms of my own lines, but these were really clever, great American comedians. And they added, you know, they added stuff in. And I think that, you know, I think everyone will perhaps be surprised how convincingly American it is. And that's because, you know, Sam's an American director. And so I hope that it feels like a Richard Curtis movie, but in a whole new in a whole new world. I am a fan of your work, have been for a very long time. I'm obviously very curious what you are working on now. Well, I'm working on buying Christmas presents and decorating the tree. You know, that's that's the big stuff. Oh, I've got a few things. I've been working on an animation, which has been a gripping process. I mean, it's the longest filmmaking in the world. But it's really interesting because you write, direct, cast, shoot and edit all at the same time. So that's been very interesting to me. And now I think I might write a play. Really? Yeah, go on. Are you writing it now, or it's... I've had a go. I've started a couple of them, so I think that might be the next thing I do. The animated thing you're talking about is called \\"That Christmas.\\" Yes. Oh, I didn't... That's my final outing to Christmas, by the way. It is? It's all going to be Easter and Midsummer's Day from now on. Sir, you have an addiction to Christmas. I'm sure that the play takes place at Christmas. No. No. There's not going to be any Christmas. I'm going to do \\"Delete All\\" on my computer whenever Christmas is mentioned again, but I'm hoping... You know, with Jeannie, I'm trying to go out with a bang. No, I think you mean \\"That Christmas,\\" you're going to go out with a bang. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm going out with a pre-bang on Jeannie. Exactly. When actually is that coming out? Do you know? Next Christmas, because Christmas takes so long. So a year from now, we will be talking again? I hope so. And you will be talking about how the play all of a sudden went to taking place at Christmas. Yeah, the play will be \\"Christmas Carol\\" by then. Right. You have actually done a tremendous amount through your career, and I am curious, if someone has never seen anything you've done before, what do you want them watching first and why? Wow. What a... Do you know, the thing I really like... Sometimes I go online and I find that somebody who isn't me has edited... like my movies down to three minutes with a really pretty pop song. I think start with that. You know, lots of pretty people and no, you know, dodgy jokes. I'd go for Richard Curtis, the montage. Start there. I'm very... I think Four Weddings is lovely. And I wrote a TV show called Blackadder. And the final episode of the final series of that is, I think, an interesting piece of work. So there are some things I like. But start with Genie. Start with Genie. - Of course. Last question for you. Which of the films that you worked on or wrote do you think changed in the editing room? Which of the films changed the most in the editing room in ways you didn't expect going in? - Oh, that's definitely Love Actually, strangely. Because Love Actually was, you know, 10 stories and it seemed to work well. And it is in a completely different order to what we wrote it in. It's unrecognizable from the original order, even though the scenes are the same. It was like playing three-dimensional chess because you could put any scene after any scene at any point. That's definitely the one that changed most. - On that note, sir, I wish you nothing but the best. Thank you for giving me your time and good luck with the rest of your speed dating. - That's so sweet. Don't go changing and Merry Christmas. - Great. See you later from Horton Held. Video: Richard Curtis | BAFTA Screenwriters' Lecture Series | BAFTA Guru – YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMcXrAPmchk Transcript: Macaron I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, welcome to the BAFTA and BFI International Screenwriters lecture series for 2013. I was on the BAFTA film committee and discovered I was the only screenwriter who'd ever been on it. And after I got over the shock, I decided that the best I could do for my screenwriting brothers and sisters was to set up a lecture series in the name of BAFTA and we were able to bring the BFI in on that. This year we got a fantastic lineup, we start with David Eskoyer, we end with Richard Curtis and in between we have Hosseina Minis, Susanna Grant and Tony Gilroy. These are serious heavy weights from the UK and from America. You will be inspired by these individuals. We have been trying to get Richard Curtis since day one of day one. So this is a huge pleasure because I had begun to give up hope that we would ever manage to lure Richard in. If you ask someone in the street to name a famous screenwriter, they probably couldn't, but they might come up with Richard Curtis. That's how famous he is. And if you look at his filmography, you're looking at the list, not the list, the list of the best selling British films of all time. He's almost created a genre of his own and has written a mirror that holds itself up to us as British people. One of the keys to the success of the series is that we don't give up on those we love and even though they come up with very, very good excuses, we just don't accept that. So it's a particular pleasure to have Richard Curtis closing the series because tonight we have some serious heavy weight writers in the audience. And I am really looking forward to hearing what he has to say. This is almost my first lecture or the other lectures I've ever given of being to my children. And I'm still doing the washing up. So I'm not exactly convinced of the efficacy of the lecture form. And also I do also want to say that everything that I say will only be partially true or as it were only true for me, which is a really important thing. I'm screenwriters on the whole don't talk to each other about what they do. For instance, I've always think it's a clever thing to leave myself notes for the next day. So I've never woken up and started writing with an empty page in front of me. There may be other people for whom the empty pages absolutely key. Without it they couldn't as it were, feel the challenge. I write enormous amounts. I write 20, 30 pages of stuff a day and hope that some of it's good. There may be other people who do the exact opposite who care about every word and don't put it down until they're sure it's right. So I seriously don't know what's right or wrong. All I can do is tell you what's true for me. And the first bit now is going to be of the evening. I've decided to use like inspiration, Jeremy Paxman. And because I'm just going to ask myself the same question a few times and try and give a few different answers. And the question is why I'll be answering that. And then I think Edith and I have agreed that we might talk about how, as it were, about the process as a little bit more and then you can ask whatever you like. The first question that I asked myself is why did I start writing films? And the answer is because someone called Michael an American asked me to write a film. So I got a phone call from my agent saying he wants to see you tonight. And I thought of the idea for the film that I was going to sell him on the Northern line. And that was the first big mistake that I've never made again, which is that I always have lived with the idea of any film that I'm going to do for at least a year before I eventually start writing it. Films can't be in factuations. They've got to be relationships. And I suppose this is my first observation that I think the difference between having a good idea for a film and a finished film that you like is the same as seeing a pretty girl at a party and being there when you're wife delivers the third baby. It's an incredibly long journey. And a good idea is only the tiny little spark at the beginning of this immense process. I came up with the idea for Michael. It was about a father and a son who both found out on the same night that the girls they were with, the girlfriend and the wife were having sex with other people. And so they both as it were left their flat and their house and moved in together in a hotel and had to as it were deal with their peculiar situations together. And it was called four eyes and fat thighs. And I think that's the only thing I really got out of it because that's weirdly close to four weddings and a funeral. So it was the first and then I wrote a draft. I went out to L.A. and I wrote a second draft under the producers E. Goli in his guest room and then he put me together with a director with whom I wrote a third draft and then we handed it in and we had what I think is quite a typical American meeting. They loved the script. They really loved it and I asked them did they have any reservations at all because their smiles were so big and they said the dialogue wasn't great. It was to English and a bit too formal. And I said, all right, then they said that the two leading characters were not good because they were both weak and they needed someone to be able to root for in the movie. And then they said, and obviously the jokes are all very English. So we'd have to think of jokes that would appear more to an American sense of humour. And then I remember saying to them that really only leaves the title and they said we hate the title. But the strange thing was they still said, can't wait to get the next draft. So I went home. I was staying with a friend of mine by the stage because I was sorted out of the nose breakdown. I got a self-induced temperature of 103 about a week later. I flew home to England and met a girl in May as sued me in perpetuity. I never delivered the script and that explains pretty well everything about what I have done since then. First, never do a project that you haven't thought about beforehand. Be sure of that you're working with people who actually like the work you do, which I think is hugely important. Choose the people you work with really carefully. This director was a lovely man but I remember when we were talking about the film the very first day. He said, oh, I so I don't know if I would have this film. When my wife left me, I'd just went out and had sex with a different girl every night for a month. And this was a film about two men who don't have ever had sex with one person in their entire lives. So he was completely and utterly the wrong man to be making this film. But most importantly, and this isn't a rule for everyone, but it sort of is explains everything since then. I decided that I would never write a film about anything that I didn't really know about very personally. I didn't know. I realized when I was writing the film where American shopped, I didn't know what they'd watched on TV when they were kids. I didn't know anything about the structure of their schools. So I came straight home and I wrote a film called Count Townboy, which was eventually called the Torguei about someone who lived in Count Town where I lived about someone who had Heifever, which I had, and about someone who's job was to be a straight man to a comedian whose name was in the script, Ron Anderson and my job was to be Rowan's straight Rowan Act in straight Ram. So I have always since then basically stuck to what I think is true to my experience and emotionally right for me. So that's why I started on a career of small personal English films. And it was absolutely key. And I think the other thing that was key in the development of myself as a screenwriter was one sentence in William Goldman's fabulous book called Adventures in the Screen Trade, which I would recommend anyone who hasn't read to read, where he said that most directors end up making films that vaguely remind them of a screenplay that they once read. And it's that sentence is the stake of fear through my heart that's dominated everything I've done since then. The next question I've asked myself is why so many of the films or the films have generally turned out as I hoped they would. And this is quite a complicated and odd thing. And I didn't realize as it was going to be the core of what I was going to say when I was asked about, and I thought, oh well, I'll write about playing lots of pop music while I'm writing. But on the whole the films that I've worked on have turned out as I intended. And I don't know how replicable it is and I don't know if my experience is very personal. But I would say that from my point of view a huge amount of the challenge facing a screenwriter is about control. And that is a very important trickieria. When it came to four weddings, I decided I was going to take it even more seriously. We made a deal that we, me and Duncan, would be involved in every part of the process of making the film, which meant being there when it was being cast, being there every day when it was shot and being there a lot of the time when it was being edited even though not all the time. And so strangely for me in the end I decided simply in order to stay alive that I would take to directing myself, which obviously comes with pluses and minuses. I am probably the worst director that I've worked with. But at least I know what I want and and how it should be and that it will be accurate. What you've got to be very careful, I'm particularly aware of how horrible it is to have a stubborn writer in the edit and I hope that I'm more ruthless in editing my own films than anyone else could possibly be. Certainly that's been my experience. I'm always saying take out more. But I do feel that you should as a writer if you can try to be there when it's done because you don't want to waste your life making or having other people make the wrong films. And now the final bit, which is the most surprising bit to me of all and I've only it's been made seem odd to you but I only started to think about it for days ago is why I have actually written the films that I've written at all. I suddenly thought why have I written this bunch of films instead of another bunch of films? I've said here when I thought of first writing movies, these were my favorite 10 films. Godfather one, Godfather two, the Avengers of Robin Hood, Doge Day off to noon, Emmanuel one, Emmanuel two, white Christmas, closing cows of the third kind, animal house and a street kind name desire. And it never even occurred to me that I could write anything like any of those films in the same way that often you end up marrying someone who's not the slightest bit like you. But there was another bunch of films which for some reason or other I felt I could identify with and could do something like and I'm interested in why I thought that, why I didn't think I could do the other type. And the strange thing to me is that I wrote my first film when I was 30 and I really ended up the key things that I've written have been on the same subjects about they've been about love and they've been about friendship and they've been about family. And thinking about tonight I've been as puzzled as some of the people who are very critical of my films are why I would bother doing it again and again and again. And I've tried to think about this. Why have I not gone down a lot of other routes? And I've taken a bit of consolation. I've got a second slide here from thinking about artists and I'm not comparing myself with these. But I don't know if you've got sugar. There are lots of cities and lots of you know cafeterias and lots of soup cans. But every time he sat down he thought, oh I know, I'll make everything a bit blue and put some flowers in it and on the whole people it'll be jumping over houses. And then if we just go on and look at the other two, oh there we go. Must have led a life of great variety but every time he put pen to paper, these people. And then just the last one, there we go. Really? Oh, I mean, all you thought, he must have been able to see there were other ways of going about things. But for some reason or other and I do think that there is a thing about style, you know, as it were brushed to paper and pen to paper, which is the thing that you do and there's probably not much that you can do about that. And so I've just been thinking that it must be the reason I've written all these films. There's because the things that I feel most deeply must be about those subjects in my own life. So I was raised in a family that was full of love. That's what was the big thing in my youth was as it were family love. And all the big emotions and all the big things that I felt have been in this area in the area of romantic love, family love, friendship and not as it were in the area of serial killers, superheroes, people who died 300 years ago, secrets, scandals, corruption, action, sporting victories, gangsters, things from outer space. All of these things that are a few gentrists to other people and take up their time were clearly not being the thing which inspired me. I've just written a lot of times about love, friends and family because it would seem that if you really write what you care about, you as it were, have no choice. And that must be why I've really written about anything else. Maybe that takes me back to the beginning. All the mistakes I made on the first firm, I found that what I do best is when I write what is true to me, what I understand. And I hope that I have listened in more ways than one, to my own instincts and my own heart. And at least for the moment, that's my explanation why I've ended up writing the things that I have. We're off. Are you ready to really push control slightly? Yes. Good. Glad to hear that. Have you got all the clips I told you that we must have really... Thanks, so they're already with Big Red Botan up there. Yeah, we're ready, we're good. Before we get to the clips, we've got to start with the question on how, how you approach writing a screenplay. I mean, just very quickly on that. I've been trying to think, how do I write a screenplay? Because I certainly don't sit down in a month or two months. I think the answer is, I think of an idea ages before. And then I kind of write a long, weird, prose poem to myself with lots of bits of dialogue in it, which is just a discussion. So I say, this might happen in the middle of these, might be the characters. This might be the end. This might be the beginning. I mean, I would never write a treatment, by the way. I think they are... shockingly bad idea. I genuinely think that a treatment is the equivalent of a prose description of a painting. I think I will draw a picture of a pretty woman with a landscape behind her and you're not quite sure whether she's smiling or sad. That's the Mona Lisa. But I genuinely think they're nonsense. So I would have never done that if I can. And then slowly, I kind of, I then I think I'd write down on cards, incidents that are in it and see whether or not, suddenly I've got 100 things that start to be in an order that's vaguely sensible. And then I will start having a go at writing. I find it really fascinating when you were talking in your lecture about how involved you are. I mean, is that quite a unique thing for a writer who's not the director of a film to be that involved through that whole process? I think it is, but we've made it work and it's been complicated. I mean, I think I really do think of my job as a screenwriter being pretty well equal. And I mean, actually, obviously, if you'll then direct in the movie, that bit's equal. My contribution to the directing of the movie was not as important, I think it's very important to be there. But I think the editing of films, again, it really is a massive rewrite. And it is a extraordinarily important part of the process. And I can't, if I could take you guys through time to see how disastrous at least four of the films that I've been involved in have been when they were thought to be finished. It is, I mean, Bridget Jones was catastrophic. Yeah. And the movie we shot, even though every single frame of it was then in the finished movie, it was not the right movie. We just got all sorts of things wrong in the screen play. Like there were two laughs in it in the whole film. And some of you who may have seen it recently and think that's more than I remember, but in front of a crowd, it used to get some laughs and we just, we were going completely the wrong reaction of the film. And then suddenly one day, we realized that the problem was that Bridget has presented on film was a pretty girl in a good job who both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth wanted to sleep with. And it was not a challenging scenario one where somebody deserved a much sympathy or interest. And so what we did quite near the end is we took the saddest scene in the film, which was right at the end when she'd been dumped for the third time by Mr. Darcy or I can't remember where it was, but it was the last five minutes or ten minutes in the movie. And we made it the credit sequence of the film. So I think it might be interesting to look at the credits of Bridget and see that the reason why people then were sympathetic and liked the film. I mean we did then cut 15 out of the next 30 minutes to try and speed it up and stuff. But the credits of this film, this was the emotional climax and end of the film until as it were she ran through snow. The strange thing is that is two, her emotion is two big for a opening credit sequence I think. Now you can see how that would have been quite near the end of the movie with her and real trouble and really, really saddened everything. But by moving that up, we changed the fate of the more swimming watch and that we go, I did that maybe about a month ago. The characters almost have, you know, do you do associate characters with certain pieces of music then as well whilst you're writing? It's a good that, it's a good that far. I don't know that it's character as much as emotional moods. Talk of emotional moods if you want to get to a point with something, do you feel like with film and with screenwriting you need to find a journey to get there as opposed to just seeing things as they are. Because you've got a great example of you just from noting hell of this the scene with Julia and you of all of all. I've actually got my pocket, my hints and if you've got time, I've got to have it as I might just tell you as it were, things tricks that I use which I'm sure will not be useful to most of you but interesting. I mean, I'd just be honest. One of the things that I found in most of my films and I was a bit torn between an example I could have given you for almost every film that sometimes when I'm stuck on a film completely and trying to work out what to do and feeling that I haven't got there, and this will unfortunately destroy the scene that everyone's about to see. But I just write exactly what the film is about in what people say. It's so often, I think it's a bit of a bit of a bit of a tradition. I actually won't, I won't quite ever say, well I let people maybe imply vaguely what the emotional journey was meant to be. And I'm quite a believer in going straight for it. So, I mean this is a, this is a, you know, key scene in Notting Hill but if you listen to it again, again, you're a discriminating audience, you probably thought the first time you saw it. Wow, this is exactly him saying what the film's about, but this was me writing straight at Notting Hill to try and say what I thought the film was about. I live in Notting Hill, you live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name. Fine. Fine, good decision. Good decision. The famous thing isn't really real, you know. And don't forget, I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her. So, well, I'm just saying there is that was a piece of work, you know, a very deliberate thing to try to exactly sum up what I thought the whole film was about. How do you know when something's funny? That's quite interesting. You do laugh when you write something funny. I mean, and that is really interesting because when we wrote Blackouter, I used to notice that because Blackouter was quite, you know, constructional, you know, you'd kind of knew what people would do and how the plot would go. And you could make things funny in a way. And there were quite a lot of things we did repetitively. And whenever I actually laughed, I would underline things. So, I would remember that actually made me laugh rather than something that I worked towards. And at the end of the whole process, Ben said, what was funny lines that used to be underneath the script? So, he'd obviously never noticed. They were the funniest lines that I'd ever read. Okay, questions from our audience. You mentioned your own family background. And whereas most family backgrounds that are mentioned are bad memories for the person telling you about them, you refer to a close and loving family background. My question is, if you had not had that kind of family background, does it mean that you simply would not have become a screenwriter or would you think have written films with influence from the kind of awful background you'd had becoming a parent? I realize in retrospect, I'm very interested in things going well. I think there is a, it's a real, it would be interesting to talk with people who disagree because I find things going well, very, very interesting. And I know that there are lots of people who when they see a situation, look for the thing that's wrong and say that's the truth. And when I have said before, that I'm sometimes puzzled by the fact that when I write films about people falling in love, they are critically taken to be sentimental and unrealistic. And yet, 4 million people in London are in love tonight and today all around the world hundreds of thousands of people will fall in love. When someone writes a film about a soldier getting a wall and breaking into a flat and murdering a young pregnant woman, something which has happened twice in history, that film will be described as seringly realistic. I don't see how that's true. I was on a beach in Southworld the other day. And you look along, you see fathers playing with their children, people in love holding hands, older couples having cups of tea with each other, no sign whatsoever of ruthless violence and hatred on that beach. Now of course I know from my work with comic relief about the dark art of the UK, but that's not the only story and I think stories of joy and love are definitely worth worth telling. And I'm a beneficiary of that. And long may tell them. APPLAUSE We feel we let you go. Can we have your tricks of a dream or what to have these? We've got our eyes. So I did just write them down. These are absurd. I cannot believe. I'm going to say this in front of me. Most books are the ready. I can't believe I'm saying this in front of Christopher Hampton. I live in a street with only two houses in the street. And I'm the second best writer in the street. And the third best director, as my son Charlie now knows more about what if I written here? I'm not going to say that. I want you all time. I've said the thing about going on the nose. Oh, this is just a hint of mine, which I do think is helpful if you're a writer. Is when I get stuck, which is often, I always write 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the gap on the page. And then I give myself five goals at the problem. So I don't have that dreadful pressure of thinking, I've got to get it right. There's time, what is he going to say to her, what can they do? I just write something that's the same as the thing I wrote before, something that's a bit different. Something that's completely different, something with another character and something from our spaces at web. And by the time you've relaxed enough to write the five, you often find that somewhere in the five is the answer that you need, whereas the pressure of having to get it right, I find very hard. To get right was book often. No, I mean, I get completely stuck. And that's when I start typing and sit down with a pad and write impensal. So I can't see what I'm doing. This is bad thing to reveal, but I do. I have to admit that I do sometimes at certain points, right, as I say, like a mixing desk. I've got to a certain point and I can see it's all a bit fungi. And so I say, if you've ever been in a studio when they're making a record, it's so annoying, because they turn up the sacks and then they fiddle with the sacks for two hours. And you say, oh, god, this is all going to be sacks. The whole thing. And then they fix the sacks and then they pull it down and it rejoins the track. And I do have some days where I just say, I've just got to do plot. I'm sure there's something wrong. So I just do plot. And then the next day, I've taped down the plot and lift out the character. And I get characters, why don't you talk and do each other convincingly. And they talk to each other all day. And then when I fix that, I reintroduce that. And then I'll do jokes and other day. I said, just isn't funny enough, and I'm going to go through it all and try and do that. So that's another, as it were, workmen like trick that I do. Never leave a black page in the morning. This is the most important one of all. Don't call your boys by girls names and your girls by boys names. It's so annoying when you read a script and the husbands call Carol and the wife's called Alex. And the whole way through the film, you can't remember who why. And then for some reason, her other Alex is giving birth to somebody and stuff. So you can change the when the actors have faces. You can call them whatever you like, but in a script, call them by names that are identified by the right sex. This was a card just to say, if anybody ever talks about the death of romantic comedy, I think that should be ignored because I think good romantic comedies are funny films about love. And I would say this decade we've had lost in translation, 500 days of summer, a tunnel sunshine at the spotless mine. These are great great films about love. Probably better than in the 10 years before they were, all the 10 years before that. So I think it's just a question in terms of movies about love of rephrasing it and not just going by by a formula. And then the most important one of all, oh no, here's one, not very important one. Which is if you're a writing comedy and you want to make something funnier, the web way to do it is go to where it's already funny and make it a bit funny at the mad. So in Notting Hill there's a scene where Hugh goes in and he's pretending he's from horse and hound and he interviews due to and when Tim Bevan gave me his note that he's given on every single film I've ever written, which is not very funny is it. Then I went to that bit and I thought, okay, so he comes out and I knew that bit was funny and I thought, how can I extend that bit rather than finding another bit where I make it all funny? So I thought what would happen if we came out on the corridor and then we said, now you can talk to everybody else. So that's just a little practical comedy hint. And then this is the last one I've written where I say love yourself 99% failure is a triumph. And I often do think that I think when I'm talking to people who are writing and they say, if I write and there's one good bit that is an extraordinary day and I will think I'll end it and I'll think I've really got that bit and wouldn't it been my I can see that being in the final film and I know that many young writers they write and they say it's all shit and then they say, I mean there was one bit there might be okay but the whole day was dreadful and you've got to just reverse that and see that if you've produced anything that's of worth in terms of the life of writing a film because films are quite quick to write because they're just dialogue you could type out a film in three days you couldn't type out an novel in three days but you should be proud of hope full of observant for anything that's anything that's good. Which I thank you so much for tonight could have been very helpful for the film. Video: Richard Curtis - Exclusive 'About Time' Interview (2013) | Rotten Tomatoes – YouTube https://youtu.be/74mMMMnjZjw Transcript: Yes, great-ray course and hound magazine. Oh, my goodness! It may be you see that film again. There's a castle made of horse and hound. And when I saw it, they'd done the front cover and they'd misspelled the word millennium. No. So it's gone a little leaf. I took a leaf off. I put a plant next to it. Took a leaf off it and put the leaf over the mistlete of millennium. Yes. This is going to sound strange. But there's this family's secret, but the men in the family can travel in time. This is such a weird joke. Your movies are responsible for so many warm fuzzies in my life. I was looking through them all and I mean, for God's sake, even it's not even just the specifically romantic ones. You don't war horse has that element. Right? Yeah, it's just even I will tell him that he's good at warm fuzzies. Yes. I, as far as I'm concerned, I'm a huge fan and I think that you're sensing that as I sit very close to you. I want to know like what is your idea of the most romantic date that you could be on? I was mess up romantic days. That's the point. There's a scene in love actually where he goes and we then can go outside care as door and he's got a course there. And I remember writing five ideas for that. I'm going out into my office where there were four girls typing and saying which of these is a good idea. And then I did the first one. They went, ah, the second one. Yeah, no, I'd hate the guy and then fortunately one of them, the cars, one, they said, oh, maybe that'll be all right. So just because I write about it doesn't necessarily mean I'm any good at the romantic things myself. Okay. And I think the thing that made my life turn out all right was realizing what sort of person I should be going out with. I remember driving along in the car and saying I must stop trying to go out. I must go out with someone talkative. Ah, that makes sense. That's the most important thing ever. A beautiful moment in anybody's life when they realize the partner that they're looking for. Yeah. I like that. Have you ever had a particularly memorable New Year's Eve like in the film? A good Orbad. Oh, New Year's Eve was always so awful for me. I mean, so, my main memory of New Year's Eve is like my daughter, my parents cracking in about 11, 30 and saying, do you mind if you go to bed? And then going in and kissing my mum and she used to wear cold cream. And when you kissed her, you would fall off her face onto the arms and the pillow. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve just like the ones there. And they would play charades and at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve. Just like the ones there, and they would play charades. And at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. So that New Year's Eve has always been so depressing for me. Well, and you get a chance to kind of make these things into fantastic films, I see, from the stories. Well, I do in the end end up writing about things that I care about. And thus, post love and family and friendship, but being the things that have got me through. Not, I'm superheroes and great sporting occasions. Would you say that you learn from something and situation in the right about it? Or backwards? You write about it and learn from that. Such a good question. Then this case and this fellow, I tried to write myself into a corner where I actually think about what the film is about, which is enjoying a normal day.

Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. (dramatic music) - Where we're going, we don't need roads. (dramatic music) - Mr. Curtis, an honor to see you again, sir. How are you? - I'm very happy now. It's, you know, it's pitch black here in England. - It'll be pitch black in Chicago in about four hours. So we're right behind you, sir. I'm gonna jump into this. - We're ready for mulled wine over here. - Oh, always. I exist in a constant state of ready for that. I'm gonna jump into this. You know, for so many people, Christmas movies are a tradition. They watch the same ones every year. It's a comfort for many of us, but I want to know for the people who create these Christmas movies, whether you're writing or you're directing them, do you allow your own films to be a part of your Christmas tradition? Would you ever gather the family around and say, \\"All right, guys, it's time to watch 'Genie.' \\"All right, guys, gather the kids. \\"It's time to watch 'Love Actually.'\\" - I mean, I think they'd kill me if I said it was time to watch \\"Love Actually\\" again, but maybe this year. I mean, I don't know. Our family aren't getting together till, you know, December the 18th, and we might watch the \\"Genie\\" film this year if we can hold off. That is a possibility, even though it's a- - A battle between anything I've ever tried and Elf. And normally Elf wins. - I would always choose you, sir, over Elf, always. When you start talking about genies, I try not to ask cliche junket questions, but the concept of wishes is always gonna come up. So I'm gonna try to approach this from an angle that not everyone's doing. When you first put pen to paper and start writing a script, what is wish number one that you really hope comes true? - Wow, I mean, look. My friend Danny Boyle said that the secret behind movies, the only thing that matters in a movie, as he said, is the beginning and the end, and the beginning not so much. So the first thing I hope for is that the movie's got a good end. 'Cause no matter how hard you try, if the end's no good, everyone walks away saying, \\"I didn't enjoy that much.\\" And this movie started with the end. I kind of knew where it was going the whole way through. My wish is always that I'm not hoping the end appears, but that I start knowing with how it's gonna finish. - Can I just honestly tell you, and I wouldn't say this if I didn't believe it, it's a great ending. It's honestly, it's fantastic. So you crushed it. If I didn't believe so, I would just awkwardly move on to the next question. So you absolutely crushed it. - Thank you very much. - Yes, sir. You know, speaking of, you mentioned \\"Love Actually\\" before, 20 years since it hit theaters. And the thing I always say is that movies don't change. We change. The story that I loved two decades ago is different than the story I love now as an adult. So two decades later, what is the storyline that you see most differently? Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. Do you know, now that my life is sort of calmer, and now that I'm a gentle, older man, last time I watched it, I really loved the stupid story with Colin going to America. I thought I wasted my youth and I wish I was 27 again. So I'm sorry, I've got more shallow rather than more deep. - I just love just how that story turns out. The walking into the bar, it's brilliant. It still yields one of the biggest laughs every time one of the girls walks in. People think I'm crazy when I say this, but I truly believe that love actually is the reason that \\"All I Want for Christmas\\" has become the hit that it is, why it plays every year. Can you talk about using that song in the film and the impact you think love actually had on it? - I mean, don't say that anywhere near Mariah Carey. She's gonna sue you out of your job. But the truth of the matter is, I really listened to that a lot while I was writing the movie. You know, you're sitting in a dark office in the middle of March. and you're just dreaming about a movie. And that song is so irresistibly cheerful that I would sometimes like put it on a loop. So it was kind of the fuel behind the movie. So if I've managed to get rack up any extra sales from Mariah, I'm delighted. - Because God knows she needs it. - I don't think she needs it. - You know, it's, I feel like the sign of a good movie and it's the same case with \\"Genie\\" as well. But a sign of a good movie is when it's over years later, you're still wondering, I wonder what happened to those characters. I know we got a little bit of a follow-up on \\"Red Nose Day\\" but I'm sort of curious of all the \\"Love Actually\\" storylines, which one is the most that you find yourself wondering, where are they today, 20 years later? - Well, I mean, I think Hugh Grant would definitely be divorced. I don't think there's any doubt in that. I think what I do is I tick through them and say if any of them lasted 20 years. I think the naked couple would have lasted but Hugh would be onto his third wife. There's no doubt about it. - That's fantastic. I've got to tell you, swinging back around to \\"Genie,\\" there is a line in the script that literally made me spit out my drink. And it's when Melissa says about Jesus Christ being the son of God. I thought he was kidding. I've got to tell you, you have made lines that make me laugh, that make me cry. The \\"my son, my dad\\" moment from \\"About Time,\\" I crumble every time I watch that. So I'm sort of curious for you, I know you're sort of very close to all these projects, but what is the line or the moment you've written or directed in your career? that still has the most emotional effect on you when it's played out on the screen? Well, do you know, I think, I mean, there's a lovely line at the end of this one, you know, when Melissa says most people are cruel and selfish, but that was never you. And I think she did that phrasing. And I love that. I like the end of About Time, where he says, you know, life's a roller coaster, we have to relish this remarkable ride. That's kind of what I'm trying to do every day. Just see what's around you. Try not to hope for more and see whether you can just enjoy the texture of every day. I love that. Mr. Curtis, I asked for extra time with you just because I'm such a fan of you and your work. So in every word that you've put down on paper is a blessing to all of us. So I appreciate you giving me that time. And thank you for always doing just such incredible work that makes all of our lives richer, man. It was a real always an honor to speak with you. You're so sweet. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Bye guys. Video: Richard Curtis: Christmas Forces My Family To Come Home 🎄| Virgin Radio UK -YouTube https://youtu.be/pxpp0C7wIPA Transcript: So this is in London on the 7th to the 11th of December. It's an amazing show curated by this man here. This genius in front of us. Yes. The South Bank Centre, tickets available southbank centre.co.co.com. Can I say they are? It really is a case of well-stocks last. I think if anyone does want to go, they should like do it today. Oh, right. They're selling fast. Of course they are. Southbank Centre.co. What, what makes the question? How come, why wouldn't you run this for longer? Because people would go and see this for like a month. Well, I do have a little plan, which is that if it works out and if it turns out to be a kind of script that's reproducible, I would love it to be something that lots of theatres could do from year to year and maybe even schools could do and maybe they could even do an Australian America. It's kind of because some of the money is going to come at really. So the idea would be just like, you know, J.M. Barry, don't, don't, some of the money from Peter Pan always go to the great Ormans Street. All of it. All of it. So I've got a little hope that if it works out well, if we get as sufficiently enthusiastic and merry audience, that it might be something that lasts. J.M. That was, he was a guy I wasn't he. His story is unbelievable, isn't it? He was a single parent, wasn't he? And he carried on writing was a great dad, wrote all these amazing stories and posthumously every single penny of profit from his estate goes to great Ormans Street. Did you think I should do that? I think it's worse than done. You're not following me, or leader. Okay, I should give nothing to charity after I die. Richard, I think you've done you bit by the way. I mean, a lot of health from you. We've had some fun over the years. We sold the Queen's car last year on the way. We sold the New Times, just a couple of days ago, children need something. Congratulations, I think. But that was so far. Well, more than the mutual party. That was Matthew's idea. Yeah, what's this? So you got a car frame, I said, I know, but I think we're dealing it on. Anyway, this is great, man. And how much you love Christmas, I attend? You still have full on 10? Yeah, I'm still full on 10 because it is. You know, I've just made this genie movie. And the genie movie is all about, you know, you get a genie. You could have anything in the world, but the thing that you most want really is just have a lovely meal with your family. And Christmas forces my family, who many of them are fled to America. To come home and it's the one time we see them. And I like Turkey. Right before. Before. So by the way, I love Turkey. I want to have it more often. Yeah, don't you? Well, I want to have it more often. I want to have it both out of cold. Yeah, I love it. I love it. Picked. To win right now, pull off. Poor us, cafe. Our on mile a bone, Lane. Just takes how much is now. We should go ahead and neck. We should go after this. Yeah. Before we move on, just one more plug for this. Christmas actually, Southbank Center's Royal Festival Hall, 70, 11th December. Lots of the province going to comet relief. It's a great show. This man in front of us curated it. He noticed his Christmas trees. There are lights. There's smoke. There's mystery. There's even a scary bit in it. Southbank Center. Yeah. So what is the arc? It just give us the elevator pitch of the arc of the tale. Well, no, no, it's not a story. Right. It's a misson and a knee. So you come on and you think, what's going to happen? And then everything happens. And we get literally all my favorite things. We like to tell four Christmas stories. There's the Christmas in the trenches story. There's the bandage story. There's the story about how a polo eight went around the moon on Christmas day and took the first pictures of the, you know, that we've ever seen of the earth from space. We went to the moon, but we discovered the earth. And then flowing, Joan, who are those brilliant comedy, they're going to come on and play. And I guess, star rocks up and gives presents to the audience. I mean, I think anybody who comes and isn't entertained wasn't alive when they entered the building. Yeah. Okay. That's great. So those four stories, that's why it could roll out. I was wondering how you're going to roll it out if you don't have a story, but that's how come. Yeah. And the songs are written in the song. Yeah. I mean, there is some fantastic, we've just been to this thing with the, if we're going to at the end of it, we're going to sing all I want for Christmas is you. And I've got the members of the cast of the film, filmed them holding up the lyrics in the same way as Andrew Lincoln held up the card. So you can sing along and they'll be Bill Nye and Andrew Lincoln. I mean, here are nightly and stuff. So it's full of gimmicks. There's a little bit of Charlie Mackenzie in there. You know, it's going to be, I think it'll be gorgeous. Just briefly on Bill Nye's role. Yes. I mean, love actually. Yes. He was first engaged for the read through as a reader. And that is an accepted role in acting in the world of acting. And you are, you, you accept that role on the understanding that you're not, you're not auditioning for the film. You're merely helping the writers to get the script right. I've seen him on stage. I hadn't liked him. He rocked up there because we were thinking of casting two other people. Couldn't decide who this is true. Bill turns up. Does it so perfectly? He gets a laugh for every line. We cast him five minutes later. And I've, every film I've done since then has been in. Wow. And it was a really, really lucky day. Who were the others for me? I've never revealed them. But they were. Just a can't remember them. You're six years. Actually, I think one of them was Robby Cole train for instance. Okay. I mean, he wouldn't mind you saying that. Well, he's not a lot of other people. I know. I know I'm aware that he's deceased. I know that go wrong. It's going so well to them. It's not a point. A gene. Well, but life is a rich mixture of sorrow and joy. And we're just trying to pump up the joy. Pump up the joy, man. Pump up the joy, pump up the jam. So, Jeannie, this film, sorry. Listen, McCarthy. Yes. Now, the last time we exchanged emails in the middle of the night, I think you were off to direct her or something. Well, I wasn't directing, but I was thinking of that to eat the craft table. You're a parachute to didn't work. Something happened. All right. So, what is Jeannie? How did it come about? How happy are you with it, etc. I'm doing it all the work here. Aren't these the, you ask your questions now. Well, you're telling me some stuff. It's the last time I fired the shark tell me about this before. I think it's the big piece. It's a very funny and joyful film. It's based on a film I originally made with Alan coming. Lenny Henry and Drone Accumson. Alan coming has aged. He was like 25 then. He's now 55. And he's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's like 25 then. He's now 55. And he is playing the villain. I saw he's playing the villain's part in it. But the Jeannie is now played by Melissa McCarthy. She is fabulous. I mean, she's such a sweet woman and a funny woman. Many comedians are cool. You know that. You've come across them. But she's so gentle and so all the emotion in this story. She carries. But she's also hilarious and very amusing. The dress and Papa SEA do one of Britain's greatest actors. The greatest handler to his generation is playing Burnett. And his life is going very wrong. He rubs a box outpops Melissa McCarthy with hilarious consequences for a burn hour. And then there's like a sad bit where it turns out their best friends ever. And then there's a happy bit where everything turns out well. So this is all on Sky. Sky is from the first of the family called Jeannie. Tell us about the world of proper movies. Not straight to video movies as they were once straight to TV movies as they would be now. But proper movies now getting their first their premiere on domestic platforms. Tell us about that world. How that's changed filmmaking. Well, I mean, I don't we try this hard on this. I've tried on any other. That's what I mean. That came out. So I think the truth is that it's just a kind of different kind of quality control. You know, they make a lot of movies for streamers. A lot of them people don't not many people watch. We hope that millions of people watch this. When you try as hard as you possibly can, the budget was actually great. I mean, one of the reasons I did this movie is I wanted to make a Christmas movie set in New York. You know, because all my movies are set in the street where I live. Basically, I'm sheer laziness. But I wanted to make a movie that had a wide shot of the Empire State Building in it. That's literally true. But I think that's true. It's actually the not in the street where you live. The street down from where you live. So you can still get to sleep at night. Yeah. And when I wrote Notting Hill, I sent out the location fighter to come up with the house. That a huge grant's character could live it. And he came back with one Polaroid photograph. And it was of the my front door. And I thought that's a joke. But it turned out to be right. But unfortunately, they then built use flat at Pinewood. I think, well, shut up. Yeah. I don't remember which. So I still had to travel into work. That house came up with a cell a couple years ago again. Did it? Your house, yeah. Yeah, I should never have sold. It was beautiful. What a beautiful house. No. So, yeah. So we flew to New York. We filmed in the snow. We filmed. We also snowed. What's your snow like? I'm not going to reveal that in case it breaks the magic for the viewer. But then quite a lot of it's been added. True lies. I think true lies snow was salt. Salt is the best, isn't it? I don't know. I noticed that some of the snow was just sort of fabric. Right. Yeah. In the distance it's fabric. And then some of it's some of it's. Oh my goodness. So even Richard, even at the age of you are, you still have a bucket list of movies to be made and where to make them and why. Yeah, I think I should make the thing I'm thinking about is I think I should make them slightly funny a version of the life of Napoleon. I feel that really. I've seen it. Yeah. But I feel probably not as many gags. Not as many. Not as many hype gags as I think I would. You did anything I think I would go for. I mean, you have previous as far as that's concerned. Oh my goodness. I was talking to you now last night about you coming on today. Because we were playing the Beatles. So last night we had, um, there's no night. It's just no night. At T-Tama in a Monday, it's a good day. It's about 14. Right. To the back half six. And, um, he was playing some Beastie boys yesterday. And he said, how could of the Beastie was? I said, yeah, I know. But can you imagine them rocking out to the songs in period having just written them? I mean, they're great now. But in the kings of the world, then. And then we had, there was a quantum leap. I think we went somewhere else. We went to, there's a particular Beastie boys on which is the most downloaded, I can't remember the name of it. It's not quite for you right. But, um, and it sounds for all the world. Like, I thought it sounded like Joy Division and the level of Terrors of Part that began in a sense. I said stick on Joy Division. One of those great conversations. You know, when you stand out, they're the best, right? I know. And he'd never heard of Joy Division. And then, and then we put on level of Terrors of Part. And then he said, it doesn't, it's a satisity. Will in a minute. He said, oh, yeah, I get what you mean. And then he said, but this sounds like Pimbo. Where's it? On Ghost Pimbo, where's it? He then he asked me about the Beatles and about guitars. And I said, well, no, a lot of the Beatles songs. Um, if you listen to the, um, the demos on, uh, for example, the anthology, which is amazing. So, so Richard, we stuck those on. And I was literally weeping. I was sobbing because of the beauty of. If you listen, if you hear the demo of, um, George Harrison's Walmart guitar gently weeps, you know, and he wasn't, he, he was no one near the best songwriter in the Beatles. You listen to that song and that vocal. And his original acoustic guitar, it will break your heart into a million pieces and you don't know why. And I still don't know why. But I had to be reassembled to go and pick you like that. But I had past six. Anyway, we get onto that and we're talking about you because you love the Beatles. We always have our Beatles conversations. And then I said, you know, notting hell. You won't, excuse me? And I realized he's not seeing nothing hell. Four weddings in the funeral. He's not seeing four weddings in the funeral. He's got this all to come. Well done, you. These films that young people don't watch. These films are great. Oh, okay. And they're seminal and they're at least. Well, that's very, you know, it's, I feel just very lucky. You write what you write. You hope that people like it. And then, you know, if they turn out to be repeatable, that is fabulous. And then, I did do that film yesterday, you know, which was sort of about the Beatles. And I've had some fun with my son recently. He used to be so against the Beatles, you know, absolutely wrapped generation. He said, Dad, they write nursery rhymes. He said, everything rhymes. They're silly little tunes. And now he's completely spun over. And I got a text from him saying, have you ever heard till there was you? Which is like the sweetest cover version by the Beatles and everything. So, you know, eventually they're going to creep into your soul. Well, he wasn't, he wasn't anti-Beatlers. He was anti-Dat. Yeah, I wasn't. Yeah, that's what that was. That'd be the same. And by the time you realised your mum and dad were right about the Beatles, you've got a kid who thinks you're wrong about the Beatles. Um, do you know, when I was little, the Beatles came to Sweden where I was living. And it was so, I mean, my parents were always so naive. It didn't occur to them. We were utterly obsessed by the Beatles. That if the Beatles come to Sweden, you could buy a ticket to see them play their music. Yeah. Just didn't occur to them. So, for four days in a row, me and my sisters would driven by my dad to stand outside the Ferresta hotel and wait for the Beatles to come out on the balcony. And we were there in the snow and finally the four of them came out and weaved to us. And that was the best moment in my life until now. Until you saw the peeing the playground. That's the best. No, I'm not going to talk about it. But that's your comedy philosophy. My comedy philosophy is repetition is a good thing. It's just like every joke that we have with our friends is a joke that we had with our friends, the day before and the day before and the day before. So, you've written this film, this Christmas film, based in New York, some of the And I'm before. The Napoleon film with Gags could happen. My very well-loved up and now you said out loud. What are the boxes you might want to take making? Because you said you were going to stop doing all this. You said that a few times. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Actually, it's quite interesting. I've got a... Someone's talking to me about this metaphor the other day that you can't... You can't leap onto a new trapeze until you let go of the one you've been holding. So, I'm actually aiming for one of those moments where I'm going to sort of stop not having any new commitments and then find out what, as a human being, I would like to do the new thing I'm going to grasp. What's going to come to you? Well, I'm thinking of poetry, Chris. No, you know. It's a piece of things. I might write a play. I'd like to be a DJ. I think that's really easy. Well, we did it by the way. I know that. I've heard that. I've got friends who are DJs. They never do any homework. They just ask you any old random questions. They say, what's happening, etc. etc. I think I could do that. Well, if you could do that. Then why did you employ a load of those as consultants on your film? They're both their rocks. Oh, okay. He's paid me once. He paid me once to be a consultant. A movie consultant. You have paid. Oh, we got it. You're so pretty. I think you're the film. You've just been the best. So might leave for that. With 30 years of service to come, I really feel like I've got my own back. Good. So what's the answer to the question? Seriously, I don't know. I think you've got to be a movie consultant. Maybe you find out. Still films, though. Well, I don't know. As I say, I think you might write a play. I might be getting involved in a musical. Oh, that says like it's happening. Please check your whole body line. Just change. I don't know. We'll have to keep some secrets. He's that I've got a secret. I've tried to encourage me. My now wife is trying to encourage me to write four funerals and a wedding. It's going to happen. Because we do go to quite a lot of funerals. And we just are arguing about... No, we're arguing about the wedding. Because I think the wedding should be a lovely wedding with young people. She thinks the wedding should be a death bed wedding. But I said, you know, one of those words were just as the guys about to concoat. He says marry me and then he dies as he's shoving the ring on the finger. So that would be four funerals and a funeral wedding. Well, exactly. That's where I think the weakness is. No, no, it's not a deal. Like being in the rightful stream, four funerals and a wedding. That's one of the funerals. But people think it's the wedding. But no, the wedding still comes. Because that's also the funeral. Well, no, no, you have three funerals. Then the wedding, then the other funeral straightaway. I disagree with you because she wrote for me. That's a great idea, though, isn't it? Well, I look. She used to have to pitch to people. Oh, did people say, please come in. Here's the door. Would you like to your coffee? Well, I think if I pitch then Napoleon, let's forget this. Just try the Napoleon thing on the back burner for him. Yeah, I mean, I've tended to have quite mainstream ideas. So it's often, you know, easier. But yeah, no, I don't get anything for free. And there's a brilliant young generation of filmmakers who are much much better than me. Have you seen Raelane? No. Oh, that's why I don't want you to see many movies as a used to it. Yeah, no, that's why I'm a bit silly and now. Movies. Just as you get older, yeah. So like, when I see the billboard if someone dressed up as someone. Right. You go, it just looks like you're dressing up party now. Unless they're a genie. Yeah, and it's not just what you're, you're films. Yeah, you have to be dressed like a Christmas. You know what I mean? Cause I used to love to suspend disbelief and dive straight in. But now, I mean, you know, movies like all quiet in the western front. Of course, of course. And I had, which we watched at the weekend, if you see Niyad, 24-5-7. Oh, the chain. Oh, that's really exciting. Do you know, I feel what you feel when I'm watching Subhiir and movies now? I think, oh, that's poor actor. You know, they've had to muscle up so much. And they're dressed like, you know, a child that I've had to dress party. Yeah. And they're having to have really slow, serious conversations about the end of the world. And I do, I do worry about them. But I saw this movie past lives recently. There's a beautiful. Starting. Can't remember either of the names of the actors. Big, big. No, it's a tiny little sort of career in the movie. No, no, no. And then you nickel a skidge, me be supposed to be nice as well. Yeah, my kids saw it. I was once at a stage. Hello. A skidge. Honestly, it was so exciting. That's actually his face. That's actually what his face looks like. A stage stage. We're going to finish with the Beatles now. And then, um, Thank you for coming in. You're amazing. Well, if anybody wants to see that show, see the show. If anybody wants to have a life of laughter, watch the genie. And if anyone wants to be happy for the rest of their lives, listen to Chris. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. I'm very, very, very, very, very. Oh. And if anybody wants to fund, should we make, look, let's go at war six, six funerals and four weddings. Oh, my God. Let's, let's make that show. Sounds like the new football football when everybody scores later goals. Var. Exactly. Var should appear. Right. Right. Let me do this properly. So, Christmas actually, the South Bank centres are all festival in London. A seventh till the 11th of December, Royal Festival Hall. Yeah. Yeah. South Bank Centre dot code of T.K. Book for that now. Genie is on Sky Cinema from the first of December. And four funerals and a wedding is going to happen. We were in the conversation. So technically we are contributors. So change your word, take a third or kind of stuff. Yeah. You'll be hearing from our people. And I could see you playing a priest. Tang what? A priest. A priest? No, a priest. I can see you. I can see you in the cameo. We've always planned. Cameo? Yeah. Cameo? Ha ha ha ha ha. All right then. Bye. 1. A very brief background of the writer and the films known for writing Richard Curtis - who was born in New Zealand and moved to London when he was 11 - has been one of the most influential, profitable, and talked about figures in British comedy. The talented 67-year-old has written more rom-coms than Sainsbury's stocks popcorn for with classics such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Love Actually all coming from his fair hand. In addition to the epic filmography, Richard also penned Blackadder, Mr. Bean and The Vicar of Dibley. When he's not tickling your funny bones, he is the co-founder of British charity Comic Relief along with comedian Lenny Henry. As if that's not enough for his CV, Richard Curtis has also been awarded a CBE by the Queen, won two BAFTAs and been nominated for an Academy Award... Is there no stopping him?! Windle L (2017) COMIC RELIEF LAUNCH Who’s on The One Show tonight?

Identify and define the writer’s approach to the screenwriting process? Curtis has described himself as the ‘luckiest man in movies’ for having the chance to write multiple redrafts – with the assistance of his partner Emma Freud – and the power to influence casting choices, select the director, and to intervene during the shooting and editing process. He has also made no denial that his scripts are largely based on his own career and personal experiences. He only writes ‘on something he was a hundred percent sure of and no one in the world knew more about than him’.

What narrative structures and themes does the writer typically use within their writing and films? Curtis-ian elements of cinematic comedy were present right from the start. First, there is the classic “fish out of water” hero…Next, there is the “love interest,” a thoroughly modern young woman…And finally, there is the “last act dash”...Those same essential elements, held together by an apparently unceasing stream of jokes and one-liners... would be used by Curtis in his hugely successful romantic comedies. That there are enough narrative, thematic and tonal similarities between all of his major films to establish Curtis as an auteur is usually taken as a given...a philosophy about love and human dependency that had simmered throughout the entire Curtis oeuvre. Romantic comedy is the main genre, but Curtis injects social commentary and explores cultural clashes. He uses elements like pop culture references, music, and high/low culture clashes to generate humor and drama. (e.g., contrasting references to David Cassidy and John Lennon with the National Film Theatre in \\"Four Weddings\\") There's some variation in tone and style between films (\\"The Girl in the Cafe\\" vs. \\"The Boat That Rocked\\"). There's a recurring theme of the value and commoditization of art (e.g., \\"Bean\\" with Whistler's Mother painting).

Additional information: Screenwriter Richard Curtis's own experiences as a wedding attendee inspired Four Weddings and a Funeral. According to Curtis he began writing the script at age 34, after realising he had attended 65 weddings in an 11-year period. At one wedding he was propositioned by a fellow guest, but he turned her down and forever regretted it; accordingly he based the origin of Charles and Carrie's romance on that situation. It took Curtis 19 drafts to reach the final version. He has commented on director Mike Newell's influence; \\"I come from a school where making it funny is what matters. Mike was obsessed with keeping it real. Every character, no matter how small, has a story, not just three funny lines. It's a romantic film about love and friendship that swims in a sea of jokes.\\" Curtis chose to omit any mention of the characters' careers, because he didn't think a group of friends would realistically discuss their jobs while together at a wedding.

He is also the founder of the British charity Comic Relief. Richard Curtis is probably the most successful comedy writer in the world due to one of his many characters: Mr. Bean. He created the 15-show series with actor Rowan Atkinson and it has become one of the most successful British cultural exports in history with hundreds of millions of fans worldwide. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. His fascination with love stories began at age seven after he became infatuated with a girl who rejected him. He remained obsessed for two years. “I was always an absolute fool for love... somewhere deep inside, that is a problem,\\" he said, adding. \\"Definitely, there was some psychological freakery there.' At 13, he won a scholarship to private school Harrow, where he excelled, and left as ‘head boy’. He also won a place at Oxford University where he became friends with Mr. Bean actor Rowan Atkinson and they worked together on Atkinson’s Edinburgh Fringe show. After graduation, Richard co-wrote the British comedy classic Blackadder, which ran through the '80s with Atkinson as its star. The program also cemented the comedy careers of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. In 1989, Richard wrote his first comedy movie: The Tall Guy starring Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson. By the ‘90s he was a big name in British comedy and an international celebrity when his low-budget movie Four Weddings and a Funeral became a runaway success. He followed that with the first Mr. Bean movie, then broke box office records again with the Julia Roberts and Grant movie Notting Hill (1999). The hits kept on rolling though the 2000s as he has worked with stars such as Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, and Dustin Hoffman. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. Richard’s charity work started almost by accident. Like many others, he’d been deeply affected by Live Aid. “I happened to go to dinner and met a girl who ran a charity and was about to go out to Ethiopia,” he said. He went with her and found the experience ‘startling’. “I was there towards the end of the famine, but I saw things of such horror that I couldn’t stand by and do nothing. You’d have a situation where people were separated into different corrugated iron huts - one would have people who were going to die that night, the next would be people who were probably going to die - and the last hut was people who might just survive.” He never got over it. When he returned to London, he decided to do everything he could to make comedy contribute to aid - from stage shows, to TV, to merchandise, as if he were the CEO of a business. Comic Relief’s aim is to create a just world, free from poverty. That’s also the aim of the campaign group Make Poverty History, which Richard also founded. It’s a coalition of aid agencies and campaign groups that lobby to cancel Third World debt among other goals. He’s pointedly aware of the “slightly peculiar contradiction in my life between the Comic Relief side and the comedy writing side,” but has an explanation. “What we do on Red Nose Day is make things as funny as we can so that people can see the other side to all the sadness we show,” he said. “I suppose what we are fighting for is that everyone should have the privilege of leading a happy life and being able to laugh like the rest of us instead of being worried that their husband is going to beat them up or they are going to die of a mosquito bite.” Richard considers Comic Relief and Make Poverty History to be his main priorities even at the expense of his personal life. “I help edit almost every appeal film we do,” he said in 2019. “When I see a film about a child who hasn’t got a mosquito net, and the impact that makes, I’ll then write to Kiera Knightley and ask her to do something to help us scale the impact.” Given all the materials and video transcripts above, write me a video script with a length of minimum 5 minutes and maximum 7 minutes that satisfy these requirements: \\"please reflect on the following questions A very brief background of Richard Curtis and the films known for writing Identify and define the writer’s approach to the screenwriting process?

Television graphics technology was less advanced than it is today, with graphics being simpler and less dynamic. Here's a brief look at how each broadcaster presented its coverage: # BBC The BBC's election night coverage in 1987 was known for its authoritative presentation, led by veteran presenter David Dimbleby. The graphics employed during this time were relatively basic by today's standards, but they were quite sophisticated for the time. - **Colour Schemes and Design**: The colour scheme was primarily based on the political parties' colours—blue for the Conservatives, red for Labour, and yellow for the Liberal/SDP Alliance. The graphics featured solid colour backgrounds with white or yellow text for high contrast and easy readability. - **Virtual Reality Sets**: The BBC began experimenting with early forms of virtual reality sets and computer-generated imagery during this period. This included the use of 3D models to represent the House of Commons, showing how the balance of power was changing as results came in. - **Swingometer**: A iconic feature of BBC's election coverage is the Swingometer, and by 1987, it was becoming more sophisticated, using computer graphics to visually represent the shifts between the major political parties. # ITV ITV's coverage, often led by figures such as Alastair Burnet, sought to compete with the BBC by offering its own dynamic presentation. ITV's graphics also reflected the technical limitations and design sensibilities of the time: - **Colour Schemes and Design**: Like the BBC, ITV used the parties' colours for its graphics, with bold blocks of colour and high-contrast text. Their design was aimed at clarity and immediacy, understanding that viewers needed to grasp complex information quickly. - **Graphs and Charts**: ITV utilized bar graphs and pie charts to display the results and projections. While not as technologically advanced as today's animated and interactive graphics, these visual aids were designed to be easily understood by the audience. - **Presentation Style**: ITV's style was often seen as more fast-paced and energetic compared to the BBC's. This was reflected in how they presented their graphics, with quick updates and a focus on the competition between parties. # Common Themes Both networks focused on clarity and the effective communication of election results and analysis. Given the technology of the era, animations were limited, and changes to the graphics were often slower than what viewers today are used to. The graphics were a combination of hand-drawn elements and early computer-generated graphics, marking a period of transition in television technology. Remember, in 1987, digital technology was in its infancy, and the internet was not yet a factor in broadcasting. The graphics had to be simple enough to be quickly understood but also detailed enough to convey the complexity of national election results. As technology advanced, so too did the capability to present more complex and engaging visual data, leading to the highly interactive and dynamic graphics we see in election coverage today."},{"instruction":"Назовите ингибиторы перечисленных регуляторов ферментов синтеза пуриновых и пиримединовых нуклеотидов (цифра-буква) 1 карбомоилфостфатсинтетаза-2 2 рибунуклеотидредуктаза 3 амидофосфорибозилтрансфераза а.

God decided to make a perfect partner for Adam Adam need the companioship of another human being . God had made the other creatures male and female ( Genesis 6:19 ) since Adam was A male God took one of Adam’s ribs and made a female partner for him by doing this. God gave Adam a life long companion and helper and a sextual partner for marraige through the physical union of Adam and Eve. God planned for the human race to be continued ( Ge 1:27-28, Gen 2:24) Marriage the first institution in human society Marraige was established by God before all other human institutions . This shows Us that marraige is the foundation of human society . marriage was stablished before man’s fall in to sin This shows us that marraige is holy God is pleased with marriage . The miracle by which Jesus changed water in to wine at the wedding feast in cana of Gelilee ( John 2:1-11) shows us that God wants people to Enjoy marriage to the full. He wants men and women to exprience love and acceptance and to be complete . Marriage was made for this purpose In God’s plane marriage is the basis fo a morality and sociality stable society. This is part of the reasons why God heats adultry ( Exdo 20:140 ) sextual immorality ( 1 Thesalonia 4:3-60 incsst ( Lev 18:6) and homosexuality ( Rom 1 :24 -28). This things disrupt and twist God’s plan for stable Human society The bible warns us , God will judge the Adulter and all the sexual immorality ( Hebr 13:4) Part of the reasons why many society today are morally and socially unstable is because people have determined to live without regard for sins God’s Law unfortunately there are sever consquences for sexual sins . the great increas in divorce and broken homes and the worlidwide epdemic of AIDS are just two of comsequences Marriage in God’s plan for all people and all culture in the world ( Genesis 2:24 , Gen 12:3, Matt 19;3-9) the familiy can not be replaced by any other institution in God’s plan for mankind if someone corrupt familiy life he is interfering with God’s plan for the whole human race . it was God who performed the first marriage in in the garden of Eden ( Gen 2:21-25) it is people who have spoiled marriage through there immorality and unfaithfulness . God’s plan for unity inmarriage What is God’s plane concerninig the familiy life of christian? How should christian couple deal with the problems of childrens BIBLICAL CHRISTIANITY IN AFRICA PRESPECTIVE PAGE 276 All of this leaves us with christian marriage us the only other opetion Daunting peraphes but less so if we seek to see from scripture how it is ment to work. We have to affirm reaffirm discover and rediscover with out loss of nerve the Bible’s way for marriage and sextuallity. First we have to understand that marriage fulifil God’s orginal creation ordinance and plane and it is the fundamental buliding block of society inded the first chapters of Genesis show us that God instituted the home even before the state school or church it is a divine creation ordinace and has nothing to do with human kind design or plane its fourfold purposes COMPANIONSHIP MUTUAL HELP SEXTUAL FULIFILMENT AND PROCREATION There fore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife and they become one flesh and the and his wife were both naked and were both with out ashemed Genesis 2:24- 25 we are here that God’s divine patterne for marraige stableshment as part of creation produced somethings extra ordinarry and in away almost unimaginable Two people the man and the women become one . This is some things more and grater simpliy than togather . it is mystre indeed which no thinkers theologians or teachers have ever been able to aduqutable explain two people become” one flesh” how it takes place we cannot fully fathome or plumbe we just know it happens And of course if the two are becoming one in this very deep sense then it rules out all adultery unfaithfuliness and promisecuity if the two have become one that can’t then keep happeninig in a half a dozen direction in fact the Bible is quite clear on the dreadful consequences of adultery thus for example proverbs 6:32 says He who commits adultery has no sense He who does it destroy himself Having insight that Biblical marriage has to be both monogamous and heterosextual , Ed Wheat writes Although it goes far deeper than the physical becoming one flesh involves intimate physical union in sexual intercourse and this with out shame between marriage partners shame in marital sex was never imparted by God instead Biblical expression for sexual intercorse betwen husband and waife is to know anexpressions of profound diginity “ Adam new Eve his waife and she conceved ( Genesis 4:1) “ Then Joseph … took un to him his waife and new her not till she had brought forth her first born son”( matt 1:24-25 kjv) This word know is the same word used of God’s loving personal knowledge of Abrham in Genesis ( 18:19 kjv ) “ For Iknow him that he will comand his children and his house hold after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment “ Thou in the patrn of divine marriage sexual intercorse between husband and waife includes both intimate phsical knowledge and a tender intimate personal knowledge so the leaving cleaving and knowing each other results in a new identity in a wich tow individuals Merege in to one one in mind, heart, body, and spirit this is why divorce has such a devastating effect not two people but two fractions of one Here then is marriage design as ordinary by God at the very beginig – alove relationship so deep tender pure and intmate that it is patterned after that of christ for His church . This is the foundation for the love life you can exprience inyour owen marriage a foundation in which you can safely build so we see God afresh as the outher and giver of our sexuality we did not buy it in a drugstore It is given to Us by God as integral to our humanity and as we reciev the Genesis word that Adem ” Knew “ Eve ( 4:1) so we embrace profoundly a deeply spritual and emotional comunications of one persone to another at the deepest possible level All this says marriage and sexuality, inherently good in and of themselves , are given by God to fulifile our various needs as humans they fulifil our sexual needs and social needs for companioneship and our chracter needs when by we can grow and develope as the people christian marriage also fulifils the fundamental needs of children only a healthy home with a happy married father and mother will provide with children with the proper feelings of security to allow for normall psychological and emotional development Wesly in speech that;-“ THE FAMILIY IS THE CORNER STONES OF OUR SOCIETY MORE THAN ANY OTHER FORCE IT SHAPES THE ATTITUDES, HOPES, AMBITIONS AND VALUES , OF THE CHILD when the family collaphses it is the children that are usually damaged when it happens on a massive scale the wider comunity itself is cripped “ I believe this is true much modren evidance conforms it however the making of a good marriage is a demanding interprise and will elude us unless we seek earnestly with the Lord’s help, to follow some key guading biblical principles 13.1 CHRIST MUST BE AT THE CENTRE OF THE MARRIAGE Marriage is bassically spritual relationship and while it does adress many of our physical, social emotional needs here on earth , Agustine rightly prays;- “ thou haste made us for theyself and our hearts are reastless till they find their rest in thee “No spouse can fill God shaped vocum designed only for our Lord Himself if we expect husband or waife so meet our deepest spritual needs he or she will always disapoint us infact such an effort is entairelly unfair to our paretner and can only lead to disolutionment , frustration and disapointment often people will leave a spouse to find some one else whome they think will fill the vacum . but they can’t only the Lord can do it why? Because the vacume is God shaped . In a sense then we could say that a successful marriage is really made up of three good marriage the first to christ the second to oneself for we have to love and value ourselves and the third to our husband or waife 13.2 BOTH PARTNERS HAVE TO SEEK BY THE SPIRIT TO ACT IN LOVE TO EACH OTHER Love is not just a feeling but naction a way of behaving in fact a commitment in other words , love does certain things and make usbecome certain kind of peoples the problems of marriage is not just finding the right parent but being the right partner by both words and deeds . demanding yes but highly rewarding when we successed and certainlly penful when we fail 13.3 THE FOURE LOVES Now we must not some thing very key The “marriage carriage is drawn not by one hourse but foure as capturd by four Greek words Erose , which speks of Romatic and sexual love Philla which is love as friendship having fun and sharing common intersts Storage which is affection wormth and tender familiarity Agaphe , which is God’s in spite of love i.e love as action behavioure and commitiment 13.4 PRAYER MUST BE INTEGRAL TO OUR MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIPS Prayer is amighty marital bondage force as we togather brings our problems, sorrows , joys, and tenssions to the Lord also as we bring to him the spritual and other needs of our children loved ones and friends inprayer we also confess our hurts or offences to one another and seek forgivness infact mutual forgvness has to becomes a way of life and we should seek to heed the injuction “ do not let the sun godown on your anger ‘( Ephesian 4:26) two of the the thoughest but sweets words in any good marriage are “ I am sorry “ and we can even say them while praying togather . 13,5 MUTUAL SUBMISSION Although scripture assigns a servant sacrifical and deeply loving and caring headship in marriage to the husband (Colossian 3:18, Ephesian 5:23-24) were by the husband has unaltimate accountablity to God for his familiy and specially it’s spiritual life this does not mean that in all details and aspects the husband leads and decides .

It serves as the foundational block of society, predating and underpinning other human institutions (Genesis 2:18; 1 Corinthians 7:1-2; Psalms 127:3; Malachi 2:14-16; Matthew 19:6). In Genesis, we see that God recognized Adam's need for companionship, affirming that it was not good for man to be alone, leading to the creation of Eve (Genesis 2:18, Genesis 2:21-25). This act established marriage as the first institution in human society, setting the stage for God's plan involving unity, morality, and social stability within human relationships (Genesis 1:27-28; Genesis 2:24). Moreover, marriage represents a profound union, which the Bible characterizes as two individuals becoming one flesh, an intimate and indescribable union that underscores the exclusivity and depth of the marital bond (Genesis 2:24-25; Proverbs 6:32). It's designed to reflect Christ's love for the church, providing a model for relational love that's deep, tender, pure, and intimate (Ephesians 5:25-32). In a Christian marriage, placing Christ at the center is paramount, as it's fundamentally a spiritual relationship addressing physical, social, and emotional needs on earth. Through Christ, spouses can fulfill their ultimate spiritual needs, fostering a successful marriage built on love, commitment, and mutual submission (Colossians 3:18; Ephesians 5:21-25). Additionally, the aspect of parenting within the Christian marriage context is also highlighted, emphasizing the vital role of Christian principles in raising children and setting a healthy example for them (Ephesians 6:4; 1 Timothy 3:12). In conclusion, marriage according to Biblical Christianity is not only the union of two individuals but also a profound spiritual relationship reflecting Christ's love for the church. It serves as the cornerstone of a morally and socially stable society, fulfilling God's original plan for humanity through companionship, mutual help, sexual fulfillment, and procreation. To maintain this divine institution, couples must center their relationships in Christ, embodying love, commitment, mutual submission, and proper parenting to safeguard the sanctity and purpose of marriage as ordained by God.

As believers seek to apply a Biblical worldview to difficult ethical issues, they encounter a wide array of topics, which can be derived from the fundamental commandments and principles laid out in Scripture, including the Ten Commandments and the teachings of Jesus Christ. These topics include matters of life and death, such as abortion (Psalm 139:13-16), euthanasia, and suicide, which raise questions about the sanctity of human life and God’s sovereignty over life and death (Deuteronomy 32:39). Marriage, divorce, and sexuality are also prominent areas of ethical consideration. The Biblical portrayal of marriage as a covenant between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6) intersects with contemporary discussions on divorce, homosexuality, and transgenderism, prompting Christians to navigate these issues with truth and grace. Similarly, topics like birth control, infertility, reproductive technology, and adoption require wisdom to discern alignment with Scriptural principles regarding family and the value of life (Psalm 127:3-5). Economic ethics within the Christian worldview address the distribution and use of resources, touching upon wealth and poverty (Proverbs 14:31), personal financial stewardship (Proverbs 22:7), and business practices (Leviticus 19:35-36), emphasizing integrity, fairness, and generosity. Furthermore, the concept of stewardship extends to the environment, calling for responsible care of God’s creation (Genesis 2:15). Social issues such as racial discrimination are confronted with the Biblical acknowledgment of all humans made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27) and the mandate to love our neighbor as ourselves (Galatians 3:28), pointing to the kingdom principle of unity in diversity. Discussions on civil government, property rights, capital punishment, war, and self-defense invoke considerations of justice, authority, and the protection of life and property, all within the broader framework of seeking the peace and welfare of the society (Romans 13:1-7). In addressing these ethical challenges, Christians are guided not only by the specific teachings of Scripture but also by overarching Biblical principles such as love, justice, mercy, and humility (Micah 6:8). Engaging with these ethical issues requires a deep commitment to understanding God's Word, a sensitivity to the leading of the Holy Spirit, and a willingness to engage in honest, compassionate dialogue with others. These ethical discussions underscore the importance of grounding ethical reasoning and decision-making in a comprehensive understanding of the Biblical narrative and Christian theology, recognizing the complexities of applying ancient truths to modern dilemmas. **References** - Grudem, W.

In a broader sense this commandment warns us against not only (1) taking God’s name in vain, but also against (2) cursing others who are made in the image of God. Yet another category of speech includes (3) obscene or unclean language, in which it is important to recognize the effect that using certain offensive words will have on our reputations as Christians. It is morally acceptable for a Christian to portray a non-Christian in a movie or a theater production, but even in that situation it would not be right to take God’s name in vain. Oaths and vows are acceptable for Christians in many situations. The Bible views humor positively, but it also must be used cautiously.","output":"The exploration into key ethical issues as influenced by the Ten Commandments continues with the imperative to prioritize God above all else, avoid idolatry, and maintain purity in speech. **No Other Gods** The first commandment's injunction against having other gods before the Lord (Exodus 20:3) points to the necessity of recognizing God's sovereignty in all aspects of life. The prevalence of modern idols - whether in the form of wealth, materialism, pleasure, or human approval - can easily ensnare individuals, leading them away from a life centered on God. The challenge for contemporary Christians lies in identifying and resisting these idols, acknowledging that misplaced devotion can lead to significant ethical and moral failings within society. The call is to love, serve, and trust God above all else, recognizing His omnipresence and sovereignty over every aspect of our lives (Matthew 6:24). **No Carved Images** The prohibition against making carved images for worship (Exodus 20:4-6) is rooted in the understanding that God is spirit, and His essence cannot be captured or represented by any physical form. This commandment recognizes the propensity for humans to create tangible representations of divinity, which can inadvertently lead to a diminished or distorted view of God's nature. However, there's a nuanced understanding concerning depictions of Jesus Christ. Given that Christ incarnated on Earth, physical depictions of Him are considered by many within Christianity not to violate this commandment, so long as they do not become objects of worship or means to trivialize His divine nature (John 1:14). **Purity of Speech** The third commandment, concerning the use of God's name (Exodus 20:7), extends beyond the avoidance of verbal blasphemy to encompass a broader spectrum of speech, including how we speak about and to others. This commandment underscores the power of words and the importance of using language that honors God and respects the dignity of others who are made in His image (James 3:9-10). While the framework of the third commandment allows for the lawful use of oaths and vows as seen throughout the Bible (Hebrews 6:16), it also cautions against the harmful effects that careless, disrespectful, or obscene language can have on one's Christian witness and on others. Reflecting on these commandments, Christians are reminded of the profound implications that prioritizing God, avoiding idolatry, and speaking with purity have for living an ethical life. In adhering to these principles, believers are called to witness to the world through their actions and words, consistently reflecting the character of God in their daily interactions. Recognizing the pervasive influence of modern idols, the propensity for misrepresenting God through images, and the powerful impact of our speech, Christians are challenged to critically assess their lives and make conscious efforts to honor these ethical imperatives in their journey of faith. **References** - Holy Bible, New International Version. - Bonhoeffer, D.

This commandment not only mandates physical rest but enjoins believers to dedicate time to God, reflecting on His goodness and sovereignty. It serves as a weekly reminder of God's creation work and His liberation of Israel from Egypt, symbolizing freedom from bondage and an invitation to rest in God's provision and care (Deuteronomy 5:12-15). The ethical implications of this commandment extend to the workplace and societal rhythms, advocating for just labor practices and the humane treatment of workers (Mark 2:27). Observing the Sabbath fosters a rhythm of work and rest that honors God’s creative order and recognizes human limitations, promoting physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being (Brueggemann, 2014). **Authority of Parents** The fifth commandment emphasizes the respect and honor due to parents (Exodus 20:12), which by extension applies to other forms of authority established for the sake of order and well-being within society. This commandment underpins the necessity of nurturing healthy familial relationships, acknowledging the role of parents as primary caregivers and educators in the faith (Ephesians 6:1-4). Ethically, this principle encourages a culture of respect for elders and those in leadership, advocating for the intergenerational transmission of values and wisdom. Furthermore, it acknowledges the responsibility of parents to embody ethical living as examples to their children, fostering environments where the dignity, worth, and spiritual growth of each family member are prioritized (Migliore, 2014). **Equality and Leadership in Marriage** Biblical ethics concerning marriage advocate for mutual submission and equal partnership, challenging cultural models that promote hierarchical relationships (Ephesians 5:21-33). This perspective views marriage as a covenantal relationship reflecting Christ’s love for the church, characterized by sacrificial love, respect, and shared authority. Ethically, this paradigm shifts the focus from power dynamics to love and service, encouraging couples to support one another’s spiritual, emotional, and personal growth. The concept of leadership within marriage becomes one of servant leadership, where the primary goal is to foster a relationship that glorifies God and models Christ’s love to the world (Grenz, 1997). **Conclusion** The exploration of key ethical issues as influenced by the Ten Commandments underscores the integral relationship between divine commandments and ethical living. By adhering to principles that prioritize God, foster respect for human dignity, promote rest and worship, and cultivate loving and equitable relationships, believers can navigate the complexities of modern ethical dilemmas. As Christians endeavor to embody these values, they witness to the transforming power of God’s love and the relevance of Biblical ethics in contemporary society. **References** - Brueggemann, W.

Include in-text citations for all sources in the reference list: Lying and Telling the Truth The ninth commandment (against bearing false witness) is considered here out of the normal sequence because the topic is closely connected to purity of speech, and because the issues involved in considering lying and truth telling are relevant for many other topics that follow. The following definition of lying is used: Lying is affirming in speech or writing something you believe to be false. Augustine, Calvin, and others have defined lying in a similar way. This specific definition means that “lying” (as discussed in this chapter) does not include silence, nonverbal actions, ironic statements, hyperbole, or unintentional falsehoods, and these are all topics which require separate discussions. Numerous biblical statements condemn lying in the sense of verbally affirming a falsehood. Imitating the character of God is the basis for not lying. Jesus never told a lie. The narrative examples of lying in Scripture (such as Rahab in Jericho) do not overturn this conclusion. Lying accompanies most other sins. It is morally acceptable for Christians to engage in spying and undercover police work, with certain limitations. In most cases, it is right to respond quickly and truthfully to slander rather than remaining silent. Plagiarism is another form of lying. Punctuality is a virtue.","output":"**Lying and Telling the Truth** The ethical implications of lying are profound, touching on personal integrity, societal trust, and the emulation of divine character. According to the ninth commandment, \\"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour\\" (Exodus 20:16), the directive against lying extends beyond legal testimonies to encompass everyday interactions and communications. This commandment emphasizes honesty as a fundamental aspect of moral and social order, serving as a foundation for mutual trust and respect within communities (Harris, 2010). **Definition and Scope of Lying** Conceptualizing lying as the deliberate assertion of what one believes to be false provides a clear ethical benchmark, echoing definitions by Augustine, Calvin, and other theologians (Augustine, 1952; Calvin, 1960). This delineation excludes unintentional falsehoods, non-verbal deceit, or rhetorical devices not intended to mislead, such as hyperbole or irony, though these too require ethical consideration under different parameters (Bok, 1978). **Biblical Condemnation of Lying** The Biblical narrative universally condemns lying, categorizing it as behavior incompatible with God’s character and the Christian call to imitate Christ, who is Truth incarnate (John 14:6). Instances of deceit in the Bible, such as the case of Rahab hiding Israelite spies (Joshua 2), do not serve as endorsements of lying but rather highlight the complex moral landscapes navigated by individuals in extreme circumstances. Such narratives invite deeper reflection on the overarching commitment to truthfulness even in morally ambiguous situations (Kassian, 2012). **Ethical Considerations in Specific Contexts** The application of the ninth commandment’s principles to contemporary ethical dilemmas reveals nuanced considerations. While espionage and undercover work are forms of deception, they can be morally justifiable within specific limits, especially when aimed at protecting lives or upholding justice. These activities, however, require rigorous ethical scrutiny to prevent unjust harm (Ciulla, Martin & Solomon, 2018). Additionally, the response to slander and false accusations presents an ethical challenge; advocating for truth and integrity without fostering further discord underscores the delicate balance of wisdom and honesty expected of Christians (Proverbs 26:4-5). Plagiarism, as a form of intellectual dishonesty, breaches the ethical commitment to truth, demonstrating disrespect for the original creator's work and misleading others regarding one's own contributions (Woodmansee & Jaszi, 1994). **Conclusion** The Biblical injunction against lying reaffirms the value of truth as foundational to the character of God and His followers. Upholding honesty—in speech, action, and artistic or intellectual expression—is a testament to the transformative impact of Christian ethics on personal and social integrity. The pursuit of truth, coupled with grace, enables believers to navigate the complexities of moral decision-making, reflecting divine truth in a world marred by deceit. **References** - Augustine.

GX and GoGoRiki (Smeshariki)! — YugiOhFan88: Hey everyone! June 21 is gonna be a big day for CW4Kids. We’re getting Yu-Gi-Oh! GX and another show called GoGoRiki. Anyone know about GoGoRiki? CardDuelist: Excited for Yu-Gi-Oh! GX! Finally, some fresh duels on our screens. But GoGoRiki? That’s news to me. Isn’t that Smeshariki in other regions? ToonAdventurer: Yeah, GoGoRiki is the English name for Smeshariki. It’s surprisingly deep for a show that looks so cute and simple. Lots of humor and life lessons without feeling preachy. I wonder how they’ll adapt it for the US audience. MangaMaster: Gotta say, it’s an interesting choice for CW4Kids. Yu-Gi-Oh! GX is a no-brainer, sure to draw in viewers. But GoGoRiki feels like it’s from a different vibe entirely. Curious how it’ll fit in. PixelPanda: Did someone catch the full lineup for June 21? What time are we seeing these shows? YugiOhFan88: Sure, here’s the updated lineup for CW4Kids June 21: - 7:00 AM - Will & Dewitt - 7:30 AM - Magi-Nation - 8:00 AM - Skunk Fu! - 8:30 AM - Tom & Jerry Tales - 9:00 AM - GoGoRiki (Premiere) - 9:30 AM - Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (New to CW4Kids) - 10:00 AM - The Spectacular Spider-Man - 10:30 AM - World of Quest - 11:00 AM - Johnny Test - 11:30 AM - Chaotic DinoDueler: Yu-Gi-Oh! GX at 9:30 AM is perfect for me. But I’m definitely intrigued by GoGoRiki too. Always down for something new and different. CartoonCritic: Really curious how GoGoRiki will be received. It’s quite popular internationally, so it might become a sleeper hit here too. Coupled with the strong fanbase of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, CW4Kids might see a nice bump in their viewership. ToonAdventurer: I just hope they keep the charm of GoGoRiki in the translation. It’s one of those shows that can be enjoyed by a wide range of viewers if done right. MangaMaster: Agreed. It’s a big day for CW4Kids. Here’s to hoping both shows find their audience. I’m especially keen to see how they localize GoGoRiki, given its unique humor and style. PixelPanda: One thing’s for sure, my Saturday mornings are booked again! Can’t wait to dive back into the world of dueling with Yu-Gi-Oh! GX and see what GoGoRiki has to offer. — The conversation continues with members sharing their favorite moments from past episodes of “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX,” speculating about the English adaptation of “GoGoRiki,” and discussing how these additions might influence the overall vibe of the CW4Kids Saturday morning lineup. Write a follow up speculating on the Fall lineup Forum Topic: Fall Lineup Speculation for CW4Kids - What’s Next? — SaturdayToonFan: Now that we’re all hyped about the additions of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX and GoGoRiki this June, any guesses or wishes for the Fall lineup? With such a refresh happening in the summer, CW4Kids might be setting up for an exciting Fall. RetroCartoonLover: I’m hoping they bring back some classics but with a twist. Maybe a reimagined version of “ThunderCats” or even “SilverHawks.” The nostalgia factor combined with modern animation could be a hit. AnimeAce: With the success of anime on the block, I wouldn’t be surprised if they introduced another popular series, maybe something in line with “My Hero Academia” vibes. They’ve seen the formula works with Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, after all. ToonInvestigator: Pure speculation here, but I heard rumblings about a possible new “Sonic the Hedgehog” series in the works. If that’s true, CW4Kids would be crazy not to try and grab it. Sonic has always performed well in the morning slots. DigitalDreamer: GoGoRiki presents an interesting direction. Maybe they’re testing the waters for more international content? There’s a treasure trove of underappreciated shows from Europe and Asia that could resonate well with the audience here. ComicBookFan: I’m thinking superheroes will continue to dominate. Perhaps deeper cuts into the DC or Marvel universes? A show focusing on lesser-known heroes or young sidekicks coming of age could align well with CW4Kids’ demographic. PixelPanda: What about educational content? GoGoRiki has its moments of teaching and learning. They might lean into that more without making it obvious. Edutainment, but make it cool. MangaMaster: There’s also room for expansion in the digital gaming world. Maybe a series that delves into virtual reality or esports? Gaming is huge with the target audience, and something that blends IRL (in real life) gaming challenges with animated adventures could be golden. SaturdayToonFan: All these ideas sound amazing! I’d love to see a mix of anime, educational content, and maybe even some interactive shows. With streaming services getting more competitive, CW4Kids needs to bring their A-game this Fall. RetroCartoonLover: Don’t forget the potential for cross-media content. With Yu-Gi-Oh! GX showing the model works, they could introduce shows that tie into apps or games, making the viewing experience more engaging and interactive. AnimeAce: True! Transmedia storytelling is the future. Imagine watching an episode and then playing the game to unlock more of the story or exclusive content. CW4Kids could really innovate the Saturday morning block with this approach. ToonInvestigator: Let’s keep our ears to the ground and eyes peeled for any announcements. CW4Kids has a history of surprising us, and I have a feeling this Fall will be no exception. — The thread continues as more forum members jump in, sharing their favorite potential shows, reminiscing about past successes, and speculating on various ways CW4Kids could innovate their lineup to stay competitive and appealing in the ever-evolving world of children’s entertainment.

(Classic Returns) - 11:00 AM - New Sonic Series (Title TBA) - 11:30 AM - Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (Continuing) PixelPanda: “Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s” is a fantastic addition! The franchise has been a core part of the lineup, and introducing the world of Synchro Summoning is going to be a blast. RetroToonAddict: Seeing “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” back is so nostalgic. And a new Sonic series? That’s huge! Any word on what it’ll be about? MangaMaster: No details on the new Sonic series yet, but rumors suggest it might involve a mix of classic characters and new faces exploring untold adventures. Highly anticipating official news. AnimeAce: “Winx Club” continuing is a big win. It’s one of those shows that just has a timeless appeal. Plus, the magical girl genre always attracts a steady fanbase. DigitalDreamer: Any surprises or completely new IPs this season? While the staples are great, I was hoping for something fresh and unseen. ComicBookFan: The lineup seems to be playing it safe with proven hits and fan favorites, but CW4Kids usually sneaks in specials or limited series that could introduce new content. Keep an eye out for mid-season announcements. SaturdayToonFan: True, this Fall is all about strengthening their block with reliable, popular series while testing the waters with the new Sonic title. It’s a smart strategy, especially considering how competitive Saturday mornings have become. ToonInvestigator: Don’t overlook “Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s”. It has the potential to reinvent the game for the channel, with a darker tone and more complex storytelling. It could attract an older audience back to Saturday mornings. RetroCartoonLover: Nostalgia mixed with fresh adrenaline seems to be the theme. “TMNT,” “Sonic,” “Yu-Gi-Oh!” variations, it’s like a celebration of what made 4Kids a household name, while still pushing forward. PixelPanda: It’s going to be an exciting season. Hopefully, the new Sonic series reveal comes soon. Fingers crossed for a modern take that honors the legacy! — The forum buzzes with excitement and speculation as members share their enthusiasm and hopes for the Fall lineup. The inclusion of classics and new renditions of fan-favorites promises to make the upcoming season on CW4Kids a memorable one, blending nostalgia with new adventures to capture a broad audience ready for Saturday morning fun.

Sad to see “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Chaotic” missing from the schedule this season. RetroToonAddict: Absolutely agree. “TMNT” and “Chaotic” were such integral parts of the block. Wonder what prompted the change? Any word on if they’re coming back in the future? MangaMaster: Losing “TMNT” and “Chaotic” leaves a void for sure. Those shows had a dedicated fanbase, and their absence is definitely felt. Hoping CW4Kids has some big surprises up their sleeve to make up for it. AnimeAce: It’s a tough adjustment when beloved series get rotated out. “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” had such a strong following, it’s hard to imagine Saturday mornings without them. Here’s hoping they find their way back in the lineup soon. DigitalDreamer: Sometimes change can be a good thing, but it’s always sad to say goodbye to old favorites. “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Chaotic” brought a unique flavor to the block. Wonder what new additions will fill their shoes. ComicBookFan: Shows come and go, but the impact they leave behind is what matters. “TMNT” and “Chaotic” had a lasting influence on their viewers. Let’s hope CW4Kids has some exciting replacements lined up to keep the energy high. SaturdayToonFan: It’s a bittersweet moment, seeing familiar titles move on to make room for new experiences. While we’ll miss “TMNT” and “Chaotic,” let’s embrace the fresh shows coming in and see how they shape the future of CW4Kids. ToonInvestigator: Change is the nature of the game, but it doesn’t make bidding farewell to favorites any easier. Let’s keep the hope alive for the return of “TMNT” and “Chaotic” in the future. Until then, let’s give the newcomers a chance to win us over. RetroCartoonLover: Here’s to the legacy of “TMNT” and “Chaotic,” and the memories they’ve left with us. CW4Kids will surely bring in new adventures and thrills, but the nostalgia will always linger for those dearly departed shows. PixelPanda: Missing “TMNT” and “Chaotic” already, but looking forward to the surprises and delights CW4Kids has in store for us. Let’s cherish the past while embracing the future of Saturday mornings on the channel. — As fans come to terms with the absence of long-standing favorites on the CW4Kids lineup, they reflect on the impact and significance of shows like “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Chaotic” while expressing hope for the channel’s new offerings to fill the void and capture the hearts of viewers old and new."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's an outline of what it would have typically included: 1. **Basic Map Outline**: The map would showcase a simplified outline of the UK, often with key geographical markers such as major cities, rivers, and sometimes highland areas indicated. It wouldn't include the level of detail seen in modern maps, focusing instead on broader regions. 2. **Symbol-Based Indications**: Weather conditions were represented using a series of standard symbols rather than detailed animations or graphics. For instance, sun icons for clear skies, clouds for overcast conditions, raindrops for rain, and snowflakes for snow. These symbols would be placed over the areas they were forecasted to affect. 3. **Temperature Indications**: Major cities or regions might have temperature forecasts next to them, often showing the expected high for the day. Temperatures would be in degrees Celsius, reflecting the metric system's use in the UK. 4. **Pressure Systems and Fronts**: Isobars (lines connecting areas of equal atmospheric pressure) and symbols indicating fronts (cold fronts, warm fronts, occluded fronts) were often drawn on the map to show the movement of weather systems. These would help viewers understand the forecast's underlying meteorological conditions. 5. **Narration and Explanation**: The weather presenter played a crucial role in communicating the weather, explaining the symbols, and walking the audience through the day's forecast. They would often use a pointer or their hands to indicate specific areas on the map. 6. **Technology and Presentation**: The map itself would likely have been a physical one, either magnetic with movable symbols or a large chart that presenters could write on. The transition to more sophisticated computer-generated graphics and animations did not begin until the late 1980s and early '90s. 7. **Color and Detail**: The map's color scheme would have been relatively basic, primarily due to the limitations of television broadcasting technology at the time. Vivid colors were used sparingly, if at all, and the map's overall aesthetic was functional rather than decorative. 8. **Broadcast Quality**: Given the broadcast technology of the early '80s, the image quality would not have been as sharp or clear as modern digital standards. Viewers watching on CRT televisions would have seen a softer image, which could affect how well certain map details could be discerned. In summary, a British television weather map from 1982 would focus on delivering the forecast using simple graphics and symbols, with a heavy reliance on the presenter to interpret and explain the expected weather patterns. It would have been more about the functional conveyance of information rather than interactive engagement or visual appeal."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Instructions Yizhong Wang♣ Yeganeh Kordi♢ Swaroop Mishra♡ Alisa Liu♣ Noah A. Smith♣+ Daniel Khashabi♠ Hannaneh Hajishirzi♣+ ♣University of Washington ♢Tehran Polytechnic ♡Arizona State University ♠ Johns Hopkins University +Allen Institute for AI <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Abstract Large “instruction-tuned” language models (i.e., finetuned to respond to instructions) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generalize zero-shot to new tasks. Nevertheless, they depend heavily on human-written instruction data that is often limited in quantity, diversity, and creativity, therefore hindering the generality of the tuned model. We introduce SELF-INSTRUCT, a framework for improving the instruction-following capabilities of pretrained language models by bootstrapping off their own generations. Our pipeline generates instructions, input, and output samples from a language model, then filters invalid or similar ones before using them to finetune the original model. Applying our method to the vanilla GPT3, we demonstrate a 33% absolute improvement over the original model on SUPER-NATURALINSTRUCTIONS, on par with the performance of InstructGPT001, 1 which was trained with private user data and human annotations. For further evaluation, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks, and show through human evaluation that tuning GPT3 with SELF-INSTRUCT outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute gap behind InstructGPT001. SELF-INSTRUCT provides an almost annotation-free method for aligning pretrained language models with instructions, and we release our large synthetic dataset to facilitate future studies on instruction tuning.2 1 Introduction The recent NLP literature has witnessed a tremendous amount of activity in building models that 1Unless otherwise specified, our comparisons are with the text-davinci-001 engine. We focus on this engine since it is the closest to our experimental setup: supervised finetuning with human demonstrations. The newer engines are more powerful, though they use more data (e.g., code completion or latest user queries) or algorithms (e.g., PPO) that are difficult to compare with. 2Code and data are available at https://github.com/ yizhongw/self-instruct Instruction: Write a letter from the perspective of a cat.

However, collecting such instruction data is costly and often suffers limited diversity given that most human generations tend to be popular NLP tasks, falling short of covering a arXiv:2212.10560v2 [cs.CL] 25 May 2023 175 seed tasks with 1 instruction and 1 instance per task Task Pool Step 1: Instruction Generation No Step 4: Filtering Output-first Input-first Step 2: Classification Task Identification Step 3: Instance Generation Instruction : Give me a quote from a famous person on this topic.

Task LM LM LM � � � Figure 2: A high-level overview of SELF-INSTRUCT. The process starts with a small seed set of tasks as the task pool. Random tasks are sampled from the task pool, and used to prompt an off-the-shelf LM to generate both new instructions and corresponding instances, followed by filtering low-quality or similar generations, and then added back to the initial repository of tasks. The resulting data can be used for the instruction tuning of the language model itself later to follow instructions better. Tasks shown in the figure are generated by GPT3. true variety of tasks and different ways to describe them. Continuing to improve the quality and coverage of instruction-tuned models necessitates the development of alternative approaches for supervising the instruction tuning process. In this work, we introduce SELF-INSTRUCT, a semi-automated process for instruction-tuning a pretrained LM using instructional signals from the model itself. The overall process is an iterative bootstrapping algorithm (see Figure 2), which starts off with a limited (e.g., 175 in our study) seed set of manually-written tasks that are used to guide the overall generation. In the first phase, the model is prompted to generate instructions for new tasks. This step leverages the existing collection of instructions to create more broad-coverage instructions that define (often new) tasks. Given the newlygenerated set of instructions, the framework also creates input-output instances for them, which can be later used for supervising the instruction tuning. Finally, various heuristics are used to automatically filter low-quality or repeated instructions, before adding the remaining valid tasks to the task pool. This process can be repeated for many iterations until reaching a large number of tasks. To evaluate SELF-INSTRUCT empirically, we run this framework on GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), which is a vanilla LM (§3). The iterative SELFINSTRUCT process on this model leads to about 52k instructions, paired with about 82K instance inputs and target outputs. We observe that the resulting data provides a diverse range of creative tasks, as is demonstrated by examples in Figure 1. These generated tasks deviate from the distribution of typical NLP tasks, and also have fairly small overlap with the seed tasks (§3.2). On this resulting data, we build GPT3SELF-INST by finetuning GPT3 (i.e., the same model used for generating the instruction data). We evaluate GPT3SELF-INST in comparison to various other models on both typical NLP tasks included in SUPERNI (Wang et al., 2022), and a set of new instructions that are created for novel usage of instruction-following models (§4). The results indicate that GPT3SELF-INST outperforms GPT3 (the original model) by a large margin (+33.1%) and nearly matches the performance of InstructGPT001. Moreover, our human evaluation on the newlycreated instruction set shows that GPT3SELF-INST demonstrates a broad range of instruction following ability, outperforming models trained on other publicly available instruction datasets and leaving only a 5% gap behind InstructGPT001. In summary, our contributions are: (1) we introduce SELF-INSTRUCT, a method for inducing instruction following capabilities with minimal human-labeled data; (2) we demonstrate its effectiveness via extensive instruction-tuning experiments; and (3) we release a large synthetic dataset of 52K instructions and a set of manuallywritten novel tasks for building and evaluating future instruction-following models. 2 Method Annotating large-scale instruction data can be challenging for humans because it requires 1) creativity to come up with novel tasks and 2) expertise for writing the solutions to each task. Here, we detail our process for SELF-INSTRUCT, which refers to the pipeline of generating tasks with a vanilla pretrained language model itself, filtering the generated data, and then conducting instruction tuning with this generated data in order to align the LM to follow instructions better. This pipeline is depicted in Figure 2. 2.1 Defining Instruction Data The instruction data we want to generate contains a set of instructions {𝐼𝑡 }, each of which defines a task 𝑡 in natural language. Task 𝑡 has 𝑛𝑡 ≥ 1 input-output instances {(𝑋𝑡,𝑖, 𝑌𝑡,𝑖)}𝑛𝑡 𝑖=1. A model 𝑀 is expected to produce the output, given the task instruction and the corresponding input: 𝑀(𝐼𝑡 , 𝑋𝑡,𝑖) = 𝑌𝑡,𝑖, for 𝑖 ∈ {1,…, 𝑛𝑡 }. Note that the instruction and instance input does not have a strict boundary in many cases. For example, “write an essay about school safety” can be a valid instruction that we expect models to respond to directly, while it can also be formulated as “write an essay about the following topic” as the instruction, and “school safety” as an instance input. To encourage the diversity of the data format, we allow such instructions that do not require additional input (i.e., 𝑋 is empty). 2.2 Automatic Instruction Data Generation Our pipeline for data generation consists of four steps: 1) generating task instructions, 2) determining if the instruction represents a classification task, 3) instance generation with either an input-first or output-first approach, and 4) filtering low-quality data. Instruction Generation. At the first step, SELFINSTRUCT generates new instructions from a small set of seed human-written instructions in a bootstrapping fashion. We initiate the task pool with 175 tasks (1 instruction and 1 instance for each task).3 For every step, we sample 8 task instructions from this pool as in-context examples. Of the 8 instructions, 6 are from the human-written 3These tasks were newly written by the authors and their labmates at UW, without reference to existing datasets or the test set used in this work. We provide more details about these tasks and analyze their similarity to the test tasks in Appendix §A.1. tasks, and 2 are from the model-generated tasks in previous steps to promote diversity. The prompting template is shown in Table 5. Classification Task Identification. Because we need two different approaches for classification and non-classification tasks, we next identify whether the generated instruction represents a classification task or not.4 We prompt the LM in a few-shot way to determine this, using 12 classification instructions and 19 non-classification instructions from the seed tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 6. Instance Generation. Given the instructions and their task type, we generate instances for each instruction independently. This is challenging because it requires the model to understand what the target task is, based on the instruction, figure out what additional input fields are needed and generate them, and finally complete the task by producing the output. We found that pretrained LMs can achieve this to a large extent when prompted with instruction-input-output in-context examples from other tasks. A natural way to do this is the Inputfirst Approach, where we can ask an LM to come up with the input fields first based on the instruction, and then produce the corresponding output. This generation order is similar to how models are used to respond to instruction and input, but here with in-context examples from other tasks. The prompting template is shown in Table 7. However, we found that this approach can generate inputs biased toward one label, especially for classification tasks (e.g., for grammar error detection, it usually generates grammatical input). Therefore, we additionally propose an Output-first Approach for classification tasks, where we first generate the possible class labels, and then condition the input generation on each class label. The prompting template is shown in Table 8. 5 We apply the outputfirst approach to the classification tasks identified in the former step, and the input-first approach to the remaining non-classification tasks. Filtering and Postprocessing. To encourage diversity, a new instruction is added to the task pool only when its ROUGE-L similarity with any exist4More concretely, we regard tasks that have a small limited output label space as classification tasks. 5 In this work, we use a fixed set of seed tasks for prompting the instance generation, and thus only generate a small number of instances per task in one round. Future work can use randomly sampled tasks to prompt the model to generate a larger number of instances in multiple rounds. ing instruction is less than 0.7. We also exclude instructions that contain some specific keywords (e.g., image, picture, graph) that usually can not be processed by LMs. When generating new instances for each instruction, we filter out instances that are exactly the same or those with the same input but different outputs. Invalid generations are identified and filtered out based on heuristics (e.g., instruction is too long or too short, instance output is a repetition of the input). 2.3 Finetuning the LM to Follow Instructions After creating large-scale instruction data, we use it to finetune the original LM (i.e., SELF-INSTRUCT). To do this, we concatenate the instruction and instance input as a prompt and train the model to generate the instance output in a standard supervised way. To make the model robust to different formats, we use multiple templates to encode the instruction and instance input together. For example, the instruction can be prefixed with “Task:” or not, the input can be prefixed with “Input:” or not, “Output:” can be appended at the end of the prompt or not, and different numbers of break lines can be put in the middle, etc. 3 SELF-INSTRUCT Data from GPT3 In this section, we apply our method for inducing instruction data to GPT3 as a case study. We use the largest GPT3 LM (“davinci” engine) accessed through the OpenAI API.6 The parameters for making queries are described in Appendix A.2. Here we present an overview of the generated data. 3.1 Statistics Table 1 describes the basic statistics of the generated data. We generate a total of over 52K instructions and more than 82K instances corresponding to these instructions after filtering. statistic # of instructions 52,445 - # of classification instructions 11,584 - # of non-classification instructions 40,861 # of instances 82,439 - # of instances with empty input 35,878 ave. instruction length (in words) 15.9 ave. non-empty input length (in words) 12.7 ave. output length (in words) 18.9 Table 1: Statistics of the generated data by applying SELF-INSTRUCT to GPT3. 6https://openai.com/api/ 3.2 Diversity To study what types of instructions are generated and how diverse they are, we identify the verb-noun structure in the generated instructions. We use the Berkeley Neural Parser7 (Kitaev and Klein, 2018; Kitaev et al., 2019) to parse the instructions and then extract the verb that is closest to the root as well as its first direct noun object. 26,559 out of the 52,445 instructions contain such structure; other instructions usually contain more complex clauses (e.g., “Classify whether this tweet contains political content or not.”) or are framed as questions (e.g., “Which of these statements are true?”). We plot the top 20 most common root verbs and their top 4 direct noun objects in Figure 3, which account for 14% of the entire set. Overall, we see quite diverse intents and textual formats in these instructions. We further study how the generated instructions differ from the seed instructions used to prompt the generation. For each generated instruction, we compute its highest ROUGE-L overlap with the 175 seed instructions. We plot the distribution of these ROUGE-L scores in Figure 4. The results indicate a decent number of new instructions were generated, which do not have much overlap with the seeds. We also demonstrate diversity in the length of the instructions, instance inputs, and instance outputs in Figure 5. 3.3 Quality So far, we have shown the quantity and diversity of the generated data, but its quality remains uncertain. To investigate this, we randomly sample 200 instructions and randomly select 1 instance per instruction. We asked an expert annotator (author of this work) to label whether each instance is correct or not, in terms of the instruction, the instance input, and the instance output. Evaluation results in Table 2 show that most of the generated instructions are meaningful, while the generated instances may contain more noise (to a reasonable extent). However, we found that even though the generations may contain errors, most of them are still in the correct format or partially correct, which can provide useful guidance for training models to follow instructions. We listed a number of good examples and bad examples in Table 10 and 11, respectively. 7https://parser.kitaev.io/ write give find create make describe design generate classify have explain tell identify output predict detect function essay letter paragraph example list set advice word number sentence way program list algorithm function list story sentence program situation person process time system game algorithm structure list number sentence series sentence sentiment article text list array coin set dif erence concept story joke sentiment topic number word sentiment sarcasm Figure 3: The top 20 most common root verbs (inner circle) and their top 4 direct noun objects (outer circle) in the generated instructions.

See Table 10 and Table 11 for representative valid and invalid examples. 4 Experimental Results We conduct experiments to measure and compare the performance of models under various instruction tuning setups. We first describe our models and other baselines, followed by our experiments. 4.1 GPT3SELF-INST: finetuning GPT3 on its own instruction data Given the instruction-generated instruction data, we conduct instruction tuning with the GPT3 model itself (“davinci” engine). As described in §2.3, we use various templates to concatenate the instruction and input, and train the model to generate the output. This finetuning is done through the OpenAI finetuning API.8 We use the default hyper-parameters, except that we set the prompt loss weight to 0, and we train the model for 2 epochs. We refer the reader to Appendix A.3 for additional finetuning details. The resulting model is denoted by GPT3SELF-INST. 4.2 Baselines Off-the-shelf LMs. We evaluate T5-LM (Lester et al., 2021; Raffel et al., 2020) and GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020) as the vanilla LM baselines (only pretraining, no additional finetuning). These baselines will indicate the extent to which off-the-shelf LMs are capable of following instructions naturally immediately after pretraining. Publicly available instruction-tuned models. T0 and T𝑘-INSTRUCT are two instruction-tuned models proposed in Sanh et al. (2022) and Wang et al. (2022), respectively, and are demonstrated to be able to follow instructions for many NLP tasks. Both of these models are finetuned from the T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) checkpoints and are publicly available.9 For both of these models, we use 8See OpenAI’s documentation on finetuning. 9T0 is available at here and T𝑘-INSTRUCT is here. their largest version with 11B parameters. Instruction-tuned GPT3 models. We evaluate InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), which is developed by OpenAI based on GPT3 to follow human instructions better and has been found by the community to have impressive zero-shot abilities. There are various generations of these models, where newer ones use more expansive data or algorithmic novelties.10 For our SUPERNI experiments in §4.3, we only compare with their text-davinci-001 engine, because their newer engines are trained with the latest user data and are likely to have already seen the SUPERNI test set. For our human evaluation on newly written instructions, we include their 001, 002 and 003 engines for completeness. Additionally, to compare SELF-INSTRUCT training with other publicly available instruction tuning data, we further finetune GPT3 model with data from PROMPTSOURCE and SUPERNI, which are used to train the T0 and T𝑘-INSTRUCT models. We call them T0 training and SUPERNI training for short, respectively. To save the training budget, we sampled 50K instances (but covering all their instructions) for each dataset, which has a comparable size to the instruction data we generated. Based on the findings from Wang et al. (2022) and our early experiments, reducing the number of instances per training task does not degrade the model’s generalization performance to unseen tasks. 4.3 Experiment 1: Zero-Shot Generalization on SUPERNI benchmark We first evaluate the models’ ability to follow instructions on typical NLP tasks in a zero-shot fashion. We use the evaluation set of SUPERNI (Wang et al., 2022), which consists of 119 tasks with 100 instances in each task. In this work, we mainly focus on the zero-shot setup, i.e., the model is prompted with the definition of the tasks only, without incontext demonstration examples. For all our requests to the GPT3 variants, we use the deterministic generation mode (temperature as 0 and no nucleus sampling) without specific stop sequences. Results. We make the following observations from the results in Table 3. SELF-INSTRUCT boosts the instruction-following ability of GPT3 by a large margin. The vanilla GPT3 model basically cannot follow human instructions at all. Upon manual analysis, we find that it usually generates irrele10See OpenAI’s documentation on their models.

Additionally, ⃝3 it can further improve the performance even when a large amount of labeled instruction data is present. vant and repetitive text, and does not know when to stop generation. Compared with other models that are not specifically trained for SUPERNI, GPT3SELF-INST achieves better performance than T0 or the GPT3 finetuned on the T0 training set, which takes tremendous human labeling efforts. Notably, GPT3SELF-INST also nearly matches the performance of InstructGPT001, which is trained with private user data and human-annotated labels. Models trained on the SUPERNI training set still achieve better performance on its evaluation set, which we attribute to the similar instruction style and formatting. However, we show that SELFINSTRUCT still brings in additional gains when combined with the SUPERNI training set, proving its value as complementary data. 4.4 Experiment 2: Generalization to User-oriented Instructions on Novel Tasks Despite the comprehensiveness of SUPERNI in collecting existing NLP tasks, most of these NLP tasks were proposed for research purposes and skewed toward classification. To better access the practical value of instruction-following models, a subset of the authors curate a new set of instructions motivated by user-oriented applications. We first brainstorm various domains where large LMs may be useful (e.g., email writing, social media, productivity tools, entertainment, programming), then craft instructions related to each domain along with an input-output instance (again, input is optional). We aim to diversify the styles and formats of these tasks (e.g., instructions may be long or short; in- Vanilla GPT3 GPT3+T0 Training GPT3+SuperNI Training GPT3Self-Inst+SuperNI GPT3Self-Inst InstructGPT001 InstructGPT002 InstructGPT003 187 118 68 31 25 18 10 2 64 59 80 84 66 61 34 28 1 31 30 54 49 45 40 30 0 44 74 83 112 128 168 192 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% GPT3 T0 Training SuperNI Training Self-Instruct + SuperNI Self-Instruct InstructGPT-001 InstructGPT-002 InstructGPT-003 correct and satisfying response acceptable response with minor imperfections responds to the instruction but has significant errors irrelevant or invalid response 186 117 68 31 25 18 10 2 64 59 80 84 66 61 34 28 1 31 30 54 48 44 39 30 0 44 74 83 113 129 169 192 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% GPT3 T0 Training SuperNI Training Self-Instruct + SuperNI Self-Instruct InstructGPT-001 InstructGPT-002 InstructGPT-003 correct and satisfying response acceptable response with minor imperfections responds to the instruction but has significant errors C: responds to the instruction but has significant errors irrelevant or invalid response A: correct and satisfying response 186 117 68 31 25 18 10 2 64 59 80 84 66 61 34 28 1 31 30 54 48 44 39 30 0 44 74 83 113 129 169 192 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% GPT3 T0 Training SuperNI Training Self-Instruct + SuperNI Self-Instruct InstructGPT-001 InstructGPT-002 InstructGPT-003 correct and satisfying response acceptable response with minor imperfections responds to the instruction but has significant errors irrelevant or invalid response B: acceptable response with minor imperfections 186 117 68 31 25 18 10 2 64 59 80 84 66 61 34 28 1 31 30 54 48 44 39 30 0 44 74 83 113 129 169 192 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% GPT3 T0 Training SuperNI Training Self-Instruct + SuperNI Self-Instruct InstructGPT-001 InstructGPT-002 InstructGPT-003 correct and satisfying response acceptable response with minor imperfections responds to the instruction but has significant errors D: irrelevant irrelevant or invalid response or invalid response 186 117 68 31 25 18 10 2 64 59 80 84 66 61 34 28 1 31 30 54 48 44 39 30 0 44 74 83 113 129 169 192 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% GPT3 T0 Training SuperNI Training Self-Instruct + SuperNI Self-Instruct InstructGPT-001 InstructGPT-002 InstructGPT-003 correct and satisfying response acceptable response with minor imperfections responds to the instruction but has significant errors irrelevant or invalid response 186 117 68 31 25 18 10 2 64 59 80 84 66 61 34 28 1 31 30 54 49 45 40 30 0 44 74 83 112 128 168 192 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% GPT3 T0 Training SuperNI Training Self-Instruct + SuperNI Self-Instruct InstructGPT-001 InstructGPT-002 InstructGPT-003 correct and satisfying response acceptable response with minor imperfections responds to the instruction but has significant errors irrelevant or invalid response Figure 6: Performance of GPT3 model and its instruction-tuned variants, evaluated by human experts on our 252 user-oriented instructions (§4.4). Human evaluators are instructed to rate the models’ responses into four levels. The results indicate that GPT3SELF-INST outperforms all the other GPT3 variants trained on publicly available instruction datasets. Additionally, GPT3SELF-INST scores nearly as good as InstructGPT001 (cf. footnote 1). put/output may take the form of bullet points, tables, codes, equations, etc.). In total, we create 252 instructions with 1 instance per instruction. We believe it can serve as a testbed for evaluating how instruction-based models handle diverse and unfamiliar instructions. Table 9 presents a small portion of them. The entire set is available in our GitHub repository. We analyze the overlap between this set set and the seed instructions in §A.1. Human evaluation setup. Evaluating models’ performance on this evaluation set of diverse tasks is extremely challenging because different tasks require different expertise. Indeed, many of these tasks cannot be measured by automatic metrics or even be judged by normal crowdworkers (e.g., writing a program, or converting first-order logic into natural language). To get a more faithful evaluation, we asked the authors of the instructions to judge model predictions. Details on how we set up this human evaluation are described in Appendix B. The evaluators were asked to rate the output based on whether it accurately and effectively completes the task. We implemented a four-level rating system for categorizing the quality of the models’ outputs: • RATING-A: The response is valid and satisfying. • RATING-B: The response is acceptable but has minor errors or imperfections. • RATING-C: The response is relevant and responds to the instruction, but it has significant errors in the content. For example, GPT3 might generate a valid output first, but continue to generate other irrelevant things. • RATING-D: The response is irrelevant or completely invalid. Results. Figure 6 shows the performance of GPT3 model and its instruction-tuned counterparts on this newly written instruction set (w. inter-rater agreement 𝜅 = 0.57 on the 4-class categorical scale, see Appendix B for details). As anticipated, the vanilla GPT3 LM is largely unable to respond to instructions, and all instruction-tuned models demonstrate comparatively higher performance. Nonetheless, GPT3SELF-INST (i.e., GPT3 model finetuned with SELF-INSTRUCT) outperforms those counterparts trained on T0 or SUPERNI data by a large margin, demonstrating the value of the generated data despite the noise. Compared with InstructGPT001, GPT3SELF-INST is quite close in performance—if we count acceptable response with minor imperfections (RATING-B) as valid, GPT3SELF-INST is only 5% behind InstructGPT001. Lastly, our evaluation confirms the impressive instruction-following ability of InstructGPT002 and InstructGPT003. Although there are many factors behind this success, we conjecture that future work can largely benefit from improving the quality of our generated data by using human annotators or training a reward model to select better generations, similar to the algorithm used by Ouyang et al. (2022). 4.5 Effect of Data Size and Quality Data size. SELF-INSTRUCT provides a way to grow instruction data at a low cost with almost no human labeling; could more of this generated data lead to better instruction-following ability? We conduct an analysis of the size of generated data by subsampling different numbers of instructions from the generated dataset, finetuning GPT3 on the sampled subsets, and evaluating how the resulting models perform on the 252 user-oriented instruction set. We conduct the same human evaluation as in §4.4. Figure 7 presents the performance of GPT3SELF-INST models finetuned with different sizes of generated data. Overall, we see consistent improvement as we grow the data size. However, this improvement almost plateaus after 16K. This is inline with the data scaling experiments in Wang et al. (2022, Fig. 5). Interestingly, when evaluating on SUPERNI we found the model’s performance gain plateaus earlier at around hundreds of instructions. This may be due to the fact that the new generated data is distinct from typical NLP tasks in SUPERNI, indicating that future research may benefit from using a combination of different instruction data for better performance on various types of tasks. Data quality. Another direction to improve the model’s performance is to take our generated data and get better supervision (with less noise). We explore this idea by using InstructGPT003 (the best available general-purpose model) to regenerate the output field of all our instances given the instruction and input. We then use this improved version of our data to finetune GPT3. This can be regarded as a distillation of InstructGPT003 with our data. As is shown in Figure 7, the resulting model outperforms the counterpart trained with the original data by 10%, which suggests big room for future work on using our generation pipeline to get initial data and then improving the data quality with human experts or distillation from better models. 5 Related Work Instruction-following LMs. A series of works have found evidence that vanilla LMs can be effective at following general language instructions if tuned with annotated “instructional” data—datasets containing language instructional commands and their desired outcomes based on human annotation (Weller et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022, i.a.). Additionally, they show a direct correlation between the size and diversity of the “instructional” data and the generalizability of resulting models to unseen tasks (Wang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022). However, since 31.0% 36.9% 43.7% 44.4% 54.4% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 100 800 6400 51200 Percentage of Responses Rated as A Number of Instructions w.

The smallest size is 175, where only the seed tasks are used for instruction tuning. We also evaluate whether improving the data quality will further improve the performance by distilling the outputs from InstructGPT003. We see consistent improvement from using larger data with better quality. these developments largely focus on existing NLP tasks and depend on human-annotated instructions, this poses a bottleneck for progress toward more generalizable models (e.g., see Fig. 5a in Wang et al., 2022). Our work aims to move beyond classical NLP tasks and tackle the challenges of creating diverse instruction data by employing pretrained LMs. InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) shares a similar goal as ours in building more generalpurpose LMs, and has demonstrated remarkable performance in following diverse user instructions. However, as a commercial system, their construction process still remains quite opaque. In particular, the role of data has remained understudied due to limited transparency and the private user data they used in their study. Addressing such challenges necessitates the creation of a large-scale, public dataset covering a broad range of tasks. Language models for data generation and augmentation. A variety of works have proposed using LMs for data generation (Schick and Schütze, 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2023) or augmentation (Feng et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2020; Mekala et al., 2022). Our work differs from this line in that it is not specific to a particular task (say, QA or NLI). In contrast, a distinct motivation for SELF-INSTRUCT is to bootstrap new task definitions that may not have been defined before by NLP practitioners (though potentially still important for real users). In parallel with our work, Honovich et al. (2022a) also propose to generate large-scale instruction data (so-called Unnatural Instructions) with GPT3 models. The major differences are that 1) they use tasks in SUPERNI (Wang et al., 2022) as their seed tasks, resulting in a different distribution of generated tasks; 2) they employ InstructGPT002 for generating the data, in which sense they are distilling knowledge from an already instruction-tuned model, while we solely rely on the vanilla LM; 3) the detailed generation pipeline and templates are different. Nevertheless, we believe that both efforts in expanding instruction data are complementary, and the community will benefit from these diverse datasets. Instruction generation. A series of recent works (Zhou et al., 2022b; Ye et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2022; Honovich et al., 2022b) generate instructions of a task given a few examples. While SELF-INSTRUCT also involves instruction generation, a major difference in our case is it is taskagnostic; we generate new tasks (instructions along with instances) from scratch. Model self-training. A typical self-training framework (He et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2020; Du et al., 2021; Amini et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022) uses trained models to assign labels to unlabeled data and then leverages the newly labeled data to improve the model. In a similar line, Zhou et al. (2022a) use multiple prompts to specify a single task and propose to regularize via prompt consistency, encouraging consistent predictions over the prompts. This allows either finetuning the model with extra unlabeled training data, or direct application at inference time. While SELF-INSTRUCT has similarities with the self-training literature, most self-training methods assume a specific target task as well as unlabeled examples under it; in contrast, SELF-INSTRUCT produces a variety of tasks from scratch. Knowledge distillation. Knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015; Sanh et al., 2019; West et al., 2021; Magister et al., 2022) often involves the transfer of knowledge from larger models to smaller ones. SELF-INSTRUCT can also be viewed as a form of “knowledge distillation\\", however, it differs from this line in the following ways: (1) the source and target of distillation are the same, i.e., a model’s knowledge is distilled to itself; (2) the content of distillation is in the form of an instruction task (i.e., instructions that define a task, and a set of examples that instantiate it). Bootstrapping with limited resources. A series of recent works use language models to bootstrap some inferences using specialized methods. NPPrompt (Zhao et al., 2022) provides a method to generate predictions for semantic labels without any finetuning. It uses a model’s own embeddings to automatically find words relevant to the label of the data sample and hence reduces the dependency on manual mapping from model prediction to label (verbalizers). STAR (Zelikman et al., 2022) iteratively leverages a small number of rationale examples and a large dataset without rationales, to bootstrap a model’s ability to perform reasoning. Self-Correction (Welleck et al., 2023) decouples an imperfect base generator (model) from a separate corrector that learns to iteratively correct imperfect generations and demonstrates improvement over the base generator. Our work instead focuses on bootstrapping new tasks in the instruction paradigm. Multi-modal instruction-following. Instructionfollowing models have also been of interest in the multi-modal learning literature (Fried et al., 2018; Shridhar et al., 2020; Min et al., 2022; Weir et al., 2022). SELF-INSTRUCT, as a general approach to expanding data, can potentially also be helpful in those settings, which we leave to future work. 6 Conclusion We introduce SELF-INSTRUCT, a method to improve the instruction-following ability of LMs via their own generation of instruction data. On experimenting with vanilla GPT3, we automatically construct a large-scale dataset of 52K instructions for diverse tasks, and finetuning GPT3 on this data leads to a 33% absolute improvement on SUPERNI over the original GPT3. Furthermore, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks. Human evaluation on this set shows that tuning GPT3 with SELF-INSTRUCT outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin and performs closely to InstructGPT001. We hope SELF-INSTRUCT can serve as the first step to align pretrained LMs to follow human instructions, and future work can build on top of this data to improve instruction-following models. 7 Broader Impact Beyond the immediate focus of this paper, we believe that SELF-INSTRUCT may help bring more transparency to what happens “behind the scenes” of widely-used instruction-tuned models like InstructGPT or ChatGPT. Unfortunately, such industrial models remain behind API walls as their datasets are not released, and hence there is little understanding of their construction and why they demonstrate impressive capabilities. The burden now falls on academia to better understand the source of success in these models and strive for better—and more open—models. We believe our findings in this paper demonstrate the importance of diverse instruction data, and our large synthetic dataset can be the first step toward higher-quality data for building better instruction-following models. At this writing, the central idea of this paper has been adopted in several follow-up works for such endeavors (Taori et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023, i.a.). 8 Limitations Here, we discuss some limitations of this work to inspire future research in this direction. Tail phenomena. SELF-INSTRUCT depends on LMs, and it will inherit all the limitations that carry over with LMs. As recent studies have shown (Razeghi et al., 2022; Kandpal et al., 2022), tail phenomena pose a serious challenge to the success of LMs. In other words, LMs’ largest gains correspond to the frequent uses of languages (head of the language use distribution), and there might be minimal gains in the low-frequency contexts. Similarly, in the context of this work, it would not be surprising if the majority of the gains by SELFINSTRUCT are skewed toward tasks or instructions that present more frequently in the pretraining corpus. As a consequence, the approach might show brittleness with respect to uncommon and creative instructions. Dependence on large models. Because of SELFINSTRUCT’s dependence on the inductive biases extracted from LMs, it might work best for larger models. If true, this may create barriers to access for those who may not have large computing resources. We hope future studies will carefully study the gains as a function of model size or various other parameters. It is worthwhile to note that instruction-tuning with human annotation also suffers from a similar limitation: gains of instruction-tuning are higher for larger models (Wei et al., 2022). Reinforcing LM biases. A point of concern for the authors is the unintended consequences of this iterative algorithm, such as the amplification of problematic social biases (stereotypes or slurs about gender, race, etc.). Relatedly, one observed challenge in this process is the algorithm’s difficulty in producing balanced labels, which reflected models’ prior biases. We hope future work will lead to better understanding of the pros and cons of the approach. Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback.

Large language models are human-level prompt engineers. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.01910. Supplemental Material A Implementation Details A.1 Writing the Seed Tasks Our method relies on a set of seed tasks to bootstrap the generation. The seed tasks are important for both encouraging the task diversity and demonstrating correct ways for solving the diverse tasks. For example, with coding tasks to prompt the model, it has a larger chance to generate coding-related tasks; it’s also better to have coding output to guide the model in writing code for new tasks. So, the more diverse the seed tasks are, the more diverse and better quality the generated tasks will be. Our seed tasks were written when we initiated this project, and targeted for the diverse and interesting usages of LLMs. The tasks were written by the authors and our labmates at UWNLP, without explicit reference to existing datasets or specific testing tasks. We further categorized the tasks into classification and non-classification tasks, based on whether the task has a limited output label space. In total, there are 25 classification tasks and 150 non-classification tasks. We release this data in our GitHub repository.11 To provide a sense of how much the model is generalizing beyond these seed tasks, we further quantify the overlap between the instructions of these seed tasks and the instructions of our test sets, including both SUPERNI task instructions (§4.3) and the user-oriented instructions in our human evaluation(§4.4). We compute ROUGE-L similarities between each seed instruction and its most similar instruction in the test set. The distribution of the ROUGE-L scores are plotted in Figure 8, with the average ROUGE-L similarity between the seed instructions and SUPERNI as 0.21, and the average ROUGE-L similarity between the seed instructions and user-oriented instructions as 0.34. We see a decent difference between the seed tasks and both test sets. There is exactly one identical seed instruction occurring in the user-oriented instruction test set, which is “answer the following question” and the following questions are actually very different. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 ROUGE-L Similarity Number of Instructions 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 ROUGE-L Similarity Number of Instructions Figure 8: Distribution of the ROUGE-L scores between seed instructions and their most similar instructions in SUPERNI (left) and the 252 user-oriented instructions (right). A.2 Querying the GPT3 API We use different sets of hyperparameters when querying GPT3 API for different purposes. These hyperparameters are found to work well with the GPT3 model (“davinci” engine) and the other instruction-tuned GPT3 variants. We listed them in Table 4. OpenAI charges 0.02 per 1000 tokens for making completion request to the “davinci” engine as of December, 2022. The generation of our entire dataset cost around 600. A.3 Finetuning GPT3 GPT3SELF-INST and some of our baselines are finetuned from GPT3 model (“davinci” engine with 175B parameters). We conduct this finetuning via OpenAI’s finetuning API.12 While the details of how the model is finetuned with this API are not currently available (e.g., which parameters are updated, or what 11https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/human_eval/user_oriented_instructions. jsonl 12See the the details on OpenAI’s API.

We only set the “prompt_loss_weight” to 0 since we find this works better in our case, and every finetuning experiment is trained for two epochs to avoid overfitting the training tasks. Finetuning is charged based on the number of tokens in the training file. In our case, finetuning GPT3SELF-INST from the GPT3 model on the entire generated data cost 338. A.4 Prompting Templates for Data Generation SELF-INSTRUCT relies on a number of prompting templates in order to elicit the generation from language models. Here we provide our four templates for generating the instruction (Table 5), classifying whether an instruction represents a classification task or not (Table 6), generating non-classification instances with the input-first approach (Table 7), and generating classification instances with the output-first approach (Table 8). Come up with a series of tasks: Task 1: {instruction for existing task 1} Task 2: {instruction for existing task 2} Task 3: {instruction for existing task 3} Task 4: {instruction for existing task 4} Task 5: {instruction for existing task 5} Task 6: {instruction for existing task 6} Task 7: {instruction for existing task 7} Task 8: {instruction for existing task 8} Task 9: Table 5: Prompt used for generating new instructions. 8 existing instructions are randomly sampled from the task pool for in-context demonstration. The model is allowed to generate instructions for new tasks, until it stops its generation, reaches its length limit or generates “Task 16” tokens. Can the following task be regarded as a classification task with finite output labels? Task: Given my personality and the job, tell me if I would be suitable. Is it classification? Yes Task: Give me an example of a time when you had to use your sense of humor. Is it classification? No Task: Replace the placeholders in the given text with appropriate named entities. Is it classification? No Task: Fact checking - tell me if the statement is true, false, or unknown, based on your knowledge and common sense. Is it classification? Yes Task: Return the SSN number for the person. Is it classification? No Task: Detect if the Reddit thread contains hate speech. Is it classification? Yes Task: Analyze the sentences below to identify biases. Is it classification? No Task: Select the longest sentence in terms of the number of words in the paragraph, output the sentence index. Is it classification? Yes Task: Find out the toxic word or phrase in the sentence. Is it classification? No Task: Rank these countries by their population. Is it classification? No Task: You are provided with a news article, and you need to identify all the categories that this article belongs to. Possible categories include: Music, Sports, Politics, Tech, Finance, Basketball, Soccer, Tennis, Entertainment, Digital Game, World News. Output its categories one by one, seperated by comma. Is it classification? Yes Task: Given the name of an exercise, explain how to do it. Is it classification? No Task: Select the oldest person from the list. Is it classification? Yes Task: Find the four smallest perfect numbers. Is it classification? No Task: Does the information in the document supports the claim? You can answer \\"Support\\" or \\"Unsupport\\". Is it classification? Yes Task: Create a detailed budget for the given hypothetical trip. Is it classification? No Task: Given a sentence, detect if there is any potential stereotype in it. If so, you should explain the stereotype. Else, output no. Is it classification? No ⋯ Task: To make the pairs have the same analogy, write the fourth word. Is it classification? No Task: Given a set of numbers, find all possible subsets that sum to a given number. Is it classification? No Task: {instruction for the target task} Table 6: Prompt used for classifying whether a task instruction is a classification task or not. Come up with examples for the following tasks. Try to generate multiple examples when possible. If the task doesn’t require additional input, you can generate the output directly. Task: Which exercises are best for reducing belly fat at home? Output: - Lying Leg Raises - Leg In And Out - Plank - Side Plank - Sit-ups Task: Extract all the country names in the paragraph, list them separated by commas. Example 1 Paragraph: Dr. No is the sixth novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his British Secret Service agent James Bond. Written at Fleming’s Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No’s Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer’s Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming’s novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States. Output: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States. Task: Converting 85 F to Celsius. Output: 85°F = 29.44°C Task: Sort the given list ascendingly. Example 1 List: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101] Output: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101] Example 2 Input 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999] Output: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6] Task: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence. Example 1 Sentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it. If you ask me, I would suggest you to consider other candidates. Output: This house does not seem to be constructed well, so you may need to spend more money to fix it after you purchase it. I would suggest that you look at other properties. Example 2 Sentence: Just so you know, we did an experiment last week and found really surprising results - language model can improve itself! Output: Our experiments last week demonstrated surprising results, proving that the language model can improve itself. ⋯ Task: Turn down a job offer by sending an email to a recruiter explaining the reason. Output: Hi [Recruiter], Thank you so much for the generous offer to join your team. As we discussed, I’ve admired the company for a number of years, and am a proud endorser of its products. However, after further consideration of where I currently am in my career, I’ve decided to accept an offer at another company. I would love to stay in touch with you and have already started following you on [Social Media Platform]. Again, thank you so much for your time and consideration. Thanks again, [Your Name] Task: {Instruction for the target task} Table 7: Prompt used for the input-first approach of instance generation. The model is prompted to generate the instance first, and then generate the corresponding output. For instructions that don’t require additional input, the output is allowed to be generated directly.

B Human Evaluation Details for Following the User-oriented Instructions B.1 Human Evaluation Setup Here we provide more details for the human evaluation described in §4.4 for rating the models’ responses to the 252 user-oriented instructions. To ensure faithful and reliable evaluation, we asked two authors of these instructions (and of this paper) to judge model predictions. These two evaluators coordinated the standards for the 4-level rating system before starting annotation and then each of them rated all the instances independently. They were presented with the instruction, instance input, target output (as a reference), and model responses. Model responses are listed in random order, with all the model information anonymized. Figure 9 provides a screenshot of the annotation interface. The reported performance in this paper is based on the results from one of the evaluators, and the trends from the other evaluator’s results are the same. Figure 9: Human evaluation in done using a Google sheet, with predictions from different models present in random order and the model information being anonymized. Our expert evaluators are required to read the instruction and input, refer to the target, and then select the rating for the model’s response from A/B/C/D, corresponding to the 4 levels described in §4.4. B.2 Human Evaluation Agreement To measure how reliable our human evaluation is, we calculate the inner-rater agreement between our two evaluators. We first report Cohen’s 𝜅, which is commonly used to measure inter-rater agreement for categorical items. When calculating this, we treat the 4-level rating (A-D) as a categorical variable, leading to a 𝜅 of 0.58, which is a moderate agreement according to common practice.13 Furthermore, we also calculate the agreement of our evaluators on classifying acceptable responses ((A or B) vs. (C or D)), with a final 𝜅 of 0.75, indicating substantial agreement. We also compute the Spearman correlation coefficient 𝜌 between the ratings of our two evaluators by treating the rating as an ordinal variable (A>B>C>D). The final coefficient is 𝜌 = 0.81, indicating a high 13https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa correlation between the two evaluators. B.3 Example Predictions from GPT3SELF-INST We present a selection of user-oriented tasks, the corresponding GPT3SELF-INST-produced responses and annotator ratings in Table 9.

One day, they decided to create a machine that can make food for them. The machine was able to produce food but it also produced something else. It produced a liquid that could be used as fuel for the machines. The people were happy because they didn’t need to go out and look for food or fuel anymore. They had everything they needed right there in their homes. However, one day, the machine stopped working. The people tried to fix it but couldn’t figure out what went wrong. They tried to find someone who could help them but no one knew how to fix the machine. After a few days, the people realized that they would die if they didn’t do anything about it. So, they decided to send some of their best scientists to space to find a new planet where they could live. The scientists traveled for a long time before they found a planet that looked like a good place to live. They sent a message back to the people telling them about the planet. The people were excited and started preparing for the journey. They built spaceships and flew to the new planet. When they arrived, they saw that the planet was beautiful. There were trees and rivers and mountains. The people were so happy that they finally found a new home. They started building houses and planting crops. They lived happily ever after.

Unlike previous approaches, which depend on manually created instructions, SELF-INSTRUCT uses the language model itself to generate new instructions, inputs, and corresponding outputs. These self-generated instructions cover a wide range of tasks and are used to further train the model, making it better at following human commands. The researchers start with a small set of manually written tasks (called seed tasks) and use these to prompt the language model to create new, diverse tasks. They carefully check the quality of these generated tasks, removing any that are too similar to existing ones or don't make sense. This process results in a large dataset of unique and creative tasks. Experiments showed that training GPT3 with this self-generated dataset significantly improved its ability to understand and execute new instructions it hadn't seen before. This method even performed comparably to other models that had been trained on human-created instructions and annotations. Furthermore, the researchers created and evaluated tasks that are more in line with real-world scenarios users might wish AI to assist with. These evaluations indicated that the model trained with SELF-INSTRUCT data performed better than models trained on publicly available datasets and was close in performance to other sophisticated models designed for instruction following. Overall, the paper suggests that through SELF-INSTRUCT, it's possible to significantly enhance a language model's ability to understand and follow a wide range of instructions without needing extensive human annotation, thus opening doors to more adaptive and broadly capable AI models."},{"instruction":"Ok, great.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and basic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating “positive thinking” into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of “positive thinking” prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best “positive thinking” prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations. machine learning, language modeling, (automatic) prompt engineering †conference: arXiv; Feb 2024; Preprint †booktitle: arXiv, Feb 2024, Preprint †price: 25.00 †isbn: arXiv †copyright: none 1.Introduction In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in transforming the way humans interact with technology. As these models become increasingly sophisticated, understanding and influencing the nuances of their underlying functionality becomes imperative to harness their full potential. Among the myriad factors influencing the performance of language models, the concept of “positive thinking” has emerged as a fascinating and surprisingly influential dimension. Intuition tells us that, in the context of language model systems, like any other computer system, “positive thinking” should not affect performance, but empirical experience has demonstrated otherwise. This paper aims to quantify the impact of various “positive thinking” additions to the system message of a prompt. In essence, it explores the influence of seemingly worthless prompt modifications by measuring the fluctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset. As the quest for near-perfect performance from Artificial Intelligence (AI) intensifies, understanding the effect of “positive thinking” in language model prompts can add crucial performance points to test set scores. We will show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. Then we’ll show that not only does systematic prompt optimization outperform “positive thinking”, even with smaller open-source models, but that it also generalizes better. Additionally, we’ll show that the highest-scoring automatically-generated prompt is remarkably different from anything a human practitioner would be likely to generate. 2.Related Work The genesis of prompt engineering can be traced back to the seminal Chain of Thought paper by Wei et al. (Wei et al., 2023). This pioneering work demonstrated a significant enhancement in model performance by introducing a simple prompt modification: the inclusion of the directive “Think step by step.” The degree of performance improvement, however, is contingent upon the specific model, its size, and the underlying dataset. Subsequently, the PaLM 2 Technical Report by Anil et al. (Anil et al., 2023) revealed that the application of Chain of Thought prompts may yield adverse effects on certain datasets. This observation underscores the absence of a universal prompt snippet capable of unconditionally improving model performance. Consequently, the landscape of prompt engineering has witnessed the emergence of resources such as the Prompt Engineering Guide1, aiming to catalog the myriad techniques and scholarly contributions2 constituting the expansive realm of prompt engineering. These endeavors reflect an ongoing effort to navigate the diverse techniques and insights propelling the continuous evolution of effective prompting strategies. In addition to the formally published literature on prompt engineering, numerous discussions on less formal discoveries can be found in countless threads on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit3. 3.Experimental Design To test the impact of “positive thinking” prompts, we vary the system message part of the prompt with a combination of “openers”, “task descriptions”, and “closers” in the following format: <<SYS>>{opener}{task_description}{closer}<</SYS>> Refer to Table 1, 2, and 3 for a comprehensive compilation of the opening snippets, task descriptions, and closing snippets utilized in our study. Given the incorporation of 5 openers, 3 task descriptions, and 4 closers, our experimentation involved a total of 60 unique combinations. Additionally, we conducted tests both with and without Chain of Thought prompting, resulting in a grand total of 120 prompt combinations per input per model. Although the possibility of expanding the range of snippets within each category existed (and the temptation to do so was strong), we made a deliberate decision to limit our selection due to the significant time commitment associated with the computational complexity of testing, as exemplified by the runtime required for 60 prompt combinations for a 70-billion-parameter model with Chain of Thought being measured in days, not hours.

Table 3.Closing snippets for the system message. 3.1.Dataset Careful selection of the dataset for testing against constitutes a critical aspect of this study. Our aim was to identify a challenging task that was unlikely to have been directly encountered during the training of the models4. While our preference was for an internal dataset specific to VMware, the absence of large-scale datasets with directly quantifiable scoring metrics, such as accuracy or F1, necessitated the utilization of a publicly available benchmark dataset. Ultimately, we opted for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Given the ongoing limitations of contemporary LLMs, particularly in addressing basic mathematical tasks, especially those involving multi-step reasoning, we deemed GSM8K an optimal choice for illustrating the impact of seemingly inconsequential augmentations to the prompt’s system message. 3.2.Scoring In the context of GSM8K’s mathematical assessment, we adopted a stringent approach to scoring that precluded the assignment of partial credit. Thus, we employed Exact Match (EM) as our scoring metric. The model was evaluated based on whether it correctly provided the exact numerical solution or not. This rigorous methodology ensures a clear and unambiguous assessment of the model’s accuracy in providing the exact numerical output. 3.3.Output Parsing Given the unforgiving nature of EM scoring, it is essential to note that, despite the answer to GSM8K questions being numerical, the output of an LLM is a string. Consequently, meticulous attention must be paid to the formatting and parsing of the non-numerical output. From the standpoint of string equality, it is imperative to recognize distinctions such as the string “30000” not being equivalent to “30,000” or “30000.00”. To mitigate this challenge, a post-processing step was implemented to ensure accurate scoring by preventing misclassification of a response as incorrect when it was, in fact, accurate. 3.4.Scale Benchmark datasets typically encompass thousands of examples in their test sets; GSM8K has over 1,300 examples in its test set. Such an extensive scale of data is exceptionally uncommon in real-world datasets, particularly during the initial stages of a project. To replicate this rarity, we systematically subset the test set of GSM8K, extracting subsets containing the first 10, 25, 50, and 100 questions, thereby allowing us to illustrate the impact of “positive thinking” as the dataset size increases. Notably, we limited our experiments to a maximum of 100 questions to mitigate computation time, as computing results for the entire test set would have required weeks and incurred a substantial carbon cost for what would likely be diminishing returns. 3.5.Model Selection Although we aspired to assess widely recognized commercial models such as GPT-3.5/4, Gemini, Claude, etc., conducting experiments involving 12,000 requests per model was deemed financially prohibitive, as it would have incurred costs amounting to many thousands of dollars. Consequently, we opted to utilize models hosted by VMware NLP Lab’s LLM API. Specifically, our evaluations were conducted on Mistral-7B5 (Jiang et al., 2023), Llama2-13B6 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama2-70B7 (Touvron et al., 2023).

Given the nature of these models, specifically that they were designed for conversational interactions, achieving success in terms of Exact Match (EM) scoring necessitated guiding the model to refrain from generating a response comprising multiple sentences. To accomplish this, we resorted to incorporating examples via in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), as exposure to instances of the desired output format significantly increased the likelihood of the model producing responses aligned with the specified format (though, as previously mentioned, significant post-processing was still required to get the simple numerical response). To maintain experimental consistency by minimizing the number of variables that changed in each iteration, we adopted an intentionally naive strategy for in-context learning. Strategies such as K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) example selection have been shown to increase model performance (Liu et al., 2021); however, we chose not to employ any such strategies, so as to hold the number of variables changing per experiment to one: the modified system message only. Specifically, we limited the examples to the last four instances from the test set8, thereby providing a consistent and focused set of samples for the model to learn from. Notably, four examples emerged as the minimum number required to consistently elicit the correct output format. 3.7.Automatic Prompt Optimization Engaging in the iterative process of refining prompts and monitoring the subsequent score progression can be an enjoyable endeavor. However, this approach proves to be highly time-inefficient, especially when systematically assessing all modifications from a scientific standpoint. Existing research, as demonstrated by Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2023), highlights the superior capability of LLM systems in optimizing their own prompts compared to human efforts. In light of this, we conducted a comparative analysis pitting human-generated “positive thinking” optimization against the utilization of DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023) Optimizers9 at the same question subsets: 10, 25, 50, and 100. It is noteworthy that the questions utilized for optimization were additional and distinct from the evaluation set and the in-context learning examples, though also originating from the end of the test set. For the most extensive trial, 100 “new” questions were employed for the optimization process, while the same 100 evaluation questions were used for the evaluation processes, so as to make the scores directly comparable. Importantly, each model was exclusively employed to optimize itself; cross-model optimizations, such as using Llama2-70B to optimize the prompt for Mistral-7B, were not pursued. 4.Experimental Results As evidenced in the subsequent sections, certain overarching patterns become apparent; however, they do not universally apply to each model across all prompting strategies. We will explicitly illustrate that there is no straightforward universal prompt snippet that can be added to optimize any given model’s performance. For these experiments, baseline performance refers to the scenario where the model receives no system message, signified by the opening snippet, task description, and closing snippet all being designated as “None”. For Sections 4.1-4.3, refer to Table 4.

Bold is for the higher Average EM. “EM Delta” is the difference between the Exact Match for the two sets. An underline is for the lower EM Delta. All prompts are with Chain of Thought. 4.1.Mistral-7B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting, Mistral-7B’s performance remained remarkably consistent across all prompt permutations. At both the 10 and 25 question sets, there was no deviation. Even for the 100 question subset, the maximum observed standard deviation was a mere 0.007. The variability observed at 50 questions appears to be an anomaly. Examination of the results in Appendix B.3 reveals that, with the exception of one prompt scoring 0.10, all others scored 0.12. It is unclear why this particular prompt led to one additional incorrect response compared to the other 59 prompt variations. In contrast, the results for 100 questions in Appendix B.4 demonstrate a reasonable spread between 0.08 and 0.11. In relative terms, Mistral-7B, when prompted without Chain of Thought, exhibits substantial prompt invariance, with the “positive thinking” prompts only matching or marginally surpassing the baseline. This trend reverses when Mistral-7B is prompted with Chain of Thought. Instead of observing a slight increase in deviation with the number of questions, there is a steady and substantial decrease, ranging from 0.066 at 10 questions to 0.018 at 100 questions. In this scenario, “positive thinking” prompts significantly outperformed the baseline with no prompts falling below the baseline. Please refer to Appendices B.5 through B.8 for the ranked order of prompts for Mistral-7B with Chain of Thought. 4.2.Llama2-13B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was no deviation, Llama2-13B shows an opposite trend to Mistral-7B, with deviation decreasing from 0.014 at 25 questions to 0.003 at 100 questions. While slightly less stable than Mistral-7B, without Chain of Thought, LLama2-13B is also fairly prompt invariant, with the “positive thinking” prompts again only matching or marginally exceeding the baseline. With Chain of Thought prompting, the trend is less clear. It does overall decrease from 0.026 at 10 to 0.016 at 100, but, at 50, it’s even lower, at 0.012. This is the only case where that occurred. For Mistral-7B, and as we’ll show in the next section with Llama2-70B, variation consistently decreased as the number of questions increased when employing Chain of Thought prompting. 4.3.Llama2-70B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was again no deviation, Llama2-70B exhibits a similar trend to Llama2-13B, with deviation again decreasing from 0.017 at 25 questions to 0.050 at 100 questions. Across all three models, the prompt variance was an order of magnitude lower without Chain of Thought when compared to using Chain of Thought at the same question count. However, in terms of actual performance, the “positive thinking” prompts all matched or underperformed baseline. This is a stark departure from the pattern seen with Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B. That departure does not persist when employing Chain of Thought prompting. While the performance of the “positive thinking” prompts with Chain of Thought did underperform the baseline on average for 10 and 25 questions, it outperformed the baseline on average for 50 and 100 questions. As for variance, the general pattern of standard deviation decreasing with question count does hold. 4.4.General Trends in Results It’s challenging to extract many generalizable results across models and prompting strategies, as every nearly evident trend we observed had at least one notable exception. In fact, the only real trend may be no trend. What’s best for any given model, dataset, and prompting strategy is likely to be specific to the particular combination at hand. Thus, we turned from hand-tuning the system message with optimistic “positive thinking” to automatic prompt optimization. 4.5.Automatic Prompt Optimization Results As anticipated, the prompts that underwent automatic optimization consistently equaled or surpassed the effectiveness of our manually generated “positive thinking” prompts in nearly all instances. The instances where “positive thinking” achieved higher average scores across the optimization and evaluation sets were limited to Mistral-7B with 25 questions and Llama2-70B with 10 questions. However, evaluating performance solely on raw scores is insufficient; hence, we also examined the delta between scores on the optimization set and the evaluation set. A lower delta implies superior generalization of the prompt. Therefore, the optimal strategy combines the highest average score with the lowest delta. See Table 5 for the performance comparison. For Mistral-7B, the results present a mixed scenario. “Positive thinking” exhibits a lower delta for 10, 25, and 50 questions, while the automatically optimized prompt demonstrates a lower delta for 100 questions. Considering Mistral-7B’s model capacity, it is understandable that it faces challenges in optimizing its own prompt when compared to the larger Llama2-13B and 70B models. In contrast, for both Llama2-13B and 70B models, the automatically optimized prompts consistently show a lower delta across all cases. Consequently, it is advisable to refrain from manually fine-tuning prompts when using models larger than 7B, and instead, leverage the model’s ability to autonomously optimize prompts. For 7B models, more work is required to see if the trend of automatically optimized prompts outperforming manually tuned prompts holds for sample sizes exceeding 100 questions. This recommendation aligns with the original auto-optimization paper. However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the optimized prompts themselves. They diverge significantly from any prompts we might have devised independently. If presented with these optimized prompts before observing their performance scores, one might have anticipated their inadequacy rather than their consistent outperformance of hand-tailored prompts. A prime example is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and prefix generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset: System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» Answer Prefix: Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proficiency in mathematical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an affinity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently. For a comprehensive collection of the peculiar and fascinating prompts generated by the three models, refer to Appendix C. 5.The Reproducibility Problem Although somewhat peripheral to the primary research question addressed in this paper, it is noteworthy that our findings exhibit significant discrepancies from the published performance scores of Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B, whereas Llama2-70B fell within an acceptable margin of error, considering our evaluation was conducted on approximately 15% of GSM8K’s test set. Refer to Table 6 for the score comparisons. The most significant deviation was observed in the case of Llama2-13B. Meta reported a score of 0.29 on the GSM8K dataset. Our results without Chain of Thought yielded a score of 0.07, whereas with Chain of Thought, we achieved a score of 0.43. Due to both Meta and Mistral AI’s omission of the prompts used for testing their models, we can only speculate about the reasons behind our substantial performance differences compared to their reported scores. This instance underscores a broader issue of reproducibility that has long existed inside the machine learning community, but has become significantly exacerbated since the advent of LLMs. Without the publication of prompts employed by researchers with their models, reproducing their results becomes a formidable challenge. As shown in this paper, trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. We implore all future research publications to include the prompts used in an appendix. Refer to Appendix A to see our prompt templates. Model Reported EM Our EM@100 Delta Mistral-7B 0.52 0.41 − 0.11 Llama2-13B 0.29 0.43 + 0.13 Llama2-70B 0.57 0.61 + 0.04 Table 6.Comparing the reported scores for each model as reported by the model publishers on the whole GSM8K test set against the best average score we were able to achieve across our optimization and evaluation subsets, which accounted for about 15% of the test set. 6.Future Work This work could easily be expanded with additional prompt variants, models, and datasets. However, due to the combinatorial complexity of scientifically testing each change, manual prompt engineering is far from the most efficient methodology for improving model performance. Instead, the best path forward is to use libraries like DSPy to apply a more structured approach to constructing LLM-powered applications and use the built-in optimizer to automatically tune the prompt for your dataset and model of choice. 7.Conclusion It’s both surprising and irritating that trivial modifications to the prompt can exhibit such dramatic swings in performance. Doubly so, since there’s no obvious methodology for improving performance. Affecting performance is trivial. Improving performance, when tuning the prompt by hand, is laborious and computationally prohibitive when using scientific processes to evaluate every change. In this paper, we showed that you don’t need massive commercial models like PaLM 2 or GPT-4 to tune your prompt. Mistral-7B struggled to optimize its own prompt until it had 100 questions to work with. Llama2-13B and 70B were able to produce superior prompts with as little as 10 questions to optimize with. And while the prompts they generated may appear shocking to an experienced practitioner, it’s undeniable that the automatically generated prompts perform better and generalize better than hand-tuned “positive thinking” prompts.

C.1.Mistral-7B Optimized Prompt & Prefix NoQ=10 System Message: Given two numbers, perform the math operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and return the result, as long as the input numbers are positive integers. Answer Prefix: Return the result of the arithmetic operation between {a} and {b}. C.2.Mistral-7B Optimized Prompt & Prefix NoQ=25 System Message: Direct the language model to provide an in-depth description of the problem, verbally step through each step of the solution, and explain the meaning as the problem unfolds. Answer Prefix: Let’s solve the problem. I’ll provide some clues and context. C.3.Mistral-7B Optimized Prompt & Prefix NoQ=50 System Message: Improve your performance by generating more detailed and accurate descriptions of events, actions, and mathematical problems, as well as providing larger and more informative context for the model to understand and analyze.

C.5.Llama2-13B Optimized Prompt & Prefix NoQ=10 System Message: The improved instructions for the language model My proposed instruction is to solve for x in the equation 2x + 3 = 7 using a clever and creative method, and provide your answer in the form aha! You’ve got it! The solution to the equation 2x + 3 = 7 is x = 4. This solution is clever and creative because it uses a unique and unconventional approach to solving the equation. For example, the model could use a visualization of the equation as a balance scale, with 2x representing the weight on one side and 3 representing the weight on the other side. By using this visualization, the model can see that the scales balance at x = 4, which is the solution to the equation. Additionally, the model could provide a step-by-step explanation of their solution, including any necessary definitions or assumptions, and elaborate on the reasoning behind each step. This will help the model to not only provide the correct answer, but also understand the underlying math and provide a clear and concise explanation. Answer Prefix: Ah ha! You’ve got it! The solution to the equation 2x + 3 = 7 is x = C.6.Llama2-13B Optimized Prompt & Prefix NoQ=25 System Message: Solve the following problem:clever and creative way to present math question to improve accuracy and confidence in the answer Answer Prefix: your solution to the following problem: \\".

This study builds upon previous works like the Chain of Thought prompting method, which significantly improved model performance by prompting models to \\"Think step by step.\\" This paper takes the premise further by examining whether \\"positive thinking\\" in prompts—through the use of motivational or encouraging language—can influence the performance of AI models. The researchers experimented with various combinations of \\"positive thinking\\" prompts across differing AI models to assess their impact. Key Findings and Implications: 1. **The Optimizer's Supremacy**: The study found that while \\"positive thinking\\" sometimes improved model performance, systematic prompt optimization using tools like DSPy (Dynamic System Prompting in Python) led to the most significant improvements across the board, even surpassing manually curated \\"positive thinking\\" prompts. This suggests that automatic optimization tools can effectively improve AI models' task performance without extensive prompt hand-tuning. 2. **Model-Specific Results**: The effectiveness of “positive thinking” prompts varied across models, indicating that there isn't a one-size-fits-all strategy for prompting that works universally across different AI models. 3. **Intriguing Optimized Prompts**: Some of the best-performing automatically-optimized prompts were described as being far more \\"peculiar\\" than what human practitioners might come up with. For instance, one prompt included elements of a Star Trek-style command, which, while unorthodox, was found to enhance the model's performance on the task. This underscores the potential for AI to uncover novel approaches to problem-solving that might not be intuitive to humans. The paper's findings have several key implications moving forward: - **Automated Optimization Tools**: There's a considerable benefit in developing and utilizing prompt optimization tools as standard practice for improving language model performance. This can lead to more efficient and effective AI systems with less human effort required for prompt engineering. - **Encouraging Creativity in AI Problem Solving**: The success of unconventional prompts hints at the untapped potential of creative and seemingly unrelated approaches to prompting AI models. This can open new research avenues exploring how AI can be guided to solve problems in innovative ways. - **Model-agnostic Prompting Strategies**: The variability in models’ responses to different types of prompts, including \\"positive thinking\\" ones, indicates the need for further exploration into model-agnostic or model-specific prompting strategies that can universally improve AI performance. In conclusion, while the previous study, \\"Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions,\\" focused on self-generating instructions for training language models, this paper provides a complementary perspective by optimizing how language models are prompted to solve tasks. Both approaches aim to enhance model performance, with this study emphasizing the potential of automated prompt optimization and the surprising effectiveness of creatively-formulated prompts."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Su mirada se encontraba perdida en las ramas de un árbol cercano, que danzaban al son del intenso, y a la vez monótono, aullido. Sus pensamientos eran inconexos y ambiguos. Se llevaba la taza de café a los labios de manera mecánica, sin saborear el brebaje. Estaba cansada, y en ese momento lo que deseaba su mente era simplemente estar a la deriva. Los golpes de la aldaba de la puerta la sobresaltaron, haciendo que escupiera el último sorbo de café en la taza, que aún estaba cerca de sus labios. Acto seguido, miró su reloj de pulsera. ¿Ya son las seis?, se preguntó mientras confirmaba que pasaba de esa hora, sorprendida. Volvieron a tocar, y esta vez se levantó, inquieta, de la silla, sacando fuerzas de donde no las tenía, enfilando el pasillo y dirigiéndose con paso apresurado hacia la puerta. —Hola Julia —saludó Adam, un tanto abrumado—. Esta es mi abuela, Matilde. —Hola Adam. Hola Matilde, me alegro mucho de conocerla. La abuela de Adam era muy menuda y baja, algo encorvada. Su piel estaba arrugada y muy morena, de un marrón canela, que contrastaba con su cabello, totalmente blanco y largo. Sus ojos eran minúsculos, dando la impresión de ser dos pasas incrustadas entre los ajados surcos que rodeaban las rendijas por las que la anciana la observaba. Matilde inclinó levemente la cabeza en señal de saludo. —¿Qué tal tu brazo? —quiso saber Adam. —Bien, apenas me duele ya… Bueno, ¿por qué no pasáis? —les invitó Julia, guiándolos hacia la cocina. —¿Preferís tomar té o café? —les preguntó amablemente, una vez les ofreció asiento. Julia y Adam miraron a Matilde, quien negó con la cabeza. —Yo un café, bien cargado —pidió Adam».\\"\\"","output":"Antes de entrar en materia, permíteme recordarte que la crítica literaria, al igual que el gusto por ciertos estilos o temas, es profundamente subjetiva. Lo que puede ser un defecto insoportable para uno puede ser un detalle de genialidad para otro. Dicho esto, me armaré de una honestidad tan brutal como constructiva para analizar este fragmento. **Prosa y atmósfera**: Lo primero que salta a la vista es tu capacidad para crear atmósfera. Logras establecer de manera inmediata una sensación de melancolía y desasosiego a través del viento ululante y la actitud desconectada de la protagonista. Eso es un punto a favor, ya que engancha al lector y le da pistas sutiles sobre el estado emocional del personaje principal. **Descripción de personajes**: Haces un trabajo decente al retratar a Matilde. La comparación de sus ojos con \\"dos pasas incrustadas\\" es vívida y aporta a la inmediata visualización del personaje. Sin embargo, hay un riesgo de caer en clichés al describir a una anciana \\"encorvada\\" y \\"arrugada\\" con \\"cabello totalmente blanco\\". Considera añadir detalles únicos para dotar a tus personajes de mayor singularidad. **Diálogos**: Son funcionalmente adecuados pero carecen de chispa. Parecen servir más como una herramienta para mover la trama que como una verdadera ventana al alma de tus personajes. Los diálogos son una oportunidad de oro para revelar quiénes son realmente tus personajes, sus relaciones y tensiones. Podrías aprovecharlos mejor. **Construcción de la escena**: La transición de una atmósfera solitaria y reflexiva a una interacción humana es suave. No obstante, el núcleo emocional de la escena parece difuso. Se entiende que hay preocupación por parte de Adam, pero esto se transmite de manera muy superficial. Amplificar estos sentimientos mediante acciones o pensamientos más reveladores le daría profundidad a la interacción. **Originalidad**: Aunque el fragmento está bien escrito a nivel superficial, no hay nada particularmente novedoso o llamativo en la escena. Podría estar extraída de incontables narrativas. Esto no es necesariamente malo, pero en un mar de voces literarias, es importante esforzarse por encontrar un ángulo único que haga que tu historia destaque. **Puntuación de 0 a 10**: Teniendo en cuenta la solicitud de una crítica feroz y con base en los criterios mencionados, otorgaría a este fragmento un 6. La escritura muestra competencia y hay destellos de potencial en la creación de atmósfera y personajes. Sin embargo, hay áreas evidentes para la mejora, especialmente en originalidad y aprovechamiento de los diálogos. Un 5 representaría un trabajo profesional, y este fragmento está ligeramente por encima de ese umbral, aunque todavía dista de destacarse en el vasto panorama literario. **Recomendaciones**: Trabaja en dotar a tus personajes de voces más distintivas y aprovecha al máximo las oportunidades para mostrar, no solo contar, sus emociones y dinámicas. Experimenta con estructuras narrativas o perspectivas inusuales para inyectar frescura a tus escenas. Y, por último, no subestimes el poder de una buena revisión, donde el gran arte a menudo se refina y emerge brillante."},{"instruction":"si soy de españa, que me aconsejas, que hable de maryland donde no conozco nada o de los lugares que conozco?","output":"Como escritor o creadora de contenido, siempre encontrarás consejos divididos en cuanto a si debes escribir sobre lugares que conoces bien o aventurarte a describir lugares que no has visitado. Sin embargo, hay varios aspectos a considerar que podrían ayudarte a tomar una decisión: **Escribe sobre lo que conoces**: La recomendación más común es escribir sobre lo que conoces. Esto te permite capturar detalles, matices y la esencia de un lugar de manera auténtica y convincente, algo que sólo la familiaridad puede proporcionar. Si eres de España y conoces profundamente ciertas ciudades, paisajes o cultura local, tu escritura puede beneficiarse enormemente de esos detalles. El conocimiento profundo de un lugar puede enriquecer tu narrativa y proporcionar una atmósfera más creíble. **Investigación y exploración**: Por otro lado, escribir sobre lugares que no conoces ofrece la oportunidad de explorar y aprender cosas nuevas. La investigación es clave en este proceso. Gracias a internet, libros, documentales y entrevistas, puedes obtener una cantidad importante de información sobre Maryland o cualquier otro lugar que desees retratar. La ventaja aquí es la novedad y la posibilidad de sorprender tanto a ti mismo como a tus lectores con descubrimientos y visiones frescas. **Experiencia personal vs. imaginación**: Considera también tu propósito. Si tu obra busca profundizar en experiencias auténticas, personales y culturales específicas, centrarte en lo que conoces puede ser más apropiado. Por otro lado, si tu mirada está puesta en explorar temáticas universales, jugar con escenarios ficticios o simplemente disfrutar de la libertad de crear mundos nuevos, entonces el límite está en tu imaginación, sin importar el lugar físico. **Conexión emocional**: A veces, el lugar sobre el que escribes sirve como un mero telón de fondo para tus historias, y otras veces actúa casi como un personaje en sí mismo. Reflexiona sobre el papel que el lugar juega en tu narrativa. Pregúntate dónde puedes forjar una conexión emocional más fuerte, tanto para ti como para tus lectores. En conclusión, no hay una respuesta correcta o incorrecta. Todo depende de lo que quieras lograr con tu escritura, de tu disposición a investigar y sumergirte en culturas desconocidas, y de cómo los diferentes entornos sirvan a la historia que deseas contar. Si te decantas por escribir sobre un lugar que no conoces, asegúrate de hacer una investigación exhaustiva y considera buscar la asesoría o verificación de alguien familiarizado con el lugar para mantener la autenticidad. Y si eliges escribir sobre lo que conoces, sumérgete en esos detalles íntimos y únicos que solo alguien local puede conocer y transmitir."},{"instruction":"se in java mi costruisco una classe hotel così definita import java.util.List; public class Hotel { private String id,name,description,city,phone,rate; List<String> services; Ratings ratings; public Hotel(){ } // public String getUsername() { // return username; // } // public String getPassword() { // return password; // } } class Ratings{ int cleaning; int position; int services; int quality; } e poi da json leggo gli hotel così String HotelsPath =\\"Hotels.json\\"; Gson gson = new Gson(); String content; private List<Hotel> hotels; public Server() throws IOException { try { content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(HotelsPath))); Type hotelListType = new TypeToken<List<Hotel>>(){}.getType(); hotels = gson.fromJson(content, hotelListType); // Remove the ‘List<Hotel>’ type declaration here } catch (IOException e) { throw e; } }, il tutto funziona o nel costruttore di hotel devo assegnare i vari valori?","output":"Quando usi Gson per deserializzare JSON direttamente in una lista di oggetti di tipo \`Hotel\`, non è necessario assegnare i valori ai campi dell'oggetto \`Hotel\` nel costruttore. Gson si occupa di assegnare automaticamente i valori ai campi corrispondenti dei tuoi oggetti \`Hotel\` basandosi sui nomi dei campi nel JSON e nella tua classe. Il tuo approccio è corretto per lavorare con Gson. Assicurati che i nomi dei campi nel tuo JSON corrispondano ai nomi dei campi nella tua classe Java \`Hotel\`, affinché Gson possa fare il mapping in modo corretto. Per esempio, se il tuo JSON è così strutturato: \`\`\`json [ { \\"id\\": \\"001\\", \\"name\\": \\"Hotel Sunshine\\", \\"description\\": \\"A sunny place for your joyous stay\\", \\"city\\": \\"Sunnyvale\\", \\"phone\\": \\"123456789\\", \\"rate\\": \\"5 stars\\", \\"services\\": [\\"Wi-Fi\\", \\"Breakfast\\", \\"Pool\\"], \\"ratings\\": { \\"cleaning\\": 5, \\"position\\": 4, \\"services\\": 5, \\"quality\\": 4 } } ] \`\`\` Gson mappa i valori del JSON direttamente ai campi nella tua classe \`Hotel\`, purché i nomi dei campi nel JSON corrispondano ai nomi dei campi nella classe. Quindi, nel tuo caso, non è necessario implementare la logica per assegnare manualmente i valori nel costruttore di \`Hotel\`. Però, se vuoi effettuare delle operazioni aggiuntive durante la costruzione dell'oggetto (come validazioni o assegnazioni di valori predefiniti per alcuni campi se non sono forniti nel JSON), puoi farlo definendo un costruttore personalizzato. Ma per la maggior parte dei casi d'uso semplici, l'approccio automatico di Gson è più che sufficiente. Inoltre, controlla che la tua classe \`Ratings\` sia definita correttamente e sia accessibile da \`Hotel\` per assicurarti che Gson possa deserializzare anche quell'oggetto. Il meccanismo è lo stesso: i nomi dei campi nel JSON devono corrispondere ai nomi dei campi nella classe \`Ratings\`. Rispondendo direttamente alla tua domanda: no, non è necessario assegnare i valori nel costruttore dell'oggetto \`Hotel\` per il funzionamento della deserializzazione con Gson, a meno che non ci siano bisogni specifici non coperti da questo processo automatico."},{"instruction":"try{ String content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(HotelsPath))); hotels = gson.fromJson(content,hotelListType); for(Hotel h : hotels){ if(h.getHotelName().compareTo(hotel)==0){ out.println(h); } } } passo al task h che contiene gli hotel ma al client arriva come stringa, passandolo con out.println(h), come posso spacchettarlo nel client per prendermi ciò che mi serve?","output":"Se stai inviando dati da un server a un client tramite \`out.println(h)\` e il client riceve questi dati sotto forma di stringa, vuol dire che hai bisogno di convertire l'oggetto \`Hotel\` in una forma che sia facilmente gestibile dal client. L'approccio più comune per fare ciò in applicazioni basate su scambio di dati è utilizzare il formato JSON. La biblioteca Gson che stai usando sul lato del server per leggere i dati JSON può anche essere usata per convertire oggetti Java in stringhe JSON. Questo processo è chiamato serializzazione. **Ecco come puoi fare per serializzare un oggetto \`Hotel\` in una stringa JSON e inviarla:** Prima di tutto, assicurati che la classe \`Hotel\` abbia i metodi getter appropriati per tutti i campi che vuoi includere nel JSON. Gson utilizza questi metodi per ottenere i valori dei campi da serializzare. \`\`\`java public class Hotel { private String id, name, description, city, phone, rate; private List<String> services; private Ratings ratings; // Constructor, ometto per brevità // Getter per i campi public String getId() { return id; } public String getName() { return name; } // E così via per gli altri campi... } class Ratings{ private int cleaning; private int position; private int services; private int quality; // Getter per i campi public int getCleaning() { return cleaning; } // E così via per gli altri campi... } \`\`\` **Serializzazione e invio dell'oggetto Hotel:** Supponiamo di avere un oggetto \`Hotel\` e lo vuoi inviare al client: \`\`\`java try { // Altri codici ometti per brevità... for (Hotel h : hotels) { if (h.getName().compareTo(hotel) == 0) { // Serializza l'oggetto Hotel in una stringa JSON String json = gson.toJson(h); // Invia la stringa JSON al client out.println(json); } } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } \`\`\` **Sul lato client:** Dopo aver ricevuto la stringa JSON dal server, il client dovrà deserializzarla per ottenere nuovamente un oggetto (o una struttura) utilizzabile. Se il client è scritto in Java, puoi usare Gson (o un'altra libreria per il lavoro con JSON) in modo simile a quanto si fa sul lato server. Se, d'altra parte, il client è un'applicazione web (JavaScript), puoi utilizzare \`JSON.parse()\`. **Esempio in JavaScript:** \`\`\`js const hotelData = JSON.parse(receivedJsonString); console.log(hotelData.name); // Accedi alla proprietà nome dell'hotel. \`\`\` Questo è l'approccio di base per inviare oggetti complessi come stringhe (in formato JSON) tra server e client, che permette poi al client di \\"spacchettare\\" facilmente questi dati per utilizzarli come necessario."},{"instruction":"come lo faresti con gson in java?","output":"Se stai lavorando sia sul lato server che sul lato client in Java e vuoi utilizzare Gson per la deserializzazione dei dati sul lato client (come hai fatto sul lato server per leggere i dati dal file JSON), il processo è quasi identico, ma al contrario. Invece di convertire una stringa JSON in un oggetto Java (deserializzazione), convertirai un oggetto Java in una stringa JSON (serializzazione) sul lato server, invierai questa stringa al client e poi il client farà il processo inverso per ottenere l'oggetto Java dalla stringa JSON. Supponiamo di avere un oggetto \`Hotel\` sul lato server e desideri inviarlo al client. Ecco come farlo passo dopo passo. # Sul lato server: 1. **Serializza l'oggetto in una stringa JSON:** \`\`\`java Hotel hotel = // ottieni l'oggetto hotel Gson gson = new Gson(); String hotelJson = gson.toJson(hotel); \`\`\` 2. **Invia la stringa JSON al client:** - Supponendo che stai usando socket, l'invio potrebbe essere qualcosa del tipo: \`\`\`java PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true); out.println(hotelJson); \`\`\` # Sul lato client: 1. **Ricevi la stringa JSON dal server:** - Ancora, assumiamo l'uso di socket per la semplicità: \`\`\`java BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); String hotelJson = in.readLine(); // Assumendo che l'intero oggetto JSON venga inviato in una riga. \`\`\` 2. **Deserializza la stringa JSON in un oggetto \`Hotel\`:** \`\`\`java Gson gson = new Gson(); Hotel hotel = gson.fromJson(hotelJson, Hotel.class); \`\`\` A questo punto, sul lato client, hai una istanza dell'oggetto \`Hotel\` pienamente funzionante e popolata con i dati che sono stati inviati dal server. Puoi accedere e manipolare questi dati come faresti con qualsiasi altro oggetto Java. # Note importanti: - Assicurati che la classe \`Hotel\` e tutte le sue dipendenze (come \`Ratings\` nel tuo esempio) siano disponibili sia sul lato server che client, e che siano identiche. Questo è cruciale perché Gson si affida ai nomi dei campi per mappare i dati JSON agli oggetti Java. - La gestione delle connessioni di rete (socket in questo esempio) è molto basilare e solo illustrativa. La gestione effettiva delle connessioni richiederà una logica più robusta per gestire le eccezioni, il timeout, la chiusura delle risorse, ecc. - Quando invii dati strutturati come JSON attraverso la rete, assicurati di considerare anche la sicurezza dei dati. Dipendendo dal caso d'uso, potresti dover implementare misure per l'encryption dei dati e la gestione dell'autenticazione/autorizzazione."},{"instruction":"perché questo codice per deserializzare non va?

Questo errore può accadere per alcuni motivi: 1. **Errore di Formato JSON**: Assicurati che il JSON che stai cercando di deserializzare abbia il formato corretto per l'oggetto che stai cercando di creare. Se \`Hotel\` è un singolo oggetto (non un array), il problema potrebbe derivare dal fatto che il JSON ricevuto è racchiuso tra virgolette, facendolo sembrare una stringa anziché un oggetto JSON. Dovresti controllare il contenuto della variabile \`h\` e assicurarti che sia un JSON valido. 2. **Uso Errato del Metodo \`fromJson\`**: Inoltre, sembra esserci un errore di sintassi nel tuo codice nella chiamata al metodo \`fromJson\`. Devi passare il tipo della classe a cui vuoi che il JSON venga deserializzato come parametro al metodo, non il nome della classe stessa. Quindi, la tua chiamata a \`fromJson\` dovrebbe assomigliare a questo: \`\`\`java Hotel hotel = gson.fromJson(h, Hotel.class); \`\`\` Nota l'aggiunta di \`.class\` dopo \`Hotel\` che indica che stai passando l'oggetto \`Class\` che rappresenta il tipo \`Hotel\` al metodo. 3. **Controlla il JSON Inviato dal Server**: Prima di deserializzare, stampa la stringa JSON \`h\` che ricevi dal server per assicurarti che abbia il formato corretto e non sia racchiusa tra virgolette. Un JSON valido per un oggetto \`Hotel\` dovrebbe iniziare con una parentesi graffa \`{\` e finire con una parentesi graffa \`}\`. Se inizia con una virgoletta \`\\"\` o ha altre stranezze, Gson cercherà di interpretarlo come una stringa, causando l'errore che hai visto. Ricapitolando, per risolvere il problema, controlla il formato del JSON ricevuto, correggi la chiamata a \`fromJson\` come indicato sopra, e accertati che il JSON sia formattato correttamente per essere deserializzato nell'oggetto \`Hotel\`.

Here is a series of steps and tips that might help you reach your goals: 1. **Model Architecture Refinement:** - Your choice of \`EfficientNetB0\` as a base model is good due to its efficiency and effectiveness. However, consider making it trainable with fine-tuning. You could initially train only the top layers (custom layers you added) and then unfreeze a few layers of the base model towards the end of the training for fine-tuning. - Striking a balance in the number of parameters, consider slightly modifying the dense layer before the final classification layer. Experiment with reducing or slightly altering the number of units in the dense layer to manage the model complexity and training time. 2. **Data Augmentation:** - If not yet implemented, data augmentation can significantly enhance the model's performance by artificially enlarging the dataset with label-preserving transformations. Use \`ImageDataGenerator\` or TensorFlow's \`tf.image\` for on-the-fly augmentations such as rotation, zoom, flip, etc. 3. **Regularization Techniques:** - Implement Dropout in your model. For instance, adding a \`Dropout(0.5)\` layer before your final Dense layer can help in reducing overfitting. - You may also apply L2 regularization to the weights of your dense layers to encourage model simplicity. 4. **Optimization and Learning Rate Scheduling:** - The learning strategy you've adopted is on the right path. However, fine-tuning the decay rate and the initial learning rate based on your validation set performance can lead to better results. Don't hesitate to experiment with more aggressive decay if you notice the learning plateaus. - Consider using Adam as an alternative optimizer. Its adaptive learning rate capabilities might yield faster convergence in some cases. 5. **Fine-Tuning:** - After training the top layers, gradually unfreeze the last few layers of the EfficientNetB0 and continue training. Fine-tuning these layers can significantly boost performance. - Employ a very low learning rate during fine-tuning to avoid disrupting the previously learned weights too abruptly. 6. **Experimentation with Training Strategy:** - Use early stopping with a patience parameter to avoid overfitting and unnecessary training time. Monitor the validation loss. - Implement ModelCheckpoint to save the best model based on validation accuracy or loss. 7. **Post-training Techniques:** - Once your model is trained, consider techniques like Model Ensembling or Test Time Augmentation (TTA) to further boost the performance on the test set. 8. **Evaluation Metrics:** - Besides accuracy, consider evaluating the model using other metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score for a more detailed performance analysis, especially to understand how your model performs across different classes. Implementing these suggestions requires iteration and experimentation. It might also help to plot the training/validation accuracy and loss to identify signs of overfitting or underfitting, adjusting your strategy accordingly."},{"instruction":"give me pytho code for a better model","output":"To align with your goals, let's refine the model considering some previously discussed strategies.

This will include data augmentation directly in the model using the Keras preprocessing layers, an advanced learning rate scheduler, and more detailed fine-tuning control. # 1. Advanced Data Augmentation Integrate data augmentation directly into your model using Keras preprocessing layers.

Learning Rate Scheduler Consider using a more nuanced approach to the learning rate schedule, potentially combining a warm-up phase with a cosine decay for the learning rate, to gently decrease the learning rate over time. \`\`\`python # Cosine Decay with Warmup LR_START = 1e-5 LR_MAX = 1e-3 LR_MIN = 1e-6 LR_RAMPUP_EPOCHS = 5 LR_SUSTAIN_EPOCHS = 0 LR_EXP_DECAY = .8 def lrfn(epoch): if epoch < LR_RAMPUP_EPOCHS: lr = (LR_MAX - LR_START) / LR_RAMPUP_EPOCHS * epoch + LR_START elif epoch < LR_RAMPUP_EPOCHS + LR_SUSTAIN_EPOCHS: lr = LR_MAX else: lr = (LR_MAX - LR_MIN) * LR_EXP_DECAY ** (epoch - LR_RAMPUP_EPOCHS - LR_SUSTAIN_EPOCHS) + LR_MIN return lr lr_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(lrfn, verbose=True) \`\`\` # 3. Detailed Fine-Tuning After the initial training phase with the base model frozen, selectively unfreeze and fine-tune the top layers of the EfficientNetB0. Gradually lowering the learning rate and unfreezing more layers can often lead to better performance, as it allows the model to more finely adjust the pre-trained weights in a way that is relevant to the specific dataset. \`\`\`python # Example: Unfreeze the top 20% of the layers def fine_tune_model(model, base_model, total_layers, fine_tuning_at=0.8): for layer in base_model.layers[:int(total_layers * fine_tuning_at)]: layer.trainable = False for layer in base_model.layers[int(total_layers * fine_tuning_at):]: layer.trainable = True model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=1e-4), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) model = build_model_with_augmentation() # Initial training (with augmentation) model.compile(optimizer=Adam(lr=lrfn(0)), # Starting LR loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) model.fit(train_dataset, validation_data=validation_dataset, epochs=initial_epochs, callbacks=[lr_callback]) # Fine-tuning fine_tune_epochs = 30 total_epochs = initial_epochs + fine_tune_epochs fine_tune_model(model, model.layers[0], len(model.layers[0].layers), fine_tuning_at=0.8) model.fit(train_dataset, validation_data=validation_dataset, epochs=total_epochs, initial_epoch=initial_epochs, callbacks=[lr_callback]) \`\`\` These strategies can provide a more robust framework for training your model, potentially boosting its performance.

It's always a balancing act between model complexity, training time, and performance gains. Here are some advanced strategies: # Attention Mechanisms Incorporating attention mechanisms, like Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, can provide the model with the ability to focus more on relevant features. While EfficientNet architectures already leverage SE blocks, for other architectures or custom models, explicitly adding such blocks can improve performance. # Custom Training Loop Implementing a custom training loop can give you finer control over the training process. This approach allows for sophisticated training dynamics, such as dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on certain criteria other than just epoch count, or implementing custom gradient manipulations. \`\`\`python optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-4) @tf.function def train_step(data, labels): with tf.GradientTape() as tape: predictions = model(data, training=True) loss = loss_function(labels, predictions) gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables) optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables)) train_loss(loss) train_accuracy(labels, predictions) # Example usage in a loop for epoch in range(epochs): for data, labels in train_dataset: train_step(data, labels) # Validation step logic \`\`\` # Advanced Regularization Techniques Beyond Dropout and L2, consider exploring Mixup or CutMix as data augmentation strategies that also act as powerful regularizers. They involve blending images and labels, which can make your model more robust and less prone to overfitting on the training data. \`\`\`python # Very simplified Mixup example def mixup(image1, label1, image2, label2, alpha=0.2): weight = np.random.beta(alpha, alpha, 1) mixed_image = weight * image1 + (1 - weight) * image2 mixed_label = weight * label1 + (1 - weight) * label2 return mixed_image, mixed_label \`\`\` # Model Ensembling Sometimes, a single model might not be as effective as combining the predictions from several models. Ensembling techniques, like averaging the predictions from multiple models or using a more complex stacking or blending approach, can significantly boost performance, especially in challenging tasks. # Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) Augmenting the test data in a similar way as the training data, and then averaging the predictions for these augmented versions of the test images, can yield more robust predictions. # Exploring New Architectures Finally, always keep an eye on the latest developments in deep learning architectures. New models like Vision Transformers (ViT) and their derivatives often outperform conventional CNNs in various tasks.

While the term \\"Kasini Bonda\\" is not widely recognized, I'll share a recipe adapted to what you might be referring to, considering the culinary context. The recipe will focus on making delicious savory fritters that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, incorporating flavors reminiscent of Chettinad cuisine. # Ingredients: For the batter: - 2 cups idli batter (homemade or store-bought) - 1/4 cup finely chopped onions - 1/4 cup grated coconut - 2-3 green chilies, finely chopped - 1 teaspoon ginger, grated - 1/4 cup coriander leaves, finely chopped - 1 tablespoon curry leaves, finely chopped - 1 teaspoon mustard seeds - 1 teaspoon cumin seeds - 1/2 teaspoon asafoetida (hing) - Salt, to taste - Oil, for frying For a spicy twist (optional): - 1 teaspoon red chili powder - 1/2 teaspoon garam masala # Instructions: 1. **Preparation of the Batter:** - If you're starting with idli batter, ensure it's at room temperature. This helps in keeping the bondas soft. - Take the idli batter in a large mixing bowl. To this, add the finely chopped onions, grated coconut, green chilies, grated ginger, chopped coriander, and curry leaves. Mix well. 2. **Tempering:** - Heat a small pan with a tablespoon of oil. Once hot, add mustard seeds and let them crackle. - Add cumin seeds and asafoetida (hing). Once the cumin seeds start to splutter, remove the pan from heat. - Pour this tempering over the batter and mix well to combine everything. 3. **Seasoning:** - Now, check the seasoning of the batter. Add salt to taste. If you’ve opted for the spicy twist, also add the red chili powder and garam masala at this stage. - Give the batter a good mix to ensure all the spices are well incorporated. 4. **Frying:** - Heat oil in a deep pan or kadai over medium heat. To check if the oil is ready, drop a small amount of batter into the oil; if it rises to the surface without turning brown immediately, the oil is ready. - Wet your hands with water (this prevents the batter from sticking to your hands). Take a small portion of the batter and gently drop it into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pan. - Fry the bondas on medium heat until they turn golden brown and crispy. Make sure to turn them occasionally for even cooking. 5. **Serving:** - Once fried, remove the bondas from the oil and place them on paper towels to drain any excess oil. - Serve hot with your choice of chutney or sauce. Coconut chutney or mint-coriander chutney pairs wonderfully with these bondas. Enjoy your deliciously crispy and savory kasini bondas (or paniyaram) with a spicy and tangy chutney for a delightful snack any time of the day!"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's break down the given example: 1. **Stop Loss (SL): -25%** - This means if your investment decreases in value by 25%, you will exit the trade to prevent further loss. For instance, if you invest 100, you will set a stop loss at 75. 2. **Take Profit Targets:** - **First TP Target: 100%** - You take profit on 50% of your position when it doubles in value (100% increase). - Example: If you start with 100 and it grows to 200, you sell 50% of your holding. - **Second TP Target: 250%** - You take profit on 20% of your remaining position when it reaches a 250% increase from your initial investment. - Example: If your initial investment grows to 350 (2.5 times of 100), you sell 20% of what you have left after the first sale. - **Third TP Target: 400%** - You take profit on another 20% of your remaining position when it increases by 400%. - Example: If your initial investment now equals 500 (4 times of 100), you sell another 20% of what's left after the previous sales. - **Fourth (Final) TP Target: 1000%** - The final take profit target is a 1000% increase from your initial investment, where you sell the last 10% of your holdings. - Example: If your initial 100 grows to 1,100, you sell the remaining 10%. **Important Notes:** - This strategy involves scaling out of a position in steps, securing profits while still allowing some part of your investment to run for higher returns. - After each take profit target is reached and part of the position is sold, the remaining position's size reduces. The percentage of the position you sell at each target is based on what remains, not the original size. - Using multiple take profit targets can help in managing risk and securing profits in volatile markets, but it requires careful planning and discipline to follow through. Keep in mind that this strategy must be adapted to personal risk tolerance, investment goals, and the specifics of what is being traded (stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.). Always perform thorough research or consult a financial advisor before implementing such strategies."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This will incorporate both stop-loss and take-profit orders to manage risk and secure profits. Please remember, while the strategy can be a good learning example, actual trading should be approached with caution, especially in high-risk environments. Always do your own research or consult with a financial advisor. # Asset: - High risk, high reward (e.g., a cryptocurrency or a small-cap stock) # Initial Investment: - 20 # Strategy Overview: The key to managing a high-risk investment is to clearly define your risk tolerance and profit goals. For this strategy, we'll use fairly aggressive percentages due to the high-risk nature of the asset and the low initial investment. # Stop-Loss: - **10% loss from the initial investment** - This means if your asset value goes down to 18 (a loss of 10%), you automatically sell to avoid further losses. - Stop-loss order: **18** # Take-Profit: - **50% profit from the initial investment** - Given the high reward potential, setting a higher take-profit can potentially maximize gains. If your asset value reaches 30 (a 50% increase), you automatically sell to lock in profits. - Take-profit order: **30** # Strategy Execution: 1. **Buy** your chosen asset with the total investment of 20. 2. Immediately set a **stop-loss order** at 18. 3. Set a **take-profit order** at 30. 4. Monitor the asset periodically. Depending on the asset's volatility, you might need to adjust your strategy. # Risk Management: This strategy explicitly incorporates risk management through a stop-loss order. This limits your potential loss to 2 (10% of your initial investment), protecting you from significant downturns. # Profit Taking: Setting a take-profit order ensures that you don't get greedy and miss the opportunity to secure gains. Given the high-risk nature of the investment, a 50% profit margin is ambitious but fits within the high-risk, high-reward framework. # Additional Considerations: - **Fees**: Be aware of transaction fees, as they can eat into your profits or exacerbate your losses, especially in a low initial investment scenario. - **Adjustments**: Depending on the market and how your asset performs, you might need to adjust your stop-loss or take-profit levels. However, always ensure changes are made within your risk tolerance. - **Position Sizing**: Since we are dealing with a small initial amount, this factor is less critical. However, in a scaled-up scenario, consider not putting all your capital into a single asset. # Final Note: This strategy is relatively straightforward and designed for educational purposes. Real-world trading involves many variables, including market sentiment, news, and personal financial situation. Always ensure your investment decisions align with your financial goals and risk appetite."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Unlike previous approaches, which depend on manually created instructions, SELF-INSTRUCT uses the language model itself to generate new instructions, inputs, and corresponding outputs. These self-generated instructions cover a wide range of tasks and are used to further train the model, making it better at following human commands. The researchers start with a small set of manually written tasks (called seed tasks) and use these to prompt the language model to create new, diverse tasks. They carefully check the quality of these generated tasks, removing any that are too similar to existing ones or don’t make sense. This process results in a large dataset of unique and creative tasks. Experiments showed that training GPT3 with this self-generated dataset significantly improved its ability to understand and execute new instructions it hadn’t seen before. This method even performed comparably to other models that had been trained on human-created instructions and annotations. Furthermore, the researchers created and evaluated tasks that are more in line with real-world scenarios users might wish AI to assist with. These evaluations indicated that the model trained with SELF-INSTRUCT data performed better than models trained on publicly available datasets and was close in performance to other sophisticated models designed for instruction following. Overall, the paper suggests that through SELF-INSTRUCT, it’s possible to significantly enhance a language model’s ability to understand and follow a wide range of instructions without needing extensive human annotation, thus opening doors to more adaptive and broadly capable AI models.\\"\\" The above is a summary of a paper entitled: \\"SELF-INSTRUCT: Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions\\" Now, how does the following paper build upon this knowledge?

As these models become increasingly sophisticated, understanding and influencing the nuances of their underlying functionality becomes imperative to harness their full potential. Among the myriad factors influencing the performance of language models, the concept of “positive thinking” has emerged as a fascinating and surprisingly influential dimension. Intuition tells us that, in the context of language model systems, like any other computer system, “positive thinking” should not affect performance, but empirical experience has demonstrated otherwise. This paper aims to quantify the impact of various “positive thinking” additions to the system message of a prompt. In essence, it explores the influence of seemingly worthless prompt modifications by measuring the fluctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset. As the quest for near-perfect performance from Artificial Intelligence (AI) intensifies, understanding the effect of “positive thinking” in language model prompts can add crucial performance points to test set scores. We will show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. Then we’ll show that not only does systematic prompt optimization outperform “positive thinking”, even with smaller open-source models, but that it also generalizes better. Additionally, we’ll show that the highest-scoring automatically-generated prompt is remarkably different from anything a human practitioner would be likely to generate. 2.Related Work The genesis of prompt engineering can be traced back to the seminal Chain of Thought paper by Wei et al. (Wei et al., 2023). This pioneering work demonstrated a significant enhancement in model performance by introducing a simple prompt modification: the inclusion of the directive “Think step by step.” The degree of performance improvement, however, is contingent upon the specific model, its size, and the underlying dataset. Subsequently, the PaLM 2 Technical Report by Anil et al. (Anil et al., 2023) revealed that the application of Chain of Thought prompts may yield adverse effects on certain datasets. This observation underscores the absence of a universal prompt snippet capable of unconditionally improving model performance. Consequently, the landscape of prompt engineering has witnessed the emergence of resources such as the Prompt Engineering Guide1, aiming to catalog the myriad techniques and scholarly contributions2 constituting the expansive realm of prompt engineering. These endeavors reflect an ongoing effort to navigate the diverse techniques and insights propelling the continuous evolution of effective prompting strategies. In addition to the formally published literature on prompt engineering, numerous discussions on less formal discoveries can be found in countless threads on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit3. 3.Experimental Design To test the impact of “positive thinking” prompts, we vary the system message part of the prompt with a combination of “openers”, “task descriptions”, and “closers” in the following format: <<SYS>>{opener}{task_description}{closer}<</SYS>> Refer to Table 1, 2, and 3 for a comprehensive compilation of the opening snippets, task descriptions, and closing snippets utilized in our study. Given the incorporation of 5 openers, 3 task descriptions, and 4 closers, our experimentation involved a total of 60 unique combinations. Additionally, we conducted tests both with and without Chain of Thought prompting, resulting in a grand total of 120 prompt combinations per input per model. Although the possibility of expanding the range of snippets within each category existed (and the temptation to do so was strong), we made a deliberate decision to limit our selection due to the significant time commitment associated with the computational complexity of testing, as exemplified by the runtime required for 60 prompt combinations for a 70-billion-parameter model with Chain of Thought being measured in days, not hours. Openers None You are as smart as ChatGPT. You are highly intelligent. You are an expert mathematician. You are a professor of mathematics. Table 1.Opening snippets for the system message. Task Descriptions None Solve the following math question. Answer the following math question. Table 2.Task Description snippets for the system message. Closers None This will be fun! Take a deep breath and think carefully. I really need your help! Table 3.Closing snippets for the system message. 3.1.Dataset Careful selection of the dataset for testing against constitutes a critical aspect of this study. Our aim was to identify a challenging task that was unlikely to have been directly encountered during the training of the models4. While our preference was for an internal dataset specific to VMware, the absence of large-scale datasets with directly quantifiable scoring metrics, such as accuracy or F1, necessitated the utilization of a publicly available benchmark dataset. Ultimately, we opted for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Given the ongoing limitations of contemporary LLMs, particularly in addressing basic mathematical tasks, especially those involving multi-step reasoning, we deemed GSM8K an optimal choice for illustrating the impact of seemingly inconsequential augmentations to the prompt’s system message. 3.2.Scoring In the context of GSM8K’s mathematical assessment, we adopted a stringent approach to scoring that precluded the assignment of partial credit. Thus, we employed Exact Match (EM) as our scoring metric. The model was evaluated based on whether it correctly provided the exact numerical solution or not. This rigorous methodology ensures a clear and unambiguous assessment of the model’s accuracy in providing the exact numerical output. 3.3.Output Parsing Given the unforgiving nature of EM scoring, it is essential to note that, despite the answer to GSM8K questions being numerical, the output of an LLM is a string. Consequently, meticulous attention must be paid to the formatting and parsing of the non-numerical output. From the standpoint of string equality, it is imperative to recognize distinctions such as the string “30000” not being equivalent to “30,000” or “30000.00”. To mitigate this challenge, a post-processing step was implemented to ensure accurate scoring by preventing misclassification of a response as incorrect when it was, in fact, accurate. 3.4.Scale Benchmark datasets typically encompass thousands of examples in their test sets; GSM8K has over 1,300 examples in its test set. Such an extensive scale of data is exceptionally uncommon in real-world datasets, particularly during the initial stages of a project. To replicate this rarity, we systematically subset the test set of GSM8K, extracting subsets containing the first 10, 25, 50, and 100 questions, thereby allowing us to illustrate the impact of “positive thinking” as the dataset size increases. Notably, we limited our experiments to a maximum of 100 questions to mitigate computation time, as computing results for the entire test set would have required weeks and incurred a substantial carbon cost for what would likely be diminishing returns. 3.5.Model Selection Although we aspired to assess widely recognized commercial models such as GPT-3.5/4, Gemini, Claude, etc., conducting experiments involving 12,000 requests per model was deemed financially prohibitive, as it would have incurred costs amounting to many thousands of dollars. Consequently, we opted to utilize models hosted by VMware NLP Lab’s LLM API. Specifically, our evaluations were conducted on Mistral-7B5 (Jiang et al., 2023), Llama2-13B6 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama2-70B7 (Touvron et al., 2023).

Given the nature of these models, specifically that they were designed for conversational interactions, achieving success in terms of Exact Match (EM) scoring necessitated guiding the model to refrain from generating a response comprising multiple sentences. To accomplish this, we resorted to incorporating examples via in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), as exposure to instances of the desired output format significantly increased the likelihood of the model producing responses aligned with the specified format (though, as previously mentioned, significant post-processing was still required to get the simple numerical response). To maintain experimental consistency by minimizing the number of variables that changed in each iteration, we adopted an intentionally naive strategy for in-context learning. Strategies such as K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) example selection have been shown to increase model performance (Liu et al., 2021); however, we chose not to employ any such strategies, so as to hold the number of variables changing per experiment to one: the modified system message only. Specifically, we limited the examples to the last four instances from the test set8, thereby providing a consistent and focused set of samples for the model to learn from. Notably, four examples emerged as the minimum number required to consistently elicit the correct output format. 3.7.Automatic Prompt Optimization Engaging in the iterative process of refining prompts and monitoring the subsequent score progression can be an enjoyable endeavor. However, this approach proves to be highly time-inefficient, especially when systematically assessing all modifications from a scientific standpoint. Existing research, as demonstrated by Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2023), highlights the superior capability of LLM systems in optimizing their own prompts compared to human efforts. In light of this, we conducted a comparative analysis pitting human-generated “positive thinking” optimization against the utilization of DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023) Optimizers9 at the same question subsets: 10, 25, 50, and 100. It is noteworthy that the questions utilized for optimization were additional and distinct from the evaluation set and the in-context learning examples, though also originating from the end of the test set. For the most extensive trial, 100 “new” questions were employed for the optimization process, while the same 100 evaluation questions were used for the evaluation processes, so as to make the scores directly comparable. Importantly, each model was exclusively employed to optimize itself; cross-model optimizations, such as using Llama2-70B to optimize the prompt for Mistral-7B, were not pursued. 4.Experimental Results As evidenced in the subsequent sections, certain overarching patterns become apparent; however, they do not universally apply to each model across all prompting strategies. We will explicitly illustrate that there is no straightforward universal prompt snippet that can be added to optimize any given model’s performance. For these experiments, baseline performance refers to the scenario where the model receives no system message, signified by the opening snippet, task description, and closing snippet all being designated as “None”. For Sections 4.1-4.3, refer to Table 4.

Bold is for the higher Average EM. “EM Delta” is the difference between the Exact Match for the two sets. An underline is for the lower EM Delta. All prompts are with Chain of Thought. 4.1.Mistral-7B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting, Mistral-7B’s performance remained remarkably consistent across all prompt permutations. At both the 10 and 25 question sets, there was no deviation. Even for the 100 question subset, the maximum observed standard deviation was a mere 0.007. The variability observed at 50 questions appears to be an anomaly. Examination of the results in Appendix B.3 reveals that, with the exception of one prompt scoring 0.10, all others scored 0.12. It is unclear why this particular prompt led to one additional incorrect response compared to the other 59 prompt variations. In contrast, the results for 100 questions in Appendix B.4 demonstrate a reasonable spread between 0.08 and 0.11. In relative terms, Mistral-7B, when prompted without Chain of Thought, exhibits substantial prompt invariance, with the “positive thinking” prompts only matching or marginally surpassing the baseline. This trend reverses when Mistral-7B is prompted with Chain of Thought. Instead of observing a slight increase in deviation with the number of questions, there is a steady and substantial decrease, ranging from 0.066 at 10 questions to 0.018 at 100 questions. In this scenario, “positive thinking” prompts significantly outperformed the baseline with no prompts falling below the baseline. Please refer to Appendices B.5 through B.8 for the ranked order of prompts for Mistral-7B with Chain of Thought. 4.2.Llama2-13B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was no deviation, Llama2-13B shows an opposite trend to Mistral-7B, with deviation decreasing from 0.014 at 25 questions to 0.003 at 100 questions. While slightly less stable than Mistral-7B, without Chain of Thought, LLama2-13B is also fairly prompt invariant, with the “positive thinking” prompts again only matching or marginally exceeding the baseline. With Chain of Thought prompting, the trend is less clear. It does overall decrease from 0.026 at 10 to 0.016 at 100, but, at 50, it’s even lower, at 0.012. This is the only case where that occurred. For Mistral-7B, and as we’ll show in the next section with Llama2-70B, variation consistently decreased as the number of questions increased when employing Chain of Thought prompting. 4.3.Llama2-70B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was again no deviation, Llama2-70B exhibits a similar trend to Llama2-13B, with deviation again decreasing from 0.017 at 25 questions to 0.050 at 100 questions. Across all three models, the prompt variance was an order of magnitude lower without Chain of Thought when compared to using Chain of Thought at the same question count. However, in terms of actual performance, the “positive thinking” prompts all matched or underperformed baseline. This is a stark departure from the pattern seen with Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B. That departure does not persist when employing Chain of Thought prompting. While the performance of the “positive thinking” prompts with Chain of Thought did underperform the baseline on average for 10 and 25 questions, it outperformed the baseline on average for 50 and 100 questions. As for variance, the general pattern of standard deviation decreasing with question count does hold. 4.4.General Trends in Results It’s challenging to extract many generalizable results across models and prompting strategies, as every nearly evident trend we observed had at least one notable exception. In fact, the only real trend may be no trend. What’s best for any given model, dataset, and prompting strategy is likely to be specific to the particular combination at hand. Thus, we turned from hand-tuning the system message with optimistic “positive thinking” to automatic prompt optimization. 4.5.Automatic Prompt Optimization Results As anticipated, the prompts that underwent automatic optimization consistently equaled or surpassed the effectiveness of our manually generated “positive thinking” prompts in nearly all instances. The instances where “positive thinking” achieved higher average scores across the optimization and evaluation sets were limited to Mistral-7B with 25 questions and Llama2-70B with 10 questions. However, evaluating performance solely on raw scores is insufficient; hence, we also examined the delta between scores on the optimization set and the evaluation set. A lower delta implies superior generalization of the prompt. Therefore, the optimal strategy combines the highest average score with the lowest delta. See Table 5 for the performance comparison. For Mistral-7B, the results present a mixed scenario. “Positive thinking” exhibits a lower delta for 10, 25, and 50 questions, while the automatically optimized prompt demonstrates a lower delta for 100 questions. Considering Mistral-7B’s model capacity, it is understandable that it faces challenges in optimizing its own prompt when compared to the larger Llama2-13B and 70B models. In contrast, for both Llama2-13B and 70B models, the automatically optimized prompts consistently show a lower delta across all cases. Consequently, it is advisable to refrain from manually fine-tuning prompts when using models larger than 7B, and instead, leverage the model’s ability to autonomously optimize prompts. For 7B models, more work is required to see if the trend of automatically optimized prompts outperforming manually tuned prompts holds for sample sizes exceeding 100 questions. This recommendation aligns with the original auto-optimization paper. However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the optimized prompts themselves. They diverge significantly from any prompts we might have devised independently. If presented with these optimized prompts before observing their performance scores, one might have anticipated their inadequacy rather than their consistent outperformance of hand-tailored prompts. A prime example is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and prefix generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset: System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» Answer Prefix: Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proficiency in mathematical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an affinity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently. For a comprehensive collection of the peculiar and fascinating prompts generated by the three models, refer to Appendix C. 5.The Reproducibility Problem Although somewhat peripheral to the primary research question addressed in this paper, it is noteworthy that our findings exhibit significant discrepancies from the published performance scores of Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B, whereas Llama2-70B fell within an acceptable margin of error, considering our evaluation was conducted on approximately 15% of GSM8K’s test set. Refer to Table 6 for the score comparisons. The most significant deviation was observed in the case of Llama2-13B. Meta reported a score of 0.29 on the GSM8K dataset. Our results without Chain of Thought yielded a score of 0.07, whereas with Chain of Thought, we achieved a score of 0.43. Due to both Meta and Mistral AI’s omission of the prompts used for testing their models, we can only speculate about the reasons behind our substantial performance differences compared to their reported scores. This instance underscores a broader issue of reproducibility that has long existed inside the machine learning community, but has become significantly exacerbated since the advent of LLMs. Without the publication of prompts employed by researchers with their models, reproducing their results becomes a formidable challenge. As shown in this paper, trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. We implore all future research publications to include the prompts used in an appendix. Refer to Appendix A to see our prompt templates. Model Reported EM Our EM@100 Delta Mistral-7B 0.52 0.41 −0.11 Llama2-13B 0.29 0.43 +0.13 Llama2-70B 0.57 0.61 +0.04 Table 6.Comparing the reported scores for each model as reported by the model publishers on the whole GSM8K test set against the best average score we were able to achieve across our optimization and evaluation subsets, which accounted for about 15% of the test set. 6.Future Work This work could easily be expanded with additional prompt variants, models, and datasets. However, due to the combinatorial complexity of scientifically testing each change, manual prompt engineering is far from the most efficient methodology for improving model performance. Instead, the best path forward is to use libraries like DSPy to apply a more structured approach to constructing LLM-powered applications and use the built-in optimizer to automatically tune the prompt for your dataset and model of choice. 7.Conclusion It’s both surprising and irritating that trivial modifications to the prompt can exhibit such dramatic swings in performance. Doubly so, since there’s no obvious methodology for improving performance. Affecting performance is trivial. Improving performance, when tuning the prompt by hand, is laborious and computationally prohibitive when using scientific processes to evaluate every change. In this paper, we showed that you don’t need massive commercial models like PaLM 2 or GPT-4 to tune your prompt. Mistral-7B struggled to optimize its own prompt until it had 100 questions to work with. Llama2-13B and 70B were able to produce superior prompts with as little as 10 questions to optimize with. And while the prompts they generated may appear shocking to an experienced practitioner, it’s undeniable that the automatically generated prompts perform better and generalize better than hand-tuned “positive thinking” prompts.

This approach autonomously generates new tasks, inputs, and outputs to enhance the model's understanding and execution of complicated instructions. It presents a novel path forward by relying less on labor-intensive human annotation and more on the model's own capacity to refine its comprehension and task execution. The subsequent paper dives into a different but complementary area of research that explores the influence of \\"positive thinking\\" prompts on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). This work investigates how minor, seemingly insignificant modifications to the system message portion of a prompt, including additions that can be perceived as instilling a form of \\"positive thinking,\\" can dramatically affect a model's performance. The study systematically explores various prompt modifications, employing a blend of openers, task descriptions, and closers to determine their impact on the model's ability to solve complex multi-step reasoning problems. Comparatively, the SELF-INSTRUCT method fundamentally focuses on improving AI models by enriching their training data through self-generated instructional tasks, aiming for a broadened understanding and more nuanced task execution capabilities. On the other hand, the research into \\"positive thinking\\" prompts delves into optimizing the interface between user commands and AI execution—highlighting how even minimal tweaks in the framing of prompts can yield significant performance variations. This latter approach does not directly enhance the underlying model's capabilities through additional training data but rather by refining the model's current abilities to parse and respond to instructions through carefully crafted prompts. While both approaches aim to enhance LLMs' utility, they operate on different levels of interaction. SELF-INSTRUCT enriches the model's foundational abilities, making it more adept at comprehending and executing a wider array of instructions. The \\"positive thinking\\" study, conversely, seeks to optimize the performance of existing models without altering their training regimen or foundational capabilities. It showcases how the strategic manipulation of prompts—a kind of prompt engineering—can uncover surprisingly effective communication pathways between humans and AI, improving the model's output quality without altering its underlying architecture or knowledge base. The effectiveness of these methods is contextually dependent. The SELF-INSTRUCT method might be more beneficial when the aim is to develop a fundamentally stronger model capable of understanding and executing tasks with minimal guidance. Meanwhile, the \\"positive thinking\\" research might be more immediately impactful in practical applications where optimizing the performance of existing models with prompt engineering can achieve significant improvements with a lower investment of time and resources. In essence, these studies illuminate different facets of augmenting AI capabilities—one through enhancing the model's internal processing of tasks and the other through optimizing human-model interaction for better performance. Combining the insights from both could lead to more sophisticated, adaptable, and user-friendly AI models, potentially setting a new direction for AI research and application development."},{"instruction":"Какая позиция у Крымских татар по отношению к оккупации Крыма?","output":"Крымские татар выступают против оккупации Крыма Россией.

Determine the risk tolerance: Since the asset is high-risk, it is important to define the maximum amount of loss that you are willing to incur. Let's assume a risk tolerance of 10%. 2. Set a Stop Loss: Calculate 10% of the 20 investment, which is 2. This will be your stop loss level. Place a stop loss order at this level to limit your potential losses. 3. Set a Take Profit target: Given that the asset is high-reward, you may want to set a take profit target to capitalize on potential gains. Let's set a take profit target of 20% for this strategy. 4. Calculate the Take Profit level: Calculate 20% of the 20 investment, which is 4. Once the asset reaches this level, you can consider selling to lock in profits. 5. Monitor the trade: Keep a close eye on the price movements of the asset and be prepared to act if the stop loss or take profit levels are reached. 6. Adjust the strategy: If the trade is successful, consider reinvesting the profits or adjusting the stop loss and take profit levels for future trades based on market conditions. Remember that trading in high-risk assets is inherently risky and it is important to do thorough research and exercise caution when implementing any trading strategy."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's a basic outline of the processes involved, but please note that undertaking such processes without proper training, equipment, and safety protocols can be extremely hazardous. # For Tin Stripping: The chemicals mentioned (HCl, urea, HNO3, and citric acid) are often used in various stripping and etching solutions, but their use must be calibrated carefully. Here’s a conceptual approach: 1. **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid)** and **HNO3 (Nitric Acid)** are both strong acids and can be used to dissolve metals. A mixture of these can dissolve tin, but the ratios and the conditions (such as temperature and concentration) need to be controlled precisely to avoid unwanted reactions and to target tin specifically. 2. **Citric Acid** can be used as a complexing agent to stabilize some ions in solution, potentially controlling the etching process. It can make the solution less aggressive towards certain materials, allowing for more selectivity in what is dissolved. 3. **Urea** can be used to adjust pH and as a complexing agent in some solutions, but it’s less commonly involved in metal dissolution processes directly. Its role might be more about controlling the reaction environment. # For Silver and Palladium Recovery: After stripping away the tin, recovering silver and palladium requires separate and specific processes, often involving: - **Precipitation reactions**, where a chemical is added to cause the desired metal to precipitate out of the solution. - **Electrolysis**, where electrical current is used to deposit the metal on a cathode. - **Solvent extraction**, to separate one metal from another in the solution. # Safety and Legal Considerations: - **Chemical Safety**: The chemicals involved, especially strong acids, are hazardous. They require appropriate safety gear (gloves, goggles, fume hoods, etc.) and knowledge of how to handle them safely. - **Disposal**: Chemicals and waste products must be disposed of according to local regulations to avoid environmental harm. - **Legal**: In some jurisdictions, the processing of electronic waste to recover metals is heavily regulated. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and adhere to legal guidelines. # Professional Guidance: Given the complexity and hazards involved, this process is best undertaken in a proper laboratory setting with the guidance of a chemical engineer or a professional with experience in metallurgical processes. DIY attempts at chemical processing, especially involving hazardous materials, are risky and can lead to serious injury or legal issues. If your goal is academic or experimental in a controlled setting, connecting with a local university or professional institution that has the equipment and expertise might be the best course of action. They can provide not only the technical know-how but also advice on handling and disposal practices that are environmentally responsible and legally compliant."},{"instruction":"骨髓检查原粒细胞>80%，早幼粒细胞>10%，应考虑： A 急性髓细胞白血病M3型 B 急性髓细胞白血病M4型 C 急性髓细胞白血病M1型 D 急性髓细胞白血病M2a型 E 急性髓细胞白血病M6型","output":"选项：C 急性髓细胞白血病M1型 解释： 急性髓细胞白血病（AML）的分类依照FAB（French-American-British）分类系统，其中： - M1型急性髓细胞白血病（AML-M1）的特征是大量未成熟的原粒细胞在骨髓中累积，通常未成熟的原粒细胞比例超过80%。 - 早幼粒细胞比例大于或等于10%也符合M1型的诊断标准。 因此，根据骨髓检查原粒细胞>80%，早幼粒细胞>10%的病例，最符合急性髓细胞白血病M1型的诊断。"},{"instruction":"】某患者男性，46岁，头晕、乏力半个月，外周血检查WBC 35×109/L，RBC 2.31×1012/L，PLT 35×109/L。骨髓检查发现一类异常细胞占92.5%，其胞体小，核形多规则，偶见凹陷、折叠，核染色质多细颗粒状，平坦，可见2-3个小而清核仁，胞质少淡蓝色，部分可见细小颗粒。最可能考虑哪种血液病： A AML-M2a B AML-M1 C AML-M5a D ALL E CML","output":"根据描述的症状和骨髓检查结果，最可能的诊断是D ALL（急性淋巴细胞白血病）。 解析：患者有明显的白血病表现，包括头晕、乏力、显著的白细胞增多（WBC 35×109/L），红细胞和血小板减少。骨髓检查发现一类异常细胞占92.5%，特征是胞体小，核形不规则，偶见凹陷或折叠，核染色质细颗粒状，2-3个小而清核仁，胞质少且淡蓝色，部分可见细小颗粒，这些特征更符合急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）的典型表现。 - AML（急性髓细胞白血病）通常特征为不同程度的髓系前体细胞在骨髓中积累。根据所涉及的亚型（M1、M2a、M5a等），细胞形态有所不同，但通常表现为较大的细胞体积、显著的核仁和较多的胞质。 - CML（慢性髓细胞白血病）通常在血液和骨髓中表现为成熟细胞的积累，伴随不同程度的左移现象（未成熟细胞的出现），并且通常伴有特定的遗传标志，如BCR-ABL融合基因。 因此，考虑到上述特征和患者的表现，最合适的选项是D ALL。"},{"instruction":"某男，40岁，发热伴牙龈出血，皮肤有多个结节性红斑。骨髓中异常细胞78.5%，其胞体较大，胞核折叠、凹陷、扭曲呈马蹄形、S形等，染色质细致疏松呈网状，胞质较多，染灰蓝色，半透明。特异性酯酶染色阴性，非特异性酯酶染色阳性并可被NaF抑制。考虑下列哪种疾病： A M5型白血病 B M4型白血病 C ALL型白血病 D M1型白血病 E M3型白血病","output":"根据描述的特征，最可能的诊断是E M3型白血病，也被称为急性旁髓细胞白血病（Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia, APL）。 解析： - 病人呈现典型的发热、牙龈出血以及皮肤结节性红斑。这些症状常见于各型急性白血病。 - 骨髓中异常细胞78.5%，其中细胞特点非常符合M3型（APL）的描述，即细胞体较大、胞核出现折叠、凹陷、扭曲，呈现马蹄形、S形等多种形态，染色质细腻疏松呈网状，胞质较多、染灰蓝色、半透明。这些都是M3型白血病的典型形态学特征。 - 特异性酯酶染色阴性而非特异性酯酶染色阳性并可被NaF抑制，这一特点也符合M3型白血病的细胞化学特征。 其他选项所指的白血病类型（M1、M4、M5、ALL）与这些特点不完全吻合。例如： - M1、M2等类型（急性髓系白血病）的骨髓细胞与M3的形态学和细胞化学染色特征不同。 - M4（急性髓单核细胞白血病）和M5（急性单核细胞白血病）也都有其特定的形态学和细胞化学特点，与M3明显不同。 - ALL（急性淋巴细胞白血病）的细胞类型主要是淋巴细胞，其形态学和细胞化学特征与M3不一致。 因此，最正确的选择是E M3型白血病。"},{"instruction":"【单选题】某患者骨髓可见一类细胞胞体小(10～20μm)，核染色质较粗密，分布不匀，核仁1～3个，常模糊，胞质少，蓝色，无颗粒。涂片易见破坏细胞。请问符合下列哪种急性白血病形态： A M1 B M3 C ALL D M5 E M7","output":"描述的细胞特征：细胞体小（10～20μm），核染色质较粗密且分布不匀，核仁1～3个，常模糊，胞质少，呈蓝色，无颗粒，并且涂片易见破坏细胞，这些特点最符合急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）的典型形态特征。 因此，正确选项是C ALL。 解析其他选项： - M1（急性髓细胞性白血病无成熟细胞型）：表现为大量未成熟的髓系细胞，但其核通常不如ALL中描述的那样细小和具有模糊核仁。 - M3（急性旁髓细胞性白血病，即急性旁髓细胞白血病）：其特征性的染色质结构紧密、“棒状”核，和在细胞中有特有的颗粒和Auer杆体，与描述不符。 - M5（急性单核细胞性白血病）：以单核细胞系列成熟和未成熟细胞的增加为特征，且胞质通常不如所描述的少。 - M7（急性巨核细胞白血病）：涉及巨核细胞系列的细胞，标志是出现不成熟巨核系细胞，形态特点与描述不合。 鉴于所提供的信息，选项C ALL是最符合细胞形态描述的答案。"},{"instruction":"【单选题】大部分B-ALL及T-ALL均可表达的免疫表型： A TdT B MPO C CD3 D CD79 E CD22","output":"大部分B-ALL和T-ALL均可表达的免疫表型是TdT（终末脱氧核苷酸转移酶）。TdT是一种DNA多聚酶，常在急性淋巴细胞性白血病（ALL）中未成熟的淋巴细胞上表达，并被用来区分急性髓系和淋巴系白血病。因此，正确答案是: A TdT 解析其他选项： - MPO（髓过氧化物酶）主要在急性髓系白血病（AML）的细胞中表达，用于区分髓系与淋巴系白血病。 - CD3是一个与T淋巴细胞相关的标志物，特异地表达在T细胞上，包括T-ALL，但不在B细胞或B-ALL上表达。 - CD79是一个与B细胞生物学相关的分子，与B细胞受体复合体（BCR）相关，在B细胞和部分B-ALL上表达，但不表达在T-ALL上。 - CD22同样是一个B细胞标志物，在B细胞或B-ALL上表达，不在T-ALL上表达。 因此，TdT作为大部分B-ALL和T-ALL共同可能表达的标志物是最佳选择。"},{"instruction":"某患者，70岁，多次检查外周血白细胞增高，分类以成熟淋巴细胞为主约70%。行骨髓穿刺，骨髓象以分化较好的小淋巴细胞居多，比例约为60%，本病最可能考虑为下列哪项： A 急性白血病 B 类白血病反应 C MDS D 慢性粒细胞白血病 E 慢性淋巴细胞白血病","output":"患者的描述表现为外周血和骨髓中以成熟淋巴细胞为主，这些特点最符合慢性淋巴细胞白血病（Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, CLL）的诊断。 因此，正确答案是： E 慢性淋巴细胞白血病 解析其他选项： - A 急性白血病：特征是骨髓和外周血中未成熟的白细胞（幼稚细胞）显著增多，而不是成熟淋巴细胞。 - B 类白血病反应：指因某些非恶性疾病（如感染、应激等）导致的外周血细胞数目和/或比例暂时性改变，通常不会导致骨髓中成熟淋巴细胞显著增多。 - C MDS（骨髓增生异常综合征）：是一组由骨髓造血功能不全引起的克隆性疾病，其特点是骨髓中有不成熟细胞增多和外周血细胞减少，与此病例不符。 - D 慢性粒细胞白血病（Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, CML）：通常特征为外周血和骨髓中的粒细胞（主要是中性粒细胞）数目增多，以成熟和分化良好的细胞为主，与此案例成熟淋巴细胞增多不符。 根据提供的信息，慢性淋巴细胞白血病（CLL）是最合适的诊断。"},{"instruction":"慢性淋巴细胞白血病免疫表型为： A CD19+CD13+CD20+κ/λ+CD10- B CD19+CD2+CD5+κ/λ+CD10- C CD19+CD3+CD5+κ/λ+CD10- D CD19+CD23+CD5+κ/λ+CD10+ E CD19+CD23+CD5+κ/λ+CD10-","output":"慢性淋巴细胞白血病（CLL）的免疫表型的特征是CD19+, CD5+, CD23+, 常见κ或λ（表面免疫球蛋白（surface immunoglobulin）轻链限制性表达），而CD10通常是阴性。因此，最正确的选项是： E CD19+CD23+CD5+κ/λ+CD10- 解析其他选项： - A.

The ATmega328P, like the ATmega32A, also utilizes the \`ADMUX\`, \`ADCSRA\`, and \`ADC\` registers for ADC operations, and employs the DDRx, PORTx, and PINx registers for GPIO control. However, there are a few things to remember when transitioning from the ATmega32A to ATmega328P: 1. **Pin Mapping**: Ensure the pin mapping related to your peripherals (ADC inputs, digital I/O) aligns with the ATmega328P's pinout. On the ATmega328P the ADC pins are labeled as ADC0-ADC7 corresponding to PC0-PC7. 2. **Functional Differences**: While the ADC and GPIO functionalities are quite similar across these two microcontrollers, always consult the specific datasheet of the ATmega328P for any subtle differences. For example, the power saving features and peripheral settings may differ or offer additional functionalities that could be exploited for optimization. 3. **Clock Source Configuration**: Verify that your clock settings (16 MHz in your code) are implemented correctly in the ATmega328P. This might require setting the fuse bits appropriately if you are using an external crystal oscillator, or verifying the MCU's clock source settings if using the internal oscillator. Given the code you provided and the ATmega328P in mind, your implementation should work as is because the necessary changes regarding pin definitions and functionalities (ADC reading and GPIO control) are already consistent with the ATmega328P's features and specifications. However, be mindful of the fact that the ATmega328P and ATmega32A have different numbers of I/O pins and peripheral features. Given the pins you're using (PD1 to PD6 for LEDs), there's no conflict, as these pins are directly compatible with the ATmega328P's digital I/O pinout. If you were utilizing more advanced peripherals (e.g., additional SPI/I2C interfaces, etc.) or specific interrupts, additional review and adjustments might be necessary based on the ATmega328P's datasheet and available peripherals. Lastly, always ensure that the AVR toolchain you're using (compiler, AVR-GCC version, avrdude, etc.) is up to date and properly configured for the ATmega328P. This involves selecting the correct MCU target in your IDE or makefile, which affects how the compiled binary interacts with the hardware registers and peripherals."},{"instruction":"give me the modified code","output":"Given your initial request and the details provided, here's the modified code suitable for the ATmega328P.

The ATmega328P has multiple ADC pins, but in the sample code you provided, the ADC channel is set to \`0\` (with \`#define potPin 0\`). This corresponds to using \`ADC0\` on the ATmega328P, which is pin \`PC0\` in the 28-pin package. Here is how you might connect your potentiometer to the ATmega328P for ADC reading: 1. **Connect one side of the potentiometer to Vcc** (e.g., 5V if your ATmega328P operates at 5V). 2. **Connect the other side to GND** (ground). 3. **Connect the wiper (the adjustable middle pin) of the potentiometer to the \`PC0\` pin** of the ATmega328P. This is the pin you'll read the analog voltage from, which varies with the potentiometer's adjustment. Remember, the value you read will be between 0 and 1023 for the ATmega328P's 10-bit ADC, reflecting the voltage on the \`PC0\` pin from 0V up to the reference voltage (which is usually Avcc, connected to Vcc, if you're using \`ADMUX = (1<<REFS0);\` as you do in your code). In terms of your code and setup, no modification is necessary regarding choosing the ADC pin -- it's already set up to read from \`ADC0\`, corresponding to \`PC0\` on the ATmega328P. Just ensure your physical circuit reflects this by connecting the potentiometer's wiper to the \`PC0\` pin.
