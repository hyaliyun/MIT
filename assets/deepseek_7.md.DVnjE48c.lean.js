Here is a question about this article: Adolescence (from Latin adolescere, meaning \\"to grow up\\") is a transitional stage of physical and psychological human development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood (age of majority). The period of adolescence is most closely associated with the teenage years, though its physical, psychological and cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later. For example, although puberty has been historically associated with the onset of adolescent development, it now typically begins prior to the teenage years and there has been a normative shift of it occurring in preadolescence, particularly in females (see precocious puberty). Physical growth, as distinct from puberty (particularly in males), and cognitive development generally seen in adolescence, can also extend into the early twenties. Thus chronological age provides only a rough marker of adolescence, and scholars have found it difficult to agree upon a precise definition of adolescence. What is the answer to this question: What is the Latin meaning of the word \\"adolescere\\"?","output":"The Latin meaning of the word \\"adolescere\\" is \\"to grow up.\\" It is derived from this Latin verb that the term \\"adolescence\\" is formed, which refers to the transitional stage of physical and psychological human development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood (age of majority)."},{"instruction":"\\"Last Day in Florida\\" is the eighteenth episode of the eighth season of the American comedy television series \\"The Office\\" and the show's 170th episode overall, the episode features the final appearance of Lindsey Broad and guest stars Georgia Bright Engel, an American actress who is best known for her role as Georgette Franklin Baxter, on which tv series?

Movie title: Kissing Jessica Stein Context: Twenty-eight-year-old Jessica Stein, a copyeditor living and working in New York City, is plagued by failed blind dates with men, and decides to answer a newspaper's personal advertisement containing a quote from Rilke that she had read and admired earlier. The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men. Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sickâwhich she says earlier in the film never happens to herâJessica is there to care for her. The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica. Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup. It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The New York Times The reason for this disappointing outcome, in his view, is that natural selection has been far more efficient than many researchers expected at screening out disease-causing variants. The common disease/common variant idea is largely wrong. What has happened is that a multitude of rare variants lie at the root of most common diseases, being rigorously pruned away as soon as any starts to become widespread. It takes large, expensive trials with hundreds of patients in different countries to find even common variants behind a disease. Rare variants lie beyond present reach. “It’s an astounding thing,” Dr. Goldstein said, “that we have cracked open the human genome and can look at the entire complement of common genetic variants, and what do we find? Almost nothing. That is absolutely beyond belief.” If rare variants account for most of the genetic burden of disease, then the idea of decoding everyone’s genome to see to what diseases they are vulnerable to will not work, at least not in the form envisaged. “I don’t believe we should do more and more genomewide association studies for common diseases,” Dr. Goldstein said. Instead, he suggested, the “missing heritability” might be tracked by thoroughly studying the genome of specific patients. Researchers hunting for disease genes strongly disagree. They say genomewide association studies with larger numbers of patients will bring more disease-promoting variants to light. Dr. Kari Stefansson, chief executive of the Icelandic gene-hunting company Decode Genetics, says it does not matter whether disease-causing variants are common or rare as long as they yield insights into the biochemical pathways by which disease develops, and which will provide targets for drugs. The HapMap project was started amid much skepticism but has proved a technical success, even if it has brought to light fewer common disease variants than hoped. “There is no doubt it has succeeded far beyond what some skeptics proposed,” said Dr. David Altshuler, an architect of the HapMap at the Harvard Medical School. He defends the common disease/common variant hypothesis, saying it meant only that some, not all, of the genetic burden of a disease would be conveyed by common variants. And the genomewide association study, currently the gold standard of gene discovery, is in his view only one step along the road. Dr. Goldstein does not shy away from unpopular positions or research. In a new book, “Jacob’s Legacy” (Yale University Press), he recounts how he delved into the genetic history of Jews. Given the abuses of the past, geneticists approach with caution research in the genetics of racial or ethnic groups. But genetics can provide powerful insights into history. Because some Jewish communities, for instance, have for centuries married only within their religion, they have developed certain distinctive genetic profiles. One is a genetic signature on the Y chromosome of the hereditary Jewish priests known as cohens. Dr. Goldstein, as he describes in his book, found a set of DNA variations in the signature that allowed him to estimate when that signature first appeared — about 3,000 years ago. The date fit nicely with the presumed date of King Solomon’s reign and supported the claim that cohens were indeed descended from a high priest of around that time, even if that priest may not have been Aaron, as tradition holds. He gleaned an even deeper insight into Jewish origins from analysis of mitochondrial DNA taken from Jewish communities around the world. In 2000, a team led by Dr. Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona found that men from Jewish communities all carry a certain lineage of Y chromosomes, one that is shared by many Near Eastern peoples. That established the origin of the founding fathers of Jewish communities, but where did the founding mothers come from? Two years later, a team led by Dr. Goldstein provided the surprising answer: the mitochondrial DNA of many Jewish communities looks as if it was derived, a long time ago, from the population of the host community. Jewish communities may therefore have been founded by Jewish men, arriving perhaps as traders, who took local wives, converted them to Judaism, and thereafter married only within the religion. Dr. Goldstein had never been bar mitzvahed and had taken little interest in his Jewish heritage until as a graduate student at Stanford during the Persian Gulf war he was moved by the plight of Israeli civilians being bombarded by Saddam Hussein’s Scud missiles. After gaining his Ph.D. in 1994, he moved to England, to Oxford University and University College, London He later took an appointment at Duke, where he has focused on pharmacogenetics, the interaction between drugs and the genome. He has laid aside, at least for the moment, further research into Jewish genetic history. Another pursuit that interests him, one of high promise for reconstructing human evolutionary history, is that of discovering which genes bear the mark of recent natural selection. When a new version of a gene becomes more common, it leaves a pattern of changes that geneticists can detect with various statistical tests. Many of these selected genes reflect new diets or defenses against disease or adaptations to new climates. But they tend to differ from one race to another because each human population, after the dispersal from Africa some 50,000 years ago, has had to adapt to different circumstances. This newish finding has raised fears that other, more significant differences might emerge among races, spurring a resurrection of racist doctrines. “There is a part of the scientific community which is trying to make this work off limits, and that I think is hugely counterproductive,” Dr. Goldstein said. He says he thinks that no significant genetic differences will be found between races because of his belief in the efficiency of natural selection. Just as selection turns out to have pruned away most disease-causing variants, it has also maximized human cognitive capacities because these are so critical to survival. “My best guess is that human intelligence was always a helpful thing in most places and times and we have all been under strong selection to be as bright as we can be,” he said. This is more than just a guess, however. As part of a project on schizophrenia, Dr. Goldstein has done a genomewide association study on 2,000 volunteers of all races who were put through cognitive tests. “We have looked at the effect of common variation on cognition, and there is nothing,” Dr. Goldstein said, meaning that he can find no common genetic variants that affect intelligence. His view is that intelligence was developed early in human evolutionary history and was then standardized. At Duke, he revels in the greater freedom to pursue his own interests. “In England, there’s a much greater tendency to be wary of something too ambitious,” he said. “The feeling in the American scientific community is one of confidence — let’s get the job done.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F3 of the New York edition with the headline: A Dissenting Voice as the Genome Is Sifted to Fight Disease.

Beckham promotes Pepsi and Lineker appears in Walkers crisps commercials. Others who have signed letter include Dr Hilary Cass, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.","output":"Title: Celebrity Endorsements of Unhealthy Foods: An Urgent Call for Change Introduction: High-profile athletes and public figures, such as David Beckham and Gary Lineker, have come under increasing scrutiny for their endorsements of unhealthy food and beverage products, as a recent letter by TV chef Jamie Oliver, among others, highlights the negative impact that such marketing tactics have on children and their overall health. In an open letter, health experts, chefs, and public figures alike have voiced their concerns over the implications of the commercial use of athletes in promoting unwholesome products for children. The Problem with Athlete Endorsements: The letter criticizing the use of renowned athletes, including David Beckham promoting Pepsi and Gary Lineker appearing in Walkers crisps commercials, expresses a strong disapproval of such practices, believing that it sends the wrong message to children. The concern is rooted in the fact that children tend to look up to these celebrity athletes, who are seen as role models. If their idols endorse unhealthy food choices, children are more likely to accept, and even demand, these products - consequently leading to poor eating habits and potential health issues at a young age. Supporters of the Open Letter: Dr. Hilary Cass, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), has also put her name to the letter. As an expert in the field of child health, Dr. Cass's endorsement of the letter reflects the increasing impetus to reconsider the ethical implications of using celebrity endorsements that could adversely impact young minds. Other notable figures who have supported this call for change include Michelin-star chef, Tom Kerridge, and child health expert, Dr. Sarah Jarvis. The Need for Responsible Marketing: The involvement of celebrities endorsing products that may directly or indirectly harm children's health highlights a significant problem - dishonest advertising. This unethical approach may not only result in the misinterpretation of a product's health benefits but also validates the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages among the younger demographics. By calling out these marketing tactics, the open letter seeks to raise awareness and push for a change that emphasizes responsible marketing moving forward. Possible Solutions: To address the negative consequences of these unethical marketing practices, the open letter suggests various approaches that can be adopted: 1. Cease partnerships with athletes and celebrities: Brands and companies must reconsider teaming up with athletes and other public figures who appeal to children, mitigating the risk of promoting unhealthy products with a familiar, lovable face. 2. Encourage healthy role models: Instead of endorsing unhealthy products, athletes must set a positive example by promoting healthier alternatives. In turn, this would create healthier behaviors among children who look up to these role models. 3. Implement stricter advertisement regulations: Governments and regulatory bodies can establish robust guidelines and restrictions to ensure that environments where children are exposed (such as schools, television networks, and online platforms) are more tightly regulated in terms of promotional content. Conclusion: The recent open letter criticizing the use of athletes in commercials for unhealthy food products brings to light a critical issue - the need for conscientious marketing practices that prioritize children's health and well-being. By ceasing partnerships with athletes endorsing unhealthy products, promoting effective role models, and implementing stricter advertisement regulations, society can work towards providing a healthier and safer environment for the overall growth and development of children. As responsible global citizens, it is imperative for each one of us to advocate and support such positive initiatives that will lead to a more sustainable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: A:","output":"To answer the question, let's analyze the given answer options step-by-step: 1. Gaseous iron: Iron in the gaseous form would not typically react with nitric acid to produce hydrogen gas. The reaction of nitric acid with iron would produce iron nitrate and hydrogen gas, but gaseous iron is not a common reactant in this case. 2. Martian iron: Martian iron generally refers to the iron found on Mars. There is no specific property of \\"Martian iron\\" that would make it react differently with nitric acid compared to elemental iron. Therefore, considering it as a separate option from elemental iron does not make sense. 3. Carbon: Carbon does not typically react with nitric acid to produce hydrogen gas. In fact, nitric acid is an oxidizing agent, and it could potentially oxidize carbon, leading to carbon dioxide and water, but not to hydrogen gas. 4. Elemental iron: Elemental iron (Fe) reacts with nitric acid (HNO₃) to produce hydrogen gas (H₂) and iron nitrate (Fe(NO₃)₃). The reaction can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation: Fe (s) + 6 HNO₃ (aq) → 3 H₂ (g) + Fe(NO₃)₃ (aq) Hence the answer is elemental iron.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those. In short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What are some side effects of constipation in the elderly? Options:  A. nausea, increased heart rate  B. decreased irritability and bleeding  C. pain, irritability, bleeding  D. not enough information A:","output":"C. pain, irritability, bleeding"},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: Image copyright Shutterstock      A South African woman is recovering in hospital after being discovered alive in a mortuary fridge.      The woman was taken to Carletonville morgue, in Gauteng province, having been declared dead by paramedics following a road accident.      Ambulance company Distress Alert said she had shown \\"no form of life\\", South Africa's TimesLive website reports.      But when a morgue worker returned to check on the body in the fridge, he found the woman was breathing.      An official has confirmed to the BBC the woman is now being treated in a hospital east of Johannesburg after being referred by forensics officers. She has not been named.      An investigation into the incident is being carried out, with the family demanding answers.      \\"As a family we won't talk about this unless the police, paramedics and the mortuary officials who were involved are present.

Distress Alert operations manager Gerrit Bradnick said there was \\"no proof of any negligence\\" on his company's behalf.      \\"This did not happen because our paramedics are not properly trained,\\" he told TimesLive.      Mr Bradnick told TimesSelect she was one of several people involved in a car accident which left two others dead on Sunday, 24 June.

It is also not the first time this has happened in South Africa. Seven years ago, a 50-year-old man woke up screaming in an Eastern Cape morgue. In 2016 another road accident victim, from KwaZulu Natal, was declared dead, only to be found breathing the next day.

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

In the second sentence, \\"Nishiyama was elected as the new president of the first AAKF,\\" the focus is on Nishiyama being a new president for an already existing AAKF, and it specifies that this is the first AAKF, implying there might be more than one AAKF. This sentence suggests that Nishiyama is taking up the role of the president in an organization that has already had a history, rather than being the first president of a recently established one. Thus, the difference is on the emphasis of Nishiyama's role as the first-ever president of a new organization versus a new president for an already existing one."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Context: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

Tickets are not required for the lawn area. About Coppelia Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: \\"Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue.\\" Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, \\"It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage.\\" (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992) Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in \\tthe workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.","output":"\\"Experience the Magic of Coppélia: Free Houston Ballet Performances at Miller Outdoor Theatre on May 11-13, Sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON!\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

National news is still talking about the \\" 110 mph winds \\" of Ike , but local news is noting the highest winds clocked on Galveston Island are only 70 mph . Radar is also showing a large dry area on the east side of the eye , which one local meteorologist speculates could mean the eye is disintegrating ( it seems to be growing more diffuse , not more compact , as it comes ashore ) . You can see in the picture that the eye is starting to look like an apostrophe rather than a period . Question: What type of event is the narrator describing ?","output":"The narrator is describing a tropical cyclone or hurricane, specifically Hurricane Ike, which was a powerful storm that affected the Gulf Coast of the United States in September 2008. The storm's impact can be inferred from the mention of wind speeds, radar imagery, and the eye of the storm. The discussion of the disintegration or diffusion of the storm's eye suggests that the storm is undergoing a transformation, possibly indicating that it is weakening as it approaches land. The mention of differences between national and local news sources highlights the variability in reporting about the storm's strength and the specific conditions in the affected areas, such as Galveston Island. Tropical cyclones, or hurricanes, as they are known in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific, are massive low-pressure systems that form over warm ocean waters and bring strong winds, heavy rain, and coastal flooding to impacted regions. Hurricane Ike was a particularly destructive storm, classified as a Category 2 hurricane at its peak intensity, which caused massive devastation in the Caribbean and along the Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana. The mention of an \\"apostrophe\\" instead of a \\"period\\" to describe the storm's eye indicates that the storm's structure is becoming less concentric and organized. This is a crucial observation that meteorologists use when analyzing the development and potential intensity of a tropical cyclone. A well-defined eye is usually a sign of a stronger, more intense storm, while a disorganized or less distinct eye could indicate a storm that is weakening or encountering unfavorable conditions for further development. In conclusion, the narrator is describing the conditions and observations of Hurricane Ike, a powerful tropical cyclone that affected the Gulf Coast of the United States in September 2008. The focus of the discussion revolves around the wind speeds, radar imagery, and the eye of the storm, providing insight into the complex and impactful nature of such a meteorological event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: If you entire body is experiencing fatigue what would you do at the end of the day? Possible A: sleep, sit down, sit on chair, have rest, lie on floor  Why is \\"sleep\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Sleep\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in response to the question of what one would do if their entire body is experiencing fatigue at the end of the day for several reasons: 1. Physical Recovery: Sleep offers the body a chance to recover and repair itself after a long day's work. During sleep, the body releases growth hormones, repairs tissues, and restores energy levels, which helps alleviate and counteract feelings of fatigue. 2. Mental Restoration: Sleep is essential for cognitive function, including memory consolidation and problem-solving abilities. A good night's sleep helps the brain process and store new information, allowing the mind to be rejuvenated and ready for the next day. 3. Emotional Well-being: Sleep is crucial for maintaining overall emotional well-being. It helps reduce stress, anxiety, and irritability, which are often linked to fatigue. By getting adequate sleep, individuals can better manage their emotions and feel more energized. 4. Duration of Rest: Comparatively, sleep provides a more prolonged period of rest than merely sitting down or taking a short break. An entire night's sleep gives the body ample time to recover and replenish its resources. 5. Biological Need: Sleep is a fundamental biological need for humans. It is a natural response to fatigue, as the body has evolved to require regular periods of rest to function optimally. Sleep maintains a balance in the body's internal systems, including thermoregulation, immune function, and hormone production. In summary, \\"sleep\\" aligns with human common sense as an appropriate response to fatigue at the end of the day because it offers physical, mental, and emotional restoration, and it is a natural and necessary biological process for maintaining overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I see that the status is under Credit Review. 2) Definitions: \\ta) Interest Payment Date- should state \\"3 business days after the Valuation Date\\" \\tb) Reference Price- amend the phrase \\"..last regular way trade...\\" to state \\"...Official Closing Price...\\" in (i) and (ii)(b)(iii). c) Securities- Omit the reference to \\"Bonds\\". The definition should only read: \\"are the securities specified as such in the Confirmation\\". d) Valuation Date (s)- October 15, 2001, November 15, 2001, ... October 15, 2002 \\t 3) Section 5.1 (i)- Omit the reference to Bonds. This section (i) should read: \\"If a Security pays a dividend or makes another distribution, the payment to be made by the Seller shall be equal to the gross amount of the cash dividend or distribution per share (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any tax credits), as the case may be, multiplied by the Dividend Percentage, multiplied by the Contract Quantity\\". We should include a definition for \\"Dividend Payment Date\\" to read, \\"The Equity Payment Date relating to the Valuation Date (s) on which the relevant Dividend Period ends\\". We should also include a definition for \\"Dividend Amount\\". The \\"Dividend Amount\\" definition should read, \\"100% of all ordinary cash dividends where; (i) the ex-dividend date occurs during the period from the day following the Trade Date to and including the final Valuation Date and (ii) the date on which the related ordinary cash dividend would have been received by persons who held the Shares comprising the Basket during such period is during the relevent Dividend Period\\". I believe we should address Section 5.2 \\"Potential Adjustment Event\\". We should recommend replacing the language similar to the Intra-Period Adjustment language we utilitized in the Enron Credit Confirmation. Their section allows CSFB to \\"determine\\" the provisions of the Intra-Period Adjustments. CSFB should not have control over determining any additonal payment or adjustment of the Opening Price or Contract Quantity. The Intra-Period adjustment language is comprehensive in covering all provisions therein. 4) Schedule to Basket Swaps: \\ta) Applicable Interest Rate Cycle: should read \\"1 month\\" \\tb) Termination Date: should read \\"1 year\\" \\tc) Business Day Convention: should be the standard ISDA \\"Modified Following Business Day Convention\\" language. 5) We should also include the Annex structure to be able to monitor the positions held, along with any subsequent adjustments, in the Equity Swap Basket at any time throughout the deal.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: A surge in interest in the Greens has taken the party to 11 per cent in a new opinion poll. The new survey by Lord Ashcroft puts the Greens up three points in just a week, ahead of the Lib Dems and just behind Ukip, after their profile was boosted by a row over being excluded from TV debates. The poll and focus group findings will make grim reading for the other parties, with Labour and the Tories both on less than 30 per cent and Ed Miliband likened to a zoo animal 'you're not bothered whether you see or not'. The latest survey for Lord Ashcroft puts the Green party on 11 per cent, up three points in a week. While much attention has been focused on the rise of Ukip in recent months, the Greens have made steady gains. The party boasts that its membership had reached 44,175 in England and Wales, higher than the 41,943 claimed by Ukip last week and almost level with the 44,526 issued by the Liberal Democrats in November. The Labour party has been warned it has failed to take the threat of the Green party seriously. One in five people saying they will back the Greens voted Lib Dem in 2010, precisely the people Labour needs to woo to win. The Ashcroft survey puts the Tories ahead on 29 per cent and Labour on 28 per cent. Ukip is on 15 per cent, and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Lord Ashcroft said: 'One factor could be that the Greens have benefited from their prominence in the arguments over TV debates – in which case it will be interesting to see in the coming weeks whether they can sustain their share.' The Labour party has been warned it has failed to take the threat of the Green party seriously, with former Lib Dems turning Green. As a nation of animal lovers, it is no surprise Britons come to see their politicians as members of the animal kingdom. But a lot depends on whether they are a predator or prey depends. Lord Ashcroft asked a series of focus groups what they thought of the party leaders. He found David Cameron was viewed as a fox for 'being smart and sleek' while others described the PM as a giraffe, 'looking down on everybody'. Ukip leader Nigel Farage was branded a peacock or a weasel while Nick Clegg was dismissed as 'a Chihuahua in David Cameron’s handbag'. But Labour's Ed Miliband left most voters blank, telling the pollster: 'Certainly not a predator… one of those animals that, when you go to the zoo, you’re not bothered whether you see it or not.' Today Green party leader Natalie Bennett predicted a 'political earthquake' at the general election and said believes that the public are moving away from 'business-as-usual politics'. She said it was vital for her party to be included in any TV debates to provide balance as voters are moving away from the 'old boys' club' of Westminster. Ms Bennett was speaking at the launch of a poster campaign aimed at the leaders of the main parties, entitled 'What are you afraid of, boys?', to challenge broadcasters to include the Greens in any televised debates between party leaders. Ms Bennett said: 'I have seen a whole slew of surveys last week that showed that the public want the Green Party represented in these debates, and of course we had a petition with 275,000 people saying, 'invite the Greens'. 'The arguments don't stack up - the broadcasters have to invite the Greens.' 'It is very clear that we should be there if this is going to be a balanced debate.' Ms Bennett said it was time to move on from the traditional 'old boys' club of Westminster, and that debates should be inclusive and help promote that. Last week she wrote to Labour leader Ed Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip Leader Nigel Farage, urging them to back calls for them to be involved in the debates. She revealed Mr Farage had written back to her, 'basically saying 'no'.' 'This is the Green surge,' Ms Bennett said. 'We don't know where it is going, but it is certain that politics in Britain is not going to be the same again, and that is a very good thing. 'Let's get past the debating about the debates and let's actually debate the issues that we so desperately need, given the state of Britain today.' Green party leader Natalie Bennett predicted a 'political earthquake' at the general election and said believes that the public are moving away from 'business-as-usual politics' Asked what sort of animal Labour's Ed Miliband would be, the focus group told the pollster: 'Certainly not a predator… one of those animals that, when you go to the zoo, you’re not bothered whether you see it or not.' David Cameron was viewed by voters as a fox for 'being smart and sleek' while others described the PM as a giraffe, 'looking down on everybody' Ms Bennett said the 'Green surge' pointed to the fact that politics is changing 'very fast', and that the main political parties were afraid of the political ground shifting. She said: 'There is a real potential at this election that we could see politics break wide open.' Polls and studies suggest Britain politics faces being plunged into chaos after the election, with at least three parties would be needed to form a coalition. At the weekend political commentator Iain Dale predict Labour will win 300 seats and the Tories 279, but both would need at least two other parties to secure a majority of the 650 MPs in the Commons. A separate survey showed a third of Scots want to see Britain run by a Labour-SNP coalition which could put Alex Salmond in the Cabinet. Mr Miliband faces the grim prospect of a Labour wipeout north of the border, seriously damaging his hopes of securing an overall majority in the general election in May.","output":"The Green party is gaining popularity and has reached 11% in a recent opinion poll. This is higher than the Lib Dems and just behind Ukip. People are liking the Green party more because they were left out of TV debates, and this made them more well-known. The Green party now has more members than Ukip and almost as many as the Liberal Democrats. This could be a problem for the Labour party because some people who voted Lib Dem in the past might now vote for the Green party instead. The Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, thinks that there will be big changes in politics during the next general election. She wants the Green party to be included in TV debates so that people can hear different ideas and choose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Title: Friday Night Lights Movie plot: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself.

Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury.

A close-knit community rallies together in support. In a small town near Houston, Texas, a community faces an unexpected crisis as one of their beloved high school football players, 16-year-old Jason Thompson, suffers a stroke while playing in a game. Thompson, a talented young athlete, talented student, and beloved friend, collapsed in the middle of the football game last Friday, sending shockwaves through the town and placing the spotlight on the rare condition that almost cost him his life. During a regular play, Thompson took a hit to the head which seemingly came as no shock to spectators. Yet, moments later, he would collapse on the field struggling to regain consciousness. With urgent care and quick responses from the coaches, medical staff, and family members, Thompson was rushed to the nearby hospital, where doctors discovered the unimaginable reality - Jason had suffered a stroke. Strokes in teenagers are extremely rare, with research indicating that only about 10 in 100,000 children experience strokes annually. In Jason's case, a blood clot had formed in his brain, causing the devastating incident. Doctors and neurologists quickly took action, performing an emergency surgery known as a thrombectomy to remove the clot and alleviate the pressure on his brain. Jason's family and friends anxiously awaited the results in the waiting room, their hearts heavy with concern. In the days following the surgery, Jason remained in a coma, his condition stable but critical. The community continued to rally around their cherished young football player. The school organized fundraisers and shared updates on Jason's condition through social media, creating a widespread outpour of love and support both online and offline. As word spread about Jason's condition, messages poured in from football players and coaches across the country. Other stroke survivors shared their own experiences and words of encouragement, highlighting the power of community support during this difficult time. While the road to recovery remains long and uncertain, Jason gradually shows signs of progress. A recent MRI scan revealed minimal brain damage, and his mobility and cognitive function have begun to improve. There are promising signs that, with continued care, support, and rehabilitation, Jason may still have the opportunity to make a remarkable recovery. This heart-wrenching incident highlights the importance of recognizing the symptoms of stroke in young people, as early detection and treatment can save lives. Health organizations emphasize the need to educate people on the signs of stroke, even in teenagers and young adults. The acronym FAST (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties, and Time) can help individuals quickly identify stroke symptoms and take action. As the town of Houston and the larger football community comes together for Jason and his family, this tragic event serves as a poignant reminder of the power found within a supportive community. For young players everywhere, keeping an eye out for one another can be a matter of life and death. This story reaches beyond the lines of one football field and teaches the invaluable lessons of empathy, awareness, and unity in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ginger should feel solid and should not have any soft spots. Feel around the root with your hands and look for noticeable spots of rot. Peeled ginger will darken around the edges when it starts to go bad. Cut off the ends of the root with a sharp chef’s knife. Cutting a little off of each side will make it easier to hold the ginger rather than working with an irregular shape. Try to only cut off a small portion from the edges so you do not waste any of the usable ginger. Stand the ginger on one of its ends, and use a sharp knife or vegetable peeler to remove the rest of the skin. Slice in a downward motion towards the cutting board. Remember to try and remove as little of the skin as possible. Alternatively, you can use the edge of a spoon to scrape the peel off of fresh ginger. This works especially well on the rounded knobs that may be difficult to reach with a knife. Peeled ginger should be stored in a freezer-safe resealable bag and keeps for 1 week. Frozen ginger is easier to grate since it hardens up.  Unpeeled ginger keeps in the freezer for up to 3 months. Allow it time to thaw before peeling it.  Peeled ginger can be grated as soon as it’s pulled out from the freezer.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To address your questions, I will break down the answers step by step and provide justification for each step. Question 1: What are signs of low blood sugar? Step 1: Identifying the primary context:  - The primary context is \\"low blood sugar,\\" which is a medical condition known as hypoglycemia. Step 2: Listing symptoms of low blood sugar: - Some common signs of low blood sugar include shakiness, dizziness, sweating, confusion, irritability, headache, blurred vision, difficulty in thinking, fatigue, rapid heartbeat, and fainting. Step 3: Presenting the answer: - The signs of low blood sugar are shakiness, dizziness, sweating, confusion, irritability, headache, blurred vision, difficulty in thinking, fatigue, rapid heartbeat, and fainting. Justification: Identifying the primary context allows for a clear understanding of low blood sugar and its symptoms. Listing these symptoms accurately answers the question at hand. Question 2: What happens when someone has low blood sugar? Step 1: Explaining the causes of low blood sugar: - Understanding the reason behind low blood sugar is crucial. Some common causes include diabetes medications, skipping meals, consuming less carbohydrates, excessive exercise, or drinking alcohol without eating. Step 2: Describing the body's response: - When blood sugar levels are low, the body cannot function optimally. It may use stored glucose or release stress hormones to raise blood sugar levels naturally. Step 3: Presenting the answer: - When someone has low blood sugar, their body is unable to function properly due to lack of available energy sources. This can lead to symptoms like shakiness, dizziness, and confusion. The body may also try to raise blood sugar levels by breaking down stored glucose or releasing stress hormones. Justification: Explaining the causes and the body's response to low blood sugar helps provide a comprehensive answer to the question, creating a deeper understanding of the issue. Now, to address your final question: Would the answer to these two questions be the same? No, the answers to these two questions are not the same.

Step 2: Be patient - Give her enough time and space to grieve and process the loss of her fiance before approaching her with your romantic interest. Step 3: Examine your intentions - Ensure that your intentions are pure and you truly care about her well-being, not just in pursuit of a romantic relationship. Step 4: Communicate your feelings - If the appropriate time has passed and you still have feelings for her, communicate your feelings in an empathetic, supportive, and non-pressure way, respecting her decision whatever it may be. 2.

Step 2: Consider the implications - Understand that pursuing a relationship with your ex-girlfriend's best friend can strain their friendship and your relationship with your ex-girlfriend. Step 3: Open communication - Talk to your ex-girlfriend about your feelings, if you are on good terms, to gauge her reaction and discuss the potential consequences of pursuing a relationship with her best friend. Step 4: Build a connection - If you have considered the implications and still wish to pursue a relationship, make an effort to genuinely connect with the best friend by showing interest in her hobbies, beliefs, and values. Be kind, considerate, and impress her by being yourself.

Given the question: This article: Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity.... contains an answer for the question: What is the title of the song that contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords?, what is it ?

This way of thinking was called the \\"Stone Philosophy.\\" It was called this because it was all about using tiny pieces of wisdom, like little stones, to build big, strong ideas in our minds. In this story, we are going to talk about the main ideas in the Stone Philosophy, and how they can help us become better, happier people. 1. The Kindness Stone In the Stone Philosophy, the first important idea is called the \\"Kindness Stone.\\" It teaches us to be nice to everyone we meet, even if they are not being nice to us. If we treat others with kindness, we will make new friends, and our hearts will feel warm and happy. 2. The Patience Stone The second important idea in the Stone Philosophy is the \\"Patience Stone.\\" It teaches us to wait quietly and calmly for things we want, even if it takes a really long time. By being patient, we can stay calm and relaxed, even when things are hard or confusing. 3. The Sharing Stone The third important idea in the Stone Philosophy is the \\"Sharing Stone.\\" It teaches us to share what we have with others, even if we do not want to. Sharing makes other people happy, and it also helps us understand that our happiness comes from giving, not just from having. 4. The Gratitude Stone The fourth important idea in the Stone Philosophy is the \\"Gratitude Stone.\\" It teaches us to say \\"thank you\\" for the things we have and the kind things that other people do for us. By being thankful, we can remember to feel happy and blessed for everything in our lives. 5. The Imagination Stone  The fifth important idea in the Stone Philosophy is the \\"Imagination Stone.\\" It teaches us to use our minds to create, dream, and think of new ideas. By using our imaginations, we can make the world a more magical, fun, and interesting place. 6. The Love Stone The last important idea in the Stone Philosophy is the \\"Love Stone.\\" It teaches us to love everyone, even people who are different from us or who we do not understand. By loving others, our hearts grow bigger and stronger, and the world becomes a happier place. So, next time you see a beautiful stone outside, remember the ideas of the Stone Philosophy. Try to live your life with kindness, patience, sharing, gratitude, imagination, and love.

News article: After more than four decades on the airwaves in Atlanta, Neal Boortz this morning announced that he is ending his syndicated talk show on January 21, 2013, replaced by former presidential candidate Herman Cain.      Cain will cohost the day the president elect is officially inaugurated and then takes over solo on Tuesday, January 22.      “I’m going to miss everything associated with doing a talk show,” Boortz said on air as his producer Belinda Skelton teared up.      He said he is not doing this for health reasons. “I am not doing this because I’m fixing to die,” he said. “I have absolutely no health problems period.” Rather, he wants to travel with his wife Donna, something he said is difficult to do as a full-time talk-show host. He even purchased a tour bus to rove the country.      “We’re going to call this Neal’s happy ending,” he added later with a glint in his eye.      After his first break, post announcement, associate producer Christina Gonzalez popped the champagne. Cain ambled in a few minutes later and grabbed a glass. “Mr. Boortz,” he said. “Your announcement was pure Boortz.”      Boortz, 67, has been the longest running talk show host on Atlanta radio. He is now heard locally on 95.5FM and AM750 News/Talk WSB from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. weekdays.      On December 5, 2012, he said he’s going to take the month off. After New Year’s, he will work until January 21.      “Neal is my brother from another mother,” Cain said on air. “Congratulations on the retirement. Congratulations on 42 years in this business.”      Boortz said he will do daily commentaries for Cain and will be a fill in for Cain and Erick Erickson, who is heard on WSB from 6 to 8 p.m. weeknights. Currently, Cain has been the primary fill in for Boortz.      Boortz estimated since he started in radio, he has taken 280,000 phone calls. “And 260,000 got cut off,” he said.      During a break, Skelton said Boortz intimated to her two years ago that he wanted to retired in early 2013. “It always seemed so far away,” she said. “For the past year, my stomach has been in absolute knots. It was hard for him. He loves what he does.”      Program Director Pete Spriggs said he was aware of Boortz’s intentions but they agreed to make this announcement relatively early. “He wanted it off his chest,” Spriggs said. At the same time, Spriggs wanted to have a successor ready to go so he was glad to convince Cain to take over.      “I feel great,” Boortz said on air at 11:18 a.m. when fellow syndicated host Clark Howard stopped by. “Last week, I felt really down. Right now, I’m feeling great. I don’t know how I will feel tomorrow. But I have no doubt I made the right decision.”      In 1970, on what was then called 680/WRNG-AM in Atlanta, Boortz took over for a morning host who had just committed suicide – a story he loves to tell.      He earned a law degree and juggled radio and a private practice from 1977 to 1992.      Boortz joined WSB in 1993 when it was just on the AM side. He’s a workaholic who spends four and a half hours on air every day, longer than most hosts, and Tweets several times a day.      A self-proclaimed Libertarian, Boortz usually supports Republican policies and candidates but isn’t always in line with them on social issues such as abortion, gay marriage and drug enforcement. He espouses smaller government but has been more hawkish about terrorism after 9/11 than many Libertarians.      He portrays himself as an entertainer and castigates people who merely echo what he says and don’t think for themselves. His daily line about himself: “Home of the high priest of the Church of the Painful Truth.”      Boortz has written four books. The most impactful was 2005’s “The Fair Tax Book,” which advocates dropping the federal income tax in favor of a national sales tax. In a press conference early Monday afternoon, Boortz said he is working on another book about stories as a radio host and plans to release it as an e-book.      He demurred when asked about a future in politics after he retires but didn’t say no. He did acknowledge his wife Donna is highly active in the Mitt Romney campaign.      Although Boortz still has a home in Atlanta, he now spends most of his time in Naples, Fla. He grew up in several different places, including Florida, attended Texas A&M and spent several years in various professions before radio such as jewelry and carpet buyer, insurance salesman and a speech writer.      He has been lauded by radio groups across the nation over the years, entering the national Radio Hall of Fame in 2009.      Cain, a 66-year-old former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, joined WSB in 2008 as an evening talk show host until early 2011, when he decided to run for president. His bid ended in December. Since January, he has provided daily commentaries on Boortz’s show and has continued to sub in for Boortz.      Cain’s radio footprint will now be national. Boortz is heard on about 240 radio stations. Talkers magazine, which tracks talk radio, estimates Boortz draws more than six million listeners a week, tied with Laura Ingraham for seventh.      “For all practical purposes,” Cain said on the air, “I am done with politics. Essentially, I wanted to continue to express my views and help educate people on what’s going on in this country.”      Cain will do his show each day from 9 a.m. to noon. “That is still a significant commitment a day,” he said during a press conference Monday afternoon. “When I subbed in for his four and a half hours, it was exhausting!”      Dan Kearney, market manager for Cox Radio Atlanta, said WSB will decide later what it will do with the noon to 1 p.m. slot, as well as 8:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. He also noted that Cain has huge name recognition, even better than Boortz, thanks to his presidential run.      Cain said he had other offers, including TV and radio gigs. But this syndication deal was the most enticing. It will allow him to make TV appearances and do speeches across the country. He declined to say how long his deal will last.      Want more photos from the day? John Spink of the AJC posted a photo gallery.                  Join my Facebook fan page and Twitter.

William Temple put on the classic militia outfit, grabbed the Gadsden flag, and headed to Herman Cain’s Sunday night reception. He has 12 different get-ups to re-enact different military eras, but this one—tan sailcloth, black leather gaiters, tricorner hat—goes over the best at Tea Party events.      David Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.      Reporters love this. Temple is probably the most-photographed soldier of the Tea Party movement. Alas, it’s Sunday night at a hotel in a particularly anonymous quadrant of the Washington, D.C. suburbs. Barely 150 people have shown up. So Temple grabs appetizers. There are four nearby tables piled high with grape leaves, various cheeses, pita bread tips, and charcuteries.      “I’m here to support Mr. Cain in whatever he does,” says Temple. “What the media did to force him out of the race—that was one of the worst things ever done in this country. I emailed [Fox News reporter] Carl Cameron on it, and said it was a high-tech lynching. He emailed back, and said ‘I’m not an investigative reporter.’ This was Fox News! Fox News carried this story with no proof.”      Advertisement            A waiter walks by, cradling a tray of crabcakes, each approximately the size of a gummy eraser.      “Ah, yes!” says Temple, affecting his revolutionary-era accent. (Think of an extra from the John Adams mini-series.) “I’ll have a full regiment.”      The waiter moves over to Judson Phillips, the founder of Tea Party Nation and mastermind of the February 2010 National Tea Party Convention. That event cost up to 549 per ticket. This event is free. Phillips passes on the crab cake anyway, as he scans the crowd for networking opportunities. Look, there are leaders from Tea Party Patriots! Over there—that’s the editor of Tea Party Review magazine!      “Herman Cain is becoming the man of the moment, as far as the Tea Party’s concerned,” says Phillips. “What’s his role in the movement now? I’d call him a strategic planner without a portfolio.”      You can chortle at the empty chairs and uneaten catering at the Renaissance Hotel, but put it in perspective: The inspiration is a guy who dropped out of the presidential race before any of the primaries. He had to drop out because middle-aged women kept materializing in TV studios and describing grabby encounters with the former National Restaurant Association boss. As he was quitting, he spent more than 300,000 on legal bills.      And yet here he is, still beloved by the movement that briefly made him a legit threat to Mitt Romney. Here’s Mark Block, Cain’s chief of staff, still Internet-famous for the campaign video that featured him free-associating about Cain’s “campaign like no other” and smoking a cigarette in front of a brick wall.      “How many candidates dropped out of the race?” he asks, rhetorically. “Herman didn’t go away. Here’s a joke among staff that we love. He took ‘three days of vacation’ after the announcement, okay? Two and a half days of that, he was working, setting up Cain Solutions.”      Quitting the presidential race worked out brilliantly for Cain. Contrast his life with that of Newt Gingrich, still technically running for president. Cain now heads three organizations, with loosely defined goals—Cain Connections, Cain Solutions, and the Herman Cain Foundation. At this reception, he will announce a video channel called CTV. Its flagship show, confusingly enough will be called Cain TV. A short preview shows the host, a beefy joke writer named Rodney Lee Conover, mocking the life and loves of Sandra Fluke as a cartoon of the birth-control advocate sprawls lazily and lustily on a dorm room bed.      It compares awfully well to the no-end-in-sight tragedy that is Newt 2012. When he left Congress, Gingrich started founding think tanks and holding conferences that people actually showed up to—the strategy that Cain is Xeroxing. Those think tanks, now Newt-less, are shutting down. Running for president doesn’t give Gingrich space in the media to share his grand ideas. It gets him headlines about being bit by penguins. The life of the professional has-been is sweeter than the life of the has-been candidate. ||||| Herman Cain is going back on the air.      The pizza entrepreneur turned talk-show host turned presidential candidate turned unlikely tax policy advocate is turning back into a talk-show host.      Cain is set to replace Neal Boortz on Atlanta's News/Talk WSB. Boortz announced Monday that after 20 years of hosting “The Neal Boortz Show,\\" he's giving up the microphone in January. The libertarian-leaning host has more than 6 million weekly listeners, according to WSB, and is known as the \\"the high priest of the church of the painful truth.\\"      Cain is known to many as the high point of weirdness in the 2012 GOP presidential primary season. His bid shot out of nowhere last year, as restless Republican voters seemed to be looking for something different.

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established.

The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.

News article: Psychic Wins Libel Lawsuit Against U.K. Tabloid The Daily Mail had called her a \\"charlatan\\" in a 2011 article Perhaps Sally Morgan got a signal from the spiritual realm that she was about to get a lot richer. Or maybe she just figured she had a good enough case to win a lawsuit. Either way, her intuition proved correct: On Thursday, the British medium was awarded 193,000 in damages from the Daily Mail, which had printed a story calling her a “charlatan.” A September 22, 2011 article purported that Morgan was lying when she claimed to be receiving messages from the dead during a performance in Dublin, Ireland. It went on to speculate that she was actually receiving the messages from crew members backstage via a hidden earpiece. The author of the article, Paul Zenon, is a British magician who had previously expressed skepticism about Morgan’s claims of supernatural ability. (MORE: Psychic Claims That Steve Jobs Isn’t Having a Nice Afterlife) Zenon made the allegation after two women called into an Irish radio show claiming they overheard crew members feeding the psychic messages. But it turned out that the crew members were not employed by the psychic and had no contact with her during the show. (They were lighting technicians working at the theater.) Morgan’s lawyer argued that the accusations pushed her into litigation. “It… caused enormous distress to Mrs. Morgan, who decided, given the newspaper’s initial defense of the article, that she had no choice but to commence legal proceedings against the publisher of the Daily Mail,” attorney Graham Atkins told a London court. The Daily Mail apologized and agreed on a settlement and payment of her legal bills. “The Daily Mail withdraws the suggestion that Mrs. Morgan used a secret earpiece at her Dublin show in September 2011 to receive messages from off-stage, thereby cheating her audience, which it accepts is untrue,” attorney Brid Lawson told the court. On her website, Morgan says that she was libeled and accused of trying to con her audiences. “That accusation was totally unfounded and the subsequent fall out has affected me, my family, my career, my health and the good reputation I have built up over many years. It was an unjustified and unfair attack and it has been a very difficult, costly and painful process to get where I am today and to rectify that wrong,” she wrote. It should be noted that the lawsuit was specifically over claims of Morgan using the earpiece and did not specifically address her psychic ability. And while the psychic prevailed in this case, her profession is frequently the target of negative publicity. In 2004, psychic Sylvia Brown told the mother of missing Cleveland teenager Amanda Berry that her daughter was dead. Berry was found alive in May with two other women after being held captive for a decade. After a firestorm of criticism, Browne responded: “I have been more right than wrong … Only God is right all the time.” MORE: Found: Timeline of Ohio Women Missing Since 2002 What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1.

The Vikings' twelfth game was an interconference duel with the Bills inside their dome and the first home game for interim head coach Leslie Frazier. On their first series, QB Brett Favre attempted a pass, but he was hit from behind and was intercepted by Bills CB Drayton Florence. Favre was slow to get up afterwards and he was able to walk off the field on his own power, but did not return to the game, citing a shoulder injury (later revealed to be a sprain in his throwing shoulder). At 297 consecutive starts over 19 seasons, this injury would put an end to Favre's all-time NFL consecutive start streak.  In his place, backup QB Tarvaris Jackson took over for the rest of the game. They got off to a bad start after Jackson's pass was intercepted by CB Drayton Florence and returned 40 yards for a touchdown. They overcame this deficit with Jackson getting a 31-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. It was originally ruled an interception, but Frazier challenged the play and the officials sided with the Vikings, saying that Rice had two hands on the ball, resulting in a touchdown. It was followed in the second quarter by RB Adrian Peterson getting a 2-yard and a 3-yard TD run. Then Jackson found Rice again on a 6-yard TD pass, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 38-yard field goal. They continued to dominate in the fourth quarter when Peterson ran 43 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. The Bills responded with QB Ryan Fitzpatrick getting a 12-yard TD pass to TE David Nelson.

The suggested changes have raised concerns among Serbian officials who believe that these modifications may have implications for the region's stability and Serbia's national interests. The United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) was established in 1999 to provide support during the aftermath of the Kosovo conflict. To this day, it continues to assist in maintaining peace and fostering political dialogue between the Serbian government and the partially recognized Kosovan government. The reconfiguration called for by the United Nations Secretary-General aims to adapt to the current political situation in the region and focus on more defined areas of support and engagement. However, Serbian authorities view these proposed changes with skepticism. They argue that the reconfiguration of UNMIK could inadvertently disrupt the delicate balance between Serbia and Kosovo, potentially reigniting old tensions and conflicts. Furthermore, Serbia maintains that any reformation of the mission should be thoroughly discussed and agreed upon by all parties involved, including the Serbian government. Serbia's concerns stem from its long-standing dispute with Kosovo, which declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. Although Kosovo has been recognized by over a hundred UN member states, it has yet to gain full recognition from the international community, including Serbia. The unresolved tensions between the two entities further heighten the potential risk of the proposed reconfiguration. In taking these factors into account, the following steps can be enacted to address Serbia's concerns: 1. Encourage open dialogue between all parties involved, including the governments of Serbia and Kosovo, to ensure mutual understanding and agreement on any proposed changes. 2. Establish an impartial review committee to assess the potential impact of the reconfiguration and provide recommendations that consider the ongoing complex relationship between Serbia and Kosovo. 3. Maintain a comprehensive monitoring system to swiftly identify any emerging tensions or security risks that may arise as a result of the reconfiguration, enabling quick response and conflict prevention. 4. Prioritize transparency and inclusivity in the decision-making process when assessing potential changes to the mission, so that all relevant parties are well-informed and have the opportunity to voice their concerns. By taking these cautious measures, it is possible to address Serbia's concerns while still pursuing the necessary adaptations to modernize the UN's peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. Considering the region's delicate political landscape, it is imperative to balance the pursuit of progress with the preservation of stability and peace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Trump probably feels that he should go forward with the plan despite some polls indicating it is viewed negatively because... Options:  A. He needs any kind of tax plan to remain president  B. not enough information  C. The people that voted for him like it  D. He needs the money to help accomplish his executive goals Answer:","output":"C.

Summarize this article: It takes deer take 2-4 weeks to adjust to a new diet, so start feeding them gradually. Slowly introducing new types of food into a deer's diet will help their digestive system learn to process it. Deer typically eat woody vegetation that is found in forests, so feeding them foods that are rich in fats and carbohydrates can be extremely harmful. Begin introducing new foods by combining supplemental foods with deer's natural diet. Start by including a small amount of the new food, and gradually incorporate more and more, ultimately replacing their natural diet. In winter, their natural food supply will decrease significantly (if not completely), so it is recommended to begin this transition before winter hits. These mixes can typically be found at feed mills or pet supply stores. Deer feed mixes are usually a mix of alfalfa, oats, soybeans, molasses and several vitamins and minerals. This type of food is easiest for deer to digest, which is what makes it ideal for supplemental feeding. You must be careful when feeding deer supplemental foods, as they have a sensitive digestive system. If formulated deer food mixtures are unavailable, oats are the next best supplemental food for deer. Oats provide deer with a healthy mixture of fiber and carbohydrates without disrupting their digestive system.  A wide variety of fruits and vegetables – including apples, grapes, cherries, pears, carrots, and snap peas – are eaten in nature by deer. Therefore, it is safe to feed deer these fruits. Acorns are another safe food source. A deer's digestive system is complex, and corn happens to be one of the worst types of food for them. Unfortunately, many deer end up extremely sick or dead because animal lovers believe that corn is good for deer. When deer are offered a sudden supply of corn, they aren't able to adjust to the high carbohydrate diet, and they end up dying. In nature, deer eat twigs and other natural forest vegetation. To provide them with more of their natural food source, cut down branches that are out of their reach. This is one of the safest and most natural ways to keep deer fed throughout the year. Summary:","output":"Deer require 2-4 weeks to adjust to a new diet, and the process should be gradual to help their digestive system adapt.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: In the Indonesian port city of Surabaya, Fred Wilson, a spokesman and promotions specialist for a huge oil conglomerate, Petrox, is preparing a voyage aboard one of the corporation's exploration ships. As the ship sets sail, a stowaway steals on to the boat and hides under the canvas cover of a life boat.The ship makes its way through the stormy south Indian Ocean. Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat. The stranger identifies himself as Jeff Prescott, a paleo-primatologist, who had snuck aboard the ship specifically because it was going to the island. He talks about the island's other secret: that a large beast inhabits the island, is the dominate life form there and is worshipped as a god by the local native tribe.

Context: Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.","output":"Father John Augustine Zahm belonged to the Catholic Church.

Movie plot title: A Bug's Life Movie plot: Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, lives in a colony of ants in the middle of a dried creek. They are led by Princess Atta and her mother, the Queen. The colony is oppressed by a gang of marauding grasshoppers, led by Hopper, that arrive every season demanding food from the ants. One day, when the annual offering is accidentally knocked into a stream by Flik's latest invention, a grain-harvesting device, the grasshoppers demand twice as much food as compensation. The ants trick Flik into accepting his plan to recruit \\"warrior bugs\\" to fight off the grasshoppers. While Flik actually believes in the plan, the other ants see it as an opportunity to get rid of Flik and save themselves trouble. Making his way to the \\"big city\\" (a heap of trash under a trailer), Flik mistakes a group of circus bugs that have recently been dismissed by their money-hungry ringmaster, P.T. Flea, for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. After they arrive, the circus bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings during a welcome performance by the ants. The circus bugs then attempt to leave, but are forced back by a bird that attacks the group. They save Dot, Atta's younger sister, from the bird as they flee, gaining the ants' respect in the process. At Flik's insistence, they continue the ruse of being \\"warriors\\" so the troupe can continue to enjoy the attention and hospitality of the ants. The bird encounter inspires Flik into creating a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What does the butler's ex wife ask The Lone Wolf to do?, using the article: In 1947, Inspector Garvey of Scotland Yard suspects Michael Lanyard, the reformed jewel thief known as \\"The Lone Wolf\\" is behind the theft of the priceless diamonds called the \\"Eyes of the Nile\\". Lanyard denies any involvement claiming that he is in London with his butler, Claudius Jamison to write a book on the jewels and was in New York when they were stolen.  Lanyard and Jamison are short of funds and when Ann Kelmscott, the daughter of wealthy gem collector Sir John Kelmscott, invites them to the family estate, they agree. Sir John confides that he is in desperate need of money and asks Lanyard to arrange a confidential loan with part of his jewel collection as collateral. Jamison tells his master that Lily  (Queenie Leonard), the maid, told him the butler, Henry Robards, is heartbroken because his former wife, actress Iris Chatham, has run off with Monty Beresford who financed the lavish stage production that launched Iris to stardom.  Back at his hotel, Lanyard receives a call from Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscotts. At her apartment, Robards begs her for a reconciliation, but she demands something first. Lanyard decides to accept Kelmscott's offer and arranges to meet Bruce Tang, a gem dealer the next morning. Kelmscott gives Robards a packet of jewels to deliver to Lanyard but he steals the Eyes of the Nile for Iris. David Woolerton, Ann's fiancé, asks him for a ride because he wants to spy on Lanyard. At Tang's shop, Inspector Garvey has followed Lanyard. When Robards' car rolls to a stop, the butler is dead behind the wheel, the jewels still in his possession but the Eyes of the Nile are gone. Woolerton claims Robards pushed him out of the car on the outskirts, and said he suspects Lanyard was the murderer., what would be the answer ?","output":"The answer to the question \\"What does the butler's ex-wife, Iris Chatham, ask The Lone Wolf to do?\\" is: Iris Chatham asks The Lone Wolf, Michael Lanyard, to stay away from the Kelmscotts when she invites him to the theater that night."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Atomic mass, the mass of a given atom or molecule, can be expressed in standard SI mass units - grams, kilograms, etc. However, because atomic masses, when expressed in these terms, are incredibly small, atomic mass is often expressed in unified atomic mass units (usually shortened to \\"u\\" or \\"amu\\") or in Dalton's (Da). The standard for one atomic mass unit is equal to 1/12th of the mass of a standard carbon-12 isotope. Atomic mass units tell the mass of one mole of a given element or molecule in grams. This is a very useful property when it comes to practical calculations, as it allows easy conversion between the mass and moles of a given quantity of atoms or molecules of the same type. Most standard periodic tables list the relative atomic masses (atomic weights) of each element. This is almost always written as a number at the bottom of the element's square on the table, under its one or two letter chemical symbol. This number is usually expressed as a decimal rather than as a whole number.   Note that the relative atomic masses listed on the periodic table are average values for the associated element. Chemical elements have different isotopes - chemical forms that differ in mass because of the addition or subtraction of one or more neutrons to the atom's nucleus. Thus, the relative atomic mass listed on the periodic table is suitable as an average value for atoms of a certain element, but not as the mass of a single atom of that element. Relative atomic masses, as listed on the periodic table, are used to calculate molar masses for atoms and molecules. Atomic masses, when expressed in amu, as on the periodic table, are technically unitless. However, by simply multiplying an atomic mass by 1 g/mol, a workable quantity is obtained for an element's molar mass - the mass (in grams) of one mole of an element's atoms. For example, the atomic mass of iron is 55.847 amu, which means one mole of iron atoms would weigh 55.847 grams. As has been noted, the relative atomic masses listed for each element on the periodic table are average values of all of an atom's isotopes. This average value is valuable for many practical calculations - like, for instance, calculating the molar mass of a molecule comprised of several atoms. However, when dealing with individual atoms, this number is sometimes insufficient.   Because it's an average of several different types of isotopes, the value on the periodic table isn't the exact value for any single atom's atomic mass. The atomic masses for individual atoms must be calculated by taking into account the exact number of protons and neutrons in a single atom. What is a summary?","output":"A summary for this is: Atomic mass tells us how heavy an atom or molecule is. It's often measured in units called \\"u,\\" \\"amu,\\" or Dalton's. The numbers on the bottom of the boxes in the periodic table show the average atomic masses of elements. These numbers are helpful for calculating the mass of a whole bunch of atoms or molecules, but not exact for just one atom since there are different types in an element called isotopes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: It's worth preparing for the worst of you are travelling to Bangkok as the Thai capital has the highest number of cases where the British Consulate has stepped in to help out Britons in trouble. In research released by the Foreign Office for 2014, Bangkok emerged as the destination where most Britons found themselves in trouble on holiday, with the need for medical advice and attention the biggest reason. Paris and Malaga followed Bangkok in the list, but both had almost a quarter of cases compared to that of the the Far Eastern city, where there were around 8,000 cases of Britons requiring overseas help. Scroll down for video. A total of 84,000 British citizens required help from the Consulate last year around the world, ranging from medical and illness assistance, to help with arrests and lost property. The report looked at each month of 2014, dissecting what cases were looked at where British government assistance was required. As far as drug arrests were concerned, Spanish party-city Malaga topped the pile on the highest number of Britons requiring assistance with drug-related offences, with around 50 cases recorded. Bangkok was again up there with around 33 cases, followed by the city of love Paris and Mexico  recording 33 cases apiece. Bangkok has the highest number of Britons requiring British Consulate help in the world, with most concerning receiving adequate medical treatment. The summer season sees a dramatic increase in the number of drug-related offences - in July alone 150 Britons were arrested around the world adding more work for the foreign office. Poor hygiene in Thailand contributes to Bangkok being ahead of everywhere else when it comes to cases of Britons needing hospital attention. And of course, with the language barrier often leading to confusion, it's little surprise the British Consulate is called upon to mediate and ensure the right treatments are given. Those countries that have a buzzing nightlife and club scene were also unsurprisingly high in the list where hospital treatment was required. Malaga again made the top five, alongside Tenerife, Palma and Alicante. Numbers lower than five in the research were averaged between one and five, and so given as three for reporting purposes. The clubbing scene appears to be linked to drug arrests, with more Britons arrested for these offences in Malaga than anywhere else. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office told MailOnline Travel: 'In light of the risk of unprovoked attacks you should be cautious and take care, especially at night. 'Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment resulting in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK.

Use a knife to cut the pan of rice crispy treats before you store them. This will help each piece to freeze evenly and make it easier to pull out individual treats once they’re frozen. If you use a container, fill it up layer by layer with the treats, then seal the top. Freezer bags are a great alternative for when you can’t find the right size of container or don’t want to leave your containers in long-term storage. Simply fill a freezer bag with 1 or 2 layers of treats, press out any extra air, and seal it up tight.  If you’re using a container, look for one made of either plastic or glass pyrex to store your squares. Try to find the right size of container that won’t leave too much extra space at the top. Eliminating extra air will help keep the treats fresher for a longer amount of time. This will help prevent the rice crispy treats from sticking and bonding. Measure your container or freezer bag, then cut the wax paper to about the same size. This will make stacking and sealing much easier. To help you keep track of the treats’ freshness, make sure to place a piece of tape on the top of the container and write down today’s date. These labels will help you easily determine whether or not the treats are edible when you find them in your freezer later. Up until 6 weeks, you can keep enjoying these sweet treats. After 6 weeks, the treats will likely lose most of their moisture and turn rock-hard. If you see any containers with a date label from more than 6 weeks ago, just throw away the old rice crispy treats. To eat a frozen rice crispy treat, take it out of the freezer and let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before eating or serving. This thawing period will bring back some of the rice crispy treat’s original softness and gooeyness. Summary:","output":"Properly store rice crispy treats by cutting them before freezing, using a container or freezer bag with minimal air space, and labeling with the date for freshness up to 6 weeks, ensuring enjoyable treats after thawing for 15 minutes at room temperature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 2: I think this will end in the appointment being cancelled.

Step 1: Identify the main ideas in both sentences. Sentence 1: A meeting with the district's member of Congress is scheduled, and the speaker is sure about its outcome. Sentence 2: The speaker thinks the meeting will likely be cancelled. Step 2: Compare the main ideas to see if there is a direct connection or logical relationship. In Sentence 1, the speaker expresses certainty about the outcome of the scheduled meeting, but they do not specify what that outcome will be. In Sentence 2, the speaker speculates that the meeting will be cancelled. While they may seem related to the meeting's outcome, there is no direct information in Sentence 1 to entail the cancellation mentioned in Sentence 2. Therefore, based on the analysis, the second sentence is not necessarily entailed by the first sentence. The first sentence does not provide enough information about the outcome to directly lead to the conclusion of the appointment being cancelled."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The rotor spins inside the core, which has magnets inside surrounded by wire loops. 6. The spinning of the rotor in the core generates electricity. Scenario: The shaft disconnects from the blades. Effect on the process: - Since the shaft has disconnected from the blades, the spinning motion from the blades will not be transferred to the shaft anymore. - As the shaft stops spinning, it cannot transfer the rotational energy to the generator. - Consequently, the rotor inside the generator will not spin as well. - Without the spinning motion of the rotor, no magnetic field can be created within the wire loops in the core. - Thus, electricity generation would cease.

Viruses are designed to spread, and it is irresponsible to test viruses on a computer that is not isolated from the internet at large. Ensure that your test environment is contained so that the viruses you are testing cannot spread to computers that you don't want infected.  You'll also want to make sure that your computer doesn't have any sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, social security identification, payment records, etc.) on it just in case your virus is able to copy the contents of your hard drive. Make sure that the computer or computers you are testing on are not connected to the Internet when you open an infected file. For greater security, test viruses using a virtual machine on a physical computer that is not connected to the internet. Infecting your own computer can jeopardize your data and personal information, and if your computer is connected to the internet or other computers on a network, you run the risk of infecting others.  Intentionally infecting someone's computer with a virus is illegal in most countries. If you are trying to test your antivirus software, it is strongly recommended that you use the test file in the previous method. Most routers contain hardware firewalls that can help protect your computer. For maximum vulnerability, you should connect your modem directly to your computer via an Ethernet cable, which will bypass the router's security. . The Firewall service acts as a built-in threat deterrent, so disabling it will allow unauthorized programs to access your computer. In some cases, disabling your computer's Firewall will also allow unauthorized users to gain access to your network. Most antivirus programs do an admirable job of catching the majority of viruses, so you'll want to disable or remove your antivirus software completely before trying to infect the computer. There are a variety of communities online dedicated to testing internet security, and you may be able to find links to known viruses in the community discussions. One of the most popular internet security (NetSec) communities is the NetSec subreddit. You can find a variety of discussions and links to sites containing specific viruses. One of the most popular ways for viruses to be spread is through pirated media and software. Look for \\"cracks\\" or \\"serials\\" for popular programs that require a file to be run. These files often contain viruses that execute when your run the crack program.  Torrents are a very popular way to share these files. When browsing torrent sites, look for torrents with low ratings and comments from other users warning about viruses. These are the ones you want. P2P sharing programs are another popular way to spread viruses. Programs like Kazaa and Gnutella are some of the more popular options. Lots of websites, known as \\"warez\\" sites, will offer \\"free\\" downloads for virtually any program. These are almost always infected with viruses and adware, and the program itself rarely works. Many advertisements—especially ones about enhancement-based drugs or services—redirect to shady sites which house viruses. Open your email's Spam or Junk folder, then open an email from an unknown sender and look for a download button or link.  Sometimes simply opening a spam email will be enough to contract a virus. For some spam emails, you'll have to click a link in the email to prompt a virus file to download. Screensavers are traditionally some of the most infected files around, especially when downloaded from untrustworthy sources (e.g., torrenting websites). This method will typically only work for Windows computers, as the screensaver (.scr) files will usually only be executable on a Windows computer. when your test is complete. In extreme cases, you may have to erase your computer's hard drive and reinstall the operating system to wipe out all traces of the virus. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: To test viruses on a computer responsibly, ensure your computer is backed up, isolated from the internet, and doesn't contain sensitive information.

During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid. Shad has even more bones than other fish and you'll never see it featured on any cooking show (except maybe Iron Chef, where the disgusting and unusual seems to be standard).

This was one of those days, a day when we were on a hike, I became my children's hero. This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail   and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek   a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther  _ was. While crossing the creek by walking on a downed tree trunk, our little Izzie fell into the creek and immediately started moving up and down in the current  . Immediately, I jumped into the creek after her. I managed to grab her and push her to the bank. But now, I was the one in need of being rescued. I thought this might be the end and I wasn't sure if I could hold on. Then, I heard the voice of the love of my life, my wife's voice. She shouted loudly--Stand up! Stand up! With the last bit of strength I had, I stood, and walked out of the creek. The kids showed little concern for my health; they were looking after Izzie, now safe in their arms. But I did hear one of the kids say: Thanks Dad, for saving Izzie. You're our HERO! As we walked back down the trail, I enjoyed a rare, but one of those sweet moments in life, that I wouldn't trade for anything on earth. I didn't care about my wet clothes, the squish   of water in my boots, or the embarrassment of nearly drowning in water; none of that mattered.

Would \\"German battleship Schleswig-Holstein , Westerplatte , September 1, 1939\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"World War 2 was a complex global conflict that resulted from a combination of numerous political, economic, and ideological factors. Although the German attack on Poland, characterized by the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein shelling the Polish garrison at Westerplatte on September 1, 1939, is generally considered the event that marked the beginning of the war, it is not the sole cause. Summarizing the cause of World War 2 by only referencing the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein, Westerplatte, and September 1, 1939, would be an oversimplification. Some key factors that contributed to the outbreak of World War 2 include: 1. Treaty of Versailles: The unfair and harsh terms imposed upon Germany following World War 1, which led to widespread resentment, economic instability, and political turmoil in Germany. The Treaty of Versailles demanded substantial territorial and financial reparations, and forced a reduction in German military capacity, which created fertile ground for the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. 2. Economic turmoil: The Great Depression that began in 1929 had a major impact worldwide and greatly exacerbated the economic struggles in Germany. This contributed to the growing appeal of extremist politics, including the Nazis, who promised to restore national dignity and economic prosperity. 3. The rise of totalitarian regimes: In the 1930s, aggressive totalitarian regimes emerged in Germany, Italy, and Japan, pursuing imperialist and expansionist policies. Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Emperor Hirohito sought to assert their nations' dominance in the international arena, paving the way for conflict. 4. Appeasement policy: Britain and France, hoping to avoid another catastrophic war, pursued a policy of appeasement towards Germany and Italy, allowing them to annex territories without resistance in the hopes of satisfying their imperial ambitions. This policy emboldened the fascist leaders to make further territorial demands, ultimately leading to war. 5. Failure of the League of Nations: The international body established to prevent war through diplomacy and collective security failed to effectively address German and Italian aggression, leading to a loss of credibility and destabilizing the international order. In conclusion, while \\"German battleship Schleswig-Holstein, Westerplatte, September 1, 1939\\" marks the start of World War 2, the causes of the conflict are multifaceted and cannot be summarized by this single event. The war's origins lie in a complex web of political, economic, and ideological factors that led to an environment ripe for global conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what language did the miwok indians speak?\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"The Miwok Indians, an indigenous people native to present-day California, spoke a variety of languages that belong to the Utian linguistic family. These languages, collectively referred to as the Miwokan languages, can be further divided into four primary branches: Eastern Miwok, Coast Miwok, Lake Miwok, and Central Miwok. Eastern Miwok, also known as Sierra Miwok, was spoken in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. This branch consists of three distinct dialects: Northern Sierra Miwok, spoken in the northern foothills and high upland valleys; Central Sierra Miwok, spoken in the central foothills and South Fork of the American River region; and Southern Sierra Miwok, mainly spoken in the Yosemite Valley and its surroundings. Coast Miwok encompasses two dialects, spoken by the Coast Miwok peoples who inhabited the lands west of the San Francisco Bay, from present-day Point Reyes to the Golden Gate and around Sonoma County's Petaluma Creek. The two dialects are Bodega Miwok, spoken in the Bodega Bay area, and Marin Miwok, spoken around present-day San Rafael and the Point Reyes Peninsula. Lake Miwok, spoken by the Clear Lake Miwok or Eastern Pomo tribes, was mainly used in the Clear Lake Basin region of California. It encompasses a single dialect but features several local varieties with minor differences. Central Miwok, also known as the Valley and Sierra Miwok, consists of three distinct dialect groups: Northern, Southern, and Central Valley Miwok. The Northern dialect group includes the languages spoken in the Cosumnes River area and the present-day Sacramento region. The Southern dialect group covers the languages spoken along the Merced, Chowchilla, and Fresno rivers. The Central Valley Miwok dialects were spoken throughout the San Joaquin Valley and the foothills between the Stanislaus and San Joaquin rivers. It is important to note that the Miwokan languages were passed down orally. Consequently, there is limited written documentation available. As a result of colonization and cultural assimilation, the use of these languages has significantly diminished, with only a small number of native speakers remaining today. However, efforts are underway to preserve and revitalize the Miwokan languages through linguistic research, educational programs, and cultural initiatives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And for that, we apologize.   After a 4-hour car ride to Edinburgh, over an hour driving around the city (thanks to construction) to find our hotel and another hour walking exploring and searching for a place to eat, we settled on take-out from Mediterranean Gate to bring back to the hotel.  So, needless to say, we were all (4 adults & a toddler) hungry & a bit cranky.  We didn't mean to be so chaotic and take forever to order, but they had 5 different menus around the store and none of us could figure out what sounded best.  In the end, my sister & I ordered a falafel wrap with baba ganoush, which apparently they were out of. Hmph. (Fine for me, as I was going to get it without anyway.) They gave my sister aubergine (eggplant) on hers - and guacamole. An interesting condiment in a Mediterranean place!  The chips (aka fries) were frozen - I saw the guy take them out of a bag and put them in the frier) - and needed more ketchup.  While HUMUNGOUS, the wraps themselves were not flavorful enough - even with hummous, tahini & hot sauce! We ended up all adding hummous that we had in the hotel to our wraps.  A huge thank you to the man sitting at the table - he helped us move our stroller out of the way and even helped us order!

Answer: Answer:","output":"Upon analyzing the given product review - \\"Marta's Opinion,\\" it appears that the reviewer has shared predominantly negative feedback about the book they purchased. We can observe the following key aspects in their review: 1. The title of the book seemed promising and contributed to the reviewer's decision to buy it, which is a positive aspect. However, this point is outweighed by negative comments. 2. The reviewer's main concern was that the book's content didn't provide as much wisdom as they expected.

The reviewer highlights the difficulty they experienced in understanding the importance of certain stories shared within the book. According to the reviewer, the significance of these stories was clear for the authors or participants, but not for the readers, which eventually left them feeling bored and questioning the need for including those stories.

They want more fences to stop people falling in. Police say that students need to take more responsibility for themselves when they go out drinking. The warning comes after three student deaths in the River Wear in the past year and a half. Sope Peters drowned in October 2013, Luke Pearce in May 2014, and Euan Coulthard died in January of this year. Toby Dickinson, a 19-year-old first year student, is unhappy with the way the measures are being brought in. \\"I think what's going on here is victim blaming, you died and it's your fault because you drank,\\" he said. Plans include breathalysing people at clubs if bouncers think they've had too much to drink. An area where drunk people can be taken to sober up before being sent on their way home is also being suggested. They will be looked after in these areas by volunteers. Newsbeat saw a number of people being helped by \\"street angels\\" after being kicked out of the clubs and bars. A lot of the students we spoke to said tackling drunks was the wrong approach and ignores the real problem. \\"There are no lights by the river and the fences don't cover the whole path,\\" says Lauren Maine, a third-year student. \\"The path does go to some colleges on the hill so if you were heading that way you would have to get to a bit where there isn't any fence.\\" She is not alone in being angry with the plans. A lot of the students Newsbeat spoke to were unhappy, felt they were being targeted and that local residents weren't facing the same treatment. The local police say that they aren't singling out students and point out that locals aren't dying in the river. They say in the past 15 months four students went into the water after drinking too much and three of those died. Chief Superintendent Ivan Wood is working with the council and university to try to stop more accidents happening. \\"There have been three tragic accidents in the past 14 months, all involving students, all on a Wednesday night, all having consumed alcohol,\\" he said. \\"What we're saying is take responsibility for your own actions.\\" The fear of another death in the city is very high at the moment. When Newsbeat was speaking to students outside the main club there was a moment of panic when a friend of one of the above group went missing after drinking too much. He turned up after a few frantic phone calls and there was a collective sigh of relief. One of those trying to track down the missing student was Ivan Jones, 21, who said: \\"It highlights a point, after these things happen then everyone is worried and you'd expect that.\\" The council, police and university have told students to \\"look after your friends and stick together walking home\\". This is a message that Jackie Roberts wants people to take on. Her daughter Megan died in another university city, York, which is also dominated by a river running through it. Megan fell into the River Ouse after a night out drinking with friends. Jackie told Newsbeat that she has relived what could have happened to her in the water over and over in her head and doesn't want anyone else to go through what she has. \\"I'm never going to preach to anyone and say don't go out and have a drink and don't have fun, but just realise there is this huge danger if you're not careful,\\" she said. She also agreed with the students Newsbeat has spoken to who say more needs to be done to physically stop people falling in. Some changes are being made and since meeting with Newsbeat, Jackie has been in touch to say that York Council will receive a gate in March to install over the steps where Megan died. \\"Good news in that it helps prevent the same tragedy in that area and it is also a mark of respect to Megan,\\" said Jackie.

They say that not enough is being done to make the river area safe, and they want more fences placed near the river to keep people from falling in. The police say that students should be more careful when they go out drinking. This comes after the deaths of three students who drowned in the river. Some possible solutions include having people who have had too much to drink be checked by volunteers, and having a place where drunk people can go to recover before they go home. The students don't think these ideas will solve the real problem, which they believe is a lack of lights and fences near the river. The police say they are not targeting just students but point out that local residents have not been dying in the river. The fear of another accident is really high among students, and they want more to be done to prevent more accidents from happening."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Walkers: The term \\"walkers\\" refers to people who are engaged in the act of walking, typically for recreation, exercise, or as a hobby. In this context, it appears to be the primary subject of the sentence, as it indicates who is performing the action of resting. 2. Resting: The verb \\"resting\\" is the second crucial element, as it depicts the action or activity the walkers are involved in. People often pause or rest during a walk or hike, especially if they are undertaking a physically demanding route like a mountain trail. Resting provides an opportunity for the walkers to regain their strength and appreciate the scenery. 3. Mountain: Lastly, the word \\"mountain\\" helps to establish the setting or environment where the walkers are resting. Mountains are often associated with challenging hikes, beautiful vistas, tranquility, and a sense of achievement for those who manage to reach their peaks. In this sentence, the mountain serves as a backdrop that adds context and detail to the experience of the walkers. In summary, \\"walkers,\\" \\"resting,\\" and \\"mountain\\" are the three most salient words in the sentence as they convey information about the subject, action, and setting.

He was a prominent figure in the Mexican muralism art movement, which was a significant part of the cultural renaissance following the Mexican Revolution. Rivera sought to create public art that portrayed the struggles, history, and hopes of the Mexican people. Diego Rivera's murals can be found in numerous institutions, public buildings, and even on exterior walls of various cities. Some of his most famous works include the murals at the National Palace in Mexico City, which depict Mexico's rich history from the pre-Columbian era through the Spanish conquest, colonial times, and the struggle for independence. Another notable work is Man at the Crossroads, a mural commissioned for the Rockefeller Center in New York City, which was eventually destroyed due to its controversial content. Rivera was a member of the Mexican Communist Party and often incorporated political themes into his murals. His artwork sought to promote social change and address socio-political issues of his time, making it accessible and meaningful to the general public. Diego Rivera was married to famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, and they lived together in Coyoacán, a neighborhood in Mexico City. Several of their homes, studios, and art collections are open to the public and serve as a testament to their contributions to the world of art. Their most well-known residence, La Casa Azul (the Blue House), now functions as the Frida Kahlo Museum, which holds many of their personal belongings, including Kahlo's artwork and Rivera's collection of pre-Columbian artifacts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: General Election 2010: What the manifestos mean for our pay packets By Paul Farrow Published: 6:46PM BST 17 Apr 2010 What the manifestos mean for your pay packet Photo: MacWilliam The manifestos have been published and the first television debate has been aired. As each day passes, voters are getting a clearer picture of what life would be like under a Labour, Conservative or Liberal Democrat government. \\"It is the typical pre-election period, when the parties are bidding for your votes,\\" said Mike Warburton of Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm. \\"They have made their manifesto pledges and you can look at the potential implications.\\" The major talking point so far has been National Insurance. Labour has made its intention to raise NI well known and the Conservatives have latched on to this rise and retaliated with the seemingly full support of the business community. Last week, Labour also said it would not raise the basic, higher and new top rates of tax in the next parliament. On the other hand, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have made no such pledges. So, based on the manifestos, who are the winners and who are the losers when it comes to the amount of money left in your pay packet? We asked Grant Thornton to tap some figures into its newly created general election tax spreadsheet to find out. Here is what it revealed. Let's start with a Conservative victory. Should David Cameron move into Number 10, a single person earning less than £35,000 a year will be better off to the tune of £150 a year. This takes into account the Tories' decision to reverse Labour's planned NI increases. And then, of course, you have the controversial marriage tax. Married couples and those in civil partnerships will be a further £150 to the good, making a total of £300. But not everyone is a winner. Workers earning around £45,000 to £55,000 would be worse off under Mr Cameron. Those earning £45,000 a year would be worse off by £294 and £546 if they earn £50,000 and £213 worse off if they earn £55,000. If the Lib Dems come to power, most people will have more money in their pocket, thanks to their proposal to raise the personal tax allowance to £10,000. This will lift many on low incomes out of the tax system altogether – indeed, everyone earning up to £113,000 will be a winner. Single people on less than £150,000 would be £705 better off with Nick Clegg as prime minister. So would most married couples, although those on earnings of £35,000 to £54,000 would be better off only to the tune of £160 and those on £55,000 would have £493 more in their pay packet. Couples earning up to £35,000 and those on more than £60,000 would be £705 better off. As we mentioned earlier, these figures do not take into account any changes to income tax rates. Labour has pledged not to increase income tax rates. But remember, pledges are not promises, as Gordon Brown has proved: he broke the Labour pledge to freeze tax rates with the new 50pc supertax on high earners. George Bull, head of tax at Baker Tilly, said: \\"It is difficult to know whether to laugh or cry when noting that Labour have repeated their 2005 pledge that they will not raise the basic, higher and new top rates of tax in the next parliament.\\" The Tories and the Lib Dems have made no such pledges on freezing taxes in their manifestos, although in a statement the Conservatives said they could not \\"imagine any circumstances in which we would raise income tax rates\\". A 1p increase in the basic rate of income tax raises about £4.5 billion a year and so it is an option to help reduce the deficit for any incoming government. Should an unforeseen event trigger a change of heart from the Tories, or if the Lib Dems decided to raise the basic rate by 1p, many of the gains made from NI policy and the marriage tax would disappear. Take someone earning £25,000. Under a Tory government, an increase in the basic rate of tax by 1p would mean that a single person would be £35 worse off, those on £40,000 would be £185 worse off and everyone earning more than £50,000 would be £375 out of pocket. It would be even worse for a couple with one income earner, despite the marriage tax. Those on £45,000 would be worse off by £668, those on £50,000 would be £920 out of pocket and those on £55,000 would be £587 worse off. Those earning £60,000 or more would be £375 worse off. The only winners, based on a basic-rate tax rise of 1p under the Tories, would be those on incomes of less than £25,000 a year. Depending on whether they are single or married, they could be up to £275 a year to the good. The vast majority of people would still be in the black under the Lib Dems even if there were a 1p income tax increase – between £306 and £799 better off. The only people to suffer would be those earning £150,000 plus, who would be around £1,000 worse off under the Lib Dems should income tax rise by 1p. None of the above calculations take into account the other tax in the frame – VAT. Whoever wins, a VAT rise to around 20pc is highly likely. Mr Warburton said: \\"The three major parties have each produced manifestos which say that they understand the importance of tackling the truly appalling state of our public finances. \\"Despite this, they are all happy to tell us the good news in their tax policies, but they say little about the tax rises and public spending cuts that are now inevitable after the election is out of the way, whoever wins.\\" Such is the size of Britain's deficit that payback can come only from three places, despite plans to cut public spending. These are raising basic-rate tax, increasing VAT and imposing NI increases. This is because these are the taxes most people pay and which therefore generate the bulk of the tax receipts by the government. Last year, these three \\"taxes\\" accounted for two thirds of all receipts by central government. Fuel duty, corporation tax and council tax make up the bulk of the difference but on their own they would not be able to raise the amount required to reduce the deficit significantly, experts say. \\"My guess is that we would see an increase in both the rate of VAT and NI if Labour won this election,\\" said Mr Warburton. \\"It is unlikely that a Conservative government would seek to raise further taxes using NI. I think that the Tories are more likely to choose the VAT route to reduce the deficit.\\" Whoever wins, further tax rises are likely – and these could dwarf the differences between the parties shown up by their manifesto pledges.","output":"This news article is about the different political party manifestos during the General Election in 2010. The manifestos talk about what each party plans to do if they win the election. This article focuses on how these plans would affect people's pay packets or the amount of money they take home from their jobs. The main discussion is about National Insurance, a type of tax. The Labour party said they want to raise National Insurance, and the Conservatives have a different plan. The article then looks at how people's pay packets would change under different parties like the Conservatives, Labour, and Liberal Democrats. It says that different people would have more or less money depending on which party won the election. The article also reminds us that sometimes politicians make promises during elections that they don't always keep, like with taxes. So the changes to people's pay packets might not be exactly like they say in their manifestos. Finally, the article says that no matter who wins the election, taxes might still go up to help reduce the money the government owes (called the deficit)."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Don Blankenship.

Summarize this article: * Tuberculosis has come back \\"with a vengeance\\" in Europe      * More than 80,000 cases in WHO's European region each year      * Drug-resistant strains can take years to treat, many patients die      By Kate Kelland      LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis (TB) are spreading at an alarming rate in Europe and will kill thousands unless health authorities halt the pandemic, the World Health Organisation(WHO) said on Wednesday.      Launching a new regional plan to find, diagnose and treat cases of the airborne infectious disease more effectively, the WHO's European director warned that complacency had allowed a resurgence of TB and failure to tackle it now would mean huge human and economic costs in the future.      \\"TB is an old disease that never went away, and now it is evolving with a vengeance,\\" said Zsuzsanna Jakab, the WHO's Regional Director for Europe.      \\"The numbers are scary,\\" Lucica Ditiu, executive secretary of the Stop TB Partnership told a news conference in London. \\"This is a very dramatic situation.\\"      TB is currently a worldwide pandemic that kills around 1.7 million people a year. The infection is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and destroys patients' lung tissue, causing them to cough up the bacteria, which then spreads through the air and can be inhaled by others.      Cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) -- where the infections are resistant to first-line and then second-line antibiotic treatments -- are spreading fast, with about 440,000 new patients every year around the world.      According to the WHO and Stop TB, 15 of the 27 countries with the highest burden of MDR-TB are in the WHO's European region, which includes 53 countries in Europe and Central Asia.      More than 80,000 MDR-TB cases occur in the region each year -- almost a fifth of the world's total. The WHO said precise figures for XDR-TB are not available because most countries lack the facilities to diagnose it, but officially reported cases of XDR-TB increased six-fold between 2008 and 2009.      Rates are highest in eastern Europe and Central Asia, but many countries in western Europe have increasing rates of TB and drug-resistant TB, Ditiu said. Britain's capital, London, has the highest TB rate of any capital city in western Europe with around 3,500 cases a year, 2 percent of which are MDR-TB.      Treating even normal TB is a long and unpleasant process, with patients needing to take a combination of powerful antibiotics for 6 months. Many patients fail to correctly complete the course of medicines, a factor which has fueled a rise in drug-resistant forms of the disease.      Treatment regimes for MDR-TB and XDR-TB can stretch into two or more years, costing up to 16,000 in drugs alone and up to 200,000 to 300,000 per patient if isolation hospital costs, medical care and other resources are taken into account.      Experts say around 7 percent of patients with straightforward TB die, and that death rate rises to around 50 percent of patients with drug-resistant forms.      The WHO's action plan for tackling tuberculosis emphasises the need for doctors and patients to be more aware of the disease and its symptoms, to diagnose and treat cases promptly with the right drugs, and follow patients up over many months or years to ensure they take their medications.      If that doesn't happen \\"not only are these people quietly and painfully dying, they are also spreading the disease,\\" Ditiu said.      The WHO said that if the plan is fully implemented -- at an estimated cost of 5 billion -- 127,000 people will be successfully treated for drug-resistant TB and 120,000 deaths will be averted by 2015.      The cost would also be recouped, since 250 000 MDR-TB and 13,000 XDR-TB cases will be prevented, saving 7 billion in averted treatment costs, the WHO said. It added that prevention of premature deaths among TB patients would add to economic productivity in the region and generate an extra 5 billion. (Reporting by Kate Kelland) ||||| The UK has been using opportunistic X-rays to detect undiagnosed cases of TB      A plan has been drawn up to try to tackle cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis in 53 European countries.      The World Health Organisation (WHO) has described the problem as \\"alarming\\".      Eastern Europe has the highest level of infection, while in Western Europe, London has the highest TB rate of any capital city.      The WHO estimates there are 81,000 cases of drug-resistant TB a year in Europe, although many countries are failing to diagnose it.      The plan aims to increase diagnosis and access to treatment. Experts believe it has the potential to save several billion pounds and 120,000 lives by 2015.      European problem      Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan are among the countries with the highest burden of illness.      We cannot be complacent - the cost of each case can be several hundred thousand pounds. Dr Ibrahim Abubakar, Health Protection Agency      TB cases in the UK are concentrated in large cities. There are 3,500 cases in London each year.      In 2009, there were 58 cases of drug-resistant TB in the UK. Resistance can arise if patients fail to complete their course of medication.      The Health Protection Agency's TB expert, Dr Ibrahim Abubakar, said: \\"Although the overall numbers are small, the trend has been for an increase in the past decade.      \\"We cannot be complacent. The cost of managing each case can stretch to several hundred thousand pounds.      \\"So it's significant - and while that person is infectious, other people can get TB.      \\"The larger numbers in Eastern Europe represent a failure to take action.\\"      He urged GPs and casualty departments to be vigilant for possible cases.      Six weeks later came the depressing news that none of the three antibiotics were effective Anna Watterson, Drug-resistant TB survivor      TB is an airborne infection which still proves fatal in about 7% of cases. Almost half of patients with the multi-drug resistant form of the disease die.      The WHO has praised the UK's \\"Find and Treat\\" service, which uses a mobile X-ray van to screen homeless people and drug addicts for TB.

This is particularly concerning as some drug-resistant strains can take years to treat and are often fatal. TB is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which destroys lung tissue and spreads through the air, meaning others can inhale it. TB infections that are resistant to first and second-line antibiotics are spreading rapidly, with 15 of the 27 countries with the highest burden of multidrug-resistant TB located in the WHO's European region. The WHO's action plan to tackle TB emphasises early diagnosis and treatment with the right drugs. This will require an investment of 5 billion but will treat 127,000 people, save 120,000 lives, prevent 263,000 cases, and save 7 billion in treatment costs by 2015, according to the WHO. In addition, it could generate an extra 5 billion by preventing premature deaths."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A poor farmer and his young son arrive into the settlement where the farmer confronts Luke, a thieving henchman employed by wealthy land baron Richard Barrett. The man complains to Fletcher that he had been cheated by Barrett claiming he had been sold a deed to non-existent property. Fletcher finally shoots the farmer, killing the man in front of his young son. His son then picks up his father's shotgun, uses it to kill Fletcher, and rides out of town with Fletcher's horse and a distinctive silver-trimmed saddle. The boy is next seen several years later and has since become a hardened bounty hunter calling himself Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma). He meets an elderly drifter, Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), who accompanies him to the frontier town of Cerriotts. Snake is a colorful character who claims that the story of the \\"silver saddle\\" and the boy who avenged his father's death is well known and that he wishes to join Blood in his travels. On the way, Snake often scavenges the remains of those killed in gunfights by Roy Blood. Their arrival in Cerriotts is noticed by several townspeople, in particular, a local cowboy known as Turner (Gianni De Luigi). Blood visits the town whorehouse where he meets with an old girlfriend, Shiba (Licinia Lentini), who is also its madam. She tells Blood that she is being extorted by a man called Shep who collects the money on behalf of a Mexican bandit named Garrincha (Aldo Sambrell). Shiba enlists Blood's help in taking care of Garrincha and his gang. Indeed, Blood confronts and kills Shep and several of Garrincha's men in a gunfight. Afterwards, Turner appears to offer Blood 2,000 to kill a man called Barrett. Blood is hesitant to take the murder contract, but accepts the offer upon recognizing the name of the land baron who had swindled his father years before. The murder is arraigned to take place in a graveyard outside town where Barrett is expected to arrive. Blood lies in wait until a carriage eventually...

Please answer the following question: Jonathan is attending a football game for his favorite team. Before the game, there will be a fireworks display and a fly over by some jet fighter planes. Jonathan has been looking forward to the fireworks for weeks because he has heard they are really great. The fireworks begin and their sound waves are of a high intensity. After the fireworks, the jets fly over and the sound waves for that has an even higher intensity than the fireworks did.  Which sound less likely damaged Jonathan's ears?  Hint: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Answer:","output":"To determine which sound is less likely to have damaged Jonathan's ears, we need to compare the intensity (decibel level) of both the fireworks and the jet flyover. Step 1: Determine the decibel levels of the fireworks and the jet flyover. - Since the jet flyover has an even higher intensity than the fireworks, we only need to establish one point of reference, i.e., the fireworks' decibel level. Step 2: Compare the decibel levels to the reference values mentioned in the hint. - According to the hint, high-decibel sounds are dangerous and can cause hearing loss. Step 3: Assess the potential damage of each sound. - If the fireworks demonstrate a high intensity but are still considered safe, the lesser damage should come from them, as the jet flyover's intensity is even higher. Unfortunately, without the mentioned Figure, we do not have specific decibel levels to compare. However, with the information given, the sound that is less likely to have damaged Jonathan's ears is the fireworks display because the jet flyover has an even higher intensity than the high-intensity fireworks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr. Marcy and Dr. Butler also spotted the first \\"family\\" of three planets. In June 2002 they announced another discovery: a Jupiter-like planet orbiting star 55Cancri. At first, the two researchers found only planets that orbit close to stars. Recently, the scientists found planets farther out. The planet orbiting 55Cancri is a major breakthrough: it is the first sighting of a large gas planet about same distance from the star as Jupiter is from the Sun. Why is this important ? Scientists think that life on Earth may exist because of two special features in our solar system. The first is Jupiter. \\"Because it's so big, Jupiter pulls comets and asteroids , or they all come and hit the Earth.\\" Dr. Marcy explains. \\"Without Jupiter , life on Earth would likely have been destroyed.\\" A second feature is that Earth is a rocky planet where liquid water, which is necessary for life , can exist. Unlike gas planets, rocky planets like Earth have surfaces where water can gather in pools and seas, which may support life. A huge space exists between the Jupiter-like planet and two other planets that lie close to 55Cancri. Is there an Earth-like planet in the space, too small for us to notice? If so, says Dr. Marcy, \\"We would have two striking similarities to our solar system: a Jupiter-like planet and an Earth-like planet.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get.  But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  What is an answer for this question: Which lake will have less dead zones?","output":"Based on the information provided and the background context on how dead zones are formed, it is likely that Lake Costanza will have fewer dead zones as compared to Lake Montopeke. The main reason behind this assumption is the difference in the amount of rain that each farm receives. The farm next to Lake Montopeke gets regular rain, which means that there is more water available for dissolving and carrying away the fertilizer used on the farm. This runoff carries the dissolved fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, into the adjacent Lake Montopeke. As mentioned in the background context, the introduction of nitrogen into the body of water causes excessive algae growth. When these algae die, decomposers break down their dead tissue and use up the oxygen in the water, resulting in the creation of dead zones. Therefore, it can be inferred that the more nitrogen-rich runoff present in the water, the more dead zones are formed. On the other hand, the farm adjacent to Lake Costanza hardly receives any rain. This means that there is less water available to dissolve and carry away the fertilizer from the farm into the lake. As a result, less nitrogen is introduced into Lake Costanza, leading to a lower possibility for excessive algae growth, decomposer action, and the subsequent creation of dead zones. It's important to note that though Lake Costanza seems to have a lesser probability of experiencing dead zones compared to Lake Montopeke due to the lower amount of rain it receives, both lakes could still be at risk from other factors, such as pollution or changes in water temperature. Preventive measures should be taken to minimize the chances of dead zones occurring in either lake, such as the use of more environmentally-friendly farming techniques and proper monitoring of water bodies. In conclusion, Lake Costanza is likely to have fewer dead zones than Lake Montopeke due to the difference in rain patterns and the resulting dissolution and runoff of fertilizers. However, efforts should be made to minimize the impact of agricultural practices on both lakes to ensure a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for the communities they support."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Food enters the body - Food begins to be processed by the digestive system - The pancreas releases enzymes to aid digestion - Digested food affects the amount of sugar in the blood - The pancreas releases one hormone to lower the blood sugar (glucose) level - The pancreas releases another hormone to raisethe blood sugar (glucose) level.  Question: suppose less big waves in the ocean happens, how will it affect less food to be processed.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"To answer the question, I will first analyze the connection between ocean waves and food processing: 1. There is no direct correlation between the size of ocean waves and the food entering our bodies, as food processing in the human body is primarily involved with the ingestion, digestion, and absorption of nutrients from the food we consume. 2. However, it is important to consider that ocean waves can have a more indirect impact on food supply chains and human food consumption. This is because big ocean waves could affect marine life and access to certain types of food (e.g., fish or seafood). 3. If there are fewer big waves in the ocean, the disruption to marine life and fishing could be reduced, potentially leading to more availability of marine-based food sources. 4. However, it's important to note that other factors (such as weather patterns, pollution, and overfishing) could still impact the availability of food sources from the ocean, and waves are not the only determining factor. Given that the connection between ocean waves and food processing in the human body is indirect and affected by various other factors, the answer would be: C: no effect Less big waves in the ocean would not directly impact how much food gets processed within the body since this mostly depends on an individual's food intake and their body's ability to process it.

His extraordinary story has now been backed up by a range of compelling evidence, both in France and in Germany, which is published in the latest edition of Paris's Le Point magazine.      Hitler is said to have had an affair with Mr Loret's mother, Charlotte Lobjoie, 16, as he took a break from the trenches in June 1917.      Although he was fighting the French near Seboncourt, in the northern Picardy region, Hitler made his way to Fournes-in-Weppe, a small town west of Lille, for regular leave.      There he met Miss Lobjoie, who later told their son: \\"One day I was cutting hay with other women, when we saw a German soldier on the other side of the street.      \\"He had a sketch pad and seemed to be drawing. All the women found this interesting, and were curious to know what he was drawing.      \\"I was designated to approach him.\\"      The pair started a brief relationship, which resulted in the birth of Jean-Marie, who was born in March 1918 after being conceived during a 'tipsy' evening in June 1917.      Miss Lobjoie later told Jean-Marie: \\"When your father was around, which was very rarely, he liked to take me for walks in the countryside.      \\"But these walks usually ended badly. In fact, your father, inspired by nature, launched into speeches which I did not really understand.      \\"He did not speak French, but solely ranted in German, talking to an imaginary audience. Even if I spoke German I would not be able to follow him, as the histories of Prussia, Austria and Bavaria where not familiar to me at all, far from it.      \\"My reaction used to anger your father so much that I did not show any reaction.\\"      Jean-Marie was, like thousands of other French children with German soldier fathers, badly treated by his peers at school.      He was referred to as 'the son of the Boche', and often had fights as he tried to defend his father, who had by now disappeared over the border back to Germany.      Miss Lobjoie, meanwhile, refused to discuss Jean-Marie's father, and ended up giving her only son away for adoption in the 1930s to a family called Loret.      His real father would not recognise Jean-Marie, but continued to stay in contact with Miss Lobjoie.      Incredibly, Mr Loret went on to fight the Germans in 1939, defending the Maginot Line before it was bypassed during the Nazi invasion which resulted in France being occupied from 1940 until 1944.      Mr Loret even joined the French Resistance, and was given the codename 'Clement'.      Just before her death in the early 1950s, Miss Lobjoie finally told Jean-Marie that his father was arguably the most infamous dictator in human history.      Mr Loret said: \\"In order not to get depressed, I worked non-stop, never took a holiday, and had no hobbies. For twenty years I didn't even go to the cinema.\\"      Mr Loret began investigating his past in great detail, employing scientists to prove that he has the same blood type as Hitler, and that they even have similar handwriting.      Photographs of the two also reveal an astonishing resemblance.      Other elements which corroborate the story are official Wehrmacht, or German Army, papers which show that officers brought envelopes of cash to Miss Lobjoie during the Second World War.      When Miss Lobjoie died, Mr Loret also found paintings in her attic which were signed by Hitler, who was an accomplished artist.      In Germany, meanwhile, a picture of a woman painted by Hitler looked exactly like Miss Lobjoie.      Francois Gibault, Mr Loret's Paris lawyer, said: \\"He first came to see me in 1979, but was a bit lost and did not know whether he wanted to be publicly recognised as Hitler's son, or to erase all that completely.      \\"He had the feelings of many illegitimate children: the desire to find a past, however heavy, but also the fear of returning to the old routine.      \\"I talked with him a lot, playing the role of psychologist rather than lawyer.\\"      Mr Gibault said that Mr Loret's own children might now be in a position to claim royalties from Mein Kampf ('My Struggle'), Hitler's famous book which has sold millions of copies around the world.      Mr Loret wrote a book called 'Your Father's Name Was Hitler' in 1981, and it is now set to be re-published with all the new evidence.      Hitler, who was born in an Austrian village, frequently spoke of his love for France, and especially for Paris.      In December 1940, he paid an emotional visit to the capital city, where he was pictured saluting Napoleon's tomb in front of his bemused generals.      More intriguingly still, Hitler transferred from Vienna part of the remains of Napoleon II, Napoleon Bonaparte's son with Marie Louise of Austria.      Hitler often enthused about the greatness of Napoleon, saying that he wanted to have as big an impact on history as the Frenchman.      Although he never officially had any sons or daughters of his own, Hitler often spoke of his love of children and animals.      He married his mistress, Eva Braun, as the Red Army shelled his bunker in Berlin, in 1945, and committed suicide shortly afterwards. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The story of Jean-Marie Loret, who claimed to be Adolf Hitler's illegitimate son, has been supported by a range of evidence presented in Paris's Le Point magazine. According to the narrative, Hitler had a brief affiliation with Loret's mother, Charlotte Lobjoie, in 1917 while he was on leave during his service near the French town of Seboncourt. This association led to Loret's birth in March 1918.  Due to the stigma attached to his suspected parentage, Loret was mistreated by his peers at school and was eventually given up for adoption by his mother. Despite the hardships, Loret went on to serve in the French Resistance against Nazi forces during World War II.  Before her death in the 1950s, Lobjoie admitted to Loret that his father was the infamous dictator. To confirm his lineage, Loret employed scientists, compared blood types and handwriting, and examined physical similarities in photographs. Additional details, such as payments from the German Army to Lobjoie and paintings signed by Hitler found after Lobjoie's death, further strengthened Loret's claim. According to Francois Gibault, Loret's attorney, there's a possibility that Loret's children might be eligible to claim royalties from Hitler's book, 'Mein Kampf'. Loret, who passed away in 1985, documented his extraordinary story in his 1981 book 'Your Father's Name Was Hitler,' which will be re-published with the new supporting evidence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point.

Watch a good teacher, and you will see that he doesn't sit still before his class; he stands the whole time he is teaching; he walks about, using his arms, hands and fingers to help him in his explanations, and his face to express feelings. There are very important differences between the teacher's work and the actor's. The actor has to speak words which he has learnt by heart; he has to repeat exactly the same words each time he plays a certain part, even his movements and the ways in which he uses his voice are usually fixed beforehand .What he has to do is to make all these carefully learnt words and actions seem natural on the stage. A good teacher works in quite a different way. His audience take an active part in his play: they ask and answer questions, they obey orders, and if they don't understand anything, they say so. The teacher can't learn his part by heart, but must invent it as he goes along.

Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room.

Use your rate of speech to determine how many slides your presentation can accommodate. If you have ten minutes to present, you might need upwards of 60 slides.  On the other hand, you might also need just ten slides.  Whatever number you settle on, do not include more slides than you can get through in your allotted presentation time. If you have a lot of info which would be of use in your PowerPoint, or have graphs, tables, or images available that could improve your presentation, use them.  While you don’t want to include so many slides that you can’t get through them all in the allotted time, neither should you feel constrained to the point that you don’t include valuable information or graphics in your slideshow.","output":"This article talks about finding the right number of slides for your presentation by practicing, adjusting the time spent on each slide, asking for advice from others, and considering your speaking speed, so your presentation fits in the given time and has valuable information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: If locking lips seems like too much of a commitment, try kissing a girl by giving her a quick peck. Turn your head away from her lips and purse your lips together so that your teeth aren’t showing. Lean into her cheek and give her a quick kiss to show some affection. Always get consent first, even for a simple peck on the cheek. While kissing her, if you’re confident that you can lift her off of the ground, wrap your arms around her waist and lift her up while keeping your lips against her. This is a classic romantic gesture and will show her that you’re really attracted to her and enjoying the kiss. If she resists in any way, don’t try to keep lifting her up. Some girls don’t like being lifted off of the floor. Once you’ve gotten used to kissing one another, you can start to make out. While kissing, run the very tip of your tongue over her lower lip a few times. If she opens her mouth a bit more, then she may be interested. Introduce your tongue slowly and once your tongues are touching, move your tongue slowly around her mouth.  Don’t overdo it with the French kissing if you have a lot of saliva built up in your mouth. Take breaks! It can be hard to breathe if you’re mouths are locked in a French kiss for more than 10-20 seconds.","output":"To show affection with a kiss, opt for a quick peck on the cheek, ensuring consent. For a more romantic gesture, consider lifting her up while kissing if she's comfortable with it. As you both become accustomed to kissing, introduce gentle tongue movements and be mindful of saliva buildup.

January 2, 1920 - April 6, 1992) was an American writer and professor of biochemistry at Boston University. He was known for his works of science fiction and popular science. Asimov was a prolific writer who wrote or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards. His books have been published in 9 of the 10 major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification. Asimov was born on an unknown day between October 4, 1919 and January 2, 1920, inclusive. Asimov himself celebrated it on January 2.  Asimov's parents were Anna Rachel (nee Berman) and Judah Asimov, a family of Jewish millers. He was named Isaac after his mother's father, Isaac Berman. When he was born, his family lived in Petrovichi near Klimovichi, which was then Gomel Governorate in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (now Smolensk Oblast, Russia). Asimov wrote of his father, \\"My father, for all his education as an Orthodox Jew, was not Orthodox in his heart\\", noting that \\"he didn't recite the myriad prayers prescribed for every action, and he never made any attempt to teach them to me\\".  In 1921, Asimov and 16 other children in Petrovichi caught double pneumonia. Only Asimov survived. He later had two younger siblings: a sister, Marcia (born Manya, June 17, 1922 - April 2, 2011), and a brother, Stanley (July 25, 1929 - August 16, 1995), who was vice-president of New York Newsday.  His family emigrated to the United States when he was three years old. Since his parents always spoke Yiddish and English with him, he never learned Russian, but he remained fluent in Yiddish as well as English. Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, Asimov taught himself to read at the age of five, and his mother got him into first grade a year early by claiming he was born on September 7, 1919. In third grade he learned about the \\"error\\" and insisted on an official correction of the date to January 2.  After becoming established in the U.S., his parents owned a succession of candy stores, in which everyone in the family was expected to work. The candy stores sold newspapers and magazines, a fact that Asimov credited as a major influence in his lifelong love of the written word, as it presented him with an unending supply of new reading material as a child that he could not have otherwise afforded. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1928 at the age of eight. Where was he born?","output":"Isaac Asimov was born in a place called Petrovichi, which was near Klimovichi in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: Thirty-seven-year-old Loretta Castorini (Cher), a Sicilian-American widow, is an accountant in Brooklyn Heights, New York, where she lives with her family: her father Cosmo (Vincent Gardenia) who is a successful plumber, her mother Rose (Olympia Dukakis), and her paternal grandfather (Feodor Chaliapin, Jr). Her boyfriend, Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to attend to his dying mother; she accepts, but is insistent that they carefully follow tradition as she believes her first marriage was cursed by her failure to do so, resulting in her husband's death when he was hit by a bus. They plan to marry one month later, and Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage) to the wedding. Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement. Cosmo dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to commit to paying for the \\"real\\" wedding Loretta insists on, while Rose is pleased that Loretta likes Johnny but does not love him; she believes that one can easily be driven crazy by a partner whom one loves. The next day, Loretta goes to see Ronny at his bakery after he refuses to speak to her on the phone. He reveals that he has a wooden prosthetic hand, and he explains that he blames Johnny for the loss of his hand and his own fiancÃ©e; Ronny became distracted while talking to Johnny as he cut bread for him, his hand was mangled in the slicer, and his fiancÃ©e left him. Loretta insists that they discuss the matter upstairs in his apartment, where she cooks for him and then tells him that she believes he is a \\"wolf\\" who cut off his own hand to escape the trap of a bad relationship. Ronny reacts furiously and passionately, kissing Loretta (who responds to his kiss) and then sweeping her up in his arms and carrying her to his bed where they make love. That evening, Rose's brother Raymond (Louis Guss) and his wife Rita (Julie Bovasso) join Rose and Cosmo for dinner, and they all wonder where Loretta is. Raymond recalls that when he was a boy and Cosmo was... The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Who does Loretta Castorini blame for the tragic death of her first husband, and how does this belief influence her engagement to Johnny Cammareri?\\"  The justification for this question is that Loretta holds a firm belief that not following traditions led to her first husband's demise. This belief greatly influences her decision-making process with regard to her engagement and forthcoming wedding to Johnny. This creates a tension in the plot, thus understanding Loretta's motivations and belief system helps in comprehending the dynamics of the character's actions and decisions in the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - laugh - sit - being entertained - math - meet  I believe the correct choice is \\"meet\\", here's why: A:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"meet,\\" and I will explain why this is the most suitable option among the given choices: 1. Laugh: While laughter is undoubtedly a part of many interactions between friends, it may not necessarily happen before they go out to play. Additionally, laughing is more of a response to a specific situation or comment, and is not a preparatory action before playing. 2. Sit: Sitting is a passive activity, and it is not an action that typically occurs directly before engaging in play. Friends may sit together while hanging out or taking a break from playtime, but it is not a specific action to undertake before starting to play. 3. Being entertained: Although friends may entertain each other in various ways, being entertained is not a specific action that children undertake before playing. It is more likely that the entertainment would occur during their playtime or as a part of their activities while playing. 4. Math: Math is an academic subject and, while children might engage in math-related games or learning activities with their friends, it is not a general prerequisite for going to play. Math activities would typically take place either during school time or during dedicated study sessions. 5. Meet: Meeting up with friends is the most logical choice among the options provided, as children need to gather together before they can engage in any play activities. This often involves deciding on a meeting location, greeting each other, and then proceeding to participate in their desired form of play. In conclusion, \\"meet\\" is the most accurate and appropriate choice for describing what a kid might do with his friend before going to play. Meeting allows friends to come together, discuss the day's plans, and commence their chosen activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The protagonist is at the center of the story, makes the key decisions, and experiences the consequences of those decisions. The protagonist affects the main characters' circumstances as well, as they are often the primary actor propelling the story forward. If a story contains a subplot, or is a narrative made up of several stories, then the character who is interpreted as the protagonist of each subplot or individual story.  The word \\"protagonist\\" is used notably in stories and forms of literature and culture that contain stories, which would include dramas, novels, operas and films. In those forms the protagonist may simply be the leading actor, or the principal character in the story. More formally, the protagonist, while still defined as a leading character, may also be defined as the character whose fate is most closely followed by the reader or audience, and who is opposed by the antagonist. The antagonist will provide obstacles and complications and create conflict that test the protagonist, thus revealing the strengths and weaknesses of their character.  The earliest known examples of protagonist are dated back to Ancient Greece. At first dramatic performances involved merely dancing and recitation by the chorus. But then in \\"Poetics\\", Aristotle describes how a poet named Thespis introduced the idea of having one actor step out and engage in a dialogue with the chorus.

Paragraph- Sent 1: Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Sent 2: Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. Sent 3: While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Sent 4: Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. Sent 5: But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Sent 6: Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man.

Sent 9: Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Sent 10: Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre.

Graduel Christopher Darin Carter (born November 25, 1965) is a former American football player in the National Football League. He was a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles (1987-89), the Minnesota Vikings (1990-2001) and the Miami Dolphins (2002). After starting for the Ohio State University Buckeyes, Carter was drafted by the Eagles in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL supplemental draft. While in Philadelphia, head coach Buddy Ryan helped to coin one of ESPN's Chris Berman's famous quotes about Carter: \\"All he does is catch touchdowns.\\" Carter was heavily recruited out of high school for both basketball and football. He accepted the offer from Ohio State head coach Earle Bruce. Carter became a consensus All-America selection after his junior season, Ohio State's first All American at wide receiver.  Carter had intended to play both football and basketball at Ohio State, but decided to focus on football after making an immediate impact his freshman year. That year, he set a Rose Bowl record with nine receptions for 172 yards.  Carter was known for great hands, running precise routes, and for acrobatic leaps. He had remarkable body control and footwork when making catches near the sidelines. At the Citrus Bowl at the end of the 1985 season, Carter caught a ball that quarterback Jim Karsatos was intending to throw away. Karsatos has claimed that catch by Carter was the greatest in the history of college football: \\"When I finally saw it on film, he was tiptoeing the sidelines and he jumped up and caught the ball left-handed by the point of the football at least a yard out of bounds. Then he somehow levitated back in bounds to get both his feet in bounds. I swear to this day he actually levitated to get back in bounds. When I saw it on film, it just blew me away.\\"  Prior to Carter's senior season, he secretly signed with notorious sports agent Norby Walters. When the contract was discovered, Carter was ruled ineligible. The absence of Carter in the 1987 offense contributed to a disappointing 6-4-1 season and the firing of Coach Bruce. Missing this season also cost him a chance at evening his personal record against Michigan; Carter finished 1-2, his lone taste of victory in the series being his freshman year.  Despite losing his senior year, Carter left Ohio State holding the school record for receptions (168). In 2000, he was selected as a member of the Ohio State Football All-Century Team. In 2003, he was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame.

He previously played two years for High1 from 2005 to 2007 .  - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team.  - High1 is a professional ice hockey team based in Chuncheon, South Korea, and is a member of Asia League Ice Hockey. Formed in 2004, the team was initially made up of players from the defunct Korean league who didn't immediately move to Anyang Halla from the Hyundai and Dongwon teams as well as other disbanded teams and players who had returned from military service.

When your brother is talking, don't interrupt him. Options are: (1). If he is talking for longer, stop him before he finishes talking to clarify what he is saying. Ask for clarification or make some suggestions for him to be better at talking.; (2). If he does speak, listen attentively without commenting on his words or doing necessary things for him. A lot of older siblings are taught to listen when talking.; (3). Rather, give him your full attention and nod or say yes when he says a certain number of things in a certain sentence. Pay close attention to his words, and try to get his meaning across as well.; (4). Listen carefully, and when he's done, show him that you heard him by repeating back what he said in your own words.

Options (2) and (3) don't actively demonstrate good listening skills, as they only involve passive actions like nodding and paying close attention. Option (4) is the most logical choice, as it involves actively listening and then providing a response that proves you have understood and absorbed the information shared by the brother.

Would \\"His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times, though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other Founders.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"No, the statement \\"His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times, though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other Founders\\" does not specifically address what John Adams was doing to help France. Instead, it focuses on the general recognition of Adams' achievements in comparison to other Founding Fathers. To provide a more direct answer, we need to examine John Adams' interactions with France during his political career. John Adams (1735-1826), the second president of the United States and one of the Founding Fathers, played a significant role in the development of early relations between the United States and France. During the Revolutionary War, France was an important ally of the United States, and the two countries enjoyed a close diplomatic relationship. Here are a few ways in which John Adams helped France: 1. Diplomatic missions: John Adams was appointed as one of the commissioners who were sent to France in 1778 to negotiate a treaty of alliance and amity. Adams, along with Benjamin Franklin and Arthur Lee, worked to secure French support for the American Revolution, leading to the Treaty of Alliance and the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the two nations. 2. Financial assistance: During his time in France, Adams also played a role in securing financial assistance from the French government to support the American war effort. This funding was critical in sustaining the Continental Army and ensuring its ability to continue fighting against the British. 3. Peace negotiations: In 1782, John Adams was one of the American representatives sent to negotiate peace with Great Britain. France played an essential role in these negotiations, acting as the United States' primary ally and lending its support to the cause of American independence. Adams, along with John Jay and Benjamin Franklin, helped secure the Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the war and recognized American independence. 4. Ambassador to France: After the Revolutionary War, Adams served as the first United States ambassador to France from 1785 to 1789. He worked to maintain good relations with France and promote American interests. While John Adams did help France in various ways during his political career, it is also important to recognize that his primary focus was on American interests and fostering a strong and independent United States. His efforts to secure French support and maintain good relations between the two nations were ultimately motivated by his commitment to the success and prosperity of the newly formed United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live. Making my life extremely hard for no more reason than having my work stolen. If I wasn't so tough, and for a few people left who have at least some integrity, I would be dead now, like the rest of their victims. I have lost respect for quite a few people who I used to think were really talented. I now understand where there talent comes from… Shame on them.

This serious offense shows a pattern of dishonesty and abuse of power, further emphasizing the injustice you faced in your own case.

But about two hours into the flight, the plane lost contact. There were 239 people on board the Malaysia Airlines flight, including 154 Chinese. About 12 countries, including China, the US and Australia, have joined the search for the missing plane and passengers. The plane's disappearance was a \\"mystery\\", said officials. The plane was flying at a height of more than 10,000 meters when it suddenly lost contact. The weather was clear. The pilots didn't make any distress calls  . When a plane crashes, broken parts are usually recovered. But up to April 2, officials have not found anything.    People are also talking about a possible hijacking. Interpol   said that two people on the flight used stolen passports. But that information alone isn't evidence  of a hijack. The investigation   is still going on.

Given the below context:  The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.  Guess a valid title for it!

Uncle Jesse is the grand marshal of the reunion and at the same time, is facing a lawsuit filed by Mama Josephine Maxx for access across Duke property to the Hazzard swamp where she intends to build a theme park. However, Jesse refused access, not wanting to see the swamp destroyed. However, this has made the rest of the townsfolk angry with him, as the new theme park means new jobs, and revenue for Hazzard County. Driving from Washington, D.C., the Congressman representing Hazzard County in Washington, Cooter Davenport, arrives first and goes back to the Duke farm with Jesse, where Jesse is barbecuing ribs for everyone. Shortly thereafter, a car pulls up. Jesse recognizes it as Bo due to the sound of the motor. Bo has gotten a ride from a friend as he, having returned to the professional racing circuit and has come back for the reunion, has wrecked his car (again, according to Jesse). Bo introduces the girl who brought him home and after she leaves, Cooter says she was so good looking, it hurt and Bo joked with him, saying the girl wasn't bad either. Then Daisy arrives on a motorcycle. Daisy has been at graduate school getting a PhD in ecology after a bitter divorce.

Instead, typically the three contestants (two in later rounds) who received the lowest number of votes are called to the center of the stage. One of these three is usually sent to safety; however the two remaining are not necessarily the bottom two. The contestant with the fewest votes is then revealed and eliminated from the competition.

He became the new leader of a soccer team called West Brom. The team really liked Tony because he knew how to win games. In fact, Tony helped them win their first two matches with him in charge! Normal grown-ups wear fancy suits and ties when they go to work. But Tony Pulis was not like them. He loved to wear his comfy tracksuit and a cool navy baseball cap when he was coaching his team. Even though he wore a suit in his very first match with West Brom, he decided that he would rather wear his favorite tracksuit for the other games. Everyone in town heard about the great coach Tony Pulis and how well he was doing. They wanted to show their support for him and the West Brom soccer team, so they went to the club's store to buy navy caps just like Tony's. People bought so many caps that the store ran out of them!

If a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos' approval, then go all out with big stars and glossy production values, that way, people will come for the stars.

Up to c. 1210, continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art.

Conduct research on the economic history of the United States, including data on when the country's economy overtook other major global economies. 2. Look for reliable sources that provide clear and accurate information on this topic. Step 1: Conducting research on the economic history of the United States I look into significant historical events and factors that contributed to the growth of the US economy. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the United States has been an economic powerhouse, with rapid industrialization and major advancements in technology. Key events and periods that contributed to this growth are the World Wars, the Great Depression, and the Post-WWII era. Step 2: Finding reliable sources for the information In conducting my research, I come across several reliable sources, such as data from the World Bank, and academic articles and books discussing the history of the United States' economic growth. After conducting my research and checking my sources, it is clear that the United States became the world's largest economy during the late 19th century or early 20th century. Some sources attribute the title to the US as early as the 1870s, while others mention the early 1900s, particularly around 1916 during World War I. Considering these findings, I will provide a combined answer: The United States became the world's largest economy sometime between the late 19th century and the early 20th century, with some sources pointing to the 1870s and others to the early 1900s, around 1916 during World War I.

Write an article based on this summary: Music festivals fail to reflect the diversity of the UK music scene, with headline slots being dominated by a small band of male rock acts over the decades, a study suggests. Article:","output":"Title: Are UK Music Festivals Truly Representing the Diverse Music Scene? Introduction The United Kingdom has long been applauded for its rich and diverse music scene, producing some of the world's greatest artists and bands. However, a recent study has brought to light a glaring issue with the nation's music festivals: they fail to reflect the true diversity of the UK's music scene. The study suggests that headline slots at these events have been dominated by a select few male rock acts over the years. The Lack of Diversity in Headline Acts Music festivals across the UK have become a staple of the British summer, with thousands of people flocking to see a variety of artists and bands perform in large outdoor settings. Despite the vast array of musical genres and styles prevalent in the UK, it seems that the majority of music festivals continue to be headlined by a small group of predominantly male rock acts. This persistent focus on a specific genre raises the question of why other music styles are not given greater representation. Male Domination in the Music Industry The male-dominated music industry may be a contributing factor to the lack of diversity in UK music festivals. Historically, the music business has been overwhelmingly male, with women and marginalized groups struggling to gain equal representation and opportunities. This could be reflected in the music festival scene, with the artists and bands that dominate these lineups benefiting from longstanding biases in the industry. Potential Bias in Booking Decisions Booking agents and festival organizers have a significant role to play in this issue. These professionals are responsible for deciding which acts will perform at their events, and their choices directly impact the diversity that festival-goers experience. The study's findings imply that biases may exist in the booking process, favouring acts that have traditionally been at the forefront of the music scene. This established dynamic perpetuates a narrow view of the UK's music landscape, robbing festival attendees of the chance to enjoy a wider range of musical styles and performers. The Effects on Emerging Talent The issue does not only have an impact on festival-goers; it also affects emerging artists and musicians hoping to make their mark on the industry. Music festivals are an excellent platform for new talent, offering an opportunity for up-and-coming acts to expose their work to a wide audience. By failing to reflect the full spectrum of the UK's music scene, these festivals may inadvertently stifle the careers of budding musicians whose work falls outside of the prevailing male rock act mold. Conclusion It is necessary for those involved in the UK's music festival scene – from organizers and booking agents to artists and fans – to confront and challenge the longstanding lack of diversity in the festivals' lineups. By expanding the variety of acts included in these events, UK music festivals will better represent the nation's rich and eclectic music scene, while providing a more inclusive and fair platform for emerging talent to flourish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.  - The Isle of Wight Festival is a music festival which takes place annually on the Isle of Wight in England.

Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete.  - A ceramic is an inorganic, nonmetallic solid material comprising metal, nonmetal or metalloid atoms primarily held in ionic and covalent bonds. This article gives an overview of ceramic materials from the point of view of materials science.   - Pottery is the craft of making ceramic material into pots or potterywares using mud. Major types of potterywares include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. The place where such wares are made by a \\"potter\\" is called a \\"pottery\\" (plural \\"potteries\\"). The technical definition of \\"pottery\\" used by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) is \\"all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except technical, structural, and refractory products.\\"  - Scrapbooking is a method, an art for preserving, presenting, arranging personal and family history in the form of a book, box, card.

It was recorded and released in 1972 as Grunt FTR - 1007 , and peaked at No. 20 in America .  - Industrial design is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production. Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication. This distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator at the time of its creation.  - A rock festival, often considered synonymous with pop festival, is a large-scale rock music concert, featuring multiple acts performing an often diverse range of popular music including rock, pop, folk, electronic, and related genres.  - Jefferson Airplane was a rock band based in San Francisco, California, who pioneered psychedelic rock. Formed in 1965, the group defined the San Francisco Sound and was the first from the Bay Area to achieve international commercial success. They were headliners at the three most famous American rock festivals of the 1960sMonterey (1967), Woodstock (1969) and Altamont (1969)and the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968) in England. Their 1967 break-out album \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" ranks on the short list of most significant recordings of the \\"Summer of Love\\".

Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.  - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - The San Francisco Sound refers to rock music performed live and recorded by San Francisco-based rock groups of the mid-1960s to early 1970s. It was associated with the counterculture community in San Francisco during these years. San Francisco is a westward-looking port city, a city that at the time was 'big enough' but not manic like New York City or spread out like Los Angeles. Hence, it could support a 'scene'. According to journalist Ed Vulliamy, \\"A core of Haight Ashbury bands played with each other, for each other, for free and at Chet Helms's Avalon Ballroom and Bill Graham's Fillmore.\\"  - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.  - Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast.  - ) is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word \\"origami\\" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat sheet square of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word \\"\\" to refer to designs which use cuts, although cutting is more characteristic of Chinese papercrafts.  - Woodworking is the activity or skill of making items from wood, and includes cabinet making (Cabinetry and Furniture), wood carving, joinery, carpentry, and woodturning.  - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.  - A studio is an artist's or worker's workroom, or the catchall term for an artist and their employees who work within that studio. This can be for the purpose of acting, architecture, painting, pottery (ceramics), sculpture, origami, woodworking, scrapbooking, photography, graphic design, filmmaking, animation, industrial design, radio or television production broadcasting or the making of music. The term is also used for the workroom of dancers, often specified to dance studio.  - The Summer of Love was a social phenomenon that occurred during the summer of 1967, when as many as 100,000 people, mostly young people sporting hippie fashions of dress and behavior, converged in San Francisco's neighborhood Haight-Ashbury. Although hippies also gathered in many other places in the U.S., Canada and Europe, San Francisco was at that time the most publicized location for hippie fashions.  - Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners.  - Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term \\"graphic design\\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging and signage.  - Surrealistic Pillow is the second album by American rock band Jefferson Airplane, released on February 1, 1967, by RCA Victor (LSP-3766 [stereo] and LPM-3766 [mono]). It is the first album by the band with vocalist Grace Slick and drummer Spencer Dryden. The album peaked at number three on the \\"Billboard\\" album chart and has been certified a gold album by the RIAA.  - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.    What is the relationship between 'long john silver ' and 'psychedelic rock'? Answer:","output":"Long John Silver is the seventh studio album by Jefferson Airplane, a rock band based in San Francisco, California, who pioneered psychedelic rock. The relation between Long John Silver and psychedelic rock is that the album was created by Jefferson Airplane, a band that played a significant role in the development and popularization of the psychedelic rock genre. Their music, including the \\"Long John Silver\\" album, often features elements of psychedelic rock, such as experimental sounds, unconventional song structures, and lyrics that reflect the psychedelic culture of the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: The Wrestler Context: Over the credits, we see numerous magazines and newspaper articles from the 80's, all of which feature Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a major professional wrestling star. We then flash forward twenty years, where Randy \\"The Ram\\" is getting ready for a match in a small, local auditorium on the underground circuit. He interacts with the other wrestlers backstage, most of whom are much younger than he is (Randy is acknowledged to be in his 50's). Ironically, though they are foes inside the ring, outside the wrestlers are all friendly, discussing with each other how they want to perform the \\"act\\" that night, and after the show go drinking together. Randy preps for the match and it's obvious his age has caught up with him; his joints are cracking as he stretches and becomes short-winded easily. After he stretches he puts a small piece of a razor blade in his wrist bandages, in which later he uses to cut himself on the forehead to draw blood, making the match more dramatic for the fans. Afterward, Randy is given a meager payday, as the promoter claims the audience was smaller than expected. Randy's manager then poses a 20th anniversary rematch with his most notable opponent, the Ayatollah, which sold out Madison Square garden in the 80's. Randy agrees, hoping this kind of high-profile match could help him get back to the top.Randy goes home to find he has been locked out of his trailer for not paying his rent. He takes pain medication with a beer and falls asleep in the back of his van. The next day he goes to work to load boxes at a supermarket where he asks his boss if he could have more hours. His boss is very rude to him and makes a snide comment about the cost of tights going up being the reason he needs more hours. Randy laughs it off and continues to ask his boss for more hours but \\"not on the weekends\\".

Your non-dominant hand should use the front of the can opener, and vice versa. Raise the lid and squeeze the button (s).  (d). These will be ideal for holding something while still protecting your non-dominant arm. Most camp can openers do this with left handed and right handed players.","output":"The next paragraph ends with: (b). If you are left handed, make sure you are comfortable using your right hand to open the can, or you may be cut by the blade. Hold the can firmly with your left hand. To continue with the instructions, place the small blade of the camp can opener at the lip of the can lid. With the can opener resting on the upper rim and the blade puncturing the lid, apply downward pressure on the opener while keeping a firm grip on the can. Use your left hand to hold the can steady and rotate it counterclockwise. As you rotate the can, the blade will cut through the lid in a smooth and continuous motion.  Take care to follow the inner edge of the can's lid as closely as possible to avoid jagged or uneven edges that may pose a safety hazard. Once you have worked your way around the entire circumference of the can, carefully remove the lid, taking care not to touch any sharp edges or spill the contents of the can. Dispose of the lid responsibly, and thoroughly rinse the can opener under warm, soapy water to remove any residue left behind from the can opening process. Using a camp can opener efficiently and safely comes with practice, so if you're not confident in your abilities at first, try opening a few cans at home before venturing out into the great outdoors. Remember, safety is always the top priority when using sharp tools – so proceed with caution and take your time as you familiarize yourself with this essential camping tool."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: \\"What kind of birds resemble humans more?\\"  Context: \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\\"  Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, the birds that resemble humans more are the ones with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls.  Step 1: Identify the key information in the context related to bird characteristics that can be compared to humans. In the given context, some key features mentioned are ultraviolet vision, eyelids, nictitating membrane, eye position, and ear structure. Step 2: Determine the features relevant to human resemblance. Humans do not have ultraviolet vision, do not possess a nictitating membrane, and have a different ear structure. Hence, these features cannot be used for comparison. However, eye position can be compared to humans, as both humans and some birds have forward-facing eyes. Step 3: Identify the bird group that shares a similar eye position with humans. The context mentions that birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision, similar to humans. Step 4: Conclude which bird type resembles humans more. Considering the eye position similarity, owls seem to resemble humans more as compared to other birds. Hence, the answer is that birds with forward-facing eyes, such as owls, resemble humans more due to their shared binocular vision and ability to estimate the depth of field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who was classified legally as a Frenchman?  Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was...

On Wednesday afternoon, countless unsuspecting email users—including reporters from BuzzFeed, Hearst, New York Magazine, Vice, as well as your friends here at Gizmodo Media—received some seemingly legit invites to view a Google Docs file.

Write a title: A family tug-of-war over whether to reveal Yasser Arafat #39;s cause of death bubbled over in public yesterday, with a brother of the late leader insisting the Palestinian people are entitled to know.","output":"Title: Torn Between Truth and Legacy: The Struggle Within Yasser Arafat's Family Over Unveiling the Hidden Cause of His Death Introduction: The quest for answers behind the mysterious death of iconic Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has been an ongoing debate ever since his sudden demise in 2004. Surrounded by an enigma, Arafat's cause of death has puzzled the world and raised numerous conspiracy theories over the years. Amidst all the chaos, the latest development involving a family tug-of-war has emerged, as Arafat's brother calls for disclosing the truth to the Palestinian people. As the tension within the family bubbles over in public, the dilemma between revealing the truth and preserving a legacy becomes more persistent. Background: Yasser Arafat, born in 1929, was a significant symbol for the Palestinian people, as he fought for their right to self-determination for several decades. As the leader of Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and later the President of the Palestinian Authority, Arafat became a cornerstone of Palestinian politics. However, his sudden death at the age of 75 raised many questions, as no clear cause of death was given. Rumors and Speculations: Several conspiracy theories have circulated since Arafat's death, with one suggesting his mysterious illness had been due to poisoning, possibly carried out by Israel. In 2012, an investigation conducted by Al Jazeera discovered traces of Polonium-210, a highly toxic radioactive substance, on Arafat's personal belongings. This finding further fueled the rumors of foul play. The Family's Involvement: Despite numerous calls for further investigation into Arafat's death, the family was initially hesitant to authorize an exhumation of his remains to reveal the cause of death definitively. Suha Arafat, his widow, played a significant role in this decision, as she wanted to protect the image of her husband and avoid any political exploitation of his death. She believed that Arafat's legacy was more important than finding a definitive cause of his death. The Public Tug-of-War: In recent developments, Yasser Arafat's brother, Fathi Arafat, has insisted that the Palestinian people are entitled to know the truth behind their leader's death. The family disagreement became public as other family members, such as Nasser al-Qidwa, Arafat's nephew, sided with Fathi, highlighting the importance of shedding light on the cause of death even if it tarnishes Arafat's image. Conclusion: The ongoing struggle within Yasser Arafat's family over revealing his cause of death reflects a deeper conflict between the need for transparency and the desire to protect their loved one's legacy. With emotions running high and the Palestinian people eager for the truth, it remains to be seen whether the family eventually decides to reveal the mysterious cause of their beloved leader's death. Until then, the debate surrounding Arafat's demise continues, leaving not only his family but also the world in an unresolved tug-of-war."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a general rule, start with a 10 to 12 ft (3.0 to 3.7 m) long truck if you’re moving 1 room’s worth of stuff and add 2 to 3 ft (0.61 to 0.91 m) for each additional room you plan on packing.  For small loads, you may be able to rent a pickup truck or cargo van instead of a full moving truck. If you need to haul a large object like a car or tractor, make sure your truck comes with a trailer hitch. Your search results will show you a number of different rental stores located near your house. Most of your options will be national franchises like U-Haul, Penske, and Enterprise, though some areas may have small mom-and-pop rental shops as well. Chain stores have more locations than independent businesses, so go with them if you plan on traveling far away. Before committing to a specific rental company, look at how much each store charges for the type of truck you want. Some stores offer rental estimates through their official website, though others may require you to call their customer hotline for current pricing information.  When comparing prices, keep in mind that some companies charge an additional fee for each mile you drive. Make sure you look at each company’s website to see if there are any promotional discounts available, and don’t forget to search online for third-party coupons from groups like AAA. Depending on the company you’re renting from, you may need to reserve your truck in advance. You can typically do this in person, through the store’s official website, or by calling the store’s customer hotline.  To reserve your truck, you’ll have to know the dates you need it for, where you want to pick it up from, and where you want to return it to. In some cases, making your reservation early can lock you into lower rental rates.","output":"When renting a truck for moving purposes, the primary focus should be on the size of the truck. Typically, a 10 to 12 ft (3.0 to 3.7 m) truck is suitable for moving belongings from a single room. For each additional room, an extra 2 to 3 ft (0.61 to 0.91 m) should be added to the length of the truck. For smaller loads, options such as pickup trucks or cargo vans could be more suitable. If large objects like cars or tractors need to be transported, ensure the truck has a trailer hitch. Various rental stores, including national franchises like U-Haul, Penske, and Enterprise, as well as local mom-and-pop shops, can be found in different locations. Chain stores might be a better option for long-distance moves due to their widespread presence. Before choosing a rental company, compare the prices for the required truck type. Some companies may provide rental estimates on their websites, while others could require a phone call to obtain pricing information. Be aware that some companies may charge an additional fee for each mile driven, so this should be factored into the comparison process. Check for available promotional discounts on company websites or look for third-party coupons from organizations like AAA. Prices can vary between companies, so thorough research is advised. Depending on the rental company, reservations may be required in advance. The reservation process can typically be completed in person, through the company's website, or by calling their customer hotline. When making a reservation, provide the required dates, pickup location, and return location. Early reservations may provide the advantage of lower rental rates. Overall, the key to renting a suitable truck for a move involves considering the truck size, comparing rental companies and prices, and taking advantage of discounts and promotions. Ensuring the truck can accommodate the load and is reserved in advance will contribute to a successful moving experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Finn finds a clue to the location of the treasure and manages to get on Nigel Honeycutt's yacht The Precious Gem and convince him and his daughter Gemma to join (and fund) the search for the treasure. A local gangster named Bigg Bunny and Finn's mentor, Moe Fitch, are intent on finding the treasure first. The Precious Gem and Moe's vessel compete to find the treasure in The Bahamas. As Finn attempts to secretly take down Moe's search grid, Finn discovers a sword which is a clue to finding the treasure. Tess and Finn follow the clues to an ancient church and discover a diary describing the location of the treasure. Bigg Bunny and his associates, who have been following Tess and Finn, take Tess hostage and assume (incorrectly) that Finn was killed. Bigg Bunny forces Tess to aid him in the search for the treasure in a blowhole, the location revealed in the diary. Tess finds the treasure in a cave beneath the blowhole. Meanwhile, Finn and the Honeycutts enlist the help of Moe in taking the treasure out of Bigg Bunny's hands. They arrive as Bigg Bunny sends one of his associates back into the water to find out who was killed in the blowhole. The blowhole kills Bigg Bunny's employee and traps Finn and Tess. Tess saves Finn, only to have Bigg Bunny kidnap Tess again. Gemma gets Finn to Bigg Bunny's plane on her jet ski and Finn leaps on the plane's pontoon as the plane takes off. As Bigg Bunny attempts to shoot Finn, Tess kicks Bigg Bunny out of the plane, sending him into the ocean.

The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website.  Instrumental versions of the songs on Year Zero are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including MP3, WAV, GarageBand, and Ableton Live formats. A planned film adaption of Year Zero became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks.

On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean.  - Malawi (or ; or [maláwi]), officially the Republic of Malawi, is a landlocked country in southeast Africa that was formerly known as Nyasaland. It is bordered by Zambia to the northwest, Tanzania to the northeast, and Mozambique on the east, south and west. The country is separated from Tanzania and Mozambique by Lake Malawi. Malawi is over with an estimated population of 16,777,547 (July 2013 est.). Its capital is Lilongwe, which is also Malawi's largest city; the second largest is Blantyre, the third is Mzuzu and the fourth largest is its old capital Zomba. The name Malawi comes from the Maravi, an old name of the Nyanja people that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed \\"The Warm Heart of Africa\\".  - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania.  - The Dwangwa River in Malawi is a tributary river for Lake Nyasa . It flows for approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) . The river 's source is in the Kasungu National Park , in Malawi 's central plateau . It flows north - easterly from this plateau through an ancient valley . The river 's mouth flows out of a more recently cut gorge , into the Lake . It also flows through the Bana Swamp The Dwangwa River is used both for irrigation and the generation of hydroelectric power . It is a fishing river , with prawns found in the river .  - Mozambique (or ), officially the Republic of Mozambique (or \\"\\") is a country in Southeast Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest. It is separated from Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east. The capital and largest city is Maputo (known as \\"Lourenço Marques\\" before independence).  - Lake Malawi, also known as Lake Nyasa in Tanzania and Lago Niassa in Mozambique, is an African Great Lake and the southernmost lake in the East African Rift system, located between Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. It is the ninth largest lake in the world and the third largest and second deepest lake in Africa. It is home to more species of fish than any other lake, including about 1000 species of cichlids. The Mozambique portion of the lake was officially declared a reserve by the Government of Mozambique on June 10, 2011,while in Malawi a portion of the lake is included in Lake Malawi National Park. Lake Malawi is a meromictic lake, meaning that its water layers do not mix. The permanent stratification of Lake Malawi's water and the oxic-anoxic boundary (relating to oxygen in the water) are maintained by moderately small chemical and thermal gradients.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".  - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River.  - \\"Main Stem\\" is 1942 instrumental by Duke Ellington and His Famous Orchestra.

These beautiful plants can thrive in your garden with proper care and attention. In this article, we will discuss some essential care tips to help you maintain healthy and vibrant gardenias, including watering, mulching, feeding, misting, pruning, and protecting them from pests and cold snaps. Step 1: Watering To ensure your gardenias receive adequate hydration, it's important to water them with an inch of water once a week. This will provide the necessary moisture for their root system, promoting healthy growth and preventing the soil from drying out too much. Keep in mind that over-watering or under-watering can cause problems, so be consistent in providing the right amount of water weekly. Step 2: Mulching Applying a 2-inch (5.1 cm) layer of organic mulch around the base of your gardenias serves several purposes. Mulch helps retain moisture in the soil, regulates temperature, and suppresses weeds that might compete with your gardenias for water and nutrients. Moreover, as the mulch breaks down, it provides additional organic matter and nutrients to the soil, enhancing the overall health of your gardenias. Step 3: Feeding Gardenias require nutrient-rich soil with a slightly acidic pH. To achieve this, feed your gardenias with acid fertilizer twice per year. This will replenish the essential nutrients they need to grow and bloom, while also maintaining the acidity level of the soil. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions on the fertilizer package. Step 4: Misting Misting your gardenias daily with a spray bottle helps maintain the humidity levels they prefer. This is especially important in dry or arid environments where the air lacks sufficient moisture. Regular misting can also help prevent common issues such as leaf drop or bud drop by providing the necessary moisture to the plant. Step 5: Pruning Pruning your gardenias helps maintain a tidy appearance, encourages new growth, and allows for better air circulation. Remove any dead or damaged branches, and shape the plant as desired. Be mindful not to overprune your gardenias, as this can negatively impact their growth and overall health. Step 6: Monitoring and Managing Pests Monitor your gardenias for common pests such as whiteflies and mealybugs. If you notice infestations, try using insecticidal soap or horticultural oil to eliminate these pests without harming the plant. Always follow the product's label instructions and avoid spraying during extreme heat or direct sunlight. Step 7: Protecting from Cold Snaps Gardenias can be sensitive to cold temperatures, especially during winter. To protect them from frost or freezing temperatures, cover your gardenias with a blanket or a cardboard box during cold snaps. This will provide insulation and help maintain a stable temperature for your gardenias, preventing potential freezing damage. Conclusion: With proper care and attention, your gardenias can thrive and provide you with their striking beauty and alluring fragrance for years to come. By following these essential care tips, you can ensure that your gardenias remain healthy, vibrant, and a gorgeous addition to your garden."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An international panel","output":"Title: The Time Paradox Candidate Genre: Sci-Fi/Action/Thriller Plot Summary: In the not-too-distant future, an international panel of experts known as the Global Time Commission (GTC) is formed to regulate the use of a groundbreaking time-travel machine that has the potential to alter the course of history. The panel is responsible for selecting candidates to perform time-travel missions that may solve critical global problems, including climate change, resource depletion and war. Their latest mission, codenamed Operation Proteus, is designed to prevent a catastrophic event that could lead to the complete collapse of human civilization. Main Characters: 1. Dr. Charles Thompson - Renowned physicist and inventor of the time-travel machine. 2. Agent Sarah Meyers - Skilled MI6 operative and candidate chosen by the GTC to travel back in time for Operation Proteus. 3. Chairman Ming Wu - Head of the GTC, responsible for ensuring the missions run smoothly and ethically. 4. Dr. Maria Rodriguez - A highly empathetic and critical ethics expert on the GTC, who ensures the panel makes moral decisions. 5. Sebastien Devereaux - An egotistical rival scientist hell-bent on sabotaging the work of Dr. Thompson. Plot: Dr. Charles Thompson discovers the secret to time travel and creates a machine capable of sending people back in time. The world is awestruck, but the potential for misuse is enormous. To prevent chaos, the United Nations forms the Global Time Commission (GTC), an international panel comprising scientists, military strategists, and ethicists who are responsible for choosing candidates to travel in the machine. With an urgent mission to prevent an imminent global catastrophe, the GTC selects Agent Sarah Meyers as their time-travel candidate. Agent Meyers has a distinguished background involving high-risk situations and extreme decision-making. She is brought to the GTC headquarters, where she undergoes training and learns about her target – an individual whose critical action in the past would unleash a devastating sequence of events in the present if not prevented. As Sarah prepares for the mission, she forms a close bond with Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a member of the GTC who helps her understand the moral and intellectual challenges posed by altering history. Meanwhile, Dr. Thompson faces pressure from the ambitious and ruthless scientist, Sebastien Devereaux, who aims to undermine the project and seize control of the time-travel technology for his own nefarious purposes. This sets off a tense conflict within the GTC and raises the stakes for the mission. The mission Day arrives, and Sarah is sent back in time. With limited time and resources, she has to navigate the complexities of the past and identify the crucial decision made by the target individual. As she moves closer to locating the target, Sarah discovers shocking information that casts new light on the GTC's motives, and she begins to question whether the mission is as noble as it seems. Back in the present, Dr. Thompson and Dr. Rodriguez suspect foul play as they uncover Devereaux's plan to manipulate the mission and rewrite history for personal gain. They race against time to inform Sarah and help her undermine Devereaux's scheme. This parallel action between the past and the present culminates in a thrilling climax, as Sarah faces the final decision to complete or to abort the mission, which may not only have the power to change global history but also challenge the core values of humanity itself. With twists and turns that keep audiences on the edge of their seats, 'The Time Paradox Candidate' is an enthralling exploration of the ethical and philosophical challenges raised by the prospect of time travel, power, and human responsibility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fred McFeely Rogers (March 20, 1928 - February 27, 2003) was an American television personality, musician, puppeteer, writer, producer, and Presbyterian minister. Rogers was famous for creating, hosting and composing the theme music for the educational preschool television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1968-2001), which featured his kind-hearted grandfatherly personality, and direct connection to his audiences. Originally trained and ordained as a minister, Rogers was displeased with the way television addressed children at the time, and made an effort to change this when he began to write for and perform on local Pittsburgh-area shows dedicated to youth. Rogers developed his own show on WQED in 1968, and it was distributed nationwide by Eastern Educational Television Network. Rogers was born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, 40 miles (65 km) southeast of Pittsburgh, to James and Nancy Rogers; he had one sister, Elaine. Early in life, he spent much of his free time with his maternal grandfather, Fred McFeely, who had an interest in music. He would often sing along as his mother would play the piano, and he himself began playing at five. He obtained a pilot's license while still in high school.  Rogers graduated from Latrobe High School (1946). He studied at Dartmouth College (1946-48), then transferred to Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, where he earned a B.A. in Music Composition in 1951. Rogers was also a trained general aviation pilot.  At Rollins, he met Sara Joanne Byrd (born c. 1928), an Oakland, Florida, native; they married on June 9, 1952. They had two sons, James (b. 1959) and John (b. 1961). In 1963, Rogers graduated from Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and was ordained a minister in the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.  Rogers had an apartment in New York City and a summer home on Nantucket island in Massachusetts. Rogers was red-green color blind, swam every morning, and neither smoked nor drank. He was a vegetarian on ethical grounds, stating \\"I don't want to eat anything that has a mother.\\" Despite recurring rumors, he never served in the military.  His office at WQED Pittsburgh famously did not have a desk, only a sofa and armchairs, because Rogers thought a desk was \\"too much of a barrier\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what did he do instead of serving in the military?","output":"Instead of serving in the military, Fred Rogers studied at Dartmouth College, transferred to Rollins College, and earned a B.A. in Music Composition.

But the threat wasn’t over, a sixth fatality was discovered, and public safety officials remained cautious about allowing the 38,000 evacuees to return home.      Fire fighting conditions improved in and around Redding, as winds stayed calm throughout the day. “We are very encouraged with the fire status in the city today,” said Cal Fire incident manager Bret Gouvea in an afternoon press briefing. “We’ve had no movement on the fire over the last day inside the city limits.”      Even so, the death toll from the fire grew. Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said a sixth person had been found dead Sunday. He wouldn’t say where the person died but added that the victim had received an evacuation notice but didn’t leave.      In addition, seven people in Redding remain missing, he said.

The deadly blaze, which had chewed through 95,000 acres, began surging into Trinity County, where the tiny community of Lewiston, with a population of about 1,100, was evacuated late Saturday.                  Gouvea said firefighters were struggling to contain the fire around a 100-mile perimeter, but added: “We’re feeling a lot more optimistic today as we’re starting to make up some ground instead of being on the defensive.” Containment grew from 5 percent to 17 percent late Sunday.      Still, Gouvea said that wind and weather patterns remain unpredictable and “the fire does continue to grow on us in some remote areas.” Late Sunday more evacuations were ordered, stretching from the Buckhorn Summit Road area west of Whiskeytown Lake well into eastern Trinity County.      Just two days earlier, public safety officials were urging residents to be ready to evacuate at a moment’s notice. On Sunday, their plea to the thousands who fled was markedly different: Be patient about going home.      “We care about you, and we are moving as fast as we can to get you back into your homes,” said Mike Hebrard, the Shasta County fire chief. “We understand how that feels, a lot of us are evacuated as well. We are clearing areas and making it safe as fast as we can.”                  The Shasta County Sheriff’s Department did lift evacuation orders late Saturday for the Redding Ranchettes area, just south of the Win-River Casino. But officials were adamant about issuing a mass “re-population” order for the bulk of the evacuees.      Leonard Moty, a county supervisor who’s among the evacuees, added: “Let the fire personnel make it safe before you go back.”      There have been scattered reports of looting, and National Guard troops have been stationed at multiple road blocks around the city. Roger Moore, Redding’s police chief, said the department had beefed up patrol and will arrest people who can’t show a reason for being in an evacuated neighborhood.                  “If we don’t arrest them for looting, we’ll arrest them for something else,” he said. “We are nipping it in the bud before it happens.” He said someone was arrested late Saturday on an illegal weapons charge.

Source: National Interagency Fire Center      The evacuees, meanwhile, were trying to remain patient.      At the Shasta College evacuation center, Otis Bershers, 75, was waiting anxiously for word that he and his wife, Carol, could return to their home in the city of Shasta Lake, north of Redding.      They’ve been sleeping on cots on the lawn outside the college since late Thursday, and Otis Bershers is starting to run low on his medication. He has the chronic lung condition known as COPD, and breathing the smoky air isn’t good for him. But he declined an offer to go to the hospital and said he wouldn’t leave his wife or their cat, Smokey, who was tethered to their cots.      “God, I hope they lift it on my place,” he said of the evacuation order. “I want to go home. But as long as I got my cat and her, I can’t go wrong.”      Stuart and Renee Bailey, sitting in their SUV outside their west Redding subdivision, were anxious to return home as well. Their property escaped the fire, and Stuart Bailey, a contractor, was hoping to stop in to pick up some tools for work. The couple also wanted to see if the home had been looted.      Law enforcement personnel turned them away. But the Baileys said they understood the need to be cautious. When another couple got miffed at being denied entry to the neighborhood, the Baileys told them to stay calm.      “Cut them some slack,” Stuart Bailey said, referring to the law enforcement officials. “You’ll get in sooner or later.”      The re-population process will be slow and will start with the areas that Cal Fire believes are safest from potential return of the fire, officials said. “We don’t want to allow (people) back in, then if conditions change, have to re-evacuate,” Bosenko said. “We can’t open the floodgates. We have to do it in segments.”      Utility crews are fixing gas lines and performing other repairs in preparation for re-population. By Sunday afternoon, Redding Electric Utility had restored power to 7,400 customers, leaving 600 without power, said utility director Dan Beans.      PG&E crews were fanning out in evacuated neighborhoods to conduct a crucial re-population task: Cutting off gas lines at burnt-out homes that sit next to homes that were untouched by the fire.      The fire was creating chaos at times along portions of the power grid in Shasta and Trinity counties. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had to evacuate personnel from hydro power plants in both counties, including massive Shasta Dam.      “We’ve been working really hard to keep the power on,” said Reclamation spokeswoman Erin Curtis. “It’s a region-wide issue that we’re dealing with across the fire area.”      Cal Fire said 884 buildings had been destroyed, including 657 homes.      The six people who have died include Melody Bledsoe, 70, and her two great-grandchildren, Emily, 4, and James, 5. The fire has also claimed Redding fire inspector Jeremy Stoke, 37, and private bulldozer operator Don Ray Smith, 81.                  A GoFundMe account has been established for the Bledsoe family. A little more than 1,100 had been raised by Sunday afternoon.      Temperatures in Redding were anticipated to remain uncomfortably high: 104 degrees Monday, 105 on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service.      A community meeting was scheduled for 4 p.m. Monday at the Redding Civic Auditorium. ||||| Burned vehicles sit in front of a wildfire-ravaged home, Sunday, July 29, 2018, in Redding, Calif.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Associated Press)      REDDING, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on fires in California (all times local):      11 p.m.      Authorities have arrested two people on suspicion of looting homes that had been evacuated due to an explosive wildfire.      The Sacramento Bee reports that 25-year-old Jade Ball and 19-year-old Jack Fannin, of Redding, were found with what police said was evidence tying them to several burglaries.      The so-called Carr Fire prompted mandatory evacuations for tens of thousands of people in Redding, a city hundreds of miles north of San Francisco. It has destroyed over 650 houses.      Authorities say a homeowner who stayed behind flagged down an officer after he noticed evidence that people had been in his house.      Officers found a nearby home with evidence of a broken-in door and discovered electronic items stacked by the front door. Police say they do not believe the homeowners placed the items like that before evacuating.      ___      10:45 p.m.      Thousands more are fleeing their homes after wildfires surged near a small lake town in Northern California while farther north firefighters made progress in a battle against a deadly blaze.      Crews stretched to their limits across the state are fighting flames that have claimed the lives of two firefighters and six civilians.      Residents of the waterfront town Lakeport fled Sunday after a major flare-up of two fires that combined across Mendocino and Lake counties destroyed at least four homes. Lakeport, home to about 5,000, is around 120 miles north of San Francisco.      To the northeast, a massive fire near Redding slowed for the first time since days of explosive growth.      Meanwhile officials said a second firefighter died fighting a huge blaze to the south near Yosemite National Park. |||||Summary:","output":"There was a big fire in a city called Redding in California, and it caused a lot of trouble for the people living there. The fire has been very dangerous, and at least six people have died because of it. Many people had to leave their homes to be safe, and firefighters are working very hard to try to stop the fire and help everyone. The weather has been very hot which has made it even more difficult to put out the fire. The people who had to leave their homes are waiting to go back, but authorities want to make sure it's safe for them before they return."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Oklo in Gabon, Africa is the only known place in the world where what reaction occurs naturally? What is the answer?","output":"Oklo, Gabon, Africa is the only known place in the world where natural nuclear fission reactions have been documented to occur naturally. Here's the explanation: The phenomenon was discovered at the Oklo uranium mines in 1972. These natural nuclear reactors are estimated to be about 2 billion years old. Around this period, concentration of U-235, a fissile isotope of uranium, was significantly higher (~3%) which is sufficient to support a chain reaction. The reactors were found to have operated for a few hundred thousand years, producing about 5 kW of heat continuously in that duration. In the reactors, uranium underwent spontaneous fission, releasing energy and creating byproducts similar to those produced in a typical nuclear reactor. This is considered a remarkable natural phenomenon and no other such locations have been discovered elsewhere to this day.  This might be a fact relatively unknown or interesting to many people as it's a unique natural occurrence and not a common topic of discussion."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The drive up to Rick's place in the hills always made me sick.

He claims Danish agency recruited him to work with CIA. PET said it had nothing to do with Anwar al-Awlaki operation.","output":"Title: A Double Agent's Journey: How Morten Storm turned from Radical Islamism to Becoming a Vital Link for the CIA Introduction The world of espionage and covert operations has long been fascinated with the notion of double agents. These are individuals who often lead dangerous lives, playing both sides of the coin and risking everything for their cause. Morten Storm is one such individual, and his story is nothing short of remarkable. The radical Islamist-turned-double agent claims that he was recruited by the Danish agency PET to work alongside the CIA in an effort to dismantle some of the most insidious networks within the extremist jihadist movement. Despite PET stating that it had no involvement in the Anwar al-Awlaki operation, Storm's tale sheds light on the inner workings of the secret world where terrorism, intelligence, and deception collide. Morten Storm: From Radical Islamism to Double Agent  Storm's career within the realm of radical Islamist groups began with his conversion to Islam in the late 1990s. A troubled individual with a violent past, he found solace and a sense of purpose within the teachings of the religion, soon becoming a radicalized figure. He established strong ties with extremist networks and jihadist figures and managed to ascend the ranks within these organizations. His unique set of skills and knowledge would eventually make him a valuable asset to the intelligence community. According to Storm, his life took a sharp turn when he was approached by the Danish intelligence agency PET. Recognizing his potential value as a double agent, they offered him the opportunity to turn against the radical groups he had once supported. With his unmatched access to key figures and knowledge of jihadist operations, Storm was a unique asset that the CIA and other intelligence agencies could use to infiltrate and dismantle these dangerous networks. Storm's Involvement with the Anwar Al-Awlaki Operation In his claims, Storm played a pivotal role in the operation against Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical Yemeni-American cleric who was considered one of the masterminds behind numerous terrorist plots, including the failed Christmas Day bombing in 2009. Awlaki was also known for his links with Al-Qaeda and his influential online sermons, which helped radicalize countless individuals worldwide. Storm's account suggests that he was able to establish contact with Awlaki and even deliver a tracking device inside a flash drive, which eventually led to the location and killing of the high-profile target by a U.S. drone strike in September 2011. This controversial operation, hailed as a major success in the fight against terrorism, has been shrouded in secrecy due to its implications on the use of targeted killings and extrajudicial methods. The PET's Denial of Involvement Despite Storm's claims that PET actively recruited him to work with the CIA and that they played a crucial role in the Anwar al-Awlaki operation, the Danish intelligence agency has officially denied any such involvement. The agency has maintained that it merely passed on information regarding Morten Storm's activities to its international partners, insinuating that any collaboration or recruitment may have been solely between Storm and the CIA. Conclusion Morten Storm's story reveals the intricate web of connections, deceit, and manipulation that forms the backbone of the intelligence world. The alleged collaboration between the PET and the CIA, along with the subsequent denial, raises further questions about the ethical and legal implications of such covert operations and collaborations. As the fight against terrorism continues, the use of double agents like Storm becomes even more valuable in gathering vital information and taking down extremist networks. While the full extent of Storm's contribution to the war on terror may never be fully known, his tale only adds to the mystique surrounding the secret world of espionage and double agents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: What sign of the zodiac would you be if you were born on St. Valentine's Day?","output":"If you were born on St. Valentine's Day, which is celebrated on February 14th, you would fall under the zodiac sign of Aquarius. Aquarius is the eleventh sign of the zodiac and is an air sign, symbolized by the Water Bearer. Individuals born between January 20th and February 18th are considered to be under this sign. Aquarius is known for being a sign of innovation, intellect, and originality. People born under this sign are often independent thinkers, philosophers, and visionaries who constantly seek new ideas and knowledge. They are drawn to humanitarian causes and are advocates for social change. They are typically perceived as being open-minded and altruistic, with a strong sense of morality and a desire to build a better world. Aquarians are ruled by the planet Uranus, which is associated with invention, rebellion, and progress. This influence makes Aquarians natural innovators and trailblazers, often pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo. They have a deep sense of curiosity and are driven to explore the unknown, further contributing to their often unorthodox and unique perspectives. In terms of personality traits, Aquarians tend to be highly intelligent, inventive, and creative. This sign values personal freedom and detests feeling restricted or confined in any way. They are extroverted and social, often surrounded by a diverse group of friends who are drawn to their unique energy and magnetic personality. They are great communicators and listeners, which helps them understand and empathize with others, no matter their background. On the flip side, Aquarians can sometimes be perceived as somewhat detached or aloof, as they may find it challenging to express their emotions openly. They may appear unemotional, even cold at times, but this is primarily due to their preference for rationality and logic over sentimentality. This rationality can also be a double-edged sword, as it may lead them to be seen as stubborn or inflexible in their opinions and ideas. In love and relationships, Aquarians tend to be very independent and can be hesitant to commit fully to anyone. They value their space and autonomy and are happiest with a partner who understands and respects their need for freedom. However, once they do commit, they can be deeply loyal and dedicated, always striving for growth and understanding within the partnership. In summary, if you were born on St. Valentine's Day, you would be an Aquarius, a sign known for its intelligence, creativity, and humanitarian nature. Your natural strengths lie in your ability to innovate, think critically, and communicate effectively with others. As an Aquarius, you would often be driven by your curiosity and desire to push boundaries, making you a true trailblazer in your own right."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the name of the person that painted the Pleasure at the Helm?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition, The Combat was bought from Etty by fellow artist John Martin for 300 guineas (about £24,000 in 2019 terms), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete. The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career.

If the parents care about their children whether they made many friends,what matters is that the child is comfortable and happy with his friends. Parents need to understand the steps children take in building friendships. First of all, be a friend to your child. Good friendships start at home. Children begin to develop the necessary ability to go out and meet others through getting with their parents. Greet the child warmly and let him know you are glad to see him. Children learn a lot from how their parents stay with them and other people. Teach children how to solve conflicts . Being able to work out conflicts is an important skill in getting along with others. If parents know the children have a conflict, let them work it out on their own. Only step in if it is really necessary, for example, an argument is getting physical. Give children chances to practice staying together. Have children play games that require team work and group problem solving skills. For example, races are fun and provide plenty of practice in teamwork. \\"In what ways didn't you work well together? What might you do differently next time?\\" For these ideas, see books such as Games Book by Terry Orlick, Energizers by Carol Apacki, and Team-Building Activities for Every Group by Alanna Jones.

The Indian ocean hosts a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer. The Pacific ocean has less phytoplankton and nutrients for marine life.  and a hint : Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries.

Please answer this question : Which ocean experiences more monsoonal wind forcing? A:","output":"The Indian Ocean experiences more monsoonal wind forcing compared to the Pacific Ocean. Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean is known for having one of the largest concentrations of phytoplankton blooms in summer, primarily due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing in the Indian Ocean leads to significant coastal and open ocean upwelling, introducing nutrients into the upper zones where there is enough light available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. As a result, these phytoplankton blooms play a crucial role in supporting the marine ecosystem, serving as the base of the marine food web, and ultimately supporting larger fish species. The monsoonal winds in the Indian Ocean are an essential factor contributing to the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch in the world. This abundant marine life is crucial for the bordering countries, both for domestic consumption and export, and attracts fishing fleets from countries like Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, who mostly exploit the Indian Ocean for shrimp and tuna.

She tells him that the man he is looking for, the one who will help him obtain the treasure he seeks, is a humble young boy by the name of Aladdin. Haseem goes in search of the boy and finds him returning home to his mother bringing her cabbages and watches as he alone defeats three boys that had come to bother and humiliate him.

Also, feel for bumps on your goat as you brush, as those could indicate infections or a cut or scratch. Your goat will not likely need clipping unless you plan to show her. Most of the time, brushing will be sufficient for your goat. To bathe the goat, slightly warm up the water so it's not cold. Lather the goat up with a shampoo meant for animals or specifically for goats. Use a washing mitt to help along the process. Rinse off the soap. It makes it easier if your goat has a collar on because it is easier for you to hold on to her. Pygmy goats need vitamin A in their diets to keep up their health. Mostly, they can get this vitamin from green hay or from grazing. However, if you are not supplying either of these, try adding some corn to their diet. Just like in humans, vitamin D helps goats absorb calcium, which maintains bone health. If your goats are outside most of the time, they will absorb vitamin D from the sun. However, if they don't get much sunlight, feed them either sun-cured hay (not heat-cured) or irradiated yeast. If your goats are exclusively pasture-fed (rather than alfalfa- and grain-fed), you should add a mix of iodized salt, limestone (ground), and animal bones (steamed and ground). Essentially, you can put this mixture out in its own bucket and let the goats eat it as needed. Selenium is an essential nutrient, but it is especially important if white muscle disease is prevalent in your area, as selenium protects against this disease. When kids are born, you should provide a supplement of this nutrient by needle. This disease calcifies the muscles, making them whitish, which is where the disease gets its name. Your goat will need to be vaccinated against enterotoxemia and tetanus, at the very least.  You can usually buy these at local feed stores and give them yourself. You may also want to ask your vet about rabies shots. You may also want a clostridium CD vaccination. To keep your goat in good health, it's best to schedule a yearly checkup. That way, you can ensure your goat has the proper vaccinations, and you know your goat is in good health. Your goats hooves will grow over time, and if they aren't trimmed, you could end up with goats who can't walk well.  To trim them, use gloves, hoof shears, and a hoof knife.  Tie or hold the goat. You will need to have someone hold the goat in place while you trim its hooves.  Look for the growth rings. You should be able to see where the hooves have grown. Trim back the hooves until they are even with the last growth ring.

Q:Information:  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Cyathus stercoreus, commonly known as the dung-loving bird's nest, is a species of fungus in the genus \\"Cyathus\\", family Nidulariaceae. Like other species in the Nidulariaceae, the fruiting bodies of \\"C. stercoreus\\" resemble tiny bird's nests filled with eggs. The fruiting bodies are referred to as splash cups, because they are developed to use the force of falling drops of water to dislodge and disperse their spores. The species has a worldwide distribution, and prefers growing on dung, or soil containing dung; the specific epithet is derived from the Latin word \\"stercorarius\\", meaning \\"of dung\\".  - Cyathus is a genus of fungi in the Nidulariaceae , a family collectively known as the bird 's nest fungi . They are given this name since they resemble tiny bird 's nests filled with \`\` eggs '' , structures large enough to have been mistaken in the past for seeds . However , these are now known to be reproductive structures containing spores . The \`\` eggs '' , or peridioles , are firmly attached to the inner surface of this fruit body by an elastic cord of mycelia known as a funiculus . The 45 species are widely distributed throughout the world and some are found in most countries , although a few exist in only one or two locales . Cyathus stercoreus is considered endangered in a number of European countries . Species of Cyathus are also known as splash cups , which refers to the fact that falling raindrops can knock the peridioles out of the open - cup fruit body . The internal and external surfaces of this cup may be ridged longitudinally ( referred to as plicate or striate ) ; this is one example of a taxonomic characteristic that has traditionally served to distinguish between species . Generally considered inedible , Cyathus species are saprobic , since they obtain nutrients from decomposing organic matter . They usually grow on decaying wood or woody debris , on cow and horse dung , or directly on humus - rich soil . The life cycle of this genus allows it to reproduce both sexually , with meiosis , and asexually via spores . Several Cyathus species produce bioactive compounds , some with medicinal properties , and several lignin - degrading enzymes from the genus may be useful in bioremediation and agriculture . Phylogenetic analysis is providing new insights into the evolutionary relationships between the various species in Cyathus , and has cast doubt on the validity of the older classification systems that are based on traditional taxonomic characteristics  - Nidula is a genus of fungi in the family Agaricaceae. Their fruit bodies resemble tiny egg-filled birds' nests, from which they derive their common name \\"bird's nest fungi\\". Originally described in 1902, the genus differs from the related genera \\"Cyathus\\" and \\"Crucibulum\\" by the absence of a cord that attaches the eggs to the inside of the fruit body. The life cycle of this genus allows it to reproduce both sexually, with meiosis, and asexually via spores. Species in this genus produce a number of bioactive compounds, including 4-(\\"p\\"-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone, a major component of raspberry flavor and insect attractor used in pesticides.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'parent taxon' with the subject 'cyathus'.

If the staircase is located exactly in the center of the home  take urgent action Please fix the punctuation.","output":"If the staircase is located exactly in the center of the home, take urgent action. In the event that you find the staircase of your residence situated precisely at the heart of the house, it is crucial to address the matter with urgency. The placement of the staircase is paramount to optimizing home safety, efficiency, and functionality. Furthermore, a centrally located staircase might impact other essential aspects of your dwelling such as access points, storage, and the overall aesthetic appeal. Firstly, a centrally positioned staircase ensures ease of movement between different levels in the house. By having the stairs easily accessible from various zones, you can significantly reduce unnecessary foot traffic in certain areas and facilitate efficient navigation of the space. Moreover, a central staircase benefits from natural light filtering down and brightening the core of your house, creating a more inviting ambiance. Secondly, a staircase in the middle of your home could impede proper energy flow and distribution. In Feng Shui, a traditional Chinese practice, the center of the home is referred to as the \\"heart\\" and should be kept relatively open and free from obstructions. Focusing on harmonious energy flow and distribution contributes to a positive atmosphere and enhances the overall well-being of the occupants. Thirdly, strategic placement of the staircase can aid in creating a functional and aesthetically pleasing home. A central staircase can serve as a focal point, making a strong visual statement or expressing your personal style. Proper design choices such as using high-quality materials, interesting patterns, or unique lighting fixtures, can elevate the ambiance of your home while ensuring that it remains functional and practical. When considering the importance of a centrally positioned staircase, it is advisable to engage the services of a professional architect or interior designer who can assess your current living environment and recommend adjustments or redesigns tailored to your specific needs. Overall, a staircase situated in the center of your house is indeed a matter that requires prompt attention. By carefully evaluating the design, accessibility, energy flow, and aesthetics, you can cultivate a comfortable and visually enticing space that complements modern living standards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As Hurricane Sandy's flood waters rose higher and higher around a stranded New York taxi cab on Monday night its, driver appeared helpless against the 14-foot storm surge that grew to his chin. But offering a final moment of mercy, witnesses watched as 25-year-old Jon Candelaria selflessly left his Upper East Side apartment to reach the man trapped in the churning water and wind. 'He looked like he was praying, preparing to die. He looked like he knew it was his time to go,' Mr Candelaria told DNA Info of the moment he reached the yellow SUV’s window. Standing at 6-feet-5, the East River’s water had swept up to Mr Candelaria's chest as he waded out to the vehicle he had spotted from his seventh floor apartment - a public housing complex on East 93rd street and First Avenue. From that window, at the peak of the storm, Mr Candelaria’s mother had let out a scream when catching sight of the cab as it abruptly lifted and spun 180-degrees around in the tide. 'That's when my mom flipped out,' Mr Candelaria recalled. Slipping on a jacket over a pair of shorts, Mr Candelaria began his dash outside and into the water while his mother dialed 911. '911 was overloaded. If we had waited for help, he would have died,' he said. Dipping into the water he estimated feeling like 40-degrees, Mr Candelaria said it didn't take long for the water to rise from his ankles to his chest. Wading one step at a time it was then a flash of his two-year-old daughter entered his head - his greatest risk of leaving behind. 'I would do it for anybody,' he later said of his decision. 'It doesn't matter who you are; you're a human being.' Dangerous: Standing at 6-feet-5, the East River's water had swept up to Mr Candelaria's chest as he waded out to the vehicle, pictured. Reaching the door he pulled at its handle but found it stuck, unable to budge against the water. Enlisting the driver's help, whom he said showed only brief panic, he signaled for them to both try on the count of three. Counting off, he said something unusual happened. 'As soon as I hit three, it seemed like everything became calm,' Mr Candelaria said, describing the wind briefly pausing for the first time. Pealing it open, Mr Candeleria was seen by other residents grabbing the driver from his vehicle and tossing him over his shoulder to begin their trek back. ‘Even if he had managed to get out of the car, I don't think he would have made it because he was so short,’ Mr Candeleria said of the man found to be 5-foot-1 in height. Floating: Mr Candelaria's mother had let out a scream when catching sight of the cab as it abruptly lifted and spun 180-degrees around in the tide.

Painted or carved wooden relief altarpieces became common, especially as churches created many side-chapels. Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck (d. 1441) and Rogier van der Weyden (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of incunabula, or works printed before 1500, by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others.

One day in autumn, when she rides her bicycle to school through the forest, she observes a hunting fox. Of course, the fox escapes, but the girl yearns to meet the animal again. She spends most of her free time in the forests trying to find the fox during the following months, but she doesn't meet the fox again until winter comes. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near to those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks; she is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves holes because of her observations; therefore the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. She finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it with meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox arrives at her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through her brittle plate glass window, causing the glass to shatter. The fox is hurt badly, but survives and the girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and may break more things such as fragile glass windows.

Neighbors of the family devastated by Friday's plane crash near Tweed New Haven Airport say it will take time for their neighborhood to feel safe again.      \\"The feel around here is different. It's scary,\\" said David Incerto, 36, on Monday morning. \\"It's just not the same.\\"      Incerto lives with his wife, Nicole, and daughters at 71 Charter Oak Ave., near the site of the crash that killed two girls in a home at 64 Charter Oak, the pilot and his teenage son.      \\"I think this road for a while is going to have an eerie feeling,\\" said Nicole Incerto. \\"For a while, it's not going to feel [safe] for everybody.\\"      Most investigators and emergency workers by Sunday morning had left Charter Oak Avenue, where the twin-engine plane crashed into two houses Friday.      The police department said officers would be posted at the charred ruins of the two houses that were heavily damaged and they would remain there until the buildings are demolished on Tuesday.      Charter Oak Avenue was open to traffic and the damaged homes were blocked off with chain-link fencing Monday morning.      Sade Brantley, 13, and Madisyn Mitchell, 1, who were in a house at 64 Charter Oak Ave., died when the plane crashed upside down onto it while trying to land at Tweed New Haven Airport, officials said. Their mother, Joann Mitchell, 39, also was home at the time, but escaped.      The pilot, Bill Henningsgaard, 54, of Medina, Wash., and his son, Maxwell, 17, also died. They were on a trip to visit East Coast colleges, friends said.      East Haven police, citing the state medical examiner's office, said all four victims died of blunt force trauma.      Police said Monday that a tea set Maxwell Henningsgaard had purchased for his family was recovered substantially intact from a compartment in the wrecked aircraft. It will be returned to the Henningsgaard family, police said.      David Esposito said he was drawn to the crash site by a neighbor, who turned out to be Mitchell, screaming at someone down the street.      \\"I thought it was an automobile accident, something that occurred. I ran down there and that's when I saw the plane sticking out of the house,\\" he said.      Mitchell screamed that her children were in the house upstairs and Esposito said he ran in to look for them.      \\"I went upstairs and, it's kind of funny, I saw a crib and that kind of bothered me. I took it apart, looking for somebody underneath the crib,\\" he said.      He pulled out debris scattered all over the floor and searched the closets and under the bed.      \\"There was nobody there,\\" he said.      A small fire inside the plane grew intense and Esposito said it occurred to him that there could be gas in the house.      \\"There was another gentlman behind me. I grabbed him and he grabbed the woman. The fire was pretty intense. It was time to get out,\\" Esposito said.

Former Microsoft Vice President Bill Henningsgaard, of Medina, was killed Friday along with his son when the plane they were flying crashed into two houses in a neighborhood in East Haven, Conn.      Two children were believed killed on the ground, according to Connecticut authorities.      Henningsgaard’s death was first reported by The Daily Astorian newspaper in the coastal Oregon town where he grew up, followed by a notice posted by Social Venture Partners, a Seattle foundation he formerly served as chairman, on its website. Officials had not yet confirmed the names of the victims as of late Friday.      Henningsgaard’s brother, Astoria City Attorney Blair Henningsgaard, said he hadn’t received official confirmation, but told The Seattle Times he suspected his brother and nephew were aboard the plane.      The father and his son — identified by Social Venture Partners as Max — were on the East Coast visiting colleges, according to the agency. Connecticut officials said Henningsgaard was set to land at Tweed-New Haven Airport, but missed the approach and attempted a second approach, The Hartford Courant reported. They said there was no distress call from the plane, which the Federal Aviation Administration said was a Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B, a multi-engine turboprop aircraft.      The bodies of the pilot and a child were found in the rubble, but East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo told reporters that the houses struck by the plane were unstable and crews were unable to get inside to do a full search. They were waiting for the National Transportation Safety Board to arrive before continuing the investigation.      Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Friday that two children, ages 1 and 13, were in one house and as many as three people might have been in the plane, The Courant reported.      “We presume there is going to be a very bad outcome,” East Haven Fire Chief Douglas Jackson said.      Bill Henningsgaard is listed as the registered agent of Ellumax Leasing in Medina, according to the Washington Secretary of State’s Office corporations website. Ellumax is the registered owner of the plane that crashed, FAA records show.      Henningsgaard was involved in a previous plane crash. In April 2009, his engine cut out 10 minutes into a flight from Astoria to Seattle with his mother, Edith Henningsgaard-Miller, a former Astoria mayor. The plane crash-landed into the Columbia River.      Standing on the wing of the plane as it sunk into the water, they were rescued by the Columbia River Bar Pilots. Henningsgaard wrote about the experience in a column on the Social Venture Partners website, urging people to reach out to children in the community.      He worked for about 14 years at Microsoft in various sales and marketing roles, including as vice president of sales for the Western U.S., Australia and New Zealand.      After leaving Microsoft, he became heavily involved in local social-service and philanthropy efforts, helping start Eastside Pathways, which works to support the area’s youth from “cradle to career.” He has also served as board member and past board chairman of both Youth Eastside Services and Social Venture Partners, which connects philanthropists and strengthens nonprofits.      Will Poole, former senior vice president of Microsoft’s Windows Client Business, said he and Henningsgaard were acquainted at Microsoft, but it was through Social Venture Partners that they and their families became good friends.      Henningsgaard, “like many of us, saw that we have the sort of business skills that are applicable to working in the nonprofit world and (that we could) help apply the best of what we learned at a company like Microsoft to help these organizations grow and thrive,” Poole said. “He was an effective and truly engaged philanthropist.”      Poole’s wife, Janet Levinger, a founding member and treasurer of Eastside Pathways, said Henningsgaard was “full of energy and really wanted to make a difference in the world. ... He walked his talk and took action.”      Jeff Raikes, CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was Henningsgaard’s boss at Microsoft when Henningsgaard served as vice president of worldwide licensing and pricing.      “Bill was a great thinker,” Raikes said. “If you had a tough, strategic challenge to take on, he’d be the sort of person you’d want to partner with.”      Raikes watched as Henningsgaard and his wife became more involved in philanthropy over the years, especially with groups providing opportunities for young people locally.      “He was a great leader at Microsoft,” Raikes said. “But I think, even more so, a greater leader in our community.”      Paul Shoemaker, Social Venture Partners executive connector, called him “an incredibly good, real, honest man, for the community, for his family, for this world.”      “The guy has already done so much for the world. And he was going to do so much more,” he said.      The post on the Social Ventures Partners website said the family is requesting donations to Eastside Pathways partners on behalf of Henningsgaard and to Camp Kiwanilong, in Warrenton, Ore., on behalf of his son, who spent several summers there.      “We know you will join the SVP Board and Staff in extending deepest condolences to Bill’s wife and daughters and Max’s mom and sisters, Susan Sullivan, Eleanor and Lucy,” the post said. “They are in our thoughts and hearts.”      Colin Campbell: 206-464-2033 or ccampbell@seattletimes.com.

(AP) — Authorities are making plans to demolish the two East Haven houses struck by an airplane Friday in a crash that claimed four lives.      The Connecticut Post reports the demolition will take place this week.      The houses were badly damaged when the 10-seat propeller-driven plane crashed on its approach to Tweed New Haven Airport.      Thirteen-year-old-old Sade Brantley and 1-year-old Madisyn Mitchell were killed when the plane hit their home, setting it on fire.      Also killed were the pilot, 54-year-old former Microsoft executive Bill Henningsgaard, and his 17-year-old son, Maxwell.      Officials have said emergency repairs were done after the crash to make the homes safe for the crews that recovered the bodies.      On Saturday night, dozens of people turned out for a vigil at Margaret Tucker Park to honor those who died in the crash.      Among those in attendance was 39-year-old Joann Mitchell, the mother of the 13-year-old and the 1-year-old. Mitchell, who did not speak at the vigil, was home at the time of the crash, but managed to escape.      The Hartford Courant reported that Mitchell posted the following message on her Facebook page: \\"\\"My heart is at a standstill. The feeling of emptiness engulfs me. Mommy will always love you … R.I.P. my sweet angels.\\"      East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo told the crowd at the vigil that the show of support was a great tribute.      \\"I think this is a great tribute to a great town,\\" the mayor said, \\"a caring town, a loving town. A town that comes out when things are down and people need you.\\"      Gov. Dannel Malloy said in a statement that the vigil was a \\"profound statement of the ties that bind East Haven and our entire state together as one community.\\"      \\"When a family suffers an unimaginable tragedy, we come together and pray that they have the strength they need to carry on,\\" Malloy said.      \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with all the families tonight who are suffering from grief and loss.\\" ||||| A former Microsoft executive and his teenage son are presumed dead after their small plane crashed into a residential neighborhood a few blocks from an airport while trying to land, setting fire to two houses and killing as many as four other people, the man's brother and authorities said.

(Associated Press)      Bill Henningsgaard and his teenage son, Maxwell, were traveling the East Coast to visit colleges, and Connecticut was part of the itinerary, said Blair Henningsgaard, the city attorney in Astoria, Ore.      Just before noon Friday, the multi-engine, propeller-driven plane struck two small homes near Tweed New Haven Airport. The aircraft's left wing lodged in one house and its right wing in the other.      The family learned it was Bill Henningsgaard's plane through the tail number, his brother said.      It wasn't his first crash. Three years ago, Henningsgaard crash-landed his plane on Washington's Columbia River, and he and his 84-year-old mother were rescued by a passing boat as the plane began to sink.      Henningsgaard was a member of Seattle-based Social Venture Partners, a foundation that helps build up communities. The foundation extended its condolences to his wife and two daughters.      \\"There are hundreds of people that have a story about Bill _ when he went the extra mile, when he knew just the right thing to say, how he would never give up. He was truly all-in for this community, heart, mind and soul,\\" the foundation wrote Friday in a post on its website.      Late Friday, officials from a number of agencies were still at the scene trying to determine how many people had been killed. Officials said the total was four to six. The victims of the crash have not been identified.      \\"We haven't recovered anybody at this point, and we presume there is going to be a very bad outcome,\\" East Haven fire Chief Douglas Jackson said Friday.      National Transportation Safety Board investigator Robert Gretz said at a news conference Friday night there were casualty reports of two or three people in the plane and two or three people in one of the homes, including two children, ages 1 and 13. He said the reports were unconfirmed and that local and state authorities were at the scene looking for victims.      Hours after the crash, Malloy said rescuers had spotted two bodies, including one of an adult, but hadn't recovered them. The plane's fuselage had entered one of the houses, and the recovery effort was focusing on the home's basement, he said.      Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. said later that the houses were still unstable and crews had not completed a full search.      The 10-seater plane, a Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B, flew out of Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and crashed at 11:25 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said.      Tweed's airport manager, Lori Hoffman-Soares, said the pilot had been in communication with air traffic control and hadn't issued any distress calls.      \\"All we know is that it missed the approach and continued on,\\" she said.      A neighbor, David Esposito, said he heard a loud noise and then a thump: \\"No engine noise, nothing.\\"      \\"A woman was screaming her kids were in there,\\" he said.      Esposito, a retired teacher, said he ran into the upstairs of the house, where the woman believed her children were, but couldn't find them after frantically searching a crib and closets. He returned downstairs to search some more, but he dragged the woman out when the flames became too strong.      In April 2009, Henningsgaard was flying a small plane from Astoria to Seattle when the engine quit and he tried to glide back to the airport. As he wrote 10 days later on a blog post, the plane crashed into the Columbia River after a harrowing five-minute descent. He and his mother, a former Astoria mayor, climbed out on a wing and were rescued.      He spent 14 years at Microsoft in various marketing and sales positions, according to his biography on Social Venture Partners website. He was a longtime board member at Youth Eastside Services, a Bellevue, Wash.-based agency that provides counseling and substance-abuse treatment, and led the organization's 10.7 million fundraising campaign for its new headquarters, which opened in 2008.      A vigil for the victims of the crash is planned for Saturday night at Margaret Tucker Park.      ___      Associated Press writers Steven DuBois in Portland, Ore., Gene Johnson in Seattle and Mike Melia in Hartford, Conn., contributed to this report. |||||","output":"A neighborhood near Tweed New Haven Airport is recovering from a plane crash that killed two girls in a home, the pilot, and his teenage son.

The premise tells us about the perception of Texans from the viewpoint of people from another state, whereas the hypothesis revolves around the self-perception of Texans themselves.  Therefore, even if the given premise is true, and people from Pennsylvania have some opinions about Texans, it would not directly provide insights into or entail the hypothesis, i.e., what kind of opinions Texans hold about themselves. To understand the latter, it would be necessary to carry out studies and research addressing the self-perception, values, and beliefs of individuals living in Texas.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Music history will not be rewritten. A jury found Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant and guitarist Jimmy Page not guilty of copyright infringement on perhaps their most famous song, \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"      A Los Angeles jury deliberated for about five hours before deciding the band did not steal its most famous licks from another band.      In a statement issued after the verdict was announced, Led Zeppelin said they were \\"grateful\\" that the jury \\"ruled in our favor, putting to rest questions about the origins of 'Stairway to Heaven' and confirming what we have known for 45 years.\\"      The case centered on claims that Led Zeppelin copied key note patterns in the first two minutes of their hit from a song by the 1960s psychedelic band, Spirit. That song, \\"Taurus,\\" is an instrumental ballad released four years prior to \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" The suit was filed for partial song writing credit and compensation by the estate of a deceased Spirit musician, Randy Craig Wolfe.      The plaintiff failed to show that Plant and Page were familiar with \\"Taurus,\\" and that the works were substantially similar.      The estate's attorney, Francis Malofiy, tried to introduce evidence that Page and Plant had seen Spirit in concert, owned a recording of \\"Taurus,\\" and testimony on the songs' musical similarities. Led Zeppelin's lawyer, Peter Anderson, brought Page and Plant to the stand to dispute their familiarity with \\"Taurus,\\" questioned the estate's copyright claim, and said the passage in question was a common descending chord sequence in the public domain.      Plant took the stand Tuesday and described in detail writing \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" with Page at a countryside retreat in Hampshire, England in 1971. He told the court Page was playing some music by a fire and he offered a couplet to go with it as a lyric. When asked by his attorney if he remembered what that lyric was, Plant recited what has become the well known opening line to the hit song, \\"There's a lady who knows all that glitters is gold and she's buying a stairway to heaven.\\"      Under cross-examination, Plant acknowledged that Led Zeppelin played a cover medley that included a different Spirit song in the band's early days, but he didn't recall seeing Spirit in concert, or ever meeting the group. \\"Don't remember now, and didn't remember then,\\" Plant told the court.      Related: 'Stairway to Heaven' suit: What you need to know      Last week, Page testified that he didn't remember hearing Spirit perform live. He said he first heard \\"Taurus\\" on the internet two years ago, despite owning an album with the song among his more than 4,000 records. \\"Something like that would stick in my mind. It was totally alien to me,\\" Page said.      When Page returned to the stand on Tuesday, like Plant he described their songwriting process on \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" to flatten the claim some of it had been lifted.      Copyright cases have resulted in increasing scrutiny -- and damages -- within the music industry.      Condé Nast Portfolio estimated in 2008 that \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" had earned more than 562 million in publishing royalties and record sales since it released.      Last year, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay the estate of singer Marvin Gaye 7.4 million after a jury found their song \\"Blurred Lines\\" had taken riffs from Gaye's classic \\"Got to Give It Up.\\"      CNN's Stephanie Elam and Topher Gauk Roger contributed to this report ||||| Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin cleared of stealing riff for Stairway to Heaven Los Angeles jury finds Robert Plant and Jimmy Page did not steal the most famous passage from the 1971 anthem from the band Spirit Led Zeppelin win copyright case over intro to Stairway to Heaven – video      Led Zeppelin has defeated a lawsuit that accused the band of stealing the opening riff in Stairway to Heaven, and cemented its place in rock’s pantheon.      A jury in Los Angeles on Thursday cleared Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of pinching arguably the most famous riff of the most famous anthem in rock.      The singer and guitarist were in the US district court for the climax of a six-day trial that gripped the music industry and put the band’s history and credibility under a forensic microscope.      Plant, 67, and Page, 72, denied lifting Stairway to Heaven’s opening passage, which evokes Renaissance folk music, from an LA-based psychedelic band called Spirit.      The estate of Spirit’s guitarist Randy Wolfe, also known as Randy California, had sued for recognition and a share of the proceeds on the grounds the 1971 mega-hit ripped off Taurus, an instrumental composed in 1967.            Wearing sharp suits with their hair pulled back in ponytails, Plant and Page left court without speaking publicly, but issued a brief statement later that said they were grateful to the jury and look forward to putting the matter behind them.            Francis Malofiy, the estate’s attorney, said he was sad and disappointed by the jury’s decision.            “The reality is that we proved access, but they could never hear what they had access to,” Malofiy said. “It’s bizarre.”      “This case is about one thing, one six-letter word – credit,” Malofiy had told the jury of four men and four women during the trial. He likened the case to a David and Goliath battle.      Peter Anderson, Led Zeppelin’s attorney, said the case was really an attempt to rewrite history – “to take an iconic song … and [say] it’s got a new parent”.      Yes, Led Zeppelin took from other people's records – but then they transformed them Read more      The trial wrapped on Wednesday and the jury retired to deliberate. When it returned to courtroom 850, a marble and wood-paneled arena in the Edward Roybal federal building, Goliath prevailed.      The verdict spared Led Zeppelin the humiliation and type of financial loss which befell Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams in a separate plagiarism case last year when Marvin Gaye’s family won a 7.4m award for the song Blurred Lines infringing on Gaye’s Got to Give it Up.      The music industry, still reeling from the Blurred Lines verdict, will be relieved, said Larry Iser, a lawyer and copyright specialist who was not involved in either case. “Today’s verdict is a vindication of copyright, which only protects an original expression of music.” Led Zeppelin showed that the disputed chord progression was a common building block of classical and popular music dating back centuries, he said.      Journalists and Led Zeppelin fans packed the public gallery for a trial which veered from surreal to nostalgic to belligerent as Plant, Page and other witnesses testified about what did and did not happen between 1967 and 1971.      This was a bacchanalian rock’n’roll era famed for sex and drugs but Judge Gary Klausner, a stern presence, kept testimony focused on money, memory and music. The case hinged on two questions. Did Led Zeppelin hear Taurus before composing Stairway? And is Stairway substantially similar to the Taurus sheet music submitted in 1968 to the US copyright office?      Wolfe, a guitar prodigy who wrote the instrumental for his girlfriend, drowned in 1997 saving his son in Hawaii. Shortly before his death, in a magazine interview quoted in the lawsuit, he made his resentment plain. “If you listen to the two songs, you can make your own judgment … I’d say it was a rip-off. And the guys made millions of bucks on it and never said ‘Thank you,’ never said, ‘Can we pay you some money for it?’ It’s kind of a sore point with me.”      The lawsuit alleged Led Zeppelin had a deep-rooted history of lifting composition from uncreditd blues artists and other songwriters. It cited disputes over 16 other Led Zeppelin songs, including Whole Lotta Love and Babe I’m Gonna Leave You.      Stairway to Heaven, one of the most played songs on radio, is estimated to have generated more than 500m over the decades. Damages, however, can extend back only three years and into the future.      In defending themselves Plant and Page, chipped their own mythology about Stairway being composed at Bron-Yr-Aur, a remote Welsh cottage.      Page said he in fact wrote the music at Headley Grange, a recording studio in Hampshire. Plant said he had been toying with a lyrical couplet inspired by Welsh lore and scenery and realised it could combine with Page’s notes.      “Do you remember what that couplet was?” asked Anderson.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest A courtroom sketch of Plant (left) and Page. Photograph: Reuters      Into a hushed courtroom Plant, half-speaking, half-singing, responded: “There’s a lady who’s sure all that glitters is gold, and she’s buying a stairway to heaven.”      The singer dismissed any influence from Taurus. “I didn’t remember it then, and I don’t remember it now.”      Led Zeppelin’s bass player and keyboardist, John Paul Jones, testified in the band’s defence but was not a defendant.      Malofiy, a hard-charging lawyer with a bruising reputation, sought to pierce any reverence for the British rockers by calling them session musicians who played other people’s music, including that of Spirit, with whom they shared concert billing in the late 1960s.      Page admitted Led Zeppelin used to play one Spirit song, Fresh Garbage, because back in the day the band would “chip a wink to what’s hot”.      But he insisted he had not heard Taurus, part of Spirit’s debut album, even though it was in his collection of 4,329 LPs and 5,882 CDs. He heard it only after his son-in-law told him about internet chatter making comparisons with Stairway, he said. “I don’t do the internet, so he played it for me. When I heard the orchestral part at the beginning, I knew I’d never heard it before.”      A witness for Wolfe’s estate testified about seeing Plant attend a Spirit gig and socialise with the US group at Mother’s, a Birmingham club, during its visit to England 1970. The singer shrugged that off. “I really don’t recall any of the bands I saw there or everyone I ever hung out with.”      Malofiy accused Plant and Page of having selective memory. Unable to play recordings of Taurus to the jury, the attorney summoned musicologists who said the instrumental’s copyrighted sheet music shared with Stairway a descending A-minor chord progression, notes of the same duration, arpeggios and similar pairs of notes.      The courtroom crackled when the attorney asked Page to analyse Taurus. “You want to step through it?”      “Not necessarily,” Page replied.      Page carried a guitar into court but was not asked to play. He did, however, mime air guitar and a dance move.      Musicologists summoned for the defence said the descending chromatic minor line progression shared by both songs had been a common musical device for centuries. One example cited was Chim Chim Cher-ee, from the 1964 Disney musical Mary Poppins.      Anderson said Wolfe’s estate was overreaching. “He didn’t create the key of A-minor.”      The lawyer urged the jury to not let Michael Skidmore, trustee of the late musician’s estate, usurp history. “Randy California is entitled for credit for what he did, but not what he didn’t do. [The plaintiffs] are asking you to take this iconic song, ‘Stairway to Heaven,’ and say it has a new parent in Mr Skidmore.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Rock band Led Zeppelin has won their lawsuit which accused them of stealing the opening riff in \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" from US psychedelic band Spirit.

Is there any quick method to loose belly fat?","output":"While these two questions are similar and related, they do not have the exact same meaning. Both questions focus on finding fast solutions for reducing belly fat. However, the emphasis and scope of the inquiry are slightly different between the two. The first question, \\"What are the quick ways for controlling belly fat?\\" is asking for a list of fast methods or practices that can aid in managing or reducing belly fat. This question is broad and open-ended, and it calls for multiple solutions that can help control and maintain belly fat levels effectively. The focus here is on managing and controlling, which may include prevention, reduction, as well as maintenance of healthy belly fat levels. The second question, \\"Is there any quick method to lose belly fat?\\" is more specific in its focus. It's asking if there is one (or potentially several) fast approach that can be employed to shed belly fat quickly. The emphasis here is on losing or reducing existing belly fat, instead of controlling or managing it as in the first question. To provide a detailed answer addressing both questions, here are some quick and effective approaches for controlling and losing belly fat: 1. Improve your diet: Making healthier food choices is a crucial step to controlling belly fat. Cut down on processed foods, added sugars, and unhealthy fats. Instead, opt for lean protein, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. 2. Incorporate exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity can help you lose and control belly fat. Combine cardiovascular exercise, like jogging, walking, swimming, or cycling, with strength training for a well-rounded workout regime. 3. Try High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): HIIT can be an effective and quick approach to reducing belly fat. It is characterized by alternating periods of intense exercise followed by short recovery periods. 4. Focus on abdominal exercises: Include exercises like planks, crunches, and leg raises to specifically target the abdominal area and strengthen the core muscles. This can help in both reducing belly fat and preventing excess fat accumulation. 5. Get enough sleep and reduce stress: Poor sleep and high stress levels may contribute to increased abdominal fat. Aim for at least 7 hours of sleep per night and practice stress-reduction techniques such as yoga, meditation, or mindfulness. 6. Limit alcohol consumption: Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol has been linked to an increased risk of belly fat, so reducing your intake can be an essential step in controlling belly fat. 7. Be consistent: While there may not be a specific single quick method to lose belly fat, staying consistent with healthy habits, exercising regularly, and making better food choices will speed up the process and generate long-term, sustainable results. We may see short-term effects with quick fixes, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle is the most effective approach for controlling and losing belly fat over time."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 16:57 EST, 31 July 2012 | UPDATED: 14:49 EST, 1 August 2012 Mitt Romney's international trip has won more critics as China and Iran both lashed out against the Republican presidential candidate for his remarks about Israel. Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday that Romney risked 'reigniting war' between the Israelis and Palestinians by promising to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the disputed holy city of Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the trip to the Jewish state amounted to 'kissing the foot' of Israel. Scroll down for video Criticism: Mitt Romney called Jerusalem the capital of","output":"Israel, angering both China and Iran, leading to an increase in diplomatic tensions. During his visit to Israel, Romney further fueled the controversy by stating that Jerusalem is the true capital of Israel, despite the fact that the international community, including the United States, does not recognize it as such. This declaration served to deepen international conflicts and tensions, with many questioning Romney's diplomatic abilities. In response to the Chinese outrage, the Romney campaign attempted to defend their stance by arguing that the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is long overdue, and that they firmly believe that a strong relationship with Israel is vital for maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East. However, this did not quell the mounting criticism, as China emphasized its concern that such a move would only serve to destabilize the region further and could seriously hinder any progress towards a two-state solution. As for Iran, President Ahmadinejad's comment that Romney's trip amounted to \\"kissing the foot\\" of Israel was meant to emphasize Iran's opposition to what they perceived as an unjust favoritism towards Israel. Iran, a long-standing enemy of Israel, saw Romney's actions as a direct provocation and a sign that, if elected, he would inevitably side with Israel in any ongoing or future disputes. In the face of these mounting criticisms, the Romney campaign was forced to address the broader implications of their visit to Israel and their staunch support for the country. In doing so, they attempted to appease opponents by stating that the ultimate goal of their Middle East policy would be to secure lasting peace in the region through dialogue and diplomatic negotiations with all relevant parties. However, the mixed reactions to Romney's visit to Israel and the ensuing diplomatic fallout only served to highlight the complex nature of international relations and the delicate balance that must be struck in order to promote peace, stability, and understanding. It also raised questions about whether Romney, as a potential future president, had the ability and the foresight to navigate these complexities and establish a foreign policy that would be both fair and effective. Ultimately, the tumultuous outcome of Mitt Romney's international trip served to underscore the significance of diplomacy and the importance of approaching sensitive issues with tact and discernment. The consequences of his remarks about Israel, and the subsequent backlash from China and Iran, served as a reminder of just how critical it is for world leaders to carefully consider the potential impact of their words and actions on the global stage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Write a text based on this summary: ovechkin s teammate semin scores more talks less Text:","output":"Title: Semin: The Quiet Goal Machine Standing Beside Ovechkin In the shadows of the ever-popular Alexander Ovechkin, Washington Capitals forward Alexander Semin has consistently proven himself as one of the top players in the National Hockey League (NHL). Semin, a Russian speedster and sniper, has been delivering incredible performances, registering impressive scores, and yet has managed to keep a low profile when compared to his teammate Ovechkin. While fans continue to celebrate number eight's flashy plays and exuberant personality, Semin's quiet demeanor and commitment to the team have solidified his position as a potent force on the ice. Both being Russian players drafted in 2002, Ovechkin (first overall) and Semin (13th overall) have inevitably drawn comparisons throughout their careers. Moreover, as leaders of the Capitals' offense for the past decade, the dynamic duo has left opposing teams scrambling to find ways to neutralize their lethal combination of speed and power. Despite their undeniable chemistry and proven results, Semin's contributions often remain overshadowed by the spotlight that follows Ovechkin. Certainly, Ovechkin's larger-than-life presence cannot be ignored, catching the attention of those within and outside the hockey world with his affable persona, tenacious play, and fearless leadership. Yet, Semin, preferring to let his actions speak louder than words, emerges as a player who is often underestimated and overlooked. The quiet and enigmatic forward operates with a level of precision and efficiency, enabling him to score more goals and contribute positively to the team's overall performance. While he may not dominate the headlines or receive the level of recognition reserved for superstars like Ovechkin, Semin remains a highly valued and respected member of the Capitals' roster. Throughout his career, Semin has demonstrated an uncanny ability to find the back of the net, scoring goals at critical moments and helping propel the team to victory. Armed with an impressive skillset, including a powerful and accurate wrist shot, as well as stickhandling and puck control that rival the best in the league, Semin has become a reliable and essential component of the Capitals' offensive machine. Though he often operates as a silent assassin, his effect on the game cannot be understated, as his mere presence on the ice creates opportunities and challenges for the opposition. Despite his reserved nature, this does not imply that Semin is any less passionate about the game or less dedicated to the Capitals' success. Although he may not be the most vocal or visible leader on the ice, his teammates recognize and appreciate his unwavering commitment to the team ethos. In fact, his quiet approach could be regarded as a major asset to the squad. As Ovechkin garners media attention and diverts opponents' focus, Semin tirelessly continues to carry out his role and contributes to the team's objectives. In conclusion, while Alexander Ovechkin may be considered the face of the Washington Capitals, it would be a disservice to underestimate the critical role played by his fellow Russian teammate, Alexander Semin. Quietly working behind the scenes, Semin scores more and talks less, becoming the quintessential silent achiever. Unwavering in his commitment to the team, his humble approach and undeniable skills have earned him the admiration of both his peers and fervent hockey fans alike. As the Capitals continue to strive for glory, the synergy between Ovechkin's charisma and Semin's quiet consistency will undoubtedly remain a crucial aspect of the team's ongoing success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Health officials continued on Monday to investigate the causes behind the mysterious deaths of 64 children in Cambodia after saying they had made an important discovery over the weekend. The Institut Pasteur in Cambodia tested samples taken from 24 patients and found 15 had tested positive for Enterovirus Type 71 -- a common cause of hand, foot and mouth disease that can also cause severe neurological complications, mainly in children. \\"These results now give a good explanation to this outbreak,\\" Dr. Philippe Buchy, head of the institute's virology unit, said in an e-mail over the weekend. \\"We will get more results hopefully by next Tuesday or Wednesday.\\" The World Health Organization also noted that a \\"significant proportion of the samples\\" had tested positive for EV71, but it cautioned that the outbreak had not been fully solved, and more analysis was needed. Outbreaks of the enterovirus \\"occur periodically in the Asia-Pacific region,\\" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Brunei had its first major outbreak in 2006. China had an outbreak in 2008. Though the detection of EV71 in Cambodia is significant, there may be other factors, said Dr. Beat Richner of Kantha Bopha hospitals. Over the past three months, 66 children -- between 2 and 3 years old -- were admitted to Kantha Bopha facilities. All but two died mysteriously after suffering severe neurological and respiratory complications, Richner said. In their last hours of their life, the children experienced a \\"total destruction of the alveola(e) in the lungs,\\" Richner said. The patients also suffered from encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain, he said. \\"We have now to see what really is causing the deadly pulmonary complication and see if a toxic factor is playing a role too,\\" he said. Investigators probe mystery disease killing Cambodian children. The positive test for EV71 does not particularly help in the treatment of the illness, as there is no effective antiviral treatment for severe EV71 infections, and no vaccine is available. The way the syndrome is attacking the children is \\"merciless,\\" Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said from Cambodia. Gupta noted, though, that the disease did not appear to be \\"clustering,\\" or spreading rapidly in particular geographic areas, reducing fears of a possible epidemic. In milder cases, EV71 can cause coldlike symptoms, diarrhea and sores on the hands, feet and mouth, according to the journal Genetic Vaccines and Therapy. But more severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain, resulting in polio-like paralysis and death. Adults' well-developed immune systems usually can fend off the virus, but children are vulnerable to it, according to the CDC. On Sunday, a World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Cambodia warned the new discovery \\"does not mean we have solved the problem of the undiagnosed cases. A lot more analysis is needed, and further laboratory investigations need to be done.\\" The WHO said that other pathogens had been detected in the investigations, including dengue and Streptococcus suis. It added that samples tested negative for H5N1 and other influenza viruses. Tensions have arisen between the WHO and Kantha Bopha hospitals about the dissemination of information about the outbreak. The international organization has provided a lower death toll than the hospitals, saying Sunday that 52 out of a total number of 59 children affected by the mysterious syndrome had died between April and early July. In his statement Sunday, the hospital official Richner criticized the WHO for previously making statements to the news media \\"without being clear on the facts.\\" \\"WHO was telling whole the world: New mystery killer disease in Cambodia! This was causing unnecessary panic in Cambodia,\\" Richter said. Richner has said the number of cases affected by the mysterious disease is relatively low -- 34 cases in June, compared with the 75,000 sick children at Kantha Bopha's outpatient clinics and 16,000 hospitalized kids. But Pieter van Maaren with the WHO in Cambodia rejected suggestions that his organization caused any kind of panic. He said Richner was the one who stated, in a letter to the government, that the situation in Cambodia was \\"most severe.\\" \\"WHO has not made any statement about the disease, other than what we issued in the joint press release with the Ministry of Health,\\" van Maaren said. The ministry reported the outbreak to WHO through the International Health Regulations, which 194 nations are parties to, van Maaren said. \\"Since this event fitted the criteria of being an event where the underlying agent, disease or mode of transmission is not identified at the time, WHO is obliged to communicate information to other member states,\\" he said. EV71 was first isolated in California in 1969, according to the CDC. Mystery illnesses: A mother's painful quest for answers. CNN's Tim Schwarz, Sara Sidner, Madison Park, Jethro Mullen and Josh Levs contributed to this report.

Article: In the US, the most popular way to welcome the new year is with a big party. Some parties are at private homes. But in recent years, it has become more and more common for Americans to go to a hotel or eating-place on the night of December 31st. There, they can eat a big dinner, drink champagne, and dance to orchestra music. Most New Year's parties are usually noisy. People shout and sing. And often, guests blow on small noisemakers when the new year arrives at midnight. This tradition of noise making is believed to start centuries ago. People thought that loud sounds would drive away the bad spirits of the old year. The biggest, noisiest New Year's party in the US takes place in Times Square in New York. Thousands of people gather  there. Some of them ring bells and set fireworks. Others blow whistles of car horns . And at twelve o'clock, they begin to cheer as an electric sign in the shape of a red apple lights up on top of a tall building. The Times Square celebration includes another well-known American tradition. Since 1929, the band of musician Guy Lombardo has given a concert on New Year's Eve. Guy Lombardo died in 1977. But, Bill Lombardo, has kept the tradition alive with a band concert at a New York city hotel. When the crowds in Times Square start cheering the arrival of the new year, television cameras show the band playing the song Auld Lang Syne.

This happened a long, long time ago - way back in 1864. Imagine that! The ship, called a paddle steamer (which is a type of boat that uses wheels with paddles to move in the water), sank beneath the sea, and now, with the help of Google--you know, the search engine we use to find things on the internet--we can see and explore this hidden chapter of the underwater world. How did Google do this, you ask? Well, they used special images or photographs from something known as the Catlin Seaview Survey. Think of it this way - you know when you're playing with your toy boat in the bathtub and it gets turned upside down? What if we could take pictures of your toy boat under the water? That's what the Catlin Seaview Survey does, but instead of your toy boat, they take pictures of real sunken ships like the Mary Celeste. The wreckage of Mary Celeste is very popular among divers. Now, diving is a bit like swimming but it's deeper into the sea. These divers like to visit this ship near to the shores of a beautiful island called Bermuda. It lies around 55 feet under the waves of the sea. You know the height of your dad? Imagine him standing on one another about 10 times. That's how deep it is! Isn't it marvelous to see how technology like Google can recreate the lost world and share it with everyone? We can learn about our history, about the great Mary Celeste, without leaving the comfort of our home! It's like having a magical underwater journey all by yourself.

Throwing a rock is a physical action often borne out of frustration or anger. However, it does not address the root cause of these emotions or lead to a resolution of the underlying problem.  Once the immediate emotional response subsides, Riley may recognize this. She might feel empty, unsatisfied, regretful, or even escalated frustration because her action did not deliver the wanted outcome, which is typically resolution or change. She may also feel anxious or fearful about potential consequences, such as retaliation or punishment for her actions. It's also worth noting that everyone reacts and handles anger or conflicts differently. Some people might feel catharsis after such an act, while others would feel regret immediately.

Does the word \\"point\\" mean the same thing in \\"It's rude to point at other people.\\" and \\"The dancers toes pointed outward.\\"?","output":"While the word \\"point\\" is used in both sentences, it carries distinct meanings and functions in each context. It must be noted that \\"point\\" possesses various definitions in the English language, ranging from providing direction to emphasizing a topic. Analyzing the given sentences will help elucidate the differences between its uses. In the sentence, \\"It's rude to point at other people,\\" the word \\"point\\" refers to the action of directing one's finger toward someone or something, typically with the intention of drawing attention to it. That said, this usage is considered impolite and disrespectful, particularly when aimed at a person. When using \\"point\\" in this manner, it functions as a verb, encapsulating the physical action of extending an index finger to single out a particular individual or object. On the other hand, \\"The dancers' toes pointed outward\\" employs \\"point\\" to describe the position or alignment of a body part. By stating that the toes are \\"pointed outward,\\" the sentence aims to convey that the dancers are angling their feet away from each other, achieving a specific pose or form for their performance. Consequently, \\"point\\" represents the state of being directed toward a particular orientation, especially in terms of physical position. In summation, the word \\"point\\" conveys different meanings in the given sentences: in the first, it refers to the discourteous action of aiming one's finger at another, while the second illustrates the alignment of a dancer's toes.

In conclusion, \\"Sharknado\\" delivers a whirlwind of thrills and chills by blending a unique premise, charismatic cast, and fast-paced storytelling.

Finding Joe an irresistable target for his sarcastic on-air wit, a Howard Stern-like deejay named Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller), puts Joe on the air to tell his story. For three days Zander and a growing legion of listeners are surprised to find themselves captivated, delighted, and occasionally repelled by Joe's incredible tale of his search to find the parents who referred to him as \\"Joe Dirt\\" (rather than by his real last name, which he can no longer remember) and left him sitting in a garbage can at the Grand Canyon when he was 8 years old.

Joe feels that Brandy and his dog, Charlie, were the only real friends he ever had. After living in and leaving a series of bizarre foster homes, Joe met Brandy one winter when he was living in the woods outside Silvertown and Charlie's testicles became frozen to the front porch of Brandy's house.

An angry cat will have dilated pupils and stare at whatever it's angry at. The fur on it’s body will usually also stand on end. The tail may also flick from side to side as it holds it in an upside down U.  In addition, an angry or scared cat may have its ears flattened back. In contrast, a friendly cat will approach you with its tail up, erect ears, and rub against your legs. It may give a friendly meow or series of meows and may even be purring. Cats are affectionate and responsive creatures. To get your attention, cats will often sit close to you or brush up against your legs while meowing. This solicitation for attention is normal cat behavior. It places the cat’s scent on the recipient, helps them bond with you, and probably, although we can’t know for certain, has other significant meanings.  When a cat rubs up on a human it’s an important bonding ritual. If your cat is rubbing up against you, don't shoo it away. Let it give you a little love and attention so that This action, rubbing up against another animal to transfer scents and affection, is called allorubbing when done with another cat. This is one particular behavior that leaves some owners scratching their heads. Some cats will “paddle” or “knead” their humans. This behavior is a holdover from when the cat was a kitten. Kittens knead their mother’s mammary glands as they are nursing to get the milk flowing.  It is thought to be comforting for a cat to do so on a beloved human being. Kneading can get aggressive if your cat engages its claws while doing it. Be sure to protect yourself if you know that your cat goes overboard when kneading.

It's not often that the wine makers of Champagne are left feeling a little bit flat. But vineyards across the north of England are toasting extraordinary success - as climate change makes the region ideal for wine-making. Just over 25 years ago, Renishaw Hall, near Sheffield, was the most northern vineyard in the world. Toasting success: Kieron Atkinson, who runs the English Wine Project, at Renishaw Hall which is planning to double output to 6,000 bottles per year. Yet as they celebrate their 40th anniversary this year they are planning to double the number of white wines they produce from 3,000 to up to 6,000 per year. Vineyards across the north of England have seen demand soar as the quality of their grapes improves - and they are giving their more illustrious French rivals a run for their money in the sparkling wine stakes. As temperatures increase because of climate change, grapes become more acidic. But unlike in Champagne, northern France, it is not too hot in northern England. Improved trellis systems and management techniques have also helped British manufacturers close the gap on their continental rivals. Chateau Doncaster: The town in northern England has become the unlikely home of sparkling white wines rivaling those from Champagne. Even in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, vineyards have been able to produce wine with 12 per cent natural alcohol. The Summerhouse vineyard on the outskirts of the northern town started production in 2005 and has rapidly seen its output increase. But despite their growing success, their are still only a small number of northern vineyards spread across Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire. Across England, winemakers have seen demand soar in recent years - although until now it has largely been manufacturers in the south getting all the accolades. Last year, two English rosés, produced just a few miles from the M25 in Surrey and Kent, scooped top international awards at the wine world's 'Oscars', proving the nation does not need Mediterranean heat to turn out a top tipple. Toasting success: The head gardener works on the vines at Renishaw Hall, Derbyshire. Kent-based Chapel Down, the winemaker which provided white wine for Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton, picked up a gold medal for its sparkling Vintage Rosé Brut at the International Wine Challenge, the world's biggest and most important wine competition. And just a few miles down the road, Denbies Chalk Ridge Rose 2010, produced on the hillsides of Dorking, Surrey, beat off stiff competition from more than 360 producers from 21 countries across the globe to win the still rosé gold medal prize. Kieron Atkinson, who runs the English Wine Project, told The Times that northern winemakers are giving Champagne a run for their money. 'We are cooler than Champagne, which means we have nicer levels of acid in our grapes. That makes for a better sparkling wine,' he said. 'We are still relatively young at doing this in comparison with the Champagne region but our techniques are catching up, hence our ability to get better and better wine every year.' He added: 'I guess the alarm bells for the Champagne region are ringing because the summers are so much hotter.' Running scared?

We have 14776*b - 13895*b = 26430. Now, let's think about what we're doing when we multiply. If we have b apples and a number tells us how many more or fewer apples to add or remove, we'll get a new number of apples. Imagine we have 14776 toy trucks, and we want to add some more toy trucks (*b). Then, we have 13895 toy trucks, and we want to remove some of those trucks (*b). We want to know what the number (b) should be if the difference between these two actions results in 26430 toy trucks. To find b, here's what we can do: Step 1: Look at the equation 14776*b - 13895*b = 26430. Step 2: Let's rearrange 14776*b and 13895*b. Think of it like this: instead of adding some toy trucks (*b) to 14776 and removing some toy trucks (*b) from 13895, we can think about the difference between these two numbers first, then multiply it by b. So, we can rewrite the equation like this: (14776 - 13895) * b = 26430 Step 3: Now, let's find the difference: 14776 - 13895 = 881 So the equation becomes: 881 * b = 26430 Step 4: To find b, we need to figure out how many times 881 can fit into 26430. In other words, we need to divide 26430 by 881: 26430 ÷ 881 = 30 So, the answer is b = 30. In simple words, if we add 30 toy trucks to 14776 and remove 30 toy trucks from 13895, the difference between these two actions will be 26430 toy trucks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Labour's Andy Burnham says he is considering standing to be mayor of Greater Manchester when the position is created in 2017.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Andy Burnham Considers Run for the Position of Greater Manchester Mayor in 2017 Introduction: As the political landscape in the UK continues to evolve, a new opportunity has presented itself for Labour MP Andy Burnham. The veteran politician has announced that he is entertaining the possibility of running for the mayoral office in Greater Manchester when the position is inaugurated in 2017. This move has piqued the interest of political spectators, Labour party supporters, and the general public as it marks a potential shift in Burnham's political career and sheds light on the unfolding dynamics of the UK's political climate. Andy Burnham's Background: Andy Burnham has had an extensive political career, serving as the MP for Leigh since 2001. He has held various positions within the Labour Party, such as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Secretary of State for Health, and most recently, the Shadow Home Secretary. Widely respected for his dedication to public service, Burnham ran for Labour leader in the 2015 leadership election, only to lose to Jeremy Corbyn. Despite the loss, Burnham has remained a key figure within the party, often standing as a voice for the working-class and advocating for social justice. The Mayor of Greater Manchester Position: In 2014, the UK government announced plans to create a series of devolved elected mayoral positions throughout England. This decision came after widespread debates on how to address the growing inequality between London and other regions within the UK. The aim was to empower local governments and implement significant political reform, allowing regions to better manage their finances, infrastructure, and public services. Greater Manchester was chosen as one of the pilot areas and is set to elect its first mayor in May 2017. The successful candidate will have control over a budget of £1 billion and responsibilities that include housing, transport, and policing within the region. The emergence of the mayoral position has attracted diverse political personalities. Burnham's Potential Candidacy: Andy Burnham's decision to consider a run for the mayoral office could significantly impact the political landscape in Greater Manchester. His experience in national politics and deep understanding of the local communities make him a strong contender. Burnham has expressed that he would like to use the opportunity to return power to the people and reduce economic inequality. Burnham has voiced his concerns about the devolution plans, saying they offer an “illusion of power” and risk provoking a “Whitehall power grab.” However, his potential candidacy represents an opportunity to reshape the plans to better serve Greater Manchester's citizens. Furthermore, his presence in the mayoral race could lead the Labour party to bolster its support and determination to ensure the new mayoral position delivers real change to the area. Implications of Burnham's Potential Run: Should Burnham be successful in his bid for the mayoral office, he would ultimately have to resign from his position as MP and Shadow Home Secretary, prompting changes within the Labour party. His departure from national politics could spark debates as to whether his focus on local politics signals a loss of faith in the central party or if it's simply a strategic move to strengthen Labour's presence in the UK's changing political structure. Conclusion: As the creation of the Greater Manchester mayoral office approaches, Andy Burnham's consideration of a mayoral run marks an exciting development in UK politics. His potential candidacy may have significant implications not only for the region but also for the Labour Party and the future of devolution in the UK. As observers watch Burnham make his final decision, the nation takes a step into a future with greater regional autonomy and evolving political dynamics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Owen was born in Chester, Cheshire, the fourth child of Jeanette and Terry Owen. His father is a former professional footballer and played for clubs such as Chester City and Everton. Owen was introduced to football at the age of seven by his father who soon saw Michael as the most promising athlete in the family. A boyhood Everton fan, Owen attended Rector Drew Primary School in Hawarden, Flintshire, north Wales and by the age of ten, some of the nation's leading scouts were monitoring his progress. On 3 July 2009, it was announced that Owen had signed a two-year deal with reigning Premier League champions Manchester United. He said that the approach from manager Alex Ferguson came from \\"out of the blue\\". He signed a pay-as-you-play deal and was handed the number 7 shirt vacated by the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid. The shirt had previously been worn by many of United's other illustrious players over the years, including Johnny Berry, George Best, Steve Coppell, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.  Owen scored his first goal for United on his debut, scoring an 84th-minute winner after coming on as a substitute in a pre-season friendly against a Malaysian XI; he followed this up by scoring three more goals in United's pre-season games. Owen made his league debut for United when he came on as a substitute against Birmingham City on 16 August in a 1-0 win, and scored his first competitive goal in a Manchester United shirt against Wigan Athletic on 22 August in a 5-0 away win. On 20 September, Owen scored his first goal at Old Trafford as he netted in the sixth minute of stoppage time against local rivals Manchester City to give United a 4-3 derby win. This meant that Owen had now scored in his fourth derby, after netting in the Merseyside derby, El Clasico and the Tyne-Wear derby in previous years. Owen struggled to recall the moments immediately after the goal, and said that it ranked as one of his most important.  On 27 October, Owen notched a goal in the 2-0 away win against Barnsley to qualify United past the fourth round of the League Cup. On 3 November, Owen scored his first Champions League goal for Manchester United, as he grabbed United's first in the 3-3 draw against CSKA Moscow. Owen's seemingly slim chances of earning a place in Fabio Capello's England squad for the 2010 World Cup finals in 2010 received a boost when on 8 December 2009, Owen scored his first hat-trick for Manchester United in a 3-1 away win against VfL Wolfsburg in the Champions League, his first hat-trick since 2005. On 28 February 2010, Owen scored United's first goal in their 2-1 victory over Aston Villa in the 2010 League Cup final, but had to be substituted after pulling up on 42 minutes. Originally thought to be a minor injury, on 5 March it was announced Owen required surgery on his hamstring, ruling him out for the rest of the season.

Write an article based on this summary: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Paris to commemorate the victims of a mass arrest of Jews in Nazi-occupied France in 1942.","output":"Title: Israeli PM Netanyahu Commemorates Nazi-Era Victims in Paris Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was recently in Paris, France, to commemorate the victims of an infamous mass arrest of Jewish individuals in Nazi-occupied France, which took place in 1942.  Netanyahu, renowned for his efforts to safeguard the memory of the Holocaust, made this dedicated visit to Paris, thereby, once again, emboldening a stand against historical acts of inhumanity. The step here is to acknowledge that Netanyahu's visit is a continuous part of his commitment as the Prime Minister of Israel to uphold the memories of holocaust while fostering relationships with countries in Europe. The mass arrest, known as the 'Vel d'Hiv Roundup,' is regarded as one of the most horrific episodes of Jewish persecution in France during the Second World War. On July 16 and 17, 1942, over 13,000 Jews were detained by French police collaborating with the Nazis. The detainees, which included thousands of children, were confined under the direst conditions in the Velodrome d'Hiver, a winter cycling track in Paris before being transported to Auschwitz. This information provides context regarding the historical event that prompted Netanyahu’s visit. Through his visit, Netanyahu aims to immortalize the memories of these innocent lives tragically cut short. His visit is a symbolic gesture, signaling the enduring commitment of Israel and its allies to ensure that such atrocities are never repeated. This sentence epitomizes the symbolic and diplomatic function of Netanyahu's visit. Despite seven and a half decades after the event, the 'Vel d'Hiv Roundup' continues to be a raw wound for Jewish communities worldwide. Netanyahu's Paris visit brings this historical outrage back into sharp focus, urging the global community to remember and learn from our past. Here, we mention the current effect of this historical event on the global Jewish community and discuss the role of Netanyahu's visit in maintaining awareness of past atrocities. Netanyahu's visit to Paris also serves to reinforce ties between France and Israel. It is an important diplomatic step asserting Israel's pursuit for worldwide recognition not just of the horrors of the Holocaust but of the continued need for vigilance against anti-Semitism. This sentence connects Netanyahu's memory preservation mission to a more comprehensive diplomatic effort aimed at reinforcing international relationships. In conclusion, Netanyahu's visit to Paris as a commemorative endeavor reminds us of the unutterable atrocities of the Second World War, particularly the mass arrest and extermination of Jews in the 'Vel d'Hiv Roundup. ' It is also an adamant call for the world to remain vigilant and hold a united front against anti-Semitism and all forms of hatred and bigotry. The conclusion is necessary to summarize the main points of the article. Overall, the process of writing this article involved breaking down the given summary into several key points and elucidating each one by one. The focus remained to provide a background while dwelling on the implications and motivations behind Netanyahu's Paris visit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What do people eat with that is made from wood?\\"  Context: \\"Wood has always been used extensively for furniture, such as chairs and beds. It is also used for tool handles and cutlery, such as chopsticks, toothpicks, and other utensils, like the wooden spoon.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"People have been utilizing wood for various purposes since ancient times, due to its widespread availability and versatility. Among these uses, wooden materials have been employed in crafting various cutlery and utensils that are widely used in different cultures for eating and culinary purposes. In the given context, some of the most common wooden eating implements are: 1. Chopsticks: Chopsticks are a pair of slender sticks made from wood, bamboo, or other materials, used in Asian countries as an eating utensil. These cultural staples have been used for thousands of years, mostly in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. People hold chopsticks in one hand, typically the dominant one, and use them to pick up small pieces of food from their plates, bowls, or from shared dishes. 2. Wooden spoons: These age-old utensils are found in various kitchens across the globe. Made from hardwoods such as maple, olive, or walnut, wooden spoons serve multiple purposes, ranging from stirring and mixing ingredients to serving food. The gentle touch of a wooden spoon makes it ideal for use with non-stick or delicate cookware, preventing damage to surfaces. Wooden spoons are often carved from a single piece of wood, offering the advantage of not hosting bacteria in crevices or seams. 3. Toothpicks: Wooden toothpicks, made from small slivers of wood or bamboo, have been in use for centuries. They are often used to remove small pieces of food stuck between teeth after a meal. Toothpicks can also be utilized for serving small appetizers or finger foods, providing a convenient and disposable method of handling food without getting hands messy. 4. Skewers: Skewers are long, thin wooden or metal sticks used to pierce and hold together pieces of food for grilling, roasting, or barbecuing. Wooden skewers, typically made from bamboo, are an eco-friendly and economical option for threading and cooking various meats, vegetables, or fruits. Soaking wooden skewers in water before use helps prevent them from burning during cooking. 5. Wooden spatulas and turners: Used for flipping, lifting, serving, and scraping food while cooking, wooden spatulas and turners are preferred by many chefs since they are gentle on cookware surfaces and prevent scratching. These utensils come in various shapes, sizes, and designs, catering to different cooking needs. 6. Mortar and pestle: Although not a direct eating utensil, wooden mortar and Pestle have been widely used in global culinary traditions for grinding and crushing herbs, spices, and other ingredients to create pastes, sauces, and seasoning mixes. The wooden version provides a rustic and traditional alternative to stone or ceramic mortar and pestles. In conclusion, many wooden utensils and cutlery like chopsticks, spoons, skewers, toothpicks, and turners have been used for eating and cooking purposes throughout history. These items provide an eco-friendly, durable, and aesthetically pleasing option for meal preparation and consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that was affected by the foggy weather?, using the article: In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925., what would be the answer ?

However, maintaining good eye health goes beyond simply choosing the appropriate lenses. It involves the correct cleaning, storage, and handling of contacts, ensuring they are comfortable and safe to use on your eyes. In this comprehensive guide, we'll outline some critical steps for cleaning your contact case, washing your hands, finding an ideal space, and safely inserting your contact lenses. Section 1: Start with a Clean Contact Case Cleaning your contact lens case is a crucial, yet often overlooked aspect of contact lens care. Here are some essential tips for maintaining a clean contact case: 1.1 Rinse with care When cleaning your contact lens case, always use either a sterile contact lens solution or fresh multipurpose solution. Avoid using water as it may introduce bacteria or other impurities into the case. 1.2 Clean regularly Aim to clean your case after each use, and never leave your contacts soaking in the same solution for an extended period. Replace the solution daily to maintain a hygienic environment for your lenses. 1.3 Air dry Once you've cleaned your case, air-dry it upside down on a clean tissue or towel, ensuring any additional moisture evaporates. Avoid drying the case with a cloth as it can transfer lint or bacteria. 1.4 Replace your case Your contact lens case should be replaced at least every three months, even if it shows no visible signs of wear. A new contact case will reduce the risks of contamination and infection. Section 2: Proper Hand Hygiene Thorough hand hygiene is crucial before handling your contact lenses. Here are some tips for ensuring clean hands: 2.1 Use soap and water Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, ensuring you clean all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. 2.2 Dry with a lint-free towel After washing your hands, use a clean, lint-free towel to dry them. Avoid using a towel with lint or fabric threads to reduce the transfer of debris to your lenses. 2.3 Keep fingernails short and smooth Long or uneven nails can harbor bacteria and make it challenging to hold your contact lenses properly. Maintaining short nails will help reduce the risk of contamination and lens damage. Section 3: Finding the Right Environment Inserting your contact lenses safely and comfortably takes practice and the right conditions. Here are some guidelines to create the perfect environment: 3.1 Choose a well-lit room Ensure the room you're using has ample lighting to help you see better when inserting your contacts. Good lighting conditions will make it easier to spot any imperfections such as dirt or tears on the lens. 3.2 Use a clean mirror A clean, clear mirror is essential for successful contact lens insertion as it allows you to see what you're doing while ensuring proper lens placement. It can be helpful to use a freestanding or wall-mounted mirror that doesn't require holding. 3.3 Stand over an appropriate surface Select a surface that is stable and easy to clean. A bathroom countertop or a table with a clean, flat surface is ideal. It will help prevent your lenses from falling and getting contaminated if you drop them during the insertion process. Section 4: Inserting Your Contact Lenses Now that you have a clean contact case, washed hands, and a suitable environment, it's time to insert your lenses. Follow these steps for seamless contact lens insertion: 4.1 Inspect your lenses for damage or debris Before inserting, make sure your lenses are free from rips, tears, or any debris. Discard any damaged lenses and clean off debris as necessary. 4.2 Identify the lens orientation Hold the lens on the tip of your finger to check if it's inside out. A correctly oriented lens should resemble a smooth bowl. If it looks flared or has a lip, it's inside out, and you need to flip it. 4.3 Hold your eyes open Using your other hand, gently hold up your upper eyelid, minimizing the blinking reflex. At the same time, use the middle finger from the hand with the lens to pull down your lower eyelid. 4.4 Place the lens on your eye Look upward and gently place the lens on the whites of your eye. Release your eyelids slowly and blink a few times to help the lens position itself correctly. Conclusion Maintaining proper hygiene and handling techniques are essential for successful contact lens wear. By having a clean contact case, washing your hands, using a mirror in a well-lit room, and standing over an appropriate surface, you'll maximize your chances of comfortable, safe contact lens insertion. By following these guidelines, your eyes will stay healthy, and your vision will remain clear and comfortable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The subject is the girl and the action relates to her bringing a racket but no ball to tennis practice.  Since she didn't bring a ball, the sentence should probably explain why she brought the racket instead of the ball.  Now, I'll analyze the two options provided: A. racket was provided. B. ball was provided. Option A does not adequately explain why the girl didn't bring a ball because it focuses on the racket being provided, which doesn't seem relevant to the reason for not bringing a ball.  Option B directly addresses the lack of a ball brought by the girl - the ball was provided, meaning that it was available at the practice and that's why she didn't bring one.

Title: The King Movie plot: The city of Kozhikode suddenly witnesses a massive communal riot, claiming 12 people. Madhukumar (Appa Haja), a wildlife photographer witnessing a group of criminals transporting explosives through forest check post, calls up Shankar (Devan), the police commissioner and passes the information. Shankar asks him to wait for his guys who would pick him up. But instead of police, it was the same goons who came for him. Madhu is brutally murdered at the same night. Joseph Alex IAS (Mammootty), the aggressive and belligerent district collector is suspicious of the activities of city police commissioner and decides to investigate the case. He is assisted by ASP Prasad (Ganeshan), another sincere officer, who also admires Joseph for his arrogant way of dealing politicians. Madhu's father (Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair) reaches out Prasad for filing a man missing complaint. Prasad finds out the body of Madhu in a decomposed stage with his camera, but the film missing.

Write a summary based on this article: An eagle-eyed cop hit the scofflaw jackpot after pulling over a motorist for a routine infraction — and discovering the driver had more than 12,000 in unpaid tolls and penalties, official said Wednesday.      Oscar Sanchez, 45, was headed east into the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City on Tuesday afternoon when Port Authority Police Officer Tomasz Grel noticed he didn’t have a front license plate and traveled through an E-ZPass lane as the “toll unpaid” sign lit up, authorities said.      Sanchez’s 2001 Mercedes-Benz was pulled over and Grel found that the suspect didn’t have an E-ZPass in his window, officials said. Sanchez insisted that he still pays tolls, even without the E-ZPass, saying, “I don’t have it (an E-ZPass device) but they always charge my tag,” according to the Port Authority.      But a routine driver’s license check showed that Sanchez was wanted for allegedly beating local bridge and tunnel tolls 204 times, officials said. That added up to 2,771 in unpaid tolls and 10,200 in penalties.      The Jersey City resident Sanchez was arrested and charged with alleged theft of service, driving without a front license plate and driving with a suspended license. Sanchez had a valid New York license but records showed his New Jersey driving privileges had been suspended.      He was released without bail and ordered to appear in a Jersey City courtroom on Tuesday of next week. ||||| JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) — Authorities say a New Jersey man who owes 12,000 in unpaid EZ Pass tolls has had his black Mercedes Benz impounded and is facing charges.      Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman Joe Pentangelo said Wednesday that Oscar Sanchez, of Jersey City, was pulled over by agency police on Tuesday because the car didn't have a front license plate.      Pentangelo says the officer discovered Sanchez had an expired driver's license and more than 200 counts of missed EZ Pass toll payments amounting to about 12,000.      Sanchez faces charges including theft of service, operating a vehicle on a suspended license and not having a front license plate.      Sanchez was not immediately available for comment, and it's unclear whether he has an attorney who could speak on his behalf. |||||","output":"Imagine this. A police officer named Tomasz Grel noticed a car moving into the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City without a front license plate. Also, when the car went through a special toll lane, a sign lit up saying that the toll wasn't paid. So, officer Grel decided to stop the car. The driver of the car was a man named Oscar Sanchez.  When the officer checked Mr. Sanchez's car, he didn't find a device called E-ZPass that usually helps in paying tolls automatically. Even though Mr. Sanchez said he pays tolls without the device, when the officer checked his records, he found out something surprising. Mr. Sanchez hadn't paid for crossing bridges and tunnels 204 times! He owed 2,771 for the unpaid tolls and an additional 10,200 for fines. That adds up to more than 12,000 overall!

A large sea turtle lays around 150 eggs at a time. She lays all these eggs in just a few minutes. Large sea turtles live in the warm seas of the world. Except for when they lay their eggs, they spend their whole lives in the water. When it is time to lay their eggs, the females  swim to land. They usually return to the place where they themselves were born. How they find their way back there is unknown. When they reach shore, the big, heavy turtles crawl slowly up to the high water mark. Using their flippers, they pull themselves along the sand. They must struggle like mountain climbers. When they finally reach dry sand, they rest before beginning the difficult task of laying eggs. The turtles lay the eggs in deep holes and cover them with warm sand. The sand protects the eggs from harm. Then the females leave them. After a few weeks, if you happened to be walking along the beach, you might see the sand begin to shake. You may see tiny black balls coming out of the sand. The tiny heads of baby turtles! Question: Turtles bury their eggs to protect them from   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"danger\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"danger.\\" Turtles bury their eggs to protect them from various dangers that can harm the eggs and decrease the chances of survival for baby turtles. These dangers can include potential predators like birds, crabs, or other animals, as well as environmental factors such as extreme temperatures, flooding, or human activities like beach development and pollution. By digging deep holes and covering their eggs with warm sand, the female turtles create a protective barrier that hides the eggs from predators and safeguards them from harmful environmental factors. The sand acts as an insulator, providing a controlled environment for the eggs to incubate and the baby turtles to develop properly. Moreover, the natural camouflage offered by burying the eggs in the sand makes it difficult for predators to find them. This concealment is crucial for the survival of the baby turtles, as many species face high mortality rates due to predation, both at the egg and hatchling stages. Additionally, the buried eggs have a greater chance of survival when exposed to potential flooding caused by high tides or storms, as the sand can provide some resistance to being washed away. In summary, the answer is \\"danger,\\" as turtles bury their eggs to protect them from the multiple risks they might face, such as predators and harsh environmental conditions, ensuring the continuation of their species and maintaining the delicate balance of the marine ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It could be an expression of genuine surprise or disbelief in the listener's inability to comprehend something. Alternatively, it could also be a rhetorical question, which conveys a degree of sarcasm or frustration rather than seeking an actual response. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the truth of the hypothesis \\"You cannot understand that.\\" As such, the question leaves room for ambiguity, and it is not possible to definitively answer with a simple yes or no. In order to arrive at a more accurate conclusion, one would need to consider the context in which the statement is made, the tone of the speaker, as well as any additional information that might shed light on the situation. For instance, if the speaker is aware that the listener has struggled with the subject matter in the past, the hypothesis might be more likely to be true.

Unable to dislodge the food, Julia attempts to save her by performing a tracheotomy which results in the child's bleeding to death. Julia leaves her husband Magnus (Keir Dullea) and moves to a new house with an upstairs room containing a child's possessions, including a mechanical clown toy with sharp cymbals on which she cuts her finger. In the park, Julia sees a young girl that she believes is Kate but the child disappears. Unusual things happen to take place in the house such as strange noises and appliances turning on by themselves. Later, Julia again sees the girl in the park and finds a mutilated turtle and knife where she stood. Julia lets Magnus' sister Lily use her house to conduct a seance. Mrs. Flood, the medium, explains that spirits need to control someone to carry out physical acts. During the seance, the medium becomes frightened and tells Julia to leave the house immediately. Moments later, one of Lily's friends falls down the stairs before Mrs. Flood can explain what she saw. While Julia is out, Magnus breaks into her house. He sees something and follows it to the basement where he falls from the staircase, fatally cutting his throat on a broken bottle.

Write an article based on this summary: A rights group says it has evidence of Myanmar's government discriminating against Muslim Rohingya, restricting their movements and family size. Article:","output":"Title: Rights Group Reveals Disturbing Evidence of Discrimination Against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar Introduction A prominent human rights group has recently reported alarming evidence of discrimination practiced by the Myanmar government against the Muslim Rohingya community. The group's research indicates that the Rohingya are facing movement restrictions and family size limitations imposed by state authorities, highlighting the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Southeast Asian nation. Evidence of Discrimination The mentioned rights group claims to have gathered substantial documentation pointing to the discriminatory treatment of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. The group asserts that the government is implementing policies that deliberately restrict the movements of the Rohingya population, forcing them to remain in small areas with limited access to basic resources such as food, water, healthcare, and proper sanitation. Additionally, the rights group also states that it has found evidence of policies dictating family size limitations among the Rohingya community. These policies, purportedly designed and enforced by state authorities, create an undue burden on one of the world's most vulnerable and persecuted minority groups. Implications and International Response This new evidence of discrimination adds weight to the long-standing calls for the international community to intervene and address the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar. Various human rights organizations and activists have been urging governments worldwide to pay attention to the plight of the Rohingya people and find a way to ensure their safety, dignity, and access to essential rights. The United Nations has repeatedly referred to the Rohingya as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world, and in 2017, the organization declared a \\"textbook example of ethnic cleansing\\" in Myanmar. Additionally, in 2019 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered the country to protect the lives of its Rohingya citizens and preserve evidence of possible genocide. The Future for the Rohingya Community Despite the growing body of evidence and the international community's efforts to bring attention to the Rohingya crisis, the discrimination and persecution of this minority group continue. Accountability remains a significant challenge, and the Myanmar government has often denied any wrongdoing, which complicates finding an effective resolution to the situation. While some positive steps have been taken, such as the repatriation plan signed between Myanmar and Bangladesh in 2017 for the voluntary return of Rohingya refugees to their homes, any real progress remains limited. The international community must continue its efforts to hold the Myanmar government accountable and push for an end to discriminatory practices against the Rohingya people. Conclusion The recent evidence gathered by the rights group highlights the persistent discrimination and systemic persecution faced by the Rohingya community in Myanmar.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who re-enacts a famous scene from Bande à part?  Matthew is an American exchange student who has come to Paris to study French. While at the Cinémathèque Française protesting the firing of Henri Langlois, he meets the free-spirited twins Théo and Isabelle. The three bond over a shared love of film. After dinner with their parents, Théo and Isabelle offer Matthew the chance to stay with them while their parents are on a trip. Matthew accepts, considering them his first French friends. Matthew becomes suspicious of their relationship after seeing them sleeping nude together; he soon discovers that they accept nudity and sexuality liberally. After Théo loses at a trivia game, Isabelle sentences him to masturbate to a Marlene Dietrich poster in front of them. After Matthew loses at another game, he is seduced to take Isabelle's virginity. The two then become lovers. Matthew begins to accept Théo and Isabelle's sexuality and his time living with them soon becomes idyllic. The three re-enact a famous scene from Bande à part by \\"breaking the world record for running through the Louvre\\", and Matthew and Théo engage in playful arguments about Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix, as well as the subject of Maoism, which Théo fervently believes in.  During this time Matthew begins to pursue a relationship with Isabelle, separate from Théo. Matthew and Isabelle leave the house and go on a regular date, which she has not experienced before. Théo retaliates by inviting a companion up to his room, upsetting Isabelle. She distances herself from both Théo and Matthew, only to find them next to each other on Théo's bed when an argument between the two turns erotic. The answer to this question is:","output":"The three, which refers to Matthew, Théo, and Isabelle, re-enact a famous scene from Bande à part."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The game was the first at the newly christened University of Phoenix Stadium, which signed its naming rights deal with the Cardinals two days after Arizona's last home game vs. St. Louis. The Cards started off hot as Matt Leinart, making his first NFL start, threw two touchdowns in the first quarter to his two top targets, Anquan Boldin and Larry Fitzgerald.  The Chiefs responded early in the second quarter with a 45-yard field goal by kicker Lawrence Tynes, and a touchdown pass from quarterback Damon Huard to running back Larry Johnson.  Cards kicker Neil Rackers added a 41-yard field at the end of the first half. Another Rackers field goal, this time from 45 yards, accounted for the only score in the third quarter.  The Chiefs then scored 13 unanswered points to win the game, with a touchdown pass from Huard to Samie Parker, and two field goals by Tynes (40, 19).  Tynes' last field goal was set up by a 78-yard screen pass from Huard to Johnson.  Johnson suffered a sprained neck at the end of the play on a violent face mask tackle by Cards' cornerback Antrel Rolle, who was fined 12,500 for the penalty. A last second 51-yard field goal attempt by Rackers to send the game to overtime failed, giving the Cards their fourth straight loss.  During the game Larry Fitzgerald pulled a hamstring and missed 3 games, returning Week 10 against Dallas. Answer this question: What all field goals did Neil Rackers attempt in the second half?","output":"Okay little buddy, here's what happened with Neil Rackers in the second half of that game.

Process: - Owls have specially adapted eyes that see better at night - Owls sit at high points in trees and look around - When an owl spots a rodent they track it - When the rodent is standing still the owl swoops down - The owl grabs the rodent with their talons - The owl uses their beak to eat the rodent Perturbation hypothesis: Suppose less air pollution is produced, how will it affect more owls seeing rodents? Step 2: Analyze the relationship between air pollution and the process. Air pollution can affect visibility due to the presence of contaminants and particulate matter in the atmosphere. This can potentially influence owls' ability to see rodents at night. Step 3: Determine the potential effect of the perturbation on the process. If there is less air pollution, it can be expected that the visibility of the environment would improve. As a result, owls, which have adapted eyes to see better at night, could potentially see rodents more clearly. This may help owls to more efficiently track and locate their prey during the night. Step 4: Assess whether the perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the process. The supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process, as it potentially affects the visibility in the environment where the owls find their prey. Improved visibility due to less air pollution may enhance the owls' ability to spot and track rodents, supporting the process of hunting and eating by owls."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which fruit retained their quality longer peaches or cherries?  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]","output":"Since Mary received peaches and decided to candy them, and Ann received cherries and ate them fresh, it can be inferred that the candied peaches would retain their quality longer. Candied fruit can last up to a year due to the preservation process, while fresh fruit does not have the same extended shelf life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, he dismisses her, but later comes to their home upon receiving a phone call from Pete saying he would go to Central America himself.

At points, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius sounded downright Orwellian in her testimony before Congress on Wednesday, such as when she explained that \\"the website never crashed. It is functional, but at a very slow speed and very low reliability and has continued to function.\\" Prolonged periods of minimum usefulness, perhaps, but don't call it a \\"crash,\\" she said with a straight face. On the other half of the television screen, CNN showed a live shot of HealthCare.gov with the message displayed, \\"The system is down at the moment.\\" But in the world of Obamacare, a mandate is an \\"option,\\" expensive is \\"affordable,\\" and now apparently failure is \\"function.\\" Of course, the problem with Obamacare isn't just the website, and the loss in credibility isn't just the secretary's. President Barack Obama and other supporters of the law spent years telling the American people that \\"if you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period.\\" They said detractors who suggested otherwise were lying. They said Republicans were just trying to scare people. The President and his allies were the dishonest ones, as is now clear to everyone. Even while they were promising Americans nothing would change if they liked their policies, \\"the administration knew that more than 40 to 67 percent of those in the individual market would not be able to keep their plans, even if they liked them,\\" as NBC News reported this week. Already more than 2 million people have had their insurance plans canceled -- three times as many as have signed up for Obamacare. Yet the President continues to insist, as he did Wednesday in Boston, that \\"if you had one of these substandard plans before the Affordable Care Act became law\\" -- of course, it was the law that made them \\"substandard,\\" by definition -- \\"and you liked that plan, you were able to keep it.\\" In the same speech, he took credit for liberating Americans from those \\"substandard\\" policies. This is as good an example of \\"double-think\\" as anything we've seen in American politics. While the President and the other pitchmen of Obamacare have certainly lost credibility, however, Sebelius in particular needs to be held accountable for the launch failures. She added the problem of terrible management on top of the law's many flaws, and in doing so has put the health, financial security and personal information of hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk. Across the country there are people who will have to buy insurance through the exchanges in just a few months, some because Obamacare caused their policies to be canceled, some because Obamacare caused their employers to dump their coverage. Many of these people will face steep new costs that they weren't anticipating. But today, a full month after the exchanges went live, Americans who visit HealthCare.gov to find out what coverage they and their families will have and how much it will cost them must spend hours of frustration trying to navigate a broken system. Even more alarming, the secretary's bad execution of the President's bad plan could put thousands of Americans' personal information at risk. Sebelius told Rep. Mike Rodgers on Wednesday that she would have to get back to him on whether there had ever been a complete security test of the system. When the person who is supposedly overseeing a system into which hundreds of thousands of people are entering their personal information says she will \\"get back to you\\" about whether there has been thorough security testing, it is terrifying. And on top of everything else, the exchange website is a complete boondoggle. Sebelius testified the government has spent almost 175 million on HealthCare.gov so far, and the real tab will surely be much higher after the emergency repairs. Already, this is substantially more than Apple spent to develop the iPhone, and even (as I pointed out recently) more than NASA spent on the Mars Pathfinder mission. It likely makes HealthCare.gov the most expensive website ever built, and certainly the most expensive not to function -- although perhaps that word no longer means what we thought it did. These failures of management make the pain of a bad law even worse. I oppose the law. I have always opposed the law. I believe it will fail and cannot be improved. But most of all, honesty counts in public officials, and after Sebelius' testimony Wednesday she should have lost her credibility even in the eyes of Obamacare's supporters. It's time to offer her the option of mandatory retirement. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of Newt Gingrich. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article focus on the issues surrounding the launch of Obamacare, specifically the problematic website HealthCare.gov, and the perceived dishonesty from the Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius and President Barack Obama. The author highlights the following points: 1. Sebelius' claim that the website never crashed, despite it being slow and unreliable. 2. The broken promise that \\"if you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan\\" made by President Obama and other supporters of the law. 3. Over 2 million people having their insurance plans canceled, while only around 675,000 have enrolled in Obamacare. 4. The challenge faced by Americans trying to navigate through the broken HealthCare.gov, which has caused frustration for many users. 5. The potential risk to Americans' personal information due to inadequate or unknown security measures on the HealthCare.gov website. 6. The extremely high cost of developing HealthCare.gov, which is estimated at almost 175 million and is considered by the author as possibly the most expensive website ever built. 7. The loss of credibility and accountability that has resulted from the launch failures and dishonesty of key public figures, such as Sebelius and President Obama.

The answer is:","output":"To find the answer, let's break down the key information provided in the question: 1. Italian painter 2. 19th-century art movement 3. Small, thin, yet visible brush strokes 4. Open composition 5. Emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities 6. Ordinary subject matter 7. Inclusion of \\"movement\\" as a crucial element of human perception and experience 8. Unusual visual angles Now, we can start our search by identifying the art movement that fits these characteristics. In the 19th century, the art movement that matches these features is Impressionism.  However, Impressionism is typically associated with French artists, such as Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. So, it is unusual to attribute an Italian painter as the best known for Impressionism. Italian painters during that period mostly embraced other styles, such as Macchiaioli and Divisionism. Based on the characteristics, Giovanni Boldini has some similarities to the Impressionist movement, although he is more closely associated with portraiture and genre painting. Additionally, another Italian painter, Federico Zandomeneghi, did become involved with the French Impressionists and exhibited his works in their exhibitions. Considering these factors, the answer is: Federico Zandomeneghi, an Italian painter who was associated with the French Impressionist movement during the 19th-century."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  (1). he also tried to invent a sewing machine;  (2). he was one of Howe's best friends;  (3). he also had difficulty in falling asleep;  (4). he got some of his ideas from dreams; Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Early one morning, more than a hundred years ago, an American inventor called Elias Howe finally fell asleep. He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem. It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Despite his exhaustion, Howe slept badly. He tossed  and turned. Then he had a nightmare He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine. When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light, said his best ideas came into him in dreams. So did the great physicist Albert Einstein. To appreciate the value of dreams, you have to understand what happens when you are asleep. Even then, a part of your mind is still working. This unconscious , but still active part digests your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day. However, the unconscious part expresses itself through its own logic and its own language.. It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first. This is why dreams are sometimes called \\"secret messages to ourselves\\". Question: Thomas Edison is mentioned because  _  . Answer: A:","output":"Thomas Edison is mentioned because he, along with other great inventors and thinkers like Albert Einstein, also credited some of his best ideas to his dreams. The article highlights the significance of dreams in problem-solving and the creative process, and the mention of Edison serves as an example of how dreams have played a crucial role in the discovery and invention of groundbreaking technologies. By including Edison, the article emphasizes the importance of dreams as a source of inspiration and innovative thinking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Option 1: \\"The baths just seems unsanitary laying there.\\" Option 2: \\"The showers just seems unsanitary laying there.\\" Now, let's look at each option's relevance to the context: Option 1: This option is more relevant because it provides a reason for the preference change from baths to showers. The person finds baths unsanitary because they are laying in the water.  Option 2: This option is less relevant to the context and contradicts the stated preference for showers. The person is now fond of showers, so it doesn't make sense for them to criticize showers in the next sentence.

Bure was born in Moscow in 1971 to Vladimir and Tatiana Bure. At age 12, his parents separated, and he remained with his mother. Vladimir Bure, a Russian swimming legend, had dreams of Pavel becoming a professional swimmer, but he aspired to play hockey at an early age. He attended his first tryout with the CSKA Moscow hockey school at the age of six, despite his limited skating ability. The New York Rangers acquired Bure on March 18, 2002, along with Florida's second-round pick in the 2002 draft (Lee Falardeau) for Igor Ulanov, Filip Novak, as well as the Rangers' first and second-round choices in the 2002 draft (Petr Taticek and Rob Globke, respectively) and a fourth-round choice in the 2003 draft. The Rangers had shown interest in Bure when he requested a trade from the Canucks in 1997. After losing their initial bid for Bure, Wayne Gretzky, who retired the same season Bure was dealt to Florida, announced prior to the 1999-2000 season he would have extended his career had the Rangers been able to pull off the trade. Bure made his Rangers debut against the Vancouver Canucks the day after his trade on March 19, scoring a goal against his former team. He scored 12 goals and 20 points in 12 games after being traded, bettering his pace with Florida that season. Between the two teams, he finished the season with 34 goals and 69 points.  Bure suffered another knee injury in the 2002-03 pre-season; combined with a case of strep throat, he missed the first three games of the regular season. After returning to play, he had 14 goals and 21 points in his first 27 games, including two goals and an assist in his first game back, before a knee-on-knee collision in December forced him back out. After undergoing surgery 10 days later, it was revealed that there was no damage to the ACL as previously feared, but instead a tear to the meniscus in his left knee, which was repaired. Bure returned that season to appear in 39 games, managing 19 goals and 30 points.  Even after two operations, Bure did not play in 2003-04 due to the lingering effects of the knee injury. He failed a pre-season physical and was declared medically unable to play. Left with his fully insured 10 million salary (80 percent of which would be reimbursed to the team), the Rangers left him unprotected in the NHL's Waiver Draft, where he was unclaimed.

Q:Given the following context:  The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.  answer the following question:  What was the full name of the person that had to change their plans when money was withheld?

The sentence provided information about General John W. \\"Iron Mike\\" O'Daniel going to Vietnam for studying and assessing the French forces but does not discuss any party that provided supplies to the Vietnamese communists. In order to answer the question about who was providing supplies to the Vietnamese communists fighting against France, we need to provide context and historical background information. During the First Indochina War (1946-1954), which was a conflict between the French colonial forces and the Viet Minh, the Vietnamese communists were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh aimed to gain independence from France and establish a communist government. To effectively fight against the French, the Viet Minh received assistance in the form of supplies and support from several sources, primarily the Soviet Union and Communist China. Both of these nations were interested in assisting the spread of communism in Asia and viewed Vietnam as a crucial front in the struggle against Western imperialism. The Soviet Union began to provide military aid in 1950, with supplies including small arms, ammunition, trucks, and military communications equipment. They also sent military advisors to assist in the strategy, planning, and training of Viet Minh troops, as well as offering them economic and political support. In the case of China, which shared a border with Vietnam, they provided more substantial support. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Mao Zedong's government took a more prominent role in backing the Viet Minh. Chinese military aid to the Viet Minh included weapons, ammunition, skilled military advisors, and logistical support through supply routes that stretched across China's southern border. Moreover, the Chinese government provided financial assistance, diplomatic backing, and even sent volunteer troops to help bolster Vietnamese forces. In summary, the primary suppliers of the Vietnamese communists fighting against France were the Soviet Union and Communist China. Both nations played a crucial role in supporting the Viet Minh's struggle for independence and the establishment of a communist regime in Vietnam."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative.

The draft was set 20 years after the events depicted in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and follows an adult Scout Finch as she visits her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, and confronts the intolerance in her community. There was an assertion by Lee's agent, Andrew Nurnberg, that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" was originally intended to be the first book in a trilogy, with \\"Watchman\\" to be published last and a shorter connecting novel in between. However, this claim has been discredited by rare books expert James S. Jaffe and journalist Jonathan Mahler. They found that \\"Watchman\\" was more likely an earlier draft of \\"Mockingbird,\\" rather than a separate novel. The instances of overlapping passages and identical text between the two books also support the argument that \\"Watchman\\" is an early draft and not a distinct novel in a trilogy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although I don't speak Chinese I managed to talk with the villagers using signs and gestures.","output":"To determine if the word \\"speak\\" has the same meaning in both sentences, I will analyze the context of each sentence and the implied meaning of the word \\"speak.\\" Step 1: Analyze the first sentence. \\"They speak a strange dialect.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"speak\\" refers to the action of using a specific language or dialect to communicate. The focus here is on the usage and expression of the language. So in this context, \\"speak\\" refers to the ability to express oneself using a certain language or dialect. Step 2: Analyze the second sentence. \\"Although I don't speak Chinese, I managed to talk with the villagers using signs and gestures.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"speak\\" is used in the negative form to represent the inability or lack of knowledge to use the Chinese language for communication. Despite this, the speaker was able to communicate using non-verbal means. So, in this context, \\"speak\\" also refers to the ability to express oneself using a certain language. Conclusion: In both sentences, the word \\"speak\\" is used to denote the ability to express oneself through a specific language or dialect.

Answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House.  The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.  The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea.  Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\"  Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.  Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security.  \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\"  Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports. Question: When was trade a major topic of discussion for Trump?

Answer: CD-ROMs are popularly used to distribute computer software , including video games and multimedia applications, though any data can be stored (up to the capacity limit of a disc). Question: How many pages of text can you store onto a cd? Answer:","output":"Yes, your statement about the CD-ROM is correct. To answer your question about how much text can be stored onto a CD-ROM, we first need to determine the capacity of a standard CD-ROM and then calculate the storage requirement for textual data. A typical CD-ROM has a storage capacity of around 650-700 Megabytes (MB). It's important to note that there are other variants like CD-R and CD-RW, but we will use the standard CD-ROM capacity for this calculation. Now, let's assume that one page of text contains approximately 2000 characters, including spaces and formatting. A single character requires 1 Byte for storage (using ASCII encoding), so 2000 characters would need 2000 Bytes or approximately 2 Kilobytes (KB) of space. To calculate the number of text pages a CD-ROM can hold, we need to first convert the CD-ROM's storage capacity to Kilobytes: 1 MB = 1024 KB For a 700 MB CD-ROM: 700 MB * 1024 KB/MB = 716800 KB Now, dividing the CD-ROM's capacity in KB by the storage requirement for one page: 716800 KB / 2 KB/page ≈ 358,400 pages Hence, a standard CD-ROM can store approximately 358,400 pages of text.

Michel Richard, Acclaimed Chef at Citronelle, Dies at 68 Michel Richard, a French-born chef whose French-Californian hybrid Citrus was one of the top restaurants in Los Angeles for more than a decade, and who gave Washington a major claim to be a serious dining city after he opened Citronelle there in 1993, died on Saturday in Washington. He was 68. The cause was complications of a stroke, said Mel Davis, his longtime publicist. Mr. Richard (pronounced ree-SHAR), a pastry chef by training, was an adventurous, jovial chef, fond of experimentation and open to the myriad culinary influences of his adopted country. He loved to cook, to please, to amuse and to astonish. His many signature dishes included “begula” (a play on “beluga”), a trick caviar made from Israeli couscous cooked in squid ink and served in a tin. His trompe l’oeil “lemon egg-ceptional” fooled diners by presenting them with an eggshell made of white chocolate encasing a “yolk” made of lemon meringue. On one occasion, at Citronelle, he served an entire dessert plate made to resemble breakfast foods: French toast with butter, a fried egg, a strip of bacon. “I want to create a festive feeling,” he told The Washington Post in 1998. “I want people to be surprised, to be happy. It doesn’t take a genius to do this. Just someone like me.” His sense of play rested on a solid foundation in French classical technique, although he was self-taught as a savory chef. In 2007, the James Beard Foundation named him outstanding chef of the year. Michel Louis-Marie Richard was born on March 7, 1948, in Pabu, Brittany. His laborer father, André, seeking construction work, moved the family to the Ardennes region. An abusive drunk, he left when Michel was 6. Michel’s mother, Muguette, supported the family, barely, by working in a factory. Michel found his vocation early, cooking for the family while still a child. When he was 9, a friend took Michel on a visit to his parents’ restaurant. “When we opened the back door of the restaurant and I entered the kitchen, it was for me paradise,” he told The Washington Post in 2006. “I helped the pastry chef to make a little tart. I looked into the dining room and saw these elegant people having a good time. I fell in love with it all.” At 14, he signed on as an apprentice with a baker in Reims, France, where he showed early signs of his inventive nature. “I began doing dinners at night in the pastry shop,” he told The New York Times in 2013. “You could say they were the first pop-ups.” He satisfied his military obligation by serving as a cook in the Army and then found work at a mediocre pastry shop in Paris. His luck turned when he was hired by the famed caterer and patissier Gaston Lenôtre, who sent him to New York in 1974 to open an American outpost, the Château France. The venture failed after three years, but Mr. Richard decided to stay, traveling to Santa Fe, N.M., to run the French Pastry Shop in La Fonda Hotel. In 1977 he opened a pastry shop on Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles, where he began experimenting with savory dishes on the side as he expanded the menu. With Citrus, he came into his own. The restaurant, which opened in 1987, offered a French interpretation of the local cuisine that Mr. Richard sometimes described as California Provençal. Influenced by nouvelle cuisine, he cut back on butter, cream and heavy sauces. Making use of his pastry training, he delighted the eye with fanciful forms and striking color combinations. Dishes like crab coleslaw and fried shrimp wrapped in filaments of shredded phyllo pastry became overnight stars, copied by chefs throughout the United States. Critics were dazzled by his oyster custard in spinach sauce, and by a “lasagna” of escargots and fried parsley. “Citrus has captured the mood of Los Angeles right now, and it has thereby captured the city’s imagination,” Ruth Reichl wrote in her review of the restaurant for The Los Angeles Times. The restaurant closed in 2001. In 1997 Mr. Richard sold half his interest in Citrus to the hotel management company Meristar, his partner in the first Citronelle, which opened in the Santa Barbara Inn Hotel in 1989. Subsequent versions of Citronelle opened in Baltimore, Tokyo and Carmel, Calif. His home base was the Citronelle in Washington, in the Latham Hotel in the Georgetown neighborhood. It became the city’s premier restaurant virtually overnight, a shooting star in a city long dominated by old-line steakhouses and embassy kitchens. It closed in 2012 after its building developed structural problems. In 2007 Mr. Richard opened Central Michel Richard on Pennsylvania Avenue, six blocks from the White House. Described on its website as a “modern American bistro with a French twist,” it was named the best new restaurant in the United States by the James Beard Foundation the next year. Mr. Richard, who lived in Potomac, Md., returned to New York to open Villard Michel Richard in the Villard Houses on Madison Avenue, formerly home to Gilt and Le Cirque 2000, in 2013. It was greeted with a punishing review by Pete Wells in The New York Times and closed in less than a year, although a bakery in the same building, Pomme Palais, remains open. Mr. Richard’s first two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Laurence Retourné; five sons, Michael, Sebastien, Christophe, Luc and Clement; and a daughter, Christelle Richard. He was the author of “Richard’s Home Cooking with a French Accent” (1993) and “Sweet Magic: Easy Recipes for Delectable Desserts” (2010), but the title that best expressed his philosophy was “Happy in the Kitchen: The Craft of Cooking, the Art of Eating” (2006). “The way we should represent France is to make the food fun, charming, good, not pretentious,” Mr. Richard told The Times. “It should be like Renoir, Manet.” A version of this article appears in print on August 16, 2016, on page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Michel Richard, Chef, Is Dead at 68; Embraced ‘California Provençal’ Style.

The three films were directed by Vincenzo Natali , Andrzej Sekua , and Ernie Barbarash respectively . All three films are based on the same premise : there is a gigantic , mechanical , cubical structure of unknown purpose and origin , made up of lots of smaller cubical rooms . Each of these rooms has six doors , one on each face of the cube , which lead into adjacent , identically decorated rooms , only differing by colour . Some of these rooms are \`\` safe '' , while others are equipped with deadly booby traps such as flamethrowers and razorwire . In some cases it is possible to detect a trap by throwing an object into the room first , although this method is not always reliable due to the trigger mechanism of certain traps . In each case , a group of strangers awakens in this mysterious structure , without any knowledge of how or why they are there . In order to escape from the prison , they must band together and use their combined skills and talents to avoid the traps and navigate out of the maze , while also trying to solve the mystery of what the cube is and why they are in it . However , the pressure of being in the Cube generally turns one of the prisoners into a homicidal maniac who preys on the others . Cube Zero was slightly different from the first two films in that it also dealt with the people on the outside of the Cube whose job it was to control the cube and oversee those within . In March 2011 , Lionsgate announced it was considering an additional film in the series , tentatively titled Cube 3D . In April 2015 , The Hollywood Reporter announced that Lionsgate Films are planning to remake the original movie under the title Cubed , with Saman Kesh as director .  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

Answer: At one of the very worst sites, around Sandakan in Borneo, only six of some 2,500 British and Australian prisoners survived.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: Sandakan is located in the Sabah province of Malaysia, which is situated on the northeastern part of the island of Borneo. Sabah is one of thirteen states of Malaysia and shares its borders with the Malaysian state of Sarawak to the southwest, and with the Indonesian provinces of East Kalimantan and North Kalimantan to the south. The region's history dates back to the prehistoric era, with evidence of human habitation found in archaeological sites. In the 15th century, it became part of the Sultanate of Brunei, a powerful empire that controlled much of Borneo and the surrounding region. Over the years, European powers, such as the British, became interested in the area, resulting in the establishment of British North Borneo in 1881. During World War II, the Japanese invaded and occupied Borneo, including the town of Sandakan. The Sandakan POW camp was established, where around 2,500 British and Australian prisoners were held captive. The prisoners were subjected to forced labor, harsh living conditions, and frequent torture by the Japanese guards. One of the most notorious events that took place at the Sandakan camp was the series of death marches in 1945, where prisoners were forced to march over 260 kilometers through the Borneo jungle to the camp in Ranau. Many perished during these marches, and by the end of the war, only six of the original 2,500 prisoners had survived. Following the end of World War II, British North Borneo became a British Crown Colony, and it was merged with Sarawak and Singapore to form the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 - eventually becoming the state of Sabah. Today, Sandakan is an important port city, serving as a gateway to ecotourism destinations in Sabah, such as the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre and the Kinabatangan wildlife sanctuary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition.

The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.

Unfortunately, my experience was deeply disappointing, and I feel it necessary to share my thoughts, as I don't want others to face the same letdown I did. Firstly, upon entering the restaurant, I found the ambiance to be quite dull. The lighting seemed too bright for a fine dining environment, while the tables were arranged too close together, leaving little room for privacy. As for the background music, it was an odd mix of dated pop songs and electronic beats that seemed out of place. Our server appeared promptly, but he seemed disinterested and lacked any genuine warmth. My initial enthusiasm began to wane as he brought out the menus without any enthusiasm or recommendations. Moreover, he left us waiting for far too long before taking our orders. I expect better service from an establishment that presents itself as upscale. The food, however, was the coup de grâce to the dismal evening. We began with the crab croquettes and truffle mushroom ravioli as recommended by other online reviewers. Both appetizers were underwhelming— the crab croquettes were overcooked and lacked any discernable crab flavor, while the mushroom ravioli contained only a stingy dollop of truffle filling. My partner's main course of steak frites was passable, but my seared scallops were severely overcooked and rubbery. To cap it all off, the accompanying mashed potatoes tasted like the packaged instant variety.  In conclusion, \\"The Tasty Palette\\" simply does not live up to its name or the online hype. The uninspiring atmosphere, lackluster service, and sub-par food left me regretting my decision to dine here. I will not be returning and cannot recommend \\"The Tasty Palette\\" to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience.

Truth be told, her praises hardly do justice to the culinary gem that is this charming eatery. As soon as we walked through the doors, we were enveloped by an enchanting ambiance. The thoughtful decor combined rustic and modern elements seamlessly, while the soft string lights and flickering candles set the stage for a cozy dining experience. The friendly hostess greeted us with warmth and promptly led us to our seats. Our server, Janet, approached us with genuine enthusiasm, showcasing her extensive knowledge of each dish and helping us navigate the menu, which featured a tempting array of dishes prepared with locally-sourced, seasonal ingredients. Her recommendations did not disappoint. We started with a beautifully-presented beet salad and a creamy burrata with heirloom tomatoes. Both appetizers left us craving more. For the main courses, I opted for the pan-seared salmon with lemon-dill sauce and my friend selected the perfectly cooked wild mushroom risotto. It surpassed all expectations— the flavors and textures melded together seamlessly, creating an absolutely divine experience. We couldn't resist ending our meal with their signature chocolate lava cake, served with fresh berries and a delightful scoop of house-made vanilla ice cream. It was without a doubt, one of the best desserts I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Our entire dining experience at \\"Flavorful Oasis\\" was nothing short of spectacular. The ambiance, warm service, and extraordinary dishes make this restaurant a must-visit destination. I am already eagerly planning my next reservation and look forward to exploring more of their exquisite offerings. Rating: 5/5 stars"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By studying wet fingers closely, Smulders and his partners found that the wrinkles looked a bit like the patterns on the car tire or on the bottom of the running shoes. So they made a guess that wrinkles on fingers might be able to help the hand hold things more tightly. To test _ , researchers asked 20 people to pick up marbles from water with their hands. But before they started, some of the people had to keep their hands in water for half an hour. The researchers found that the people with wrinkled fingers completed the task the task faster than those with dry hands. But when they were asked to move dry marbles, all the people performed equally well, no matter they had the wrinkled fingers or not. Our ancestors might not have played with marbles, but wrinkled fingers could have made it easier for them to climb around in the wet forests and catch fish from rivers, researchers say. Similarly, our toes also get wrinkled in water. This may have developed from our ancestor's need to run on wet ground. But the question is, if wrinkled fingers are so helpful, why don't our hands just stay that way all the time? Researchers explained that wrinkling has its disadvantage: wet fingertips are far less sensitive than smooth ones, reducing our sense of touch. A:","output":"What is the proposed reason for our fingers wrinkling when wet, according to Professor Tom Smulders and his team's research? A. It is an accidental phenomenon with no purpose. B. The wrinkles help enhance the sense of touch in water. C. The wrinkles improve our ability to hold and grip objects in wet conditions. D. Wrinkles are a sign of aging and have no real purpose.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the current name for Long Pond?  Ricketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber. One squatter, Jesse Dodson, cut trees from around 1830 to 1860 and built a mill and the dam for what became Lake Rose in...

It shook upper Manhattan for blocks -- and when it was over, a five-story apartment building and its neighbor were gone.  After Wednesday morning's deadly building explosion in East Harlem, squads of firefighters dug through piles of shattered bricks and beams. Ladder trucks sprayed water into the gap where the buildings once stood. As Detective Martin Speechly, a New York police spokesman, put it: \\"1644 Park Avenue appears not to be there anymore.\\"  Along with that five-story apartment building, with a Latino evangelical church on the first floor, a neighboring piano store and the four floors above it collapsed in the blast.  One nearby resident, Angelica Avila, told CNN she was trapped in her apartment down the block for a short time afterward. Her stepmother had to sneak in through the back to try and open the door for her, she said.  \\"My neighbors came banging on my door. I guess they were evacuating the building, and I couldn't get out -- my door was jammed,\\" she said. \\"Everything off my windowsill fell, and I guess the impact of the explosion jammed the door as well.\\"  Something similar happened to Aisha Watts, who had just returned to her apartment in one of the adjoining buildings after taking her children to school.

To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction.  But I can use this background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  What is an answer for this question: Would test C see higher or lower concentration of the reactants than test D? The answer is:","output":"Test C would see a lower concentration of reactants than Test D. Here's why: First, it's important to understand the core of Le Chatelier's principle. The principle explains how a system at equilibrium, when subjected to changes or 'stress,' will respond by trying to resist the change and restore equilibrium. Different kinds of 'stresses' such as changes in concentration of reactants or products, temperature, or pressure, can disrupt the chemical equilibrium. The system then reacts by shifting its equilibrium position to either favour the forward or the reverse reaction, depending on the type and direction of the stress applied.  Now, in the context of John's experiment, Tests C and D involve a system responding differently to disruptions to its equilibrium. In Test C, John observes a forward reaction. This means that the reaction has shifted towards the product side. In terms of Le Chatelier’s principle, this is the system's response to counteract some stress, and the result is that the reactants are being consumed to produce more products. Therefore, the concentration of reactants would decrease as they're consumed in the forward reaction, leading to an increase in the concentration of the products.  Conversely, in Test D, John observes a reverse reaction. In this case, the previously-formed products are being converted back into reactants. The system is again seeking to counteract some stress and regain equilibrium, but this time by minimizing the amount of products and increasing the amount of reactants. Therefore, in a reverse reaction, the concentration of products decrease, and the concentration of reactants increase.  So, when comparing Test C and Test D, the concentration of reactants after Test C, where the forward reaction is favored, would be lower than after Test D, where the reverse reaction is favored. The forward reaction consumes reactants, reducing their concentration, and the reverse reaction generates reactants, increasing their concentration. Thus, according to Le Chatelier's principle and the given descriptions of Tests C and D, Test C would see a lower concentration of reactants than Test D."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Tip the flour into the sieve, and patting the sides, gently sift it through to the bowl below.  Add the egg to the flour.","output":"After adding the egg to the flour, the next steps in making a Melton Mowbray pork pie are as follows: 1. Create a well in the center of the sifted flour and egg mixture. Using a fork or your fingers, make a small indentation in the middle of the flour to create a well. 2. Incorporate the lard or butter into the flour mixture. Cut in the cold lard or butter into small cubes and add to the flour mixture. Using either a pastry cutter, your fingertips, or two knives, rub the fat into the flour until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. A food processor can also make this process relatively quick and simple. 3. Prepare the hot water crust pastry. In a small saucepan, heat the water and lard or butter together until they reach a boil. Once boiling, carefully pour the hot liquid into the well in the flour mixture. 4. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until it starts to come together. As the boiling liquid is added, the pastry will begin to form. Continue to stir until a rough dough forms. 5. Once the dough is cool enough to handle, use your hands to knead it slightly until it becomes smooth and even. Avoid overworking the dough, as it should remain pliable and easy to handle. 6. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. During this time, the dough will cool down further and become easier to shape. 7. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and prepare the filling. Mix the coarsely ground pork, finely chopped onions, and seasonings such as salt, pepper, sage, and thyme in a large bowl. 8. Roll out two-thirds of the rested dough to create the base and sides of the pie. Use a pie tin or a round mold as a guide for cutting out a circle slightly larger than your tin. Gently press the dough circle into the bottom and sides of the tin. 9. Fill the pie with the prepared pork mixture, packing it tightly to minimize air gaps. Make sure the filling is evenly distributed. 10. Roll out the remaining dough and cut a circle for the top of the pie. Lay the circle on top of the filled pie and press the edges firmly together to seal. Trim any excess dough. 11. Cut a small hole in the center of the pie lid to allow steam to escape during baking. Optionally, decorate the pie with remaining dough scraps, creating patterns or shapes if desired. 12. Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg to create a golden and glossy finish. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown, and the filling is cooked through. 13. When finished baking, let the pie cool for a few minutes in the tin before removing it. Transfer the pie to a wire rack and allow it to cool completely. Once your Melton Mowbray pork pie has cooled, cut it into slices and enjoy either warm or cold. The pie can be stored in the refrigerator for up to four days or frozen for later consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate  better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality.

The premise suggests that the individual, presumably the person for whom this statement was made, would likely appreciate or value the various pleasant characteristics of the place in question, with specific emphasis on the swimming pool as a notable and enjoyable feature. Let's break down the premise into its three main components: 1. \\"Niceties\\" - This refers to the attractive or enjoyable aspects of the location, hinting at an overall positive environment or setting. 2. \\"Amenities\\" - This term refers to the convenient features or facilities provided at the location, which typically contribute to an individual's comfort, leisure, or well-being. 3. \\"You'd probably like the pool there\\" - This statement explicitly mentions an assumption that the individual would be drawn to or find enjoyment in the swimming pool at the location. Given these three components, it is reasonable to assume that the hypothesis \\"You would enjoy the swimming pool\\" is indeed true, as the premise itself highlights the swimming pool as an aspect that the individual is likely to find appealing within the context of the other positive aspects of the location. Essentially, this hypothesis is a reasonable conclusion to draw based on the information provided in the premise. Of course, it's important to consider that the premise is making an assumption about the generalized preferences of the individual. Personal tastes and preferences can vary, and while the statement suggests that the swimming pool is expected to be a source of enjoyment for the individual, there might be circumstances or factors that could impact the individual's experience, such as swimming pool functionality, cleanliness, or personal reasons (e.g., an inability to swim).

Question: The Doctor studied two teams of people. Team N had no viral infections, while Team W had many people with HIV among its members. Obviously, team N had fewer health issues.  Which team had fewer people receiving vaccinations for viral diseases?  Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it cannot be explicitly determined which team, Team N or Team W, had fewer people receiving vaccinations for viral diseases. However, we can make certain inferences and provide some context surrounding vaccinations and antiviral drugs. Vaccinations have been used for hundreds of years to prevent viral diseases. They work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight against specific viruses, thereby preventing infections or lessening their severity. Vaccinations usually target specific diseases, such as measles, mumps, and influenza. While vaccinations are an effective preventative measure for many viral diseases, they are not necessarily an indication of a team's overall health status. On the other hand, antiviral drugs, like interferon and antiretroviral therapy (ART), are medications specifically designed to treat viral infections. These medications have been developed more recently, particularly in response to the AIDS epidemic. Antiviral drugs can help manage the symptoms and progression of diseases caused by viral infections, such as HIV. In the context of the question, Team N had no viral infections and potentially fewer health issues compared to Team W. It is possible that Team N had a higher rate of vaccination for certain viral diseases, as this could have contributed to their lower prevalence of infections. However, this is not a guaranteed assumption, as other factors such as immunity and health behaviors could also play a role in their overall health. Team W, with many people suffering from HIV infections, would likely have a higher use of antiviral drugs, specifically ART, to manage their health. While it is possible that some members of Team W had also received vaccinations for other viral diseases, the information given does not allow us to definitively determine which team had fewer vaccinations. In summary, it is not possible to conclusively identify which team had fewer vaccinations for viral diseases based solely on the information provided. However, it can be inferred that Team W would have a higher use of antiviral drugs such as ART to manage their HIV infections, while Team N may have had a higher rate of vaccinations for certain viral diseases, although this is not a guaranteed conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the below context:  Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries \\"museum pieces\\". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvořák and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saëns and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the...

Hank would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare, but this proves impossible when Noah's newspaper posts a 50,000 reward to identify Hank, known only to the public as \\"John Christmas.\\" And there's something, very, very curious about that photo: It also shows a Santa Claus suit seemingly floating in midair without an occupant. That elusive \\"Santa\\" is of course the angelic Max, who pops up now and again throughout the story in a variety of guises to solve problems, dispense advice, tie up loose plot strands--and even share a musical duet with Kathleen's talented daughter Socorro (Jennifer Pisana).

London (CNN) -- Moments after Michael Adebolajo had nearly decapitated his victim, the British soldier Drummer Lee-Rigby, he turned to one of the numerous cameras trained on him and his accomplice Michael Adebowale, and said: \\"The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers. And this British soldier is one. It is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

In this case, they were trying to show that they were upset with British soldiers and wanted them to stop hurting Muslims.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. This week on The Big Three, we tackled the George W. Bush library opening, frustration over flight furloughs (complete with congressional finger-pointing) and Dean Obeidallah's CNN.com column, \\"I'm a Muslim and I hate terrorism,\\" which seems sadly necessary in the wake of Boston. The opening of a presidential library is supposed to be a time for national unity. All the living presidents attend, standing together for a photo op and offering complimentary speeches about the newest inductee to the ex-presidents' club. But during all the same pageantry in Dallas at the opening of Bush's library, a less civil debate on the Big Three (and across the country) was going on about 43's legacy. Margaret Hoover is a proud Bush administration alumna and attended the opening in Dallas. Dean, it is fair to say, is not a Bush fan. At all. And so the debate raged, with Margaret citing his investment in foreign aid to stem the tide of AIDS in Africa and keeping the nation safe from terrorism after the attacks of 9/11. Dean acknowledged that Bush might be a nice guy to hang out with but asked whether the library would consist primarily of coloring books. As the card-carrying centrist in the group, I try to find common ground. And so it goes. At the time of our discussions, the sequester cuts were kicking in, and airline travelers were feeling the pain, with 40% of flights delayed this week because of the furlough of air-traffic controllers. Congress has since overwhelmingly approved a measure to get the air travel system up to speed again after the delays provoked a round of the blame game on Capitol Hill, with conservatives accusing the president of \\"playing politics\\" with these particular cuts. Margaret agreed with this assessment. I ain't buying it. The sequester was supposed to be so dumb and painful that it would compel Congress to reason together and find deficit and debt reduction to more strategic means. It didn't. And while the rhetoric of cutting government spending is popular, the reality is predictably less so. And so we're being treated to the absurdity of conservative activist groups such as Americans for Prosperity -- whose sole purpose is to argue for cuts in government spending -- complaining about the practical effects of those very cuts on which they insisted. This is the old dynamic we see too much of -- cuts for thee but not for me. Finally, in the wake of the Boston terror attacks, America and the American Muslim community have navigated the tricky territory of confronting the ideology of radical Islam that apparently inspired the attacks without engaging in group blame. Dean's excellent CNN.com column tries to clarify some of the bigoted myths by making the point that American Muslims might hate jihadis even more than typical Americans do because the murderers claim to represent their faith and cause a massive backlash against this growing American community. Read the column -- and then listen to our conversation, tackling subjects such as why extremists of other faiths tend not to blow things up. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The Big Three discussions this week covered the George W.

The Bush library opening sparked debates about his legacy, with Margaret Hoover praising his efforts in foreign aid and securing the nation after 9/11, while Dean Obeidallah remained critical. Regarding flight furloughs, conservatives accused the president of playing politics with the sequester cuts, while others pointed out that the reality of cutting government spending is predictably unpopular. Finally, Dean's column addressed the need for understanding between Americans and the American Muslim community, emphasizing that American Muslims hate jihadis for misrepresenting their faith and causing backlash against their community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Holly crap this place actually exists. I must enter and EAT. ....Pull...PULL...the door is locked!!!! Damn Sundays!!!! I must return.  Well I finally made it Monday night. I surely hope the food lives up to my anticipation. I walk in to rather large dining room with the menu on the wall in the back.   As I gaze at the menu I see alligator sausage (mmmmm), crawfish, shrimp, andouille, catfish, and Po' Boys.  We started with the Gator Bites. Wonderful cornmeal breading fried and served with two sauces. This is actually the best deep fried pieces of gator I've had. Not even close to chewy.   The GF decided to get the BBQ shrimp and Andouille ( comes with 2 sides and salad ). She chose the Red Beans and Rice and the Sweet Potato Hush Puppies. This was a huge meal. Loaded with shrimp and andouille. This almost came as a gumbo with rice an excellent Cajun sauce that had the right amount of seasoning and heat. WOW this was a wonderful dish. The red beans and rice were awesome but the Sweet Potato Hush Puppies are where it's at. I do not know how I have lived my life for the past 23 yrs with out eating these. Our server said her mom came up with the recipe one day. OMG these are worth a trip there alone.   I got the Catfish plate ( comes with one side and a salad ), I chose the Jambalaya. The catfish brought back memories to the last time I was in New Orleans and I ate catfish at a restaurant right on the river with my great grandparents. It was fried perfectly with a wonderful cornmeal batter. The catfish basket had two huge filet's ( probably 8-9 in. each ). This was the best catfish I have had in a VERY long time. The Jambalaya was excellent as well.   This was a lot of food. We took home our salads and some of our entrees. I eat A LOT and I was full.   My whole family consists of Louisiana natives and some still live their. This food takes me right back. I cannot explain how authentic this is.   For those of you out there that want to try some great food hit this place up. They also have Seafood, Cold, and hot PO' Boys for those a little less adventurous.  They also have Bread pudding, Peach Cobbler, and Rocky Road Brownies for dessert ( I will be back to try all three!! ).","output":"The given review is positive.

Read this article and answer this question From the 1960s to the 1980s historians still considered 100,000 a reasonable estimate of the Jews killed and, according to Edward Flannery, many considered it \\"a minimum\\". Max Dimont in Jews, God, and History, first published in 1962, writes \\"Perhaps as many as 100,000 Jews perished in the decade of this revolution.\\"  Edward Flannery, writing in The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism, first published in 1965, also gives figures of 100,000 to 500,000, stating \\"Many historians consider the second figure exaggerated and the first a minimum\\". Martin Gilbert in his Jewish History Atlas published in 1976 states \\"Over 100,000 Jews were killed; many more were tortured or ill-treated, others fled ...\\" Many other sources of the time give similar figures. Although many modern sources still give estimates of Jews killed in the uprising at 100,000 or more, others put the numbers killed at between 40,000 and 100,000, and recent academic studies have argued fatalities were even lower. A 2003 study by Israeli demographer Shaul Stampfer of Hebrew University dedicated solely to the issue of Jewish casualties in the uprising concludes that 18,000-20,000 Jews were killed of a total population of 40,000. Paul Robert Magocsi states that Jewish chroniclers of the 17th century \\"provide invariably inflated figures with respect to the loss of life among the Jewish population of Ukraine. The numbers range from 60,000-80,000  to 100,000 , but that \\"he Israeli scholars Shmuel Ettinger and Bernard D. Weinryb speak instead of the 'annihilation of tens of thousands of Jewish lives', and the Ukrainian-American historian Jarowlaw Pelenski narrows the number of Jewish deaths to between 6,000 and 14,000\\".
