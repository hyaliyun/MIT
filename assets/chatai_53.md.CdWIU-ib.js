Part (a) ( text{(divisible by 2)} ) 1. Initially, the sum of all numbers written at the vertices of the cube is 1 (1 at one vertex and 0 at all others), which is an odd number. 2. Each operation allows us to add 1 to the numbers at both ends of any given edge. As a result, each operation increases the sum of all numbers by 2 (an even number). 3. Thus, after any number of operations, the sum will always be of the form (1 + 2n) where (n) is a non-negative integer, implying the sum remains odd. 4. For all numbers at the vertices to be even, their sum must also be even. Since the sum always remains odd, it is impossible for all the numbers to become even. **Conclusion**: It is not possible to achieve the condition where all numbers are divisible by 2.

Let's color the vertices of the cube in a checkerboard pattern such that one vertex (the initial vertex with number 1) is white, and its adjacent vertices are black, and their adjacent vertices are white, following through the cube. 2. Notice that any operation adds 1 to a white vertex and 1 to a black vertex. Consequently, every operation doesn't change the difference in the sum of the numbers between the white and black vertices. 3. Initially, the sum of numbers at white vertices is 1 (since only one white vertex has the number 1), and the sum at black vertices is 0. 4. Continuing this, we observe that after (k) operations, the difference between the sum of the numbers of white and black vertices remains 1. 5. Let us assume all numbers are eventually divisible by 3. Then, both the sum of the numbers on white vertices and black vertices should be divisible by 3. 6. If one sum is divisible by 3, the other sum must be ( equiv 1 pmod{3} ) due to the initial difference of 1. This, however, contradicts the requirement that both sums should be divisible by 3 simultaneously. **Conclusion**: It is not possible to achieve the condition where all numbers are divisible by 3.

We know that circumscribing both circles such as ( Gamma_1 ) and ( Gamma_2 ), mean they both share the same perpendicularity towards line segment ( AC ), even though the triangles are differently placed on these segments. 4. **Perpendicular Distance and Triangle properties:**     - Both triangles share similar properties in terms of their distances. For the circumcenter of ( triangle BDE ), it will similarly lie on ( AC ), given the equivalent perpendicular sections formed by ( AB parallel DE ). 5. **Common chord passing through (F):**     - By construction, points ( B, F ) and ( C ) follow:       [       angle BFC = 90^circ, quad B F perp AC       ]     - This ensures that ( F ) must be on the common chord of circumcircles (Gamma_1) and (Gamma_2) since the perpendicular bisector aligning them is consistent when intersected and thus passes through both shared circumcentral points. 6. **Validate ( A ) aligns not to midpoint by side criteria:**     - Using the distances:     - (AD = 2sqrt{Rr}) equality comes directly since constructing same tangents yield such as radii forms:     [     boxed{sqrt{(R+r)^2-(R-r)^2}} = A D=2sqrt{Rr}= A B ] # Conclusion: Thus, the common cord of ( triangle A B C ), and ( triangle B D E ) circumscribe aligns through ( F ). blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The subsets of the set {0, 1} are     , the total number of subsets of the set {a, b, c} is     , the number of nonempty subsets is     , and the number of proper subsets is     .","output":"The subsets of the set {0, 1} are:   emptyset, {0}, {1}, {0, 1}, totaling 4 subsets.

A convex function can intersect the x-axis at most twice unless it is identically zero over an interval. 4. **Constructing an Example with Two Solutions:**    Consider the case where:    [    a_1 = 1, quad a_2 = a_3 = cdots = a_{10} = -1    ]    and    [    b_1 = b_2 = cdots = b_{10} = -1    ]    Then the function becomes:    [    f(x) = max {x - 1, -x - 1}    ]    To find the solutions to (f(x) = 0), we solve:    [    max {x - 1, -x - 1} = 0    ]    This gives two equations:    [    x - 1 = 0 quad text{or} quad -x - 1 = 0    ]    Solving these, we get:    [    x = 1 quad text{or} quad x = -1    ]    Thus, (x = 1) and (x = -1) are the solutions. 5. **Proving No More Than Two Solutions:**    Suppose (f(x) = 0) has three distinct solutions (x_1 < x_2 < x_3). Since (f(x)) is convex, if it is zero at three points, it must be zero on the entire interval ([x_1, x_3]). This implies that one of the linear functions (a_ix + b_i) must be zero on ([x_1, x_3]), which would mean (a_i = 0), contradicting the given condition that all (a_i neq 0). Therefore, the maximum number of solutions is 2. The final answer is (boxed{2})"},{"instruction":"From an arbitrary point on the base of a regular pyramid, a perpendicular is erected.

From point (P), we draw a perpendicular to the plane of the base intersecting (V) at a point (H). Hence, (PH perp (ABCD)). 4. Let the perpendicular from (P) intersect the lateral faces (VAB), (VBC), (VCD), and (VDA) (or their extensions) at points (A_1), (B_1), (C_1), and (D_1) respectively. # Step 1: Observation from Properties of Regular Polygon - The solution uses the property that for a regular polygon (base (ABCD)) the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to its sides is a constant. - This property directly applies to our 3-dimensional case due to the symmetry and regularity of the base polygon. # Step 2: Sum of Perpendicular Distances to Lateral Faces - Since the sum of the perpendicular distances from an inside point to the sides of the base is constant in a regular polygon, this implies for our problem that the sum of the segments (PA_1 + PB_1 + PC_1 + PD_1) is also constant. # Conclusion: Hence, we have proven that the sum of the segments from the base of the perpendicular to their intersections with the lateral faces or their continuations is a constant value.

If f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty), then its derivative must be nonnegative for all x > 0, meaning that f'(x) geq 0 which implies a leq ln(x) + frac{1}{x} + 1. Since a must also be a positive real number, we have: a > 0, Let's define a new function g(x) = ln(x) + frac{1}{x} + 1 for x > 0, and find the minimum value of g(x) as it will give the upper bound for a. The derivative of g(x) is: g'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left[ln(x) + frac{1}{x} + 1right] = frac{x - 1}{x^2}. Setting g'(x) to zero to find the extremum point: frac{x - 1}{x^2} = 0 quad text{gives} quad x = 1. Analyzing g'(x), we find that it is negative when 0 < x < 1 and positive when x > 1, meaning that g(x) is decreasing on (0, 1) and increasing on (1, +infty). Therefore, g(x) has a minimum at x = 1, with: g_{min} = g(1) = ln(1) + frac{1}{1} + 1 = 2. Hence, the range for a is: 0 < a leq 2. So, we have boxed{0 < a leq 2}. (2) Consider f(1) = (1 + 1)ln(1) - a cdot 1 + a = 0. Given the domain (0, +infty), for 0 < x < 1, if f(x) is monotonically increasing, then f(x) < f(1) = 0. For x > 1, f(x) > f(1) = 0. This implies that (x-1)f(x) geq 0. If a > 2, consider a new function p(x) = xln(x) + (1 - a)x + 1, which represents the numerator of the derivative f'(x). Taking the derivative of p(x) we get: p'(x) = ln(x) + 2 - a, Setting p'(x) = 0 to find the extremum, we find that x = e^{a-2}. When x in (1, e^{a-2}), p(x) is decreasing. Thus, p(x) < p(1) = 2 - a < 0 because a > 2. Therefore, f'(x) is negative, and f(x) is decreasing in the interval (1, e^{a-2}) which gives f(x) < f(1) = 0.

Given that the perimeters of triangle BCE and triangle BC_1E are equal, it follows logically that point C must coincide with point C_1, because if C neq C_1, one triangle would have to lie inside the other, causing their perimeters to be unequal.

We'll follow these steps to solve the problem: 1. **Lemma Statement and Proof**:     We need to prove that among any five nodes of a triangular grid, there exist two such that the midpoint of the segment connecting them is also a node of the same grid.        - Consider a triangular grid of nodes ( { mlvec{a} + nlvec{b} |  m, n in mathbb{Z} } ), where ( vec{a} ) and ( vec{b} ) are basis vectors to the nearest nodes.    - According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if there are five points, there must be two points that share both the same parity (odd or even) for ( m ) and ( n ).    - The coordinates of these points can be written as ( vec{r_1} = m_1 lvec{a} + n_1 lvec{b} ) and ( vec{r_2} = m_2 lvec{a} + n_2 lvec{b} ) with both ( m_1 ) and ( m_2 ) having the same parity, and ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) having the same parity.    - The midpoint ( vec{M} ) of the segment connecting ( vec{r_1} ) and ( vec{r_2} ) is given by:      [      vec{M} = frac{(m_1 + m_2) l vec{a}}{2} + frac{(n_1 + n_2) l vec{b}}{2}      ]    - Since ( m_1 ) and ( m_2 ) have the same parity, ( m_1 + m_2 ) is even. Similarly, ( n_1 + n_2 ) is even. Hence, the terms ( frac{(m_1 + m_2)}{2} ) and ( frac{(n_1 + n_2)}{2} ) are integers.    - Therefore, the midpoint ( vec{M} ) is also a node of the triangular grid. 2. **Application to Hexagonal Grid**:        Apply the above lemma to the problem of nodes in a hexagonal grid (which can be decomposed into two triangular grids).        - Consider a drawing of the grid, which divides hexagons into two interleaved triangular grids.    - Using the Pigeonhole Principle, among any nine nodes, at least five must be in one of these triangular sub-grids.    - According to the lemma, five nodes in a triangular grid guarantee that there are two nodes such that the midpoint of the segment between them is also a node. 3. **Conclusion:**    Since we have shown that nine nodes are sufficient to guarantee the desired property in a hexagonal grid, the minimal number of nodes required is:    (boxed{9})"},{"instruction":"rained 0.9 inches on Monday.

Let's solve the first equation for P: P = 12 - Pe Now we can substitute this expression for P into the second equation: 1000(12 - Pe) + 1300Pe = 15,000 Expanding the equation, we get: 12,000 - 1000Pe + 1300Pe = 15,000 Combining like terms, we get: 300Pe = 15,000 - 12,000 300Pe = 3,000 Dividing both sides by 300, we find: Pe = 3,000 / 300 Pe = 10 Now that we know Pe (the number of pens), we can find P (the number of pencils) using the first equation: P = 12 - Pe P = 12 - 10 P = 2 So, you purchased boxed{2}  pencils."},{"instruction":"Given points E, F, G, H in space, let Proposition A be: Points E, F, G, H are not coplanar, and Proposition B be: Line EF and GH do not intersect.

What is the minimum number of questions required for the guesser to determine the original set of integers?","output":"Let us denote the set of unknown integers as ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ), where these integers can be either positive or negative single-digit numbers. Our goal is to determine this set with the minimum number of questions.  We will show that it is sufficient to ask just one question. Specifically, consider the sum: [ S = 100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + cdots + 100^n x_n ] Given this single sum ( S ), we can uniquely determine each ( x_i ).  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Formulating the Sum:**    Define the question by assigning coefficients ( a_i ) as follows:    [ a_1 = 100, quad a_2 = 100^2, quad ldots, quad a_n = 100^n ]    So that, the reported sum ( S ) is:    [ S = 100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + cdots + 100^n x_n ] 2. **Analyzing the Relationship:**    Divide the sum by ( 100^n ):    [ frac{S}{100^n} = frac{100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + cdots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1}}{100^n} + x_n ] 3. **Bounding the Fraction:**    We need to show:    [ left| frac{100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + cdots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1}}{100^n} right| < frac{1}{10} ] 4. **Estimating the Magnitude:**    Let's bound the numerator. Since ( x_i ) are single-digit numbers (either positive or negative), the absolute value of each ( x_i ) is at most 9. Hence,    [ left| 100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + cdots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1} right| leq 100 cdot |x_1| + 100^2 cdot |x_2| + cdots + 100^{n-1} cdot |x_{n-1}| leq 9 (100 + 100^2 + cdots + 100^{n-1}) ] 5. **Summing the Series:**    The geometric series sum ( 100 + 100^2 + cdots + 100^{n-1} ) can be simplified as:    [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 100^k = 100 frac{100^{n-1} - 1}{100 - 1} = frac{100(100^{n-1} - 1)}{99} ]    Therefore, the expression becomes:    [ left|100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + cdots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1} right| leq 9 cdot frac{100(100^{n-1} - 1)}{99} ] 6. **Comparing with Denominator:**    This leads to:    [ left| frac{100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + cdots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1}}{100^n} right| < frac{9 cdot frac{100^{n}}{99}}{100^n} = frac{9}{99} = frac{1}{11} < frac{1}{10} ] 7. **Concluding the Uniqueness:**    Since the fractional part:    [ left| frac{S_k}{100^k} right| ]    is strictly less than 0.1, it means ( x_n ) can be determined by the integer part of ( frac{S}{100^n} ). Once ( x_n ) is determined, we can subtract ( 100^n x_n ) from ( S ) and iteratively find each ( x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}, ldots, x_1 ) by similar divisions and subtractions.

(2) Let's consider the function f(x) = a^{x-1} for xgeq0. We analyze two separate cases based on the value of a: For 0 < a < 1: The function a^{x-1} will decrease as x increases. Since xgeq0, the minimum exponent we can have is -1 when x=0. Therefore, the smallest value of f(x) will be a^{-1}. As x gets larger, the value of f(x) approaches 0 but never actually reaches 0. Hence, the range in this case is (0, a^{-1}]. For a > 1: The function a^{x-1} will increase as x increases. Similarly, the smallest exponent is -1, so the smallest value of f(x) is still a^{-1}. But as x gets larger, f(x) increases without bounds. Therefore, the range in this case is [a^{-1}, +infty). To summarize: If 0 < a < 1, the range of f(x) is (0, frac{1}{a}].   If a > 1, the range of f(x) is [frac{1}{a}, +infty). With the calculated value of a from part (1), a = frac{1}{2}, which is less than 1, so we apply the first case.

From g(x)=sqrt{2}sin 2x, we infer that frac{π}{4}+φ=0, which implies φ=-frac{π}{4}. Hence, the function is f(x)=sqrt{2}sin(2x-frac{π}{4}).

This implies (k = 1), giving us:    [    x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0    ]    [    (x - 1)^2 = 0    ]    [    x = 1    ]    Therefore, the only solution is (x = 1), (y = 1), (z = 2).

We know that the number, when diminished by 20, is divisible by 15, 30, and 45. Let's call the smallest number X. X - 20 is divisible by 15, 30, and 45. The least common multiple (LCM) of 15, 30, and 45 will give us the smallest number that is divisible by all three numbers.  The prime factors of these numbers are: - 15 = 3 × 5 - 30 = 2 × 3 × 5 - 45 = 3^2 × 5 The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in the numbers: LCM = 2 × 3^2 × 5 = 2 × 9 × 5 = 90 So, X - 20 must be a multiple of 90.

According to the problem's constraints, we must have three consecutive vertices in this row labeled with exactly three distinct letters, say ( a, b, c ).     - If not, some composed squares would contain a duplicate letter. 5. Once we choose ( a, b, ) and ( c ) as labels for three vertices, a corresponding fourth letter ( d ) must appear in some square touching the current vertex labels to fulfill the condition. 6. Let's look at a specific arrangement within the row:     - Suppose the vertices in one square were labeled ( a, b, c, ) and supposedly ( d ) must appear as the fourth label.    - Trying to maintain an arrangement where all four letters ( a, b, c,) and ( d ) distribute uniquely under the specified constraints leads to a contradiction as each row would require at least one missing letter to keep the unique placement, violating the given condition. 7. By extending this logic, observe squares below this row (considering a middle row from the grid), the constraint imposes a labeling pattern which continuously asks for labels to reappear or miss some rows or columns: 8. Under careful breakdown:    - The vertices below any set labeled ( a, b, c ) would force a repetition or gaps, where only ( c,d,a ) can be reassigned, contradicting the needed uniformity. Diagram Reference: (Not a detailed reproduction but refer to a grid example where labeling denotes discrepancy while validating constraints specifically for geometric proof from references like Shklyarskii, Chebotarev, Ya G.-lyar). Conclusion:     Due to the unavoidable contradiction and imposed repetition requirements defying the uniform rule: There does not exist such a labeling of the vertices of the grid that satisfies all the conditions set forth in the problem. Therefore, the given task of vertex labeling, such that each square formed in the grid contains all four distinct letters at its vertices, and every row and column mention all four letters uniquely, is impossible.

By cubing consecutive negative odd numbers, and possibly some positive odd numbers, we aim to reach a total of -1331.   Adding subsequent cubes (starting from -1 because it is odd):   [   (-1)^3 + (-3)^3 + (-5)^3 + (-7)^3 + (-9)^3 + (-11)^3 = -1 - 27 - 125 - 343 - 729 - 1331 = -2526   ]   We passed -1331 on adding (-1)^3 to (-9)^3, which sums to -1225. Adding (-11)^3 gives a total of -2552. This approach went overshot, but clearly, summing up to -11 includes unwanted terms.   **Finding Correct Combination**:   When summing cubes up to (-11)^3, we have too many values. Yet, if we only count up to (-9)^3:   [   (-1)^3 + (-3)^3 + (-5)^3 + (-7)^3 + (-9)^3 = -1 - 27 - 125 - 343 - 729 = -1225   ]   Further adding the next numbers:   [   (-11)^3 = -1331   ]   gives us the desired sum of cubes.  - **Number of Terms**:   The terms used are -11, -9, -7, -5, -3, -1.

The midpoint of an edge can be denoted as follows:    - Let (M_{AB}) be the midpoint of edge (AB).    - Let (M_{CD}) be the midpoint of edge (CD).    - Similarly, denote the midpoints of the other edges. 2. **Points of Intersection**:    - Consider the plane passing through edge (AB) and parallel to the line (NM_{CD}).     - Similarly, consider the planes through (BC) (parallel to (NM_{AD})), (CD) (parallel to (NM_{AB})), and so forth. 3. **Symmetry Argument**:    The key idea here is to use the concept of symmetry. If we reflect point (N) across the centroid (G) of the tetrahedron, the planes we defined correspond to specific symmetries.    - The centroid (G) of a tetrahedron divides each median in the ratio (3:1). It follows that (G) is the common intersection of all medians.    - Let (N') be the point symmetric to (N) with respect to (G). Since each plane is defined relative to lines connecting (N), midpoints, and tetrahedron edges, we translate their significance in relation to (G).     4. **Plane Intersection Calculation**:    - Take any two planes (say one through edge (AB) and another through edge (CD)). Each plane is associated with a \\"Fano-like\\" geometry, intersecting at the median lines. This implies they intersect in the symmetry context at a line coming through (G).    - Step by step, each symmetry line (NM_{edge}) relates directly to these properties and system articulations, establishing the planes overlap axes in the 3D shared region at centroid-leads. 5. **Conclusion**:    Finally, given the nature of symmetrical arrangement, the collection of six planes intersect in a single symmetrically relevant point (for the centroid). Thus, we proved that the six planes through specific tetrahedral edges and parallel constructs passed from centroid-associated points all indeed intersect at a single point: [ boxed{G} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the absolute value equation in terms of x, 2||x1|3|=a has only three solutions, then a=______.","output":"Given the absolute value equation in terms of x, 2||x-1|-3|=a, we want to find the value of a for which there are only three solutions.

This implies two separate equations:    [    f(x) = 1 quad text{and} quad f(x) = -1    ] 6. Now, analyze the number of solutions for each equation:    - Since (f(x) = 0) has one solution,    - (f(x) = -2) has no solution,    - (f(x) = 2) has two solutions. 7. From the behavior of polynomial (f(x)) and knowing the pattern of roots, we can deduce:    - The equation (f(x) = 1) should have exactly two solutions,    - The equation (f(x) = -1) should have no solutions,     8. Therefore, the total number of solutions for the equation ((f(x))^2 = 1) is (2).

Since overrightarrow{O{Z}_{1}} lies on the positive y-axis, cos(theta+15^{circ})=0 and sin(theta+15^{circ})=1. 3.

It is allowed to add to any number the greatest common divisor of its two neighboring numbers. Prove that it is possible, with the help of such operations, to make all the numbers pairwise coprime.","output":"Consider the given problem statement and note it is asking to demonstrate that a set of 100 integers arranged in a circle can be transformed such that any two adjacent integers are coprime. 1. We start by defining the given integers and their properties. Let a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100} be the 100 integers we're working with. Since they are arranged in a circle, we have a_{101} = a_1, a_{102} = a_2, and so on. In general, we have a_{n+100} = a_n for all integers n. 2. Next, we use a function to denote the greatest common divisor (gcd). Let (a, b) represent the gcd of integers a and b. 3. Our objective is to prove that we can modify any integer a_i by adding the gcd of its two adjacent neighbors, a_{i-1} and a_{i+1}, repeatedly, such that all integers become pairwise coprime. 4. We start with specific integers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n, and suppose d = (a_i, a_j) is their gcd. There must exist a multiple of any integers among a_i's that is greater than a_1. Let this be la_2 cdots a_n. Define a natural number k such that for any i = 2, 3, ldots, n, we have:    [    (a_1 + kd, a_i) leq d    ] 5. We'll demonstrate this by considering there exists a multiple greater than the least common multiple (LCM) of numbers including a_1. Let’s assume it to be la_2 a_3 cdots a_n. Thus, for a suitable choice of k, we have:    [    a_1 + kd > la_2 a_3 cdots a_n    ]    Let the smallest such k be k_0 and consider a_1' = a_1 + k_0d. Therefore, 0 < a_1' - la_2 a_3 cdots a_n leq d, making (a_1', a_i) leq d for all i. 6. Now, consider the gcd of each pair of adjacent numbers in the set a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{100}, and denote the maximum gcd among these pairs as M. We need to show that by using the allowed operation (adding the gcd of two neighbors), all pairs can be transformed such that their gcd is less than M. 7. Since a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{100} are relatively prime in pairs, we can find two consecutive numbers a_i and a_{i+1} where one is divisible by M but the other is not. Let d = (a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) < M. We can then apply the operation to a_i, that is a_i rightarrow a_i + kd, such that the new a_i' results in:    [    0 < a_i' - la_{i-1} a_{i+1} leq d    ]    ensuring (a_i', a_j) leq d for all j. 8. After each such operation, the gcd of every pair involving a_i will reduce, and the new gcds will remain less than M. By continually applying this operation, all gcds can be reduced until they are less than or equal to 1. 9. Repeating these steps systematically ensures that eventually, all pairs of adjacent integers become coprime by the repeated application of the transformative operations from the gcd of their neighbors. Therefore, it is demonstrated that we can convert the set a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100} so that any two adjacent numbers are coprime, fulfilling the problem's requirement. Hence the transformation to make all numbers pairwise coprime is always possible. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given that sinx + cosx = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, find the value of sin^4x + cos^4x.

This implies that the minimum value of the expression e^{λx} - frac{ln{x}}{lambda} should be greater than or equal to zero. Let's define a function f(x) = e^{λx} - frac{ln{x}}{lambda} for x > 0. Taking the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, we have f'(x) = lambda e^{λx} - frac{1}{lambda x}. Setting f'(x) = 0, we get e^{λx} = frac{1}{lambda^2 x}. From the graph of exponential function y = e^{λx} and the reciprocal function y = frac{1}{lambda^2 x} in the first quadrant, we can see that they intersect at exactly one point, say (m, n). It can be observed that when x > m, f'(x) > 0 and f(x) is increasing, while for 0 < x < m, f'(x) < 0 and f(x) is decreasing. Thus, f(x) attains its minimum value at x = m, and we have e^{λm} = frac{1}{lambda^2 m}. Solving for m and lambda by setting e^{λm} - frac{1}{lambda^2 m} = 0 gives us m = e and lambda = frac{1}{e}. Hence, the inequality e^{λx} - frac{ln{x}}{lambda} geq 0 holds true when lambda geq frac{1}{e}. The minimum possible value for lambda is boxed{frac{1}{e}}. Alternative solution: Since y = e^{λx} and y = frac{ln{x}}{lambda} are inverse functions of each other, their graphs are symmetric about the line y = x. Considering the limiting case, the line y = x will be the common tangent to both curves. The slope of this tangent is given by k = 1. Using derivatives to find the slope of the tangent, we get k = frac{1}{lambda e}.

Let's denote the number of candies in these as ( x), ( y), and ( z ) where ( x < y < z ).    Assuming ( z ) is at most 15 (because any package larger would minimize the sum exceeding 50), the next smallest integers would be 14 and 13. So:    [    x + y + z leq 16 + 17 + 18 = 51 > 50    ]    This also confirms that z (largest) must be (leq 15). 4. Removing the three smallest and three largest packages we get:    [    115 - 20 - 50 = 45    ]    These 45 candies are distributed among the remaining ( n-6 ) packages. These packages will have different counts ranging from 9 to 14 candies to sum up correctly. By analysis, these can optimally be allocated into four packages. 5. Considering the calculated middle packages and their sums, we have;    [    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 9 + 11 + 12 + 13 = 45    ] 6. Since there are packages numbered 4th from either end with less than or equal to 9 candies and more than 5;    [    sum_{a, a+1, a+2} leq 20 Rightarrow 5 leq a leq 7    ]      Thus, 20 - 8 - 7 = 5 candies are the lowest possibilities for the smallest package. # Conclusion: The number of packages is 10, and the smallest package contains 5 candies.

This simplifies to: frac {1}{a_{n+1}} - 2 = frac {1}{3}left(frac {1}{a_n} - 2right). Hence, the sequence left{frac {1}{a_n}-2right} is a geometric sequence with the first term frac {1}{3} and the common ratio frac {1}{3}. Therefore, we have: frac {1}{a_n} - 2 = left(frac {1}{3}right)^n. From this, the general term formula for {a_n} can be deduced as: a_n = boxed{frac {3^n}{2 times 3^n + 1}}, text{ for } n in mathbb{N}^*.

Multiplying by frac {1}{3}, we have: frac {1}{3}T_n = sum_{k=1}^{n} k cdot left(frac {1}{3}right)^{k+1}. Subtracting the two expressions, we get: frac {2}{3}T_n = left(frac {1}{3} + left(frac {1}{3}right)^2 + ldots + left(frac {1}{3}right)^nright) - n cdot left(frac {1}{3}right)^{n+1}. This can be simplified to: frac {2}{3}T_n = frac {1}{2} left(1 - left(frac {1}{3}right)^nright) - n cdot left(frac {1}{3}right)^{n+1}. Therefore, we have: T_n = boxed{frac {3}{4} - frac {3 + 2n}{4 times 3^n}}. Additionally, the sum of the first n even natural numbers is: 2 + 4 + ldots + 2n = n^2 + n.

Next, choose 3 boys from 5, which can be done in C_{5}^{3} ways. Finally, arrange all 5 chosen people, which can be done in A_{5}^{5} ways. According to the counting principle, there are a total of C_{3}^{2} C_{5}^{3} A_{5}^{5}=3600 arrangements. (2) Since the parabola passes through the origin, we have c=0, so there is only 1 way to choose c. When the vertex is in the first quadrant, the parabola opens downward and the axis of symmetry is to the right of the y-axis, so a < 0 and b > 0. Therefore, a can be chosen from {-1, -2, -3}, giving 3 possibilities, and b can be chosen from {1, 2, 3, 4}, giving 4 possibilities. This yields a total of 3times4=12 parabolas. When the vertex is in the third quadrant, the parabola opens upward and the axis of symmetry is to the left of the y-axis, so a > 0 and b < 0. Thus, both a and b must be chosen from {1, 2, 3, 4}, and since a and b are different, there are A_{4}^{2} possibilities. This yields a total of A_{4}^{2} parabolas.

Given that the cost price of red bean zongzi is 10 yuan cheaper per box than that of pork zongzi, we can express the cost price per box of red bean zongzi as (a - 10) yuan. Given that the merchant purchased the same number of boxes of pork zongzi for 8000 yuan and red bean zongzi for 6000 yuan, we can set up the following equation based on the ratio of total cost to cost per box for each type of zongzi: [ frac{8000}{a} = frac{6000}{a - 10} ] To solve for a, we cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions: [ 8000(a - 10) = 6000a ] Expanding both sides gives: [ 8000a - 80000 = 6000a ] Subtracting 6000a from both sides to get all the a terms on one side: [ 2000a = 80000 ] Dividing both sides by 2000 to solve for a: [ a = 40 ] Thus, the cost price per box of pork zongzi is 40 yuan. To find the cost price per box of red bean zongzi, we substitute a = 40 into the expression for the cost price of red bean zongzi: [ a - 10 = 40 - 10 = 30 ] Therefore, the cost price per box of red bean zongzi is 30 yuan.

How long does it take for the train to cross the signal pole?","output":"To find out how long it takes for the train to cross a signal pole, we need to determine the speed of the train first. We can do this by using the information given about the time it takes to cross the platform. The total distance covered by the train when it crosses the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform. So, the total distance is: 300 m (length of the train) + 1162.5 m (length of the platform) = 1462.5 m We are given that the train crosses this distance in 39 seconds. To find the speed of the train, we use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time Plugging in the values we have: Speed = 1462.5 m / 39 s ≈ 37.5 m/s Now that we have the speed of the train, we can find out how long it takes to cross a signal pole. When the train crosses a signal pole, the distance it covers is equal to the length of the train, which is 300 m.

Hence, HC equals half the length of the hypotenuse AC,      [      HC = frac{1}{2} CH = frac{1}{2} AC      ]    so HC = CD because CD = frac{1}{2} AC. 4. **Analyze triangle HCD:**    - Since HC = CD, triangle HCD is isosceles.    - Therefore, the angles opposite these sides are equal,       [      angle HDC = angle HCD      ]    - With angle HCG = 180^circ - 60^circ = 120^circ, we have      [      angle HDC = angle HCD = frac{1}{2} (180^circ - 120^circ) = frac{1}{2} cdot 60^circ = 30^circ      ] 5. **Determine angle BDC:**    - Since B, H, D lie on a straight line extending the triangle's height at point H,    [    angle BDC = 180^circ - angle HDC - angle HBD    ]    - With angle HBD = angle ABC = 45^circ and angle HDC = 30^circ, we have:      [      angle BDC = 180^circ - 30^circ - 45^circ = 105^circ      ] 6. **Verify calculation for angle BDC:**    - Using property of straight line,      [      angle HDB + angle BDC = 180^circ      ] Thus, by definition, [  angle BDC = 45^circ  ] Hence, the final angle angle BDC is: [  boxed{45^circ}  ]"},{"instruction":"While playing a trivia game, George answered some questions correct in the first half and 4 questions correct in the second half.

Thus, it is indeed impossible to separate all the 64 points using just 13 straight lines that do not pass through any of these points.

We consider differences as follows:    [    3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3    ] 6. **Calculating the Digits**:    - Start with the first digit 9.    - Subtract the first difference (3) to get the next digit: ( 9 - 3 = 6 )    - Subtract the second difference (2) to get the next digit: ( 6 - 2 = 4 )    - Subtract the third difference (1) to get the next digit: ( 4 - 1 = 3 )    - The next difference is 0, so the digit remains the same: ( 3 - 0 = 3 )    - Add the next difference (-1) to get the next digit: ( 3 + 1 = 4 )    - Add the next difference (-2) to get the next digit: ( 4 + 2 = 6 )    - Add the next difference (-3) to get the last digit: ( 6 + 3 = 9 )    Hence, the sequence of digits is: 9, 6, 4, 3, 3, 4, 6, 9. 7. **Conclusion**:    The largest interesting number satisfying the condition is ( 96433469 ).

Prove that in any 2coloring of the edges of G , there is a connected subgraph with at least δ(G) +1 points, all edges of which are of the same color.","output":"1. **Define the problem and assumptions:**    Let ( G ) be a simple graph with ( n ) vertices and minimum degree ( delta(G) geq frac{3n}{4} ). We need to prove that in any 2-coloring of the edges of ( G ), there exists a connected subgraph with at least ( delta(G) + 1 ) vertices, all of whose edges are of the same color. 2. **Introduce the two colors:**    Let the two colors used to color the edges be red and blue. Assume that the red-colored edges do not contain a spanning tree. This implies that the vertex set ( V ) can be partitioned into two non-empty sets ( A ) and ( B ) such that all edges between ( A ) and ( B ) are blue. 3. **Partition the vertex set:**    Let ( A ) and ( B ) be such that ( |A| leq |B| ). Thus, ( |A| leq frac{n}{2} ). Let ( v ) be a vertex in ( A ). 4. **Claim: All neighbors of ( v ) are accessible from ( v ) by walking on blue edges.**    - **Proof of the claim:**      - Since ( v ) and its neighboring vertices have degree at least ( delta(G) ), they form a blue connected subgraph.      - For neighbors in ( B ), the statement is obvious because all edges between ( A ) and ( B ) are blue.      - Let ( v' ) be a neighbor in ( A ). Each vertex in ( A ) has at least ( delta(G) ) neighbors, of which at least ( delta(G) - |A| + 1 ) fall in ( B ). The neighbors in ( B ) are all connected by blue edges.      - The neighbors of the vertices ( v ) and ( v' ) in ( B ) cannot be disjoint. This is because:        [        (delta(G) - |A| + 1) + (delta(G) - |A| + 1) = 2delta(G) - 2|A| + 2 geq n - |A| + 2 geq |B|        ]      - The existence of a common neighbor of ( v ) and ( v' ) in ( B ) ensures that ( v ) and ( v' ) are connected by blue edges. 5. **Conclusion:**    - The proof shows that all neighbors of ( v ) and all vertices of ( A ) are connected by blue edges.    - Since ( delta(G) geq frac{3n}{4} ), we have ( delta(G) + 1 geq frac{3n}{4} + 1 ).    - Therefore, there exists a connected subgraph with at least ( delta(G) + 1 ) vertices, all of whose edges are blue.

The (l)-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by (ax^2 + bx + c) is (-frac{b}{2a}).

For New Year, everyone sent postcards to all their friends. What is the maximum number of postcards that could have been sent?","output":"1. Let's denote the number of students at Slytherin House in Hogwarts as ( n = 30 ). 2. Assume some students are friends, and friendship is mutual. The problem states that no three persons are pairwise friends, meaning there's no triangle in the friendship graph. 3. To find the maximum number of greetings (postcards) sent, let's analyze the properties of the graph formed by friendships.  4. Let's assume that the student with the most friends, say ( x ), has ( 15 + a ) friends (since having more than half of 30 students being friends with one person contradicts the zero-triangle condition due to the Pigeonhole Principle). 5. We start by selecting the groups based on the friendship properties:    - The first group consists of these ( 15 + a ) friends of ( x ). None of these ( 15 + a ) persons can be friends with each other (otherwise, it would form a triangle).    - The remaining ( 30 - (15 + a) = 15 - a ) students form the second group. 6. Since no student in each group can be friends with another student from the same group, students in each group can only be friends with students in the other group. 7. Every student in both groups will have at most ( 15 - a ) friendships if ( a ) is positive and ( 15 + a ) friendships if ( a ) is negative. 8. Calculate the number of postcards sent within these groups:    - Each of the ( 15 + a ) students can have ( 15 - a ) friends.    - Each of the ( 15 - a ) students can have ( 15 + a ) friends.    - Total greetings by the students in group 1: ( (15 + a) times (15 - a) )    - Total greetings by the students in group 2: ( (15 - a) times (15 + a) ) 9. Summing these together, due to symmetry:    [    (15 + a) times (15 - a) + (15 - a) times (15 + a) = 2 times (225 - a^2)    ] 10. This simplifies to:    [    450 - 2a^2    ] 11. Since ( a ) cannot cause a drop below zero friends, thus limiting the greetings:    [    450 - 2a^2 leq 450    ] 12. The maximum possible value occurs when ( a = 0 ), meaning each student sends 450 postcards under optimal condition. 13. We see no ( a^2 ) term can take away from 450 since ( a^2 geq 0 ). 14.

We can plot a curve with the quantity of yeast and time as the axes to understand the changes in the yeast population. (2) Using a hemocytometer for direct counting under a microscope is a common cell counting method. This method can directly determine the total number of cells in a sample, so it is generally used for counting the number of single-cell microorganisms.

Given their x-coordinates, we have:     [    A_n left(frac{n}{n+1}, frac{n+1}{n}right), quad B_nleft(frac{n+1}{n}, frac{n}{n+1}right)    ]     2. The coordinates of point M are (1,1). 3. We compute the distances |MA_n| and |MB_n|. The distance |MA_n| is given by:    [    |MA_n| = sqrt{left(1 - frac{n}{n+1}right)^2 + left(1 - frac{n+1}{n}right)^2}    ]    Simplifying inside the square root:    [    1 - frac{n}{n+1} = frac{1}{n+1}, quad 1 - frac{n+1}{n} = frac{1}{n}    ]    Therefore:    [    |MA_n| = sqrt{left(frac{1}{n+1}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{n}right)^2}    ]    The same distance applies to |MB_n| since MB_n involves the same expressions:    [    |MB_n| = sqrt{left(frac{1}{n+1}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{n}right)^2}    ] 4. Since |MA_n| = |MB_n|, triangle M A_n B_n is an isosceles triangle.  5. Next, we calculate the slope K_{A_nB_n}:    [    K_{A_nB_n} = frac{frac{n}{n+1} - frac{n+1}{n}}{frac{n+1}{n} - frac{n}{n+1}} = -1    ]    This indicates that the line segment A_nB_n is the perpendicular bisector. 6. The midpoint E of A_nM is given as:    [    Eleft(frac{1 + frac{n}{n+1}}{2}, frac{1 + frac{n+1}{n}}{2}right) = left(frac{2n+1}{2(n+1)}, frac{2n+1}{2n}right)    ] 7. The slope K_{A_nM} is calculated as:    [    K_{A_nM} = frac{frac{n+1}{n} - 1}{frac{n}{n+1} - 1} = -frac{n+1}{n}    ] 8. Point P_n lies on the perpendicular through E to A_nM and the perpendicular is given by:    [    y - frac{2n+1}{2n} = frac{n}{n+1}left(x - frac{2n+1}{2(n+1)}right)    ] 9. Solving for y=x, we set up the following equation for x_n:    [    x_n - frac{2n+1}{2n} = frac{n}{n+1}left(x_n - frac{2n+1}{2(n+1)}right)    ] 10. Solving the equation:    [    frac{n+1}{n}(x_n - frac{2n+1}{2n}) = x_n - frac{2n+1}{2(n+1)}    ]    Simplifying further,     [    frac{(2n+1)^2}{2n(n+1)} = x_n    ] 11.

Let's denote the sequence by (a, b, c, d, e) where (a, b, c, d, e) are any permutation of the set ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}). Given the conditions: 1. (c = a + b) or (c = |a - b|) 2.

Hence, (5) is either (a) or (e). 2. **Case 1: Number 5 at First Position**:    - If (a = 5):      - (c) must be (5 pm b), but given the range of permissible values, (c) can only be reduced significantly if (b = 4) (since 5 - 4 = 1).      - Thus, (a = 5), (b = 4), (c = 1).      - Continuing:        - If (d = b + c = 4 + 1 = 5), not possible as 5 is already used.        - Thus (d = 4 - 1 = 3).        - Finally, (e = 1 + 3 = 4) or (e = |3 - 1| = 2). So, the sequences can be:    - (5, 4, 1, 3, 2) (valid)    - Also verify in permutations positions. 3. **Case 2: Number 5 at Last Position**:    - If (e = 5):      - Working backwards, (d + c = 5) or (|d - c| = 5):        - If (5 = d + c), possibilities must evaluate valid values within 1 to 4 and fixed permutation.      - Proceeding similar detailed evaluations demonstrate how positions fit in distictive sums as pairs.

Counting through the ages, we find that both the 6th and 7th members are 14 years old. Therefore, the median is frac{14 + 14}{2} = 14. This indicates that statement C, which claims the median is 13, is incorrect. **Mean**: The mean is the average of all the values in a data set. To find the mean age, we calculate the sum of all the ages and divide by the number of team members. The total sum of the ages is (12 times 1) + (13 times 3) + (14 times 4) + (15 times 2) + (16 times 2) = 12 + 39 + 56 + 30 + 32 = 169. The number of team members is 12. Thus, the mean age is frac{169}{12} approx 14.08. This shows that statement D, which claims the mean is 14, is incorrect.

We are asked to find P(2 < X < 4). First, let's understand the properties of a normal distribution. A normal distribution is symmetric around its mean. For Xsim N(2,sigma^2), the mean mu = 2, which means the distribution is symmetric around x=2. Given P(X < 4)=0.8, we can infer that P(X > 2) is the probability of X being greater than the mean, which due to symmetry, is 0.5 because the total area under the curve is 1, and the distribution is symmetric around the mean. Therefore, P(X > 2) = 0.5. Now, to find P(2 < X < 4), we can use the symmetry of the normal distribution. Since P(X < 4) = 0.8 includes all the area to the left of x=4, and we know half of this area (from x=2 to x=4) due to symmetry, we can calculate the desired probability as follows: - The total area to the left of x=4 is 0.8, which includes the area from -infty to 2 and the area from 2 to 4. - Since the distribution is symmetric and P(X > 2) = 0.5, the area from 2 to 4 is half of the area to the left of x=4 minus the area to the left of x=2. - Therefore, P(2 < X < 4) = P(X < 4) - P(X > 2) = 0.8 - 0.5 = 0.3.

How many different arrangements are possible? (Answer with a number)","output":"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Since there are 5 classes and 4 factories, and each factory must host at least one class, we can consider the problem as distributing 5 identical objects (classes) into 4 distinct boxes (factories) with no box empty. This is equivalent to solving the equation x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 5 under the condition that x_i geq 1 for i=1,2,3,4, where x_i represents the number of classes assigned to the i-th factory. The solution to this problem can be found by using the method of stars and bars, which gives us the number of ways to distribute n identical items into k different groups, with each group getting at least one item, as binom{n-1}{k-1}. However, in this case, since the objects (classes) are identical and the boxes (factories) are distinct, and we need to ensure that no factory is left empty, we use a slightly modified approach. We first assign one class to each factory to ensure that each factory has at least one class. This leaves us with 1 class to distribute freely among the 4 factories. The number of ways to distribute this remaining class among the 4 factories is simply the number of ways to choose 1 out of 4, which is binom{4}{1} = 4. But, this straightforward calculation does not account for the different permutations of distributing the initial 4 classes among the 4 factories, which also matters since the classes are considered identical in this context, but the factories are distinct.  The correct approach is to use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets, and then multiply by k! to account for the permutations of these subsets (factories in our case). For our problem, this translates to finding the number of partitions of 5 classes into 4 non-empty groups (factories), which is a problem of distributing 5 identical items into 4 distinct boxes with no box empty. This is a classic problem in combinatorial mathematics, and the solution involves a bit more than the simple binomial coefficient calculation mentioned earlier. The correct calculation involves considering the different ways to achieve this distribution, taking into account the constraint that each factory must have at least one class. This can be done by considering the partitions of 5 that include 4 parts, which are essentially the ways to add up to 5 with 4 positive integers, considering that each integer represents the number of classes in a factory.

To find the polar equation of the curve C_1: begin{cases} x=1+costheta  y=sinthetaend{cases}, we eliminate the parameter theta to get the Cartesian equation by using Pythagorean identity for sine and cosine: (x-1)^{2}+y^{2}=1. Expanding this, we obtain x^{2}+y^{2}-2x=0. Converting it to polar coordinates gives rho^2 - 2rhocostheta = 0, which simplifies to boxed{rho=2costheta}. The point of intersection P between C_1 and the positive x-axis occurs when y=0 and x=2. Hence, point P has coordinates (2, 0). The tangent line to a circle at a point on the circumference is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Since P lies on the x-axis, the tangent line should have the equation x=2. Therefore, the polar equation of this tangent line is boxed{rhocostheta = 2}. 2. The curve C_2 given by rhocostheta+rhosintheta+3=0 in polar coordinates can be transformed into Cartesian coordinates as x+y+3=0. The distance d from the center of C_1, which is (1, 0), to this line is calculated using the point-to-line distance formula, giving d = frac{|1*1 + 0*(-1) + 3|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = 2sqrt{2}.

The distance from the center to a corner of a square at position ( (i, j) ) (in one of the quadrants, using the bottom left corner as a reference for position) can be calculated as: [ text{Distance} = sqrt{(iD - 4D)^2 + (jD - 4D)^2} ] Applying this for various squares: - Corner at ( (1, 1) ) (middle of first square): [ text{Distance} = sqrt{(D - 4D)^2 + (D - 4D)^2} = sqrt{(-3D)^2 + (-3D)^2} = sqrt{18D^2} = 3Dsqrt{2} ] Since ( 3Dsqrt{2} > D/4 ), this square is not completely covered. Repeat this check for other squares, identifying which lie entirely within the circle. **Conclusion & Counting**: Verify and count the number of squares wherein all corners satisfy the distance condition and multiply this by 4 due to symmetry to get the total count. Given the strict distance condition ( D/4 ), it is likely less than or equal to only the central square, if any, will be fully covered. Squares further out will surpass the radius check.

Prove that it is possible to find four rows and four columns that contain all 12 black squares.","output":"**Step-by-Step Proof:** 1. Define ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_8 ) as the number of black squares in each of the 8 rows. We can assume without loss of generality that: [ x_1 geq x_2 geq cdots geq x_8. ] 2. Given that the total number of black squares is 12, we have: [ x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_8 = 12. ] 3. Since the ( x_i ) are non-increasing, it means we cannot have all 8 rows equal to the same number because that would violate the condition of them summing to 12 (i.e., it is impossible for ( x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_8 )). Therefore, we must have: [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 > x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8. ] 4. To prove the above point, suppose that: [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 + 1. ] 5. Summing these parts, we have: [ 2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4) - 1 = 12, ] [ 2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4) = 13. ] However, this creates a contradiction because the left side must be an even number but the right side is odd. 6. Consider the other case: [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 + 2. ] In this case, equating gives us: [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 7, ] [ x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 = 5. ] 7. Since ( x_i ) are non-increasing, we have: [ 4x_4 leq 7, ] [ x_4 leq 1. ] 8. Similarly, because: [ x_8 leq x_7 leq x_6 leq x_5 leq x_4 leq 1, ] we get: [ x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 leq 4. ] 9. This again creates a contradiction since it must sum to 5, as per step 6. Therefore, the above equalities cannot hold. 10. Based on the inequalities derived from step 3: [ 2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4) - 3 geq 12, ] [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 geq 8. ] 11. Selecting the top four rows that have the most black squares results in at least 8 black squares. The remaining black squares (12 - 8 = 4 black squares) are contained within any of the columns available for these rows. **Conclusion**: It is, therefore, possible to find 4 rows and 4 columns that together cover all 12 black squares.

This discrepancy suggests that the initial calculation of man-hours required to complete the work was underestimated or the work pace was slower than expected.

Given that the person shoots 6 times, and we are interested in the probability of hitting the target exactly 3 times with 2 of these hits being consecutive, we approach the solution in two parts. First, we calculate the probability of hitting the target exactly 3 times out of 6 shots. This can be done using combinations, as the order in which the hits occur does matter, but we are initially looking at the scenario without considering the requirement for consecutive hits. The number of ways to choose 3 hits out of 6 shots is given by the combination formula C_{6}^{3}. Since each shot is independent and has a probability of dfrac{1}{2} of being a hit, the probability of any specific sequence of 3 hits and 3 misses is left(dfrac{1}{2}right)^{6}. Therefore, the probability of hitting the target exactly 3 times out of 6 shots is C_{6}^{3}left(dfrac{1}{2}right)^{6}. Second, we need to adjust this probability to account for the condition that exactly 2 of these hits are consecutive. To find the probability of having exactly 2 consecutive hits among the 3 hits, we consider the arrangement of these hits and misses. We can treat the 2 consecutive hits as a single entity, which, along with the third hit and the 3 misses, gives us a total of 5 entities to arrange. The number of ways to arrange the 2 consecutive hits within these 5 entities is equivalent to arranging 2 items out of 4 possible positions (since treating the 2 consecutive hits as one entity reduces the total positions by one), which is given by the permutation A_{4}^{2}.  However, the initial solution incorrectly applies the concept of permutations directly to the final probability calculation without considering the base probability of hitting the target 3 times out of 6 shots correctly. The correct approach is to find the probability of hitting the target 3 times with exactly 2 consecutive hits by considering the specific arrangements that satisfy this condition. The number of favorable arrangements is C_{4}^{2}, as we are choosing 2 positions out of 4 for the hits, including the consecutive ones, to occur. This accounts for the different ways we can have 3 hits with 2 being consecutive among the 6 shots.  Therefore, the correct probability is given by the formula C_{4}^{2}left(dfrac{1}{2}right)^{6}. This accounts for the number of ways to arrange the hits and misses to satisfy the condition, multiplied by the probability of each arrangement happening.  Hence, the correct answer is (boxed{C: C_{4}^{2}left(dfrac{1}{2}right)^{6}})."},{"instruction":"Let a sequence c_1, c_2, ldots be defined as c_1 = 2, c_2 = 4, and c_{n+1} = c_n c_{n1}.

Since the sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180^circ, we get:    [    alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ    ]    Given gamma geq 91^circ, we can substitute to get:    [    alpha + beta + gamma leq 180^circ Rightarrow alpha + beta leq 89^circ    ] 3.

Now consider two cases for the value of m: **Case 1:** m leq 0. As x approaches +infty, if m leq 0, then f(x) approaches negative infinity because the leading term 2mx^2 dominates and is negative. Additionally, since g(x) = mx, this is also clearly negative for large x if m leq 0. So this case doesn't satisfy the given condition that at least one of f(x) or g(x) should be positive for all x.  **Case 2:** m > 0. For quadratic f(x), if the vertex of the parabola lies in the first or fourth quadrant (i.e., the x-coordinate of the vertex is non-negative), then because there exists a positive value of f(x) when x=0, there will always be a range of x where f(x) is positive. The vertex of f(x) is located at x = -frac{b}{2a} = frac{4-m}{2m}. If frac{4-m}{2m} geq 0, i.e., 0 < m leq 4, then the vertex is at a non-negative x coordinate, and hence the condition is satisfied.

This occurs if the discriminant Delta = 4(4-m)^2 - 8m is negative since this means the quadratic has no real roots and, given the positive coefficient for x^2, f(x) is always positive. The discriminant is given by Delta = 4(m-8)(m-2) < 0, which implies that 4 < m < 8 in order to ensure the discriminant is negative.

Therefore, the segments cannot form a triangle because 2cm + 5cm lt 8cm. For option B: 3cm + 3cm = 6cm which is equal to 6cm.

Therefore, each nine-digit number has digits adding up to 45.    - Any number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since (45) is divisible by (9), each of our nine-digit numbers is divisible by 9. 3. **Sum of All Numbers**:    - Since there are nine such numbers and each is divisible by 9, their sum is also divisible by (9).    - Let’s denote these nine-digit numbers as (N_1, N_2, ldots, N_9).

After any moves, the number of balls in the (n)-th box cannot be greater than (n).    **Proof:**    - When the (n)-th box is filled for the first time, all smaller numbered boxes must contain at least one ball each.    - In any move, if the (n)-th box isn't empty, we cannot increase the number of balls in it.    - Therefore, the number of balls in the (n)-th box cannot exceed (n). 3. **Claim 2:**    After any move, the total number of balls in boxes with numbers greater than (n) and the (n)-th box is divisible by (n).    **Proof:**    - If the sum changes after our move, it means we have filled some box labeled with a number greater than (n).    - We increased the sum by exactly ((n-1) + 1 = n).    - Thus, the sum remains (0 mod n). 4. **Using Claim 2:**    - The period of the first 35 boxes getting empty is (text{lcm}(1,2,...,36)), which is a divisor of (33!).    - The period of the first 36 boxes is (text{lcm}(1,2,...,37)), which is not a divisor of (33!).    - Therefore, the 36th box will be the first non-empty box after (33!) moves. 5. **Using Wilson's Theorem:**    - Wilson's Theorem states that for a prime (p), ((p-1)! equiv -1 mod p).    - Here, (37) is a prime, and (33!) can be related to (36!) as (36! = 33! times 34 times 35 times 36).    - We need to find (33! mod 37).

The allowed operation is to move any two tokens to their adjacent sectors. We need to determine if it is possible to gather all tokens into a single sector using these operations. 1. **Numbering the Sectors**: Number the sectors around the circle from 1 to 6. 2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: For any given arrangement, consider the sum ( S ) of the sector numbers of the six tokens (taking into account multiplicity, i.e., if multiple tokens are in the same sector, include that sector number multiple times). Initially, since there is one token in each sector:    [    S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21    ] 3. **Effect of Moves on ( S )**: When moving a token from its sector to an adjacent sector, the sector number where the token moves changes by ( pm 1 ). This change of odd value changes the parity (odd/even nature) of the sector number for each moved token.     4. **Parity Consideration**: Moving any two tokens simultaneously thus changes the sum ( S ) as follows:    - If a token moves from sector ( x ) to either sector ( x-1 ) or ( x+1 ), the parity of its contribution to ( S ) flips (odd to even or even to odd).    - Since we are always moving two tokens at a time, the parity change for each move (a simultaneous move of two tokens) results in no overall change in the parity of ( S ). 5. **Immutability of ( S ) Parity**: Initially, the sum ( S = 21 ) is odd. Since every allowed move operation preserves the parity of ( S ), ( S ) remains odd throughout. 6. **Final Configuration Analysis**: Suppose all tokens were gathered into a single sector numbered ( A ). In such a case:    - The sum ( S ) would be ( 6A ), where ( A ) is the number of the sector.    - ( 6A ) is always an even number since 6 times any integer is even. 7. **Conclusion**: Given that ( S = 21 ) is odd, it can never become an even number like ( 6A ) through any sequence of valid moves.

To determine her score on the seventh test, if the first six tests' scores equate to (33), and are the lowest sums possible (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 = 23), then the seventh test must close the gap to (43 - 23 = 20).

To minimize ( T ) while keeping it positive, we choose ( (p - q)^2 ) as the smallest perfect square greater than 100, which is 121 (same as in the original problem but the arguments here are for even sums). Thus, [ T = frac{121 - 100}{2} = 10.5. ] However, since ( T ) must be an integer, we take the next suitable perfect square, 144.

The derivative of the function f(x)=frac{x+a}{e^{x}} is f'(x)=frac{e^{x}-(x+a)e^{x}}{(e^{x})^{2}}=frac{1-x-a}{e^{x}}. Thus, the slope of the tangent line at x=0 is f'(0)=1-a=-1. Solving for a, we get boxed{a=2}. 2. From f'(x) > 0, we get x < 1-a; from f'(x) < 0, we get x > 1-a. Therefore, the function f(x) is increasing on the interval (-infty,1-a) and decreasing on (1-a,+infty).    - When 1-a < -1, i.e., a > 2, f(x) is decreasing on [-1,1], and thus boxed{f(x)_{text{max}}=f(-1)=(a-1)e}.    - When -1leqslant 1-aleqslant 1, i.e., 0leqslant aleqslant 2, x=1-a is the maximum point of f(x) on [-1,1], and thus boxed{f(x)_{text{max}}=f(1-a)=frac{1}{e^{1-a}}}.    - When 1-a > 1, i.e., a < 0, f(x) is increasing on [-1,1], and thus boxed{f(x)_{text{max}}=f(1)=frac{1+a}{e}}.

Thus, we must have mgeqslant 1.    - When mgeqslant 1, we have frac{m}{x}geqslant frac{1}{x} > 1, and thus f(frac{1}{x})geqslant f(frac{m}{x}). Therefore, it suffices to show that f(x) > f(frac{1}{x}).    We will now prove that f(x) > f(frac{1}{x}) holds for all xin(0,1).

They randomly selected 50 parents of students from the seventh and eighth grades for a questionnaire survey and obtained the rating data (denoted as x) for each parent regarding the afterschool extension services. The data was then organized, described, and analyzed. The following information is provided: a. The frequency distribution table of the eighthgrade parents' ratings for afterschool extension services is as follows (the data is divided into 5 groups: 0leqslant x lt 60, 60leqslant x lt 70, 70leqslant x lt 80, 80leqslant x lt 90, 90leqslant xleqslant 100): | Group            | Frequency | ||| | 0leqslant x lt 60 | 2       | | 60leqslant x lt 70 | 5       | | 70leqslant x lt 80 | 15      | | 80leqslant x lt 90 | a       | | 90leqslant xleqslant 100 | 8       | | Total            | 50      | b.

For the value of b, which represents the median for the eighth-grade parents' ratings, we note that the median falls within the 80leqslant x lt 90 group due to the distribution of the data. Given that the first 5 data points in this group are 81, 81, 82, 83, 83, and the mode is 83, indicating a high frequency of this value, the median is calculated as the average of the middle two values in the sorted list of this group's ratings. Since the data points are in ascending order and considering the distribution, the median b is calculated as: b = frac{82 + 83}{2} = 82.5. Therefore, b=82.5. So, the answers are: a=20, b=82.5, which can be encapsulated as: boxed{a=20, , b=82.5}  For question (2): The after-school extension services of the eighth grade are considered relatively good based on the following observations: - The average rating of the eighth-grade parents for after-school extension services is 81 points, which is higher than the seventh grade's average of 78 points. This indicates that the overall satisfaction among eighth-grade parents is higher. - The median rating for the eighth-grade parents is 82.5, compared to 79 for the seventh grade. This shows that more than half of the eighth-grade parents rated the services higher than 82.5 points, indicating a higher level of satisfaction among a majority of the parents compared to the seventh grade. These points suggest that the eighth-grade after-school extension services are performing better in terms of parent satisfaction.  For question (3): To estimate the number of parents whose ratings are not less than 80 points, we calculate the proportion of such parents among the surveyed group and then apply this proportion to the total number of eighth-grade parents surveyed, which is 600. The calculation is as follows: frac{20 + 8}{50} times 600 = frac{28}{50} times 600 = 336 , text{parents}.

The order of 2 modulo 89 is 11, since (2^{11} - 1 = 2047 = 89 cdot 23). Let (H subset G) denote the 11th powers modulo 89, so (|H| = 8). The map:    [    psi : G twoheadrightarrow H quad text{by} quad x mapsto x^{11}    ]    is surjective and vanishes exactly at powers of 2.

To prove this, we will assume the opposite and derive a contradiction. 1. **Assume the opposite:**    - Suppose that for each subset ( S_i ) (where ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k )), there exists a positive integer ( n_i ) such that ( S_i ) contains only finitely many multiples of ( n_i ). 2. **Construct a product ( n ):**    - Let ( n ) be the product of all ( n_i )'s, i.e.,      [      n = n_1 cdot n_2 cdot ldots cdot n_k.      ]    - Notice that ( n ) is a multiple of each ( n_i ). 3. **Consider multiples of ( n ):**    - Every multiple of ( n ) is also a multiple of each ( n_i ). Hence, for each subset ( S_i ), since ( S_i ) contains only finitely many multiples of ( n_i ), it must also contain only finitely many multiples of ( n ). 4. **Analyze the structure of the partitions:**    - Since ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k ) partition the set of all positive integers, and we assumed that each ( S_i ) contains only finitely many multiples of ( n ),      begin{equation}      S_1 cup S_2 cup ldots cup S_k      end{equation}      contains only finitely many multiples of ( n ). 5. **Derive a contradiction:**    - However, the set of all positive integers contains infinitely many multiples of ( n ) because if we consider the sequence ( n, 2n, 3n, ldots ), all these are multiples of ( n ), and clearly, this sequence is infinite.    - Therefore, assuming that the partitioned sets ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k ) collectively contain only finitely many multiples of ( n ) leads to a direct contradiction because this would imply the infinite set of multiples of ( n ) is finite. 6. **Conclusion:**    - Since our assumption that each subset ( S_i ) contains only finitely many multiples of some positive integer ( n_i ) leads to a contradiction, it must be false.    - Hence, there exists some subset ( S ) such that for every positive integer ( n ), ( S ) contains infinitely many multiples of ( n ).

First, we note the given condition: a natural number (a) when divided by numbers from 1 to 1000, the remainders are less than 100.     2. Let the remainder when (a) is divided by 100 be (r), i.e., (a mod 100 = r), where (0 leq r < 100). 3. When (a) is divided by any number (0 < n leq 1000) which is a multiple of 100 (i.e., 200, 300, ..., 1000), the remainder will be of the form (r + 100k), where (k) is a non-negative integer. 4. For example, for (a mod 200):    [    a = 200q + r quad text{for some integer } q    ]    Thus,    [    a mod 200 = r    ] 5. Similarly, for (a mod 300), (a mod 400), and so on, up to (a mod 1000), if the remainders are restricted to be less than 100, they will all be equal to (r). 6. Since we have the numbers 200, 300, ..., 1000 (9 numbers) which are multiples of 100, and they all give a remainder equal to (r), (r) must fall within the range (0 leq r leq 99). 7. Therefore, in the set ( {0, 1, ..., 99} ), the remainder (r) will be found exactly 10 times for a total of 1000 divisions. 8. By the previously described logic, if (r) were to appear exactly 10 times, then (r) must be one of these numbers appearing repeatedly at least once. 9. Since every number ( r ) from  {0,1,2,...,99} must repeat more than 10 times to ensure every number between 1 and 1000 has been divided, this contradicts the condition that (r) should appear exactly 10 times. 10.

The remaining distance between them is now 75 - 30 = 45 km. In the third hour, A's speed doubles again to 40 km/hr and B's speed doubles to 20 km/hr. Together, they will cover 40 + 20 = 60 km. Since the remaining distance is 45 km and they would cover 60 km in the third hour, they will meet before the end of the third hour. Let's calculate the exact time they will meet in the third hour. We can set up a proportion since their speeds are constant during the third hour: (40 km/hr) / (60 km/hr) = (distance A covers) / (45 km) Solving for the distance A covers: distance A covers = (40 km/hr) / (60 km/hr) * 45 km distance A covers = (2/3) * 45 km distance A covers = 30 km So, A will cover an additional 30 km in the third hour before meeting B. Now, let's add up the distances A covered in each hour until they meet: First hour: 10 km Second hour: 20 km Third hour (partial): 30 km Total distance A covers = 10 km + 20 km + 30 km = 60 km Therefore, A will have covered boxed{60}  km until he meets B."},{"instruction":"Convert the point (3sqrt{2}, 4, 5) in rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates.

Proportional distribution means distribution that decreases proportionally. The decreasing ratio (in percentage) is usually referred to as the proportional distribution ratio. For example, if individuals A, B, C, and D receive 100, 60, 36, and 21.6 respectively, with a decreasing ratio of 40%, then the proportional distribution ratio is 40%. Now, suppose there are a total of m units of grain (m > 0). According to the order of A, B, C, and D, with B receiving 80 units of grain and the sum of what A and C receive being 164 units, the proportional distribution ratio is ( ). A: 20% B: 25% C: 75% D: 80%","output":"Let's denote the \\"proportional distribution ratio\\" as r, where r is the fraction of the decrease (not the percentage). Since the percentage decrease is what we're looking for, we'll convert r into a percentage at the end of our calculation. Given that B receives 80 units of grain, we can express the amounts received by A and C in terms of r and the amount received by B. Since the distribution decreases proportionally, A receives more than B, and C receives less than B, following the proportional distribution ratio. 1. A receives frac{80}{1-r} units of grain because A is before B and thus receives more due to the proportional increase. 2. C receives 80(1-r) units of grain because C is after B and thus receives less due to the proportional decrease. The sum of what A and C receive is given as 164 units. Therefore, we can set up the equation: [ frac{80}{1-r} + 80(1-r) = 164 ] To solve for r, we first simplify the equation: [ 80left(frac{1}{1-r} + 1-rright) = 164 ] [ frac{80}{1-r} + 80 - 80r = 164 ] [ frac{80 - 80r + 80 - 80r}{1-r} = 164 ] [ frac{160(1-r)}{1-r} = 164 ] Since the (1-r) cancels out, we simplify the equation to find the value of r: [ 160 = 164 ] This simplification step was incorrect in our process. Let's correct the approach to solve for r accurately: Starting again from the correct setup: [ frac{80}{1-r} + 80(1-r) = 164 ] Multiplying both sides by (1-r) to clear the fraction: [ 80 + 80(1-r)^2 = 164(1-r) ] Expanding and simplifying to solve for r correctly involves recognizing that we need to solve the original equation directly: [ frac{80}{1-r} + 80(1-r) = 164 ] Let's correct the approach to directly solve for r without incorrect simplifications: Given the equation frac{80}{1-r} + 80(1-r) = 164, we aim to find the value of r that satisfies this equation. The correct approach to solve for r involves algebraic manipulation and possibly using quadratic formula or iterative methods, which was not detailed in the initial steps.

We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement. 1. **Base Case: ( n = 1 )**     When ( n = 1 ):     [     1! = 1     ]     The only natural number not exceeding ( 1! ) is 1 itself, which can be expressed as:     [     1 = 1     ]     This expression uses 1 number, which is equal to ( n ). Thus, the conclusion holds for the base case.      2. **Inductive Step:**          Assume the conclusion holds for ( n ). This means any natural number ( a ) less than or equal to ( n! ) can be expressed as the sum of at most ( n ) distinct divisors of ( n! ).     We need to show that the conclusion holds for ( n + 1 ). That is, any natural number ( b ) less than or equal to ( (n + 1)! ) can be expressed as the sum of at most ( n + 1 ) distinct divisors of ( (n + 1)! ).          Let ( b leq (n+1)! ). We can express ( b ) in the form:     [     b = (n + 1) cdot d + r     ]     where ( d leq n! ) and ( 0 leq r < n + 1 ).

In geometrical terms, the triangle must be acute-angled if this condition holds. 2. **Circumscribed Circle (Γ):** Since the triangles are formed by the vertices of a regular polygon of 2007 sides, all these triangles share the same circumscribed circle, denoted by (Gamma). This (Gamma) is the circumcircle of the regular polygon. 3. **Identifying the Unique Triangle:**    - The goal is to show that there is exactly one triangle in the triangulation such that the center (O) of (Gamma) lies within the interior of this triangle.    - The center (O) of (Gamma) is also the center of the regular polygon. 4. **Geometry of the Polygonal Triangulation:**    - In the process of paving (triangulating) the interior of the polygon, consider that each triangle is formed by selecting three vertices of the polygon.    - We need to ensure one such formed triangle contains the center (O) inside it.     5. **Uniqueness and Existence Argument:**    - Take any arbitrary triangulation of the regular 2007-gon. Because the number of sides (2007) is odd, the diagonals and sides of the polygon are evenly distributed around (O).    - Since no diagonal or side can pass exactly through (O) (due to the odd number of sides), such triangulation would involve (O) being strictly inside one triangle. 6. **Counting Argument:**    - With 2007 vertices, the total number of triangles would be (2005) (by Euler's formula for planar graphs: (V = 2007), (E = 2007+N-1), where (N) is the number of triangles, and for a triangulation with vertices on a convex polygon, (E = 3N - k) where (k) is linear boundary segments, which simplifies to (N = V-2)).    - Every vertex contributes to some triangles but only one triangle will have (O) in its interior due to the nature of (O) being within (Gamma). **Conclusion:** Therefore, by proving that (O) must be strictly inside exactly one triangle of any triangulation of the regular polygon, it is sure that exactly one triangle will have all acute angles.

We need to show that there always exist (n) non-intersecting chords such that each chord connects two points of different colors. We start by defining some terms and concepts to simplify our proof. Let us focus on the general structure and the mathematical approach used to reach the conclusion. 1. **Initial Setup**:      - Consider the circle with (2n) points.     - Color (n) points red and the other (n) points blue. 2. **Counting Chords**:      - We want to show that we can always find (n) non-intersecting chords connecting points of different colors.     - Each such chord has one endpoint in the set of red points and the other endpoint in the set of blue points. 3. **Analyzing Non-Intersecting Chords**:      - Denote the total number of ways to connect pairs of points (one red and one blue) as potential chords. 4. **Induction Hypothesis**:      - Use mathematical induction to prove our hypothesis.     - For (n = 1), the circle has 2 points: one red and one blue. There is exactly one chord connecting the two points, and it clearly satisfies the condition. 5. **Inductive Step**:     - Assume the hypothesis holds for (n = k), where we can find (k) non-intersecting chords connecting points of different colors.     - Now, consider (n = k + 1), meaning we have (2k + 2) points: (k+1) red and (k+1) blue points.     - Let (A) be a red point and (B) be a blue point which are adjacent (next to each other) on the circle. Since the configuration is circular, it's always possible to find such a pair. 6. **Reducing the Problem**:     - Remove points (A) and (B) from the circle, leaving (2k) points.     - According to the inductive hypothesis, among these (2k) points, we can find (k) non-intersecting chords where each chord connects a red point and a blue point.     - The chord connecting (A) and (B) will also be added and it will not intersect with any of the other (k) chords found. 7. **Conclusion**:     - By adding the chord (A-B) to the set of (k) non-intersecting chords in the remaining (2k) points, we have (k+1) non-intersecting chords.     - Hence, for (n = k + 1), the hypothesis also holds true. 8. **Final Argument**:     - By the principle of mathematical induction, the hypothesis holds for all (n in mathbb{N}).     - Therefore, for any circle divided into (2n) points with (n) red points and (n) blue points, we can always find (n) non-intersecting chords each connecting a red point to a blue point.

We need to prove that:    [    p_{1} p_{3} ldots p_{2n-1} = p_{2} p_{4} ldots p_{2n}    ] 2. **Height in a Triangle and Relationship to Sides**:    Recall a theorem for any triangle ABC inscribed in a circle with radius R:    [    h_{c} = frac{ab}{2R}    ]    where h_{c} is the altitude from vertex C to side AB, and a, b are the lengths of sides BC and CA, respectively. 3. **Distance from Point to Side Formula**:    Applying this theorem to each side of the polygon and corresponding chords, we get that the perpendicular distance from point M to A_{k}A_{k+1} is given by:    [    p_{k} = frac{M A_{k} cdot M A_{k+1}}{2R}    ] 4. **Product of Distances for Odd-Indexed Sides**:    Calculating the product of distances p_{1}, p_{3}, ldots, p_{2n-1}, we have:    [    p_{1} p_{3} ldots p_{2n-1} = left(frac{M A_{1} cdot M A_{2}}{2R}right) left(frac{M A_{3} cdot M A_{4}}{2R}right) ldots left(frac{M A_{2n-1} cdot M A_{2n}}{2R}right)    ] 5.

The integral of x^{frac{1}{3}}: [ int_{0}^{8} x^{frac{1}{3}} , dx = left. frac{3}{4} x^{frac{4}{3}} right|_{0}^{8} ] Evaluate the integral: [ left. frac{3}{4} x^{frac{4}{3}} right|_{0}^{8} = frac{3}{4} left( 8^{frac{4}{3}} - 0^{frac{4}{3}} right) = frac{3}{4} times 16 = 12 ] Combine the results: [ frac{128 sqrt{2}}{3} + 12 ] Simplify: [ frac{128 sqrt{2} + 36}{3} = 42.67 approx 33 frac{1}{3} ] So, the integral is: [ boxed{33 frac{1}{3}} ]  2. Compute the integral int_{0}^{1} sqrt{1+t} , dt Let us change variables. Set u = 1+t, hence du = dt and the limits change from t=0 to t=1 into limits u=1 to u=2. Thus: [ int_{0}^{1} sqrt{1+t} , dt = int_{1}^{2} sqrt{u} , du ] Apply the power rule for integration: [ int_{1}^{2} u^{frac{1}{2}} , du = left. frac{2}{3} u^{frac{3}{2}} right|_{1}^{2} ] Evaluate the antiderivative: [ left. frac{2}{3} u^{frac{3}{2}} right|_{1}^{2} = frac{2}{3} left( 2^{frac{3}{2}} - 1^{frac{3}{2}} right) = frac{2}{3} left( 2sqrt{2} - 1 right) = frac{2}{3} times (2.828 - 1) = frac{2}{3} times 1.828 = 1.2187... ] So, the integral is: [ boxed{frac{2}{3}(2 sqrt{2} - 1)} ]  3. Compute the integral int_{2}^{3} frac{dx}{sqrt{5 + 4x - x^{2}}} We complete the square inside the square root in the denominator: [ 5 + 4x - x^2 = -left(x^2 - 4x - 5right) = -left(left(x - 2right)^2 - 9right) = 9 - (x-2)^2 ] The integral becomes: [ int_{2}^{3} frac{dx}{sqrt{9 - (x-2)^{2}}} ] Using trigonometric substitution, let u = x - 2, hence the integral becomes: [ int_{0}^{1} frac{du}{sqrt{9 - u^{2}}} ] Recognizing the function is in the form of the arcsin: [ int frac{du}{sqrt{a^2 - u^2}} = arcsin frac{u}{a} + C quad text{with} quad a=3 ] Evaluating from 2 to 3: [ int_{0}^{1} frac{du}{sqrt{9 - u^{2}}} = arcsin frac{u}{3} bigg|_{0}^1=arcsin frac{1}{3} - arcsin 0 = 2 arcsin frac{1}{3} ] So, the integral is: [ boxed{2 arcsin frac{1}{3}} ]  4. Compute the integral int_{frac{pi}{6}}^{frac{pi}{4}} sec^{2} alpha , dalpha The antiderivative of sec^2 x is tan x: [ int sec^{2} x , dx = tan x + C ] Evaluate from frac{pi}{6} to frac{pi}{4}: [ left. tan alpha right|_{frac{pi}{6}}^{frac{pi}{4}} = tan left( frac{pi}{4} right) - tan left( frac{pi}{6} right) ] Evaluate the tangents: [ tan left( frac{pi}{4} right) = 1 quad text{and} quad tan left( frac{pi}{6} right) = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ] Thus, the integral is: [ 1 - frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}}- frac{1}{sqrt{3}}=frac{sqrt{3}-1}{sqrt{pi}} ] So, the integral is: [ boxed{ sqrt{3}-1} ]"},{"instruction":"There are two positive integers ( A ) and ( B ).

We need to find the ratio in which the line (s) divides the side (BC). 1. **Observation**:     Since the line (s) and the median from (B) divide the altitude from (C) into three equal parts, the point where the altitude intersects the median is divided into a (2:1) ratio from vertex (C). 2. **Identifying triangles**:    The altitude from (C) also serves as a median in the isosceles triangle (Delta ABC) where (AC=BC). 3. **Setting up points and segments**:    Let the point where the line (s) intersects the altitude (CH) be (K), and the point where it intersects the side (BC) be (P).    It follows that (Delta AKB) is also isosceles. 4. **Parallel and similar triangles**:    Now, consider point (M) on (BC) such that (KM) is parallel to (AB).    Since (KM parallel AB), (KM) is the angle bisector of (angle BKC). 5. **Establishing similarity**:    Triangles (Delta CKM) and (Delta CHB) are similar with a ratio of (3:1) because the segments on (CH) are divided into three equal parts by (K).

The shopkeeper sold the book with a 5% discount and earned a profit of 42.5%. This means the selling price (SP) after the discount is such that it includes the cost price plus 42.5% profit. First, let's calculate the selling price with the discount: Profit = Profit percentage * Cost price Profit = 42.5% of 100 Profit = 0.425 * 100 Profit = 42.50 So, the selling price with the profit included is: SP with profit = CP + Profit SP with profit = 100 + 42.50 SP with profit = 142.50 Now, this selling price is after a 5% discount. Let's denote the original selling price (before discount) as SP_original. The relationship between the discounted selling price and the original selling price is: SP with discount = SP_original - (Discount percentage * SP_original) 142.50 = SP_original - (0.05 * SP_original) 142.50 = SP_original * (1 - 0.05) 142.50 = SP_original * 0.95 Now, we solve for SP_original: SP_original = 142.50 / 0.95 SP_original = 150 So, if no discount was offered, the selling price would have been 150. Now, let's calculate the profit percentage if no discount was offered: Profit without discount = SP_original - CP Profit without discount = 150 - 100 Profit without discount = 50 Profit percentage without discount = (Profit without discount / CP) * 100% Profit percentage without discount = (50 / 100) * 100% Profit percentage without discount = 0.5 * 100% Profit percentage without discount = 50% Therefore, if no discount was offered, the percentage of profit earned would have been boxed{50%} ."},{"instruction":"Anthony has 9 pencils.

Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 60 kmph + 6 kmph Relative speed = 66 kmph Now, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to meters per second (m/s) because the length of the train is given in meters. To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s Relative speed in m/s = 66 kmph * (5/18) m/s/kmph Relative speed in m/s = 66 * 5/18 Relative speed in m/s = 330/18 Relative speed in m/s = 18.33 m/s (approximately) Now, we have the relative speed in m/s and the length of the train in meters. We can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance the train needs to cover to pass the man is equal to the length of the train, which is 240 meters.

To solve this problem, we use the following common geometric result:  **Lemma**: In a rectangle, any triangle formed by three points inside the rectangle has an area not exceeding half of the area of the rectangle. Let's denote the midpoints of sides (AB, BC, CD, DA) as (E, F, H, G), respectively. The intersection of line segments (EF) and (GH) is (O). Line segments (EF) and (GH) divide the rectangle (ABCD) into four smaller rectangles.

Without loss of generality, assume that rectangle (AEOG) contains at least two points, named (M) and (N). 1.

For a number ( n ) with prime factorization ( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_m^{e_m} ), the number of divisors is given by:    [    b(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_m + 1)    ] 2. **Constructing ( n )**:    We need to find ( n ) such that ( b(n) = k^2 - k + 1 ). Consider ( n ) of the form ( p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_m^{e_m} ) where ( e_i + 1 ) are factors of ( k^2 - k + 1 ). 3. **Choosing ( n )**:    Let's choose ( n ) to be a product of distinct primes raised to appropriate powers. For example, if ( k^2 - k + 1 ) is a prime number, say ( p ), then we can choose ( n = p^{p-1} ). This gives:    [    b(n) = p = k^2 - k + 1    ] 4. **Infinitely Many ( n )**:    Since there are infinitely many primes, we can always find such ( n ) for each prime ( p ). Therefore, there are infinitely many positive integers ( n ) such that ( b(n) = k^2 - k + 1 ). (blacksquare) # Part (b) We need to prove that there are finitely many positive integers ( n ) which satisfy ( p(n) = k^2 - k + 1 ). 1. **Understanding ( p(n) )**:    The function ( p(n) ) denotes the sum of all positive divisors of ( n ). For a number ( n ) with prime factorization ( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_m^{e_m} ), the sum of divisors is given by:    [    p(n) = left( frac{p_1^{e_1+1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} right) left( frac{p_2^{e_2+1} - 1}{p_2 - 1} right) cdots left( frac{p_m^{e_m+1} - 1}{p_m - 1} right)    ] 2. **Bounding ( p(n) )**:    For ( p(n) = k^2 - k + 1 ), we need to find ( n ) such that the sum of its divisors equals ( k^2 - k + 1 ). Since ( k^2 - k + 1 ) is a specific value, there are only finitely many ways to factorize it into sums of divisors. 3. **Example and Non-existence**:    For example, if ( k = 5 ), then ( k^2 - k + 1 = 21 ). We need to find ( n ) such that ( p(n) = 21 ). Possible ( n ) values are limited because the sum of divisors function grows rapidly with ( n ). 4. **Conclusion**:    Since ( k^2 - k + 1 ) is a fixed value and the sum of divisors function is not surjective over the integers, there are only finitely many ( n ) that can satisfy ( p(n) = k^2 - k + 1 ).

We have the probability of A passing the interview as frac{3}{4} and the probability of B passing the interview as frac{2}{3}. Given that A and B passing the interview are independent events, we aim to find the probability that at least one of these two college students passes the interview. To solve this, we start by understanding that the events of A and B passing are independent, meaning the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of at least one passing by looking at the complementary event, which is both A and B not passing the interview.  The probability of A not passing the interview is 1 - frac{3}{4} = frac{1}{4}, and the probability of B not passing is 1 - frac{2}{3} = frac{1}{3}. Since these events are independent, we can multiply these probabilities to find the probability of both not passing, which gives frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{12}. The probability of at least one passing is the complement of both not passing, which we find by subtracting this probability from 1: 1 - frac{1}{12} = frac{11}{12}.

Find the number of ordered pairs ((m, n)) such that ((m+n)^2 + 3m + n) is a perfect square. 1. We start by analyzing the expression ((m+n)^2 + 3m + n). We need to examine the conditions under which this expression is a perfect square. 2. Let's denote ( k = m+n ). Thus, our expression becomes:    [    k^2 + 3m + n    ] 3. We need this expression to be a perfect square. Let's compare it with squares of integers near ( k ):    [    (k+1)^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1    ]    [    (k+2)^2 = k^2 + 4k + 4    ] 4. From these, it is clear that:    [    k^2 < k^2 + 3m + n < (k+2)^2    ]    This means that:    [    k^2 + 2k + 1 leq k^2 + 3m + n < k^2 + 4k + 4    ] 5. For ((m+n)^2 + 3m + n) to be a perfect square, we need to examine the possibilities. Assume:    [    k^2 + 3m + n = (k+1)^2    ]    This leads to:    [    k^2 + 3m + n = k^2 + 2k + 1    ] 6. Simplifying the above, we get:    [    3m + n = 2k + 1    ]    Substituting ( k = m+n ):    [    3m + n = 2(m+n) + 1    ]    [    3m + n = 2m + 2n + 1    ] 7. Rearranging the terms, we obtain:    [    m = n + 1    ] 8. Therefore, ( m ) must be exactly 1 more than ( n ). 9. Since both ( m ) and ( n ) are integers within ([1, 99]), we need to count the number of valid pairs ((m,n)):    [    m = n + 1 Rightarrow (m, n) = (n+1, n)    ]    ( n ) ranges from 1 to 98 because ( m ) must be within the bounds of 1 to 99. 10.

This implies the products of the lengths of the corresponding bases and heights of these parallelograms are equal. [ text{Area}(KBLO) = text{Area}(MDNO) ] 4. **Expressing Areas in Terms of Lengths:**    Since the segments KM and LN are parallel to the sides, the heights of the parallelograms KBL O and MDNO are equal.

To do this, consider the ratios derived from the previous substitution: [ frac{KO}{KA} = frac{LC}{LO} ] These ratios indicate that the triangles are similar by the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) similarity criterion, since OK parallel OL and OM parallel ON ensure the corresponding angles are equal. 7. **Conclusion from Similarity:**    Therefore, [ triangle KOA sim triangle LCO ] From the similarity, it follows that point O lies on the diagonal AC, as the corresponding vertices align on the same line. 8. **Reversibility of Argument:**    Conversely, if point O lies on the diagonal AC, then by triangle similarity and equal ratios of segment lengths, the areas of the parallelograms KBL O and MDNO must be equal: [ text{Area}(KBLO) = text{Area}(MDNO) ] # Conclusion: The areas of the parallelograms KBL O and MDNO are equal if and only if the point O lies on the diagonal AC.

Solving the equation we find: x_1 + x_2 = frac{32k^2}{1 + 4k^2} text{ and } x_1 x_2 = frac{64k^2}{1 + 4k^2}...① This allows us to identify points M ((x_1, k(x_1 - 4))) and N ((x_2, k(x_2 - 4))). Therefore, the equation of line BM is: y = frac{k(x_1 - 4)}{x_1 - 2}(x - 2), which leads to point P being ((1, frac{k(x_1 - 4)}{x_1 - 2})). As a result, vectors overrightarrow{AP} = (3, frac{k(x_1 - 4)}{x_1 - 2}) and overrightarrow{AN} = (x_2 + 2, k(x_2 - 4)). To prove that points A, P, and N are collinear, we need to show that vectors overrightarrow{AP} and overrightarrow{AN} are collinear. This can be shown if the following identity holds true: frac{k(x_1 - 4)}{x_1 - 2}(x_2 + 2) = 3k(x_2 - 4). After simplifying, we have to prove that 2x_1x_2 - 5(x_1 + x_2) - 8 = 0. Substituting the values from ①, it is clear that the equality holds. Hence, boxed{A, P, N text{ are collinear}.} (ii) Transforming the line equation to the form (x = my + 4) (where (m = frac{1}{k})), and solving the system begin{cases} x = my + 4  x^2 + 4y^2 = 4 end{cases}, gives us ((m^2 - 4)y^2 + 8my - 12 = 0). The discriminant condition Delta = 64(m^2 - 3) > 0 implies (m^2 > 12). The length of MN is then |MN| = sqrt{1 + m^2} frac{4sqrt{m^2 - 12}}{m^2 + 4}, and the perpendicular distance from point O to line MN is d = frac{4}{sqrt{1 + m^2}}. The area of triangle OMN is S = frac{1}{2} times |MN| times d = frac{8 sqrt{m^2 - 12}}{m^2 + 4} = frac{8}{sqrt{m^2 - 12} + frac{16}{sqrt{m^2 - 12}}} leq frac{8}{4 + 4} = 1. The equality holds when (m = pm 2sqrt{7}), which corresponds to (k = pm frac{sqrt{7}}{14}). Therefore, the equation of the line is (y = pm frac{sqrt{7}}{14}(x - 4)) and the maximum area of triangle OMN is boxed{1 text{ unit}^2}."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=sin left(2x+ frac{pi}{6}right)2cos^2{x}.

We want to find the percentage of men who are tenured. First, we need to find out how many professors are men. Since 69% are women, the remaining 31% must be men (100% - 69% = 31%). So, there are 31 male professors. Now, we need to find out how many professors are neither women nor tenured, as this will help us determine how many men are tenured. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for this: Number of professors who are neither women nor tenured = Total number of professors - Number of professors who are women, tenured, or both Number of professors who are neither women nor tenured = 100 - 90 = 10 These 10 professors are men who are not tenured, since all women are counted in the 90%. Therefore, the remaining men (31 - 10 = 21) must be tenured. To find the percentage of men who are tenured, we divide the number of tenured men by the total number of men and multiply by 100: Percentage of men who are tenured = (Number of tenured men / Total number of men) * 100 Percentage of men who are tenured = (21 / 31) * 100 Now, let's calculate the percentage: Percentage of men who are tenured ≈ 67.74% So, approximately boxed{67.74%}  of the men are tenured."},{"instruction":"Let set P = {x | 2kpi leq alpha leq (2k + 1)pi, k in mathbb{Z}}, and Q = {alpha | 4 leq alpha leq 4}.

Our goal is to perform the operation of deleting one edge from cycles of length 4 until no more such cycles can be found. We need to find the configuration that results in the minimum number of edges remaining. 3. **Cyclic Deletion Operation**:      - Consider a cycle of length 4 in a graph, say, vertices A, B, C, and D forming a cycle with edges AB, BC, CD, and DA.     - Delete an edge from this cycle, for example, edge AB.     - The resulting graph will still be connected but has one less edge. 4. **Graph Properties**:     - The graph G we start with, K_n, is connected and not bipartite (as it contains odd cycles, specifically triangles).     - After deleting edges as described, the resulting graph H remains non-bipartite (since any even-length cycle still has chords or adjacent nodes maintaining connectivity). 5. **Maintaining Connectivity**:     - If a graph is connected and not a bipartite, it must have at least n-1 edges because if it had exactly n-1, it would be a tree and thus bipartite.     - Therefore, the resulting non-bipartite and connected graph from our operation will have at least n edges. 6. **Constructing a Graph with n Edges**:     - Initially, K_n has frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.     - To construct a graph with exactly n edges, we begin with K_n and systematically remove edges according to the deletion operation from cycles of length 4. 7. **Explicit Construction Example**:     - Label vertices A1, A2, ..., A(n-3), X, Y, Z such that we can clearly define cycles of length 4.     - Remove edge A_iA_j from cycles formed including X, Y, and A_i, A_j where 1 leq i < j leq n-3.     - Also remove edges XA_i from cycles formed by XYZ, enclosing A_i for 1 leq i leq n-3.     - Do the same for edges YA_j with 1 leq j leq n-3.     - The remaining graph will eventually have exactly n edges and no cycle of length 4 where an edge can be deleted anymore. # Conclusion: Based on the discussion and construction, the minimum number of edges that can be achieved through this operation on a complete graph with n vertices is n.

To find out how many days it takes for them to finish the entire job, we take the reciprocal of their combined work rate: Days = 1 / (A + B + C) Days = 1 / (1/12) Days = 12 Therefore, A, B, and C together can finish the job in boxed{12}  days."},{"instruction":"NASA has adjusted its transport costs to the International Space Station.

According to the Pythagorean theorem,    [    c^2 = 1 + 4 = 5    ]        Hence, the length of the hypotenuse (c) is:    [    c = sqrt{5}    ] 4. **Compute the Area Using Two Methods**:    **First Method**:    - Construct squares on each leg.    - The areas of these squares are 1 and 4 respectively.    - The area of the square constructed on the hypotenuse is calculated by summing the areas of the squares on the legs:      [      1 + 4 = 5      ]    - Construct a square on the hypotenuse and verify its area:      - Divide this square into 4 smaller right triangles and a central smaller square.      - Each triangle has legs 1 and 2, thus an area of:        [        frac{1 cdot 2}{2} = 1        ]      - Total area of 4 triangles:        [        4 cdot 1 = 4        ]      - Plus the central square of area 1:        [        4 + 1 = 5        ]    **Second Method**:    - Arrange four copies of the right triangle around the square built on the hypotenuse to form a larger square.    - The side of the larger square will be equal to the sum of the legs of the triangle:      [      1 + 2 = 3      ]    - The area of this larger square is:      [      3 times 3 = 9      ]    - The difference between this larger square and the sum of the four triangles gives the area of the square on the hypotenuse:      - The total area of the four triangles is:        [        4 cdot 1 = 4        ]      - Subtract this from the larger square:        [        9 - 4 = 5        ] **Conclusion**: Both methods confirmed that the area of the square on the hypotenuse is 5, which verifies the Pythagorean theorem for the given right triangle.

We need to show that we can organize the matches into (n-1) rounds such that each team plays exactly one match per round. 2. **Define the opponent**: Consider the (i)-th round, where (1 leq i leq n-1). Suppose that team (x)'s opponent is team (y) such that (x + y + i) is divisible by (n-1) and (1 leq y < n). If (2x + i) is divisible by (n-1), then (x)'s opponent will be team (n). 3. **Show that team (n) plays in every round**:     - If (2x_1 + i) and (2x_2 + i) have the same remainder modulo (n-1), then (2(x_1 - x_2)) is a multiple of the odd number (n-1).    - Since (|x_1 - x_2| < (n-1) - 1 < n-1), we have (x_1 = x_2).    - The remainders are (n-1) different numbers from the set ({0, 1, ldots, n-2}), so exactly one of these is zero.

According to the problem, each number equals the product of its two neighbors.      - Therefore, both neighboring numbers a and b satisfy the equation.    4. **Relationship between the numbers:**     - Since a and b are neighbors, we have that the next number adjacent to a is frac{a}{b}.     - Similarly, the next number adjacent to b is frac{b}{a}.    5. **Pattern observation**:     - Continuing this process further, numbers at distance 3 from a and b will be their multiplicative inverses. Thus, any two numbers that are three positions apart will be multiplicative reciprocals.    6. **Distance 6 relationship**:     - By extending the reasoning further, it follows that numbers that are six positions apart must be equal because the inverse of an inverse brings us back to the original number.    7. **Using the structure of the circle:**     - Since the total number of positions (2023) is mutually prime to 6, every number must follow this periodicity strictly without overlaps or skips.     - Mutual primality with 6 ensures that every number is repeated cyclically, and given the nature of the arrangement, all numbers in the sequence must indeed be the same number. 8. **Conclusion**:     - Given that 2023 and 6 are coprime and using the discovered periodic nature of the sequence, we conclude that the maximum number of different values used in such an arrangement is 1.

Please explain the reason.","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Calculation of y_{A} and y_{B} - For Store A:   - The cost of 16 badminton rackets is 16 times 150 yuan.   - Since Teacher Huang buys more than 16 boxes of shuttlecocks, she gets 16 boxes for free due to the promotion, and pays for the remaining x - 16 boxes.   - The cost for the remaining shuttlecocks is (x - 16) times 40 yuan.   - Therefore, the total cost at Store A is y_{A} = 16 times 150 + (x - 16) times 40 = 2400 + 40x - 640 = 1760 + 40x yuan. - For Store B:   - The original cost without discount for 16 badminton rackets and x boxes of shuttlecocks is (16 times 150) + (40x) yuan.   - Store B offers a 20% discount on the total cost, so the total cost at Store B is y_{B} = 80% times [(16 times 150) + (40x)] = 0.8 times (2400 + 40x) = 1920 + 32x yuan. Therefore, the expressions for y_{A} and y_{B} are: y_{A} = 1760 + 40x quad text{and} quad y_{B} = 1920 + 32x So, we have y_{A} = 1760 + 40x yuan and y_{B} = 1920 + 32x yuan.  Part 2: Comparison for x=25 - Substituting x=25 into the expressions for y_{A} and y_{B}:   - For Store A: y_{A} = 1760 + 40 times 25 = 1760 + 1000 = 2760 yuan.   - For Store B: y_{B} = 1920 + 32 times 25 = 1920 + 800 = 2720 yuan. - Comparing the total costs:   - Since 2760 > 2720, it means that the total cost at Store A is higher than at Store B for x=25. Therefore, it is more cost-effective for Teacher Huang to buy the badminton rackets and shuttlecocks at Store B when x=25. The final answers are encapsulated as follows: - For part (1): y_{A} = boxed{1760 + 40x} yuan and y_{B} = boxed{1920 + 32x} yuan. - For part (2): It is more cost-effective to buy at Store B, encapsulated as boxed{text{Store B}}."},{"instruction":"Shifting the graph of the function y=sin (2x+varphi) to the right by dfrac {1}{4} of a period results in a graph that is symmetric about the yaxis.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 9, and 11 can be found by multiplying the highest powers of prime factors present in each number. However, since 5, 9, and 11 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM is simply their product: LCM(5, 9, 11) = 5 * 9 * 11 = 45 * 11 = 495 Now, we want to find a multiple of 495 that is less than 997 and leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, 9, and 11. To leave a remainder of 3, we would add 3 to a multiple of 495: Multiple of 495 + 3 = Number less than 997 Let's find the largest multiple of 495 that is less than 997: 997 - 3 = 994 Now, we divide 994 by 495 to find the largest multiple: 994 ÷ 495 = 2 (with a remainder) The largest multiple of 495 that is less than 994 is 2 * 495 = 990. Now, we add 3 to 990 to get the number that would leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, 9, and 11: 990 + 3 = 993 So, 993 is the number that, when divided by 5, 9, and 11, will leave a remainder of 3. To find the least number that should be subtracted from 997 to get 993, we subtract 993 from 997: 997 - 993 = 4 Therefore, the least number that should be subtracted from 997 so that the remainder when divided by 5, 9, and 11 will leave in each case the same remainder of 3 is boxed{4} ."},{"instruction":"Robin initially had 300 songs on her mp3 player.

This ensures that at each move, the first player maximizes their contribution to the overall sum in the ( x )-axis direction. 3. **Number of Moves:**     - Since there are 1992 vectors and both players pick alternately, each player will make 996 moves.     - Thus, Player 1 will make the first, third, fifth, and so on moves, while Player 2 will make the second, fourth, sixth, and so on moves. 4. **Comparison of Vector Sums in the ( x )-Direction:**     - The ( x )-coordinate that the first player picks is always the largest among the remaining vectors.     - Therefore, Player 1's ( x )-coordinate on any given move ( i ) is greater than Player 2's ( x )-coordinate in the subsequent move ( i + 1 ).     - Consequentially, if we denote Player 1's accumulated sum of ( x )-coordinates by ( P1_x ) and Player 2's by ( P2_x ):       [       P1_x ge P2_x       ]       This is because each of the ( 996 ) picks by Player 1 has a higher ( x ) contribution than the following pick by Player 2. 5. **Non-Negativity of Total ( x )-Coordinate Sum:**     Since the sum of all vectors' ( x )-coordinates (i.e., ( S_x )) is non-negative:     [     S_x = P1_x + P2_x ge 0     ]     It must hold that ( P1_x ge P2_x ) since Player 1 strategically picks the higher ( x ) coordinates. 6. **Sum of ( y )-Coordinates:**     Since the vectors sum to (mathbf{s} ), ( S_y ), the total sum along the ( y )-axis, would be:     [     S_y = 0     ]     Given that Player 1 and Player 2 pick vectors alternately, the sum of the ( y )-coordinates picked by each player must cancel out each other:     [     P1_y + P2_y = 0 implies P1_y = -P2_y     ] 7. **Magnitude Comparison:**     We now consider the magnitudes of Player 1's and Player 2's resultant vectors.

A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. 4. We are using eight distinct digits, which means we are leaving out two digits from the set ({0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}). 5. The sum of the unused two digits must be (45 - 36 = 9) (where 36 is a multiple of 9). 6. Identify the pairs of digits that sum to 9. These pairs are:     - ((0, 9))    - ((1, 8))    - ((2, 7))    - ((3, 6))    - ((4, 5))        We have a total of 5 pairs. 7. For each of these pairs, the following calculation is required:    - **Case 1: Without the digit \\"0\\" being used** (pairs including the digit 0):      - Pair ((0, 9))      - There are 8 digits used excluding 0 and 9, giving 8! ways to arrange the remaining digits.      - But since 0 cannot be the first digit, we have:        [        8 times 7!        ]    - **Case 2: With the digit \\"0\\"** being used (all other pairs):      - Pairs: ((1, 8)), ((2, 7)), ((3, 6)), ((4, 5))      - Excluding the digit pair whose sum is 9, leaves 8 digits.      - Arranging these 8 digits where 0 cannot be the first digit gives:        [        7 times 7!        ] 8.

We'll show that any selection of 16 distinct numbers from the first 100 natural numbers contains subsets where the sum of one pair equals the sum of another pair. 2. **Counting Pairs**:    If we choose any 16 numbers, we can form frac{16 cdot 15}{2} = 120 different pairs. These pairs are formed by taking all combinations of two numbers from the 16 selected. 3. **Range of Sums**:    Among these 120 pairs, the sums differ. The smallest possible sum we can have from two numbers chosen from 1 to 100 is 1 + 2 = 3, and the largest possible sum is 99 + 100 = 199. Therefore, there are at most 199 - 3 + 1 = 197 possible different sums. 4. **Pigeonhole Principle**:    By the pigeonhole principle, since we have 120 pairs and 197 possible sums, it must be true that there is a repetition in sums. Since 120 > 99, at least two of these pairs must have the same sum. 5. **Symmetric Arrangements**:    Let's assume our selected sums lead to pairs of the form (z, y, x) and they can repeat. Because the principle laid out shows that with our constraints, at least 21 sums will be the same (since 120 text{ pairs} - 99 text{ unique sums} = 21 over repetitions). 6. **Constructing the Pairs**:    If we look for such repetition, we direct our approach towards symmetry:     z - y = y - x      We can restructure this equation to:     z + x = 2y     Let’s generalize this. We want to find multiple occurrences of these pairings among our 16 numbers. Since our constraints limit the middle number y to occur distinctively at least 14 times within such triples, we get:     z_{1} neq z_{2}, ( x_{1} neq x_{2}, and a common y    Therefore, we can assert:     z_{1} + x_{1} = 2 y = z_{2} + x_{2}  7. **Final Structure**:    Provided these conditions, x_{1}, x_{2}, z_{1}, and z_{2} are unique and distinct values. 8. **Additional Repetition**:    If we assume without further symmetric pairs, here's the critical scenario:    For the remaining at least seven repetitions, in which symmetry was not confined nor violated by z from w, then we assert x, y, z, w distinct:     x - y = z - w     Simplifies to:     x + w = y + z  9. **Conclusion**:    By proving through construction intervals and the pigeonhole principle, we ascertain we can always form subsets totaling sums for pairs. # Conclusion: Thus, we confirm that it is impossible to choose 16 distinct numbers from the first 100 natural numbers without finding at least one set of four numbers where the sum of one pair equals the sum of another pair. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"The salary of a worker is first increased by some percentage and afterwards reduced by 15%.

Using the double angle identity for cosine, we have cos(2α) = cos^2(α) - sin^2(α) = -frac {4}{5}. Since cos^2(α) + sin^2(α) = 1, we can divide both sides of the equation by cos^2(α) + sin^2(α) to get: frac {cos^{2}α - sin^{2}α}{cos^{2}α + sin^{2}α} = -frac {4}{5} This simplifies to: frac {1 - tan^{2}α}{1 + tan^{2}α} = -frac {4}{5} Solving for tan(α), we get tan(α) = ±3. However, since α is in the interval (frac {π}{2}, π), tan(α) must be negative. Therefore, tan(α) = -3. Now, we need to find tan(α + frac {π}{4}).
