Kevin Maurice Garnett (born May 19, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 21 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played the power forward and center positions. In high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and won a national player of the year award. He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. On June 28, 2013, the day of the NBA draft, the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets reached a deal to trade Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry for future first-round picks in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 drafts, as well as Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Kris Joseph, MarShon Brooks and Keith Bogans. The deal was finally completed on July 12, with Brooklyn also receiving D. J. White. Garnett chose to wear number 2 to honor his former Minnesota Timberwolves teammate Malik Sealy.  On December 13, 2013, Garnett surpassed 14,000 career rebounds, becoming only the tenth player in NBA history to do so. In reaching the milestone, Garnett also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone as the only players to reach 25,000 points, 14,000 rebounds and 5,000 assists. He reached the milestone in the third quarter of a 103-99 road loss to the Detroit Pistons. The Nets cherished Garnett's leadership and passion. Despite boasting a starting line-up of Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Paul Pierce, and Garnett, the Nets were unable to advance past the second round of the playoffs, while Garnett finished his 19th NBA season with career low averages of 6.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per game.  On November 1, 2014, Garnett had arguably his best game for the Nets as he recorded 18 points and 14 rebounds in 35 minutes of action in the Nets' 102-90 win over the Detroit Pistons. Six days later, he recorded five rebounds in a 110-99 win over the New York Knicks and by doing so, passed Walt Bellamy for ninth place on the all-time rebounding list.","output":"This text is about Kevin Maurice Garnett, an American former professional basketball player who played for 21 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA)."},{"instruction":"Process:  - Forest fires burn forests - The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide - Predators can now find their prey eaiser - Birds will fly away from the area - Waters warm up which hurts the fish swimming in them.  suppose lack of rain leaves the forest dry and a campfire is not extinguished correctly happens, how will it affect less birds will fly away.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the recycling process for aluminum cans begins with the collection of used cans from various sources such as homes, offices, schools, and recycling bins located in public areas. These cans are then transported to a treatment plant for further processing. This step is crucial for efficiently managing waste and promoting recycling, as aluminum is a valuable and widely used material that can be repeatedly recycled without losing its quality. During the collection process, it is important to ensure that aluminum cans are separated from other waste materials like plastic, glass, or paper. This can be done by having dedicated recycling bins for aluminum cans, or by implementing waste sorting programs that educate the public about separating different types of recyclable materials. Once aluminum cans are collected and delivered to the treatment plant, they undergo a series of steps to clean, sort, and prepare them for reprocessing. This may include: 1. Sorting: Aluminum cans are separated from other materials (if not already done in the collection process) using a combination of manual labor and automated machines like conveyor belts and magnetic separators. 2. Cleaning: The cans are cleaned to remove any residual liquid, food particles, or other contaminants. This may be done using water, air, or other cleaning solutions. 3. Crushing or shredding: To save space and make transportation easier, the cans are usually crushed or shredded into small, compact pieces. 4. Reprocessing: The aluminum pieces are then melted in a large furnace, creating molten aluminum. This remelting process allows the aluminum to be refined and eliminates any impurities. 5. Cooling and casting: The molten aluminum is poured into molds and formed into large blocks called ingots. These ingots are allowed to cool and harden. 6. Rolling: The ingots are sent to mills, where they are heated and rolled out into thin sheets. These sheets are then coiled and transported to manufacturing facilities. 7. New products: The thin aluminum sheets are then used to create new products, such as cans, foil, automotive components, and many other items. The recycling process reduces waste, conserves resources, and contributes to a more sustainable future. By collecting and processing used aluminum cans, not only do we reduce the amount of materials that end up in landfills, but we also decrease the demand for freshly mined aluminum, which can have significant environmental impacts. A great benefit to recycling aluminum is that it can be processed and reused infinitely, making it an optimal material for sustainable practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: It's for jewellery, I believe, but there might be something else in it. The key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and searched inside. Sentence 2: Julius opened it up and looked inside. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"In evaluating the truth of both sentences, it is important to examine the context, events, and conditions of each statement. Let's break down each sentence and analyze them separately before comparing them. Sentence 1: \\"It's for jewellery, I believe, but there might be something else in it. The key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and searched inside.\\" - In this sentence, it is suggested that the object in question is likely meant for jewelry, but there could be something else within it too. The sentence goes on to describe that Julius finds the key in the lock, opens the door, and proceeds to search inside the object. Sentence 2: \\"Julius opened it up and looked inside.\\" - This sentence describes Julius' action of opening the object and looking inside. This sentence is more concise than the first one, and it does not provide any information on what the object is meant for or if there was a key found in a lock. Now, let's try to assess if the second sentence is true, assuming that the first one is true.  From the first sentence, we know that Julius opened the door with the key found in the lock and searched inside. Considering this information as a series of events, we can reason that after finding the key in the lock and opening the door, Julius must have looked inside. In this scenario, one could argue that \\"looking inside\\" is equivalent to Julius \\"searching inside\\" as described in the first sentence.  From this perspective, it is reasonable to say that the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Both sentences describe, albeit with varying amounts of detail, that Julius opened the object and engaged in some form of observation or exploration of its contents. The first sentence provides more context and detail on what the object might contain and the method by which Julius opened it, whereas the second sentence is a more straightforward description of Julius' actions (opening the object and looking inside). Given this, if we accept the first sentence's depiction of events as true, we can also conclude that the second sentence is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His demeanor and bearing stand out in contrast to the rag tag prisoners he shares the camp with in part because of his willingness to ostensibly advance on the needs of others. He is constantly scrutinized by Lieutenant Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp police chief, as he has gotten reports that King has robbed fellow prisoners in a poker game. It is clear that King takes pleasure in living on what would be considered a clear example of the American Capitalist version of supply and demand. He seeks ways to increase his organization by recruiting talented men like Peter Marlowe (James Fox), an English soldier who speaks fluent Malay, but refuses King's offering of money for his services. Marlowe attempts to live by a code that bonds men in a way that transcends any financial gain, and in fact considers King an actual friend because he and the American are interned together under Japanese rule. King extends his operation to include trading valuables to the Japanese and breeding rats to sell as food to the officers as a delicacy, activities that Marlowe is happy to aid in because of the smart commercial way that the schemes are launched. The ability to gain valuable items including medical supplies becomes important when Marlowe injures himself and faces serious physical danger. As Lieutenant Grey closes in to mete out the camp law enforcement, his code of conduct conflicts with Marlowe, his cabin mate. Theirs is a philosophy differing slightly and both based on survival with the most reaffirming respect for fellow man they can develop under these war conditions. As Grey attempts to arrest King and Marlowe for their criminal activity it becomes clear that the commanding officers live by a fractured value system.

Write a text based on \\"voting underway in azerbaijan 's controversial election\\" Text:","output":"Title: The Complex Scenario of Azerbaijan's Controversial Election: Voting Underway Amidst High Tensions Introduction: As voting gets underway in Azerbaijan's highly debated election, the atmosphere in the nation continues to be tense. The controversial election has been widely discussed due to several factors, including allegations of government oppression, irregularities in the voting process, and concerns over the outcome's potential impact on regional stability. The election has drawn the attention of international observers and has led to a debate on the importance of democracy, human rights, and transparency in the election process. Background of the Controversy: The controversy over the elections in Azerbaijan can be traced back to several key issues. First, critics argue that the ruling party has maintained a stronghold on power, limiting the role of opposition parties and suppressing dissent. This has created a one-sided political playing field that lacks checks-and-balances and raises concerns over the fairness of the elections. Secondly, there have been reports of election fraud and irregularities in the past, casting doubt over the integrity and reliability of the voting process in Azerbaijan. These irregularities include instances of ballot-stuffing, voter intimidation, and manipulation of voter information. Some have argued that these tactics serve the interests of the ruling party, undermining the democratic principles that should govern any election process. Lastly, geopolitical tensions in the region have raised concerns over the election's implications for broader stability. Given Azerbaijan's strategic position in the Caucasus, bordering countries like Iran, Russia, and Turkey, the outcome of the election could have significant repercussions in international relations and may influence regional dynamics. The State of Voting in Azerbaijan: As the voting process commences, concerns have persisted regarding the transparency and fairness of the election. International observers are on the lookout for signs of irregularities and any issues that may compromise the authenticity of the vote. Concerns have also been voiced about the possibility of repression, with reports of opposition figures being silenced or intimidated as they attempt to participate in the voting process. Despite these challenges, some citizens still maintain hope for a fair and democratic election. It has been reported that voter turnout is higher than expected, potentially signaling a strong desire for change and the belief that their voice can make a difference in the electoral outcome. While the voting process is taking place, it remains to be seen whether the election will be a legitimate reflection of the will of the Azerbaijani people or will be defined by ongoing allegations of fraud and intimidation. International Response and Implications: As the world watches Azerbaijani's controversial election unfold, many international actors are carefully analyzing the situation. Praise for the high voter turnout is often accompanied by calls for increased transparency in the electoral process and respect for democratic principles. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is one of the key international observers in the election. Their role will be crucial in determining the credibility and legitimacy of the vote, as well as addressing any concerns that arise from the voting process. Ultimately, the outcome of the Azerbaijani election will have implications not only for the country's domestic politics but also for the broader regional and international landscape. The extent of electoral transparency and adherence to democratic principles may serve as a litmus test for future political developments in Azerbaijan and throughout the region. Conclusion: As Azerbaijan's controversial election grips the nation and the world, many are looking to the vote as a test of the country's commitment to democratic ideals and a sign of its future trajectory. Despite concerns over government repression, voting irregularities, and regional tensions, the Azerbaijani people have demonstrated a strong desire for political change and an opportunity to exercise their right to vote. It remains to be seen whether the election will reflect the real will of the people, but it is certain that this significant moment in Azerbaijani history will serve as an important test of democratic values and will continue to have a lasting impact on the nation's political landscape and its role in regional and global affairs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English","output":"\\"When I am here, one gigabit costs me 9,900 EUR, and when I travel to another member state, I can pay 14,900 EUR.\\" The sentence provided is in Romanian, and it describes the price of one gigabit in two different situations: when the person is present in their current location, it costs 9,900 EUR, while traveling to another member state (presumably referring to a European Union member state) incurs a higher cost of 14,900 EUR. This might be referring to the cost of a high-speed internet connection, specifically the capacity of one gigabit, which is a measure of data transfer speed. Internet service providers use this metric to advertise their plans and the corresponding prices for them. In this context, it seems that the person is emphasizing the difference in pricing when comparing the costs in their home country and when traveling within the European Union. It is important to note that costs for such services can vary significantly, depending on factors such as the country, provider, quality of the network infrastructure, and competitive landscape. Particularly in the European Union, the Digital Single Market strategy has aimed to reduce the disparities between member states when it comes to digital services and products. Nonetheless, there might still be considerable price differences between countries, reflecting the diverse economic, geographical, and market situations. In summary, the translation of the sentence from Romanian to English tells us about the costs of one gigabit for the person in the current location and when traveling to another European Union member state. It highlights the variation in costs for such services, emphasizing the potential differences in pricing among EU countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He took on this identity to expand his crime-fighting capabilities and access new strengths, like giant size and superhuman strength, that are significantly different from those of Ant-Man. Dr. Pym continued to evolve and experiment with his size-changing technology, which led him to assume other superhero identities, such as Goliath and Yellowjacket.

You will need :  Aloe barbadensis miller plant 1 tablespoons (15ml) of white vinegar (optional) 1 cup (8 oz) water (optional) 1 cup (8 oz) of any citrus based juice.  Break off a few leaves from an aloe barbadensis miller plant.","output":"To make aloe vera juice, follow these steps: 1. Preparing the aloe vera leaves: After breaking off a few leaves from the aloe barbadensis miller plant, wash them thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris. It is recommended to use mature leaves as they contain more gel. Remove the spiky edges using a sharp knife, being careful not to cut yourself. 2. Extracting the aloe vera gel: Next, lay the leaves flat on a cutting board with the concave side facing upwards. Use the knife to carefully slice off the top layer of the leaf, exposing the clear aloe vera gel underneath. Using a spoon, scoop out the gel and place it in a clean bowl. Repeat this process for each leaf. 3. Blending the gel: Place the extracted aloe vera gel in a blender. If you would like to thin the consistency of the juice, you can add 1 cup (8 oz) of water or any citrus-based juice such as orange juice, lemon juice, or even grapefruit juice. This will not only make the juice thinner but add a nice tang to the taste. 4. Vinegar (optional): If you would like to preserve the aloe vera juice for a longer time, you can add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of white vinegar, which will act as a natural preservative. This step is optional, and you can skip it if you plan to consume the juice immediately or store it in the refrigerator for a short period. 5. Blend the ingredients: Blend the aloe vera gel, water or citrus juice, and vinegar (if using) until it reaches a smooth consistency. You can adjust the thickness of the juice by adding more water or citrus juice. 6. Straining the juice: Although optional, it is advisable to strain the blended aloe vera juice through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove any remaining pulp and ensure the juice is smooth. Collect the strained juice in a clean jar or container. 7. Refrigerate and serve: Store the aloe vera juice in the refrigerator and consume it within a week. Shake the container well before serving, as the juice may settle and separate. Enjoy the refreshing and healthy aloe vera juice, either by itself, mixed with other fruit juices, or added to smoothies. Aloe vera juice has numerous health benefits, including aiding digestion, boosting the immune system, and promoting skin health. Just make sure to use the aloe barbadensis miller plant, which is safe for consumption, and avoid ingesting the yellow sap in the leaves, which can be toxic. Always consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns about consuming aloe vera juice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Scientists have just landed on both and are in the process of analyzing the environment and atmosphere of each planet. What is immediately apparent is that both planets are remarkably similar to Earth since both are oxygen rich and do not require a space suit to breathe. Another similarity that one of the planets, Jarthrow, has with Earth is that it naturally outputs approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as Earth does. The other planet, Millhouse, outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases. Climate scientists are rushing to try to see if anything new can be discovered to help out our planet with these new discoveries.  Of the new planets, which one has more trapped terrestrial radiation? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Millhouse has more trapped terrestrial radiation. Here are the steps to justify the conclusion: 1. Greenhouse gases trap heat, also called terrestrial radiation, that Earth and other planets emit. When a planet has a higher concentration of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere, it retains more heat, leading to a warmer climate. 2. Jarthrow outputs approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as Earth does, while Millhouse outputs twice as many greenhouse gases.  3. Since Millhouse has a higher concentration of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere, it is expected to trap more terrestrial radiation compared to Jarthrow or Earth.

I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? pick from the following. I. no. II. yes.","output":"If you delete WhatsApp, the messages sent to you while your WhatsApp was deleted will be delivered to you when you reinstall it again, provided you restore your chat backup from a previous backup. WhatsApp, by default, backs up your chats and messages on your phone and, in some cases, to cloud storage like Google Drive or iCloud. However, there is a catch: the messages sent to you will only be stored on the WhatsApp server for 30 days. If you reinstall WhatsApp after 30 days, messages sent during the deletion period will be lost and will not be delivered to you. To restore your chat backup when reinstalling WhatsApp, simply follow the prompts during the initial setup process. You will be asked if you want to restore your chats from a backup, and you must agree to do so. This will allow any messages sent to you during the deletion period, within the 30-day window, to be delivered when you reinstall. As for knowing if you're blocked on WhatsApp, there are a few signs you can look for: 1. Last Seen: If you can no longer see the \\"last seen\\" timestamp of the person you suspect has blocked you, it may be an indication that you have been blocked. However, keep in mind that the person could have also disabled this feature in their privacy settings. 2. Profile Picture: If the person's profile picture never changes or you can't see it at all, this might also be a sign that you have been blocked. Again, this is not definitive, as they might have changed their privacy settings or not have a profile picture set. 3. Status updates: Any status updates by the person who you suspect has blocked you will not be visible to you. 4. Message sent ticks: When you send a message to someone, WhatsApp shows a series of checkmarks to indicate the status of the message. One gray checkmark means it's sent, two gray checkmarks mean it's delivered, and two blue checkmarks mean it's read. If you're sending messages to someone you believe has blocked you and you only see one gray checkmark, it could be that they've blocked you. 5. Calling: If you try to call the person on WhatsApp and the call doesn't go through or doesn't connect, this could indicate a block. However, keep in mind that the user could also have connection issues or have their phone turned off. The only definitive way to know if you're blocked on WhatsApp is if you have multiple signs together. Even then, there might be other reasons for these signs appearing.

The President, his young daughter, portions of his staff, Constance and the Levinsons narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as a destroyer lays waste to Washington D.C.On July 3, the United States conducts a coordinated counterattack; the movie follows the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, as they participate in an assault on the destroyer that has devastated the city of Los Angeles. Their weapons fail to penetrate the craft's force field, and it responds by releasing scores of smaller \\"attacker\\" ships which are similarly shielded and armed with high-energy torpedoes. One-sided dogfights ensue. Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) manages to evade the guns of the attacker ships and lures a single attacker to the Grand Canyon. There, as his jet is about out of fuel and the attacker is about to overtake him, he deploys the landing chute for his jet and it drapes across the alien craft, temporarily disorienting the pilot. Captain Hiller then ejects from his jet. The alien crashes into the top of the canyon wall... My question: What is the date?

Movie title: Fly Away Home Context: After her mother dies in a car accident, 13-year-old Amy Alden (Anna Paquin) is brought from New Zealand to Ontario, Canada, by her estranged father Thomas Alden (Jeff Daniels), a sculptor and inventor, to live with him and his girlfriend Susan (Dana Delany). When a construction crew destroys a small wilderness area near the Alden home, Amy finds a nest of goose eggs. Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David (Terry Kinney) knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her fatherâs old barn to incubate. When the eggs have hatched, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local game warden Glen Seifert (Jeremy Ratchford) on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have imprinted on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that all domestic geese must have their wings pinioned (clipped) to render them flightless, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them. Thomas decides to use an ultralight aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry (Holter Graham), Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own, so she can teach the geese. David mentions knowing someone running a bird sanctuary in North Carolina, and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development.     Thomas (Jeff Daniels) attempts to get the geese to follow him.

We can imagine the following scenario unfolding in further detail: As the house lights dim and a hush falls over the audience, the curtains begin to draw back, revealing a beautifully designed set. Intricate and delicate, the set provides a perfect backdrop for the upcoming ballet performance. The ballerinas, poised on stage, stand close together in the starting positions of the choreography, awaiting the first notes of the orchestra to start playing. In this moment, the tension in the air is palpable. The audience members lean forward in anticipation, eager to witness the grace and artistry that ballet is known for. Meanwhile, the ballerinas, with dancers' nerves held in check, are keenly focused on delivering a flawless and powerful performance. As the music commences, the dancers' movements synchronize perfectly with the melodious notes. The initial choreography showcases the four ballerinas as if they were one unified entity, effortlessly gliding across the stage as they perform intricate movements and delicate turns. With their light and airy steps, they seem to defy gravity – every jump and lift accentuating their impressive physical prowess and grace. The story weaved into the ballet unfolds as the ballerinas travel through diverse emotions and challenges. The choreographer has designed individual solo performances to highlight each dancer's unique talents. Each solo adds another layer to the narrative, drawing the audience deeper into the world they are creating with every step, turn, and jump. In concert with the captivating storyline, the dancers utilize their technical skill to bring the sentiment and emotional depth of the music to life. Captivating the audience, they display the fluidity, elegance, and high degree of discipline that has been honed through years of intense and dedicated practice. As the performance builds toward its climax, the four ballerinas come together once again in perfect harmony, visibly connected by their shared passion and commitment to their art form. Their movements become even more dynamic – the leaps higher, the turns faster, and the lifts seemingly more gravity-defying. The audience cannot help but be wholly absorbed by the visually and emotionally stunning display on stage. As the music reaches its crescendo and the dancers execute their final movements, the auditorium resonates with a feeling of awe and admiration. The ballerinas, panting and flush with the exertion of their performance, freeze in a final tableau, gracefully capturing the essence of the story in a single, breathtaking moment. The spell that the ballet has cast on the audience gently breaks, and as the music fades, the auditorium bursts into rapturous applause."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was a student but was also, technically, a professional?, what is it ?

Upon sitting down we we handed a menu from one of the most disinterested waitressess I have experienced.  The young woman had pretty no interest in taking our order or answering questions which was probably because she did not know the answer.  We asked about one of the deserts and she had to go in the back to ask.  As it turns out it did not matter what the answer was, the desert was not available.    The menu selection was on the small side which is not a bad thing if the quality is outstanding.  Sadly, outstanding is not a word to describe any portion of our lunch.  My gf and I split a few items on the menu.  We had the Taboule Salad, Lentil Soup and a side of fries with feta cheese and a vinegar sauce.    The lentil soup was almost passable, but it had a certain blandness.  When the taboule was brought to the table the chef, maybe owner, gave a disclaimer \\"hope you like it really sour\\".  Turns out it was inedible and we returned it. The fries with feta and vinegar sauce had such potential for a junk food moment, the feta was yummy and the vinegar sauce was good, but they served all the yummy stuff on frozen crinkle cut fries, how sad.

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"To answer the question \\"Which is not a species of bird: passerine, kiwi, or chick?\\", we need to identify the terms mentioned in the text and determine if they are species of birds or not. Let's analyze the text step by step: 1. Incubation of eggs is discussed in general to provide information and context. 2. In monogamous and polygamous species, the process of incubation is described, but no specific bird species are mentioned here. 3. Brood patches are mentioned, which are a characteristic of incubating birds, but again, no specific species are identified. 4. Albatrosses are mentioned as an example of a bird that experiences weight loss during incubation, which indicates that albatrosses are bird species. However, they are not in the list of options (passerine, kiwi, or chick), so we continue our search. 5. Megapodes are mentioned, although also not among the options, we are looking for. 6. Finally, we reach the sentence that says, \\"Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\" In this sentence, passerines and kiwis are both mentioned as bird species since they have defined incubation periods.

However, to answer the question about which two empires fought to control Afghanistan, it is crucial to specify the time period in question. Historically, many empires clashed over Afghanistan's strategic location. Nonetheless, two of the most prominent empires that fought to control the region were the British and Russian Empires during the 19th and early 20th centuries, a period known as the \\"Great Game.\\" The \\"Great Game\\" was a political struggle between the British and Russian empires, primarily resulting from their desire to expand their territories and maintain influence in Central Asia. Afghanistan was located between these two empires, with British India to the south and the Russian Empire to the north. During this time, a series of Anglo-Afghan Wars took place, with Britain attempting to maintain control and influence in Afghanistan while keeping the Russians from advancing into the area. The first Anglo-Afghan War was from 1839 to 1842, followed by the second war from 1878 to 1880, and the third war in 1919.  In these wars, the British aimed to install a more compliant leadership in Afghanistan to prevent Russian influence and expansion. Conversely, the Russians sought to fortify their position in Central Asia. Afghanistan was a highly prized territory as it served as a gateway between the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Additionally, Afghanistan's natural resources and geographical position made it an important juncture for trade and communication. Therefore, both empires fought fiercely for control over this strategic territory. In conclusion, the British and Russian Empires were involved in a bitter struggle to control Afghanistan during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Although various empires have historically risen and fallen in the region, the two empires that most notably fought for control during this specific period were the British Empire and the Russian Empire amid the \\"Great Game.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The reason behind this trouble is the ongoing argument in higher education between lecturers and employers over pay.The Association of University Teachers(AUT)are currently taking industrial action because of the fact that lecturers have been underpaid for years.Vice-presidents of the universities,who enjoy six-figure salaries,are not making any noises to suggest that this will change in the near future. The National Union of Students(NUS) ly believes that our lecturers should be better paid,and that the promises made to them during the top-up fees debate about extra income must be kept. It's shameful that 1ecturers have had to take industrial action to achieve better pay and conditions while vice-presidents'own salaries have risen 25%over the past three years.But the students who are suffering as a result of the argument must be put first.We do not agree with the attitude taken by the AUT,which is refusing to set exams.We admit that the decision to take this course of action was democratically reached.However,it is having the biggest effect on our members at this moment in time and we will continue to let the AUT know the results of this. We call on both sides to sort this mess out.Hopefully then our members can get the horrible exam season Out of the way and start planning,and enjoying,their upcoming summer holiday.

In developing their Far East trade, the Dutch also began to frequent the island.

The city's underbelly is run by powerful criminal syndicates, and the law enforcement is struggling to maintain order. Step 2: Introduce the main character Max, our protagonist, is a highly skilled hacker and ex-cybersecurity expert who was framed for a high-profile data breach that costed him his career, reputation, and family. Embittered by the situation, he decides to go rogue and seek revenge against the three individuals responsible for his downfall. Step 3: Identify the three targets and their roles Stella is a cunning, high-ranking member of the corrupt police unit that fabricated evidence against Max. She capitalized on Max's skills by ensuring his accountability for the crimes committed. Nerve is a shady underworld figure and the main mastermind of the data breach. Nerve manipulated Max through blackmail and deceit, forcing him to participate in the cyber crime without his knowledge. Toby is a former colleague and friend of Max, who betrayed him to gain a higher position in the cybersecurity industry. Despite being aware of Max's innocence, Toby chose to testify against him in court for his personal gain. Step 4: Develop the conflicts and obstacles Max, with his skills in hacking and other cyber espionage tactics, begins to plot revenge against Stella, Nerve, and Toby. He encounters several obstacles, including advanced surveillance systems, hired assassins, and the omnipresent threat of betrayal from unexpected allies. Step 5: Introduce a twist While working to unravel the complex criminal network, Max uncovers a hidden truth: the data breach exposed a massive scale of corruption within the city's government and law enforcement.

UPDATED:. 20:05 EST, 10 May 2013. Repeat: Tony Martin, who killed an intruder in 1999, has been burgled again and he chased the intruder off his farm. A farmer jailed for shooting dead a burglar has told how he was too scared to tackle an intruder this week in case he was branded a criminal. Tony Martin, 67, confronted a man stealing a tractor battery on Thursday, but felt he had to let him go. The pensioner said he wished he had tried to stop him, but was afraid to defend his property after being locked up in 2000. Mr Martin, who no longer holds a gun licence, said he realised ‘it would be me in trouble’. He added: ‘I couldn’t face going through all that again.’ The farmer fired three shots in 1999 after finding two burglars inside his remote Cambridgeshire home. He killed Fred Barras, 16, and wounded his accomplice, Brendon Fearon, then 29. Mr Martin was initially jailed for nine years after being convicted of murder, but it was reduced to manslaughter on appeal, and he was released after three years. The case sparked fierce debate over whether homeowners should be given greater legal protection to defend their property. Two days ago, Mr Martin caught a man breaking into a barn on his 14-acre property, but felt powerless to stop him. He said he had already been burgled ‘two or three times’ since he was released from jail. He said: ‘I could easily have made it, and fought him for what he’d stolen, but then it quickly flashed through my mind that it would be me in trouble, not him. ‘There were weapons inside the shed so, if I had wanted to fight him off, I could have. I wished I had but, after everything I’ve been through in the past, I just couldn’t face all that hassle again. ‘I haven’t changed my views about what happened in 1999, but the whole experience has made me lose faith in the system and I didn’t want to be made out as the criminal again.’ Mr Martin, who never moved back into the farmhouse where both burglaries took place, was checking his outbuildings when he came across the intruder. He claimed the man, in his 20s, had a £90 tractor battery and a new sink unit in his arms. Incident: This is farmer Tony Martin's property, who has again been targeted by burglars again. These out buildings were allegedly where the thief was seen. Attempt: The thief allegedly tried to steal a tractor battery before being chased away by Mr Martin. As the burglar fled – dropping the stolen items – Mr Martin said he shouted: ‘Come back again and I’ll sort you my way.’ Yesterday he vowed not to let the burglar get away for a second time. He said: ‘He ran away but I’m convinced he’ll be back in my barn and then he’ll wish he wasn’t.’ He said little had changed to protect homeowners since his imprisonment, saying: ‘I don’t think we’re any safer than we were then. ‘I still feel vulnerable and am unable to properly protect myself.’ Scene: The garden and overgrown Bleak House, where Tony Martin shot three times at two burglars and killed one in 1999. In October last year, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said householders who react with ‘proportionate’ force when confronted by burglars would receive more legal protection. Last month, a law finally came into force to give householders the right to ‘bash a burglar’, but with a string of exemptions attached. For example, people will not be protected if they chase the burglar outside – and any fight must take place indoors. Yesterday, Mr Martin was said to be so ‘distressed’ by the attempted theft that he sought hospital treatment. He asked officers at Wisbech Police. Station, in Cambridgeshire, to ‘detain’ him for his own protection,. claiming he was suffering from ‘delayed shock’. Mr Martin, who has suffered from. depression in recent years, was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in. King’s Lynn, Norfolk, where he was assessed by doctors. Intruders: 16 year old Fred Barras was shot dead by Mr Martin while Brendan Fearon escaped. Later he said: ‘I am here for my own sanity and the safety of burglars. I can’t stand burglars. I think they are a filthy lot.’ Mr Martin said he had suffered similar health issues in May 1999, when he had reported a string of burglaries on his farm. He said police suggested at the time. that the break-ins, which took place two months before he shot Barras,. might be a ‘figment of his imagination’. A spokesman for Norfolk Police said: ‘Inquiries are on-going.’ What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. Tony Martin, a farmer who was jailed for shooting dead a burglar in 1999, confronted a man stealing a tractor battery on his property but felt he had to let him go, fearing potential legal consequences. 2.

Movie title: Patayin Sa Sindak Si Barbara Context: Being the loving older sister, Barbara (Lorna Tolentino) has always been overly indulgent of her little sister Ruth's every whim. Years later, Barbara meets and instantly falls in love with Nick (Tonton Gutierrez), who is mutually smitten with her. But the spoiled Ruth (Dawn Zulueta) confesses to her older sister that she too is in love with Nick and threatens to kill herself if he does not marry her. So with a heavy heart, Barbara once again passively accommodates Ruth's demands and convinces Nick to court her younger sister instead. In a twisted act of devotion, Nick reluctantly agrees to marry Ruth, to prove his love for Barbara. After the wedding, Barbara then decides to start a new life abroad, to give Nick a chance to truly fall in love with Ruth and for Barbara to get over her feelings for him. Her past comes back to haunt her (in more ways than one) when Barbara receives news that her younger sister has killed herself and was witnessed by Ruth's only daughter Karen (Antoinette Taus). Barbara immediately returns to the Philippines to mourn her sister and comfort her unstable niece. But strange events happen upon Barbara's return and she learns the reason surrounding Ruth's mysterious death. Throughout their marriage, Ruth felt that Nick never really loved her, but instead still harboured feelings for her sister. In a state of paranoid delusion, she suspects that Nick was having an affair and used his business trips to the United States as an excuse to rendezvous with Barbara. In a jealous rage, she commits suicide and haunts the household and everyone she deemed who have wronged her. It was later revealed that ever since Barbara left her for the US, she indulged herself of everything that can ease her helplessness which includes witchcraft and spiritual medium sessions.

Summarize this article: The series, which became a national talking point when it began in 2000, has been resurrected by Channel 5. In April it was announced that the broadcaster had signed a two-year deal with the show's creators Endemol. Gaining notoriety for Nasty Nick's deceit in the first series, sexual encounters among housemates and romances which were later played out in glossy magazines, the programme was initially a huge hit for Channel 4. But a drop in ratings in recent years led Channel 4's director of television Kevin Lygo to announce in 2009 that the show \\"had reached a natural end point\\". 'Positive and interesting' So why is Channel 5 investing so much time and effort in reviving the format? Bosses are hopeful the programme's reincarnation will attract new audiences to the network. Channel 5 owner Richard Desmond has reportedly had a hands-on role in Big Brother's relaunch In pictures: Big Brother house Big Brother through the years \\"This will allow us to connect to a younger audience, and very importantly, we will continue to serve the viewers who love us,\\" says Jeff Ford, Channel 5's director of programmes. \\"But we're not going to tailor it for a Channel 5 audience because we want all audiences who used to love the show.\\" Speaking at the series launch party in Elstree, where the Big Brother house has been refurbished, he promises fans that the celebrity spin-off of the new series will include only the \\"the biggest, most colourful and interesting names around\\". He says they are focusing on making the programme \\"fun, positive and interesting\\", which reflects the brand values of the channel. 'Ratings gods' Tim Hincks, chief executive of Endemol, says the regular version of the series, which begins immediately after the three-week celebrity series, is going to be \\"entertaining, funny, glamorous and occasionally sexy\\". According to reports, Channel 5 owner Richard Desmond has been closely involved in the preparation for the new show, even selecting contestants himself. The media mogul, who also owns the Daily Star, the Daily Express and OK! magazine, has high hopes for Big Brother, telling the Media Guardian he wants to generate huge ratings of at least 20 million viewers. But how can a show that ran for 10 years and was given a thorough send-off be successfully resurrected? Former Big Brother winner Brian Dowling, who is replacing presenter Davina McCall in the new version, predicts it will be a success because it is \\"missing from people's TV screens\\". The 33-year-old, who won the second series in 2001 and Ultimate Big Brother last year, adds: \\"Let's be honest, Endemol and Channel Five are not spending Â£220m for no good reason. \\"Think about it, Channel 5 is right next to Channel 4 and if people are real fans, they'll watch it regardless of what channel it's on.\\" But some fans are uncertain. Dominic Norwell, 31, from Whitstable in Kent, has watched every series since its inception. By Torin DouglasMedia correspondent, BBC News Can Channel 5 make Big Brother a national talking point again? That depends on whether it has persuaded enough high-profile names to appear on Celebrity Big Brother, the launch pad for the series on its new channel. But more importantly, it depends on coverage in magazines and tabloid newspapers not owned by Richard Desmond. He bought Channel 5 as a way of extending the \\"celebrity\\" focus of his print media empire into TV. Desmond's titles - OK! magazine, the Daily Express, the Daily Star and their Sunday versions - can be relied on to promote Big Brother. So can Channel 5's OK TV! programme, which is relocating to the Big Brother house. The Daily Star proclaims it's the Official Big Brother paper with cover stories and double-page spreads on which celebrities  are tipped to be in or out. But the Sun and the Daily Mirror - which have many more readers - are more interested in ITV's X Factor, \\"counting down\\" to its first show on Saturday. \\"The closure they gave the last series on Channel 4 was too final,\\" he says. \\"To bring it back on a smaller channel is just not going to work. If there's nothing else on, people might migrate over to and flick it on, but it won't be like Channel 4's show where people would plan their Friday nights round the eviction.\\" Media analyst Toby Syfret from Enders Analysis says the success of the programme is \\"immensely important\\" to Channel 5. \\"It's the big buy they have made since last year, there's a lot of money riding on it. \\"There are figures all over the place about what it is worth and with that sort of money they are intending on making a big splash.\\" He says the format - which was broadcast in 87 countries last year - is \\"very important property\\" and could \\"hurt\\" Channel 4 in terms of sales and viewing figures. \\"If you look at the audience trends of Big Brother over the years it's gone down and it is less fashionable for the young than it was some years ago, but it still delivered a very good audience profile. \\"If it's successful it will do the [Channel 5] brand nothing but good.\\" Popular formula Mr Ford is equally confident the show will be a big hit, quoting Kevin Costner's character from the 1989 film Field Of Dreams. \\"If you build it they will come. So we've built it, so obviously because we've built it they're going to come, aren't they? \\"It's in the hands of the ratings gods and I pray to them every night and that's all I can do,\\" he laughs. The ratings formula was not proven when Australian soap Neighbours moved from BBC One to Channel 5 in 2008. The show ended on a Friday and by the following Monday had lost 300,000 viewers. Channel 5's attempt at producing reality TV in the past has not been as successful as its terrestrial counterparts. In 2004 the network launched Back to Reality, which featured stars from other reality shows. The Farm made its debut in the same year, its most memorable moment being Rebecca Loos stimulating a pig for breeding purposes. Neither show was hugely popular, which might explain why producers have decided not to tamper with the successful Big Brother formula. \\"If you were to change the format too much, it wouldn't be Big Brother anymore,\\" says Gavin Henderson, the programme's creative director. He previously worked on the third series of the show, which introduced the late Jade Goody to our screens. A few physical changes will be introduced, he says, which will include a slightly bigger garden and one bedroom instead of two in the Big Brother compound. He adds that there will also be a new approach to editing, which means viewers \\"won't necessarily have to sit and watch it every single day for three months\\". Live streaming of content all day every day has also been replaced with the emphasis now being on following updates on social network sites Twitter and Facebook. No doubt there will be blanket coverage of the show across all of Desmond's publications. But whether that will be enough remains to be seen as channel bosses nervously await the first set of viewing figures on Friday. Celebrity Big Brother begins on Channel 5 on Thursday 18 August at 2100 BST. Summary:","output":"Channel 5 has revived the popular reality TV series Big Brother, after it had initially come to an end in 2009 due to declining ratings. By signing a two-year deal with the show's creators, Endemol, Channel 5 aims to attract new and younger audiences as well as cater to existing fans of the show. They plan to do this by focusing on making the program \\"fun, positive, and interesting\\", which reflects the channel's brand values. The success of the show is considered \\"immensely important\\" to Channel 5, as there is a lot of money riding on it. Channel 5 is hopeful that the inclusion of high-profile celebrities and coverage in magazines and newspapers will generate enough interest to help make Big Brother a popular show once again."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, Brazil's population growth rate has dropped greatly and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. This achievement really becomes the envy of many other Third World countries. Brazil has become one of the developing world's great successes at reducing population growth-----but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had a better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard. Martine  _ , among other things, soap operas(TV series) and installment  plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect role in lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of soap operas. Globo, Brazil's most popular television network, shows three hours of soaps six nights a week, while three others show at least one hour a night. Most TV series are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities. \\"Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction , they describe middle and upper class values-----not many children, different attitudes towards sex, women working,\\" says Martine. \\"They sent this image to all parts of Brazil and made people conscious of other patterns of behavior and other values, which were put into a very attractive package.\\" Meanwhile, the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers. \\"This led to an enormous change in consumption patterns and showed that consumption was in contradiction with unlimited reproduction,\\" says Martine.

In making friends, children learn how to get in touch with the others and solve problems. Having friends even does good to children's study for they can help each other during the class. If the parents care about their children whether they made many friends,what matters is that the child is comfortable and happy with his friends. Parents need to understand the steps children take in building friendships. First of all, be a friend to your child. Good friendships start at home. Children begin to develop the necessary ability to go out and meet others through getting with their parents. Greet the child warmly and let him know you are glad to see him. Children learn a lot from how their parents stay with them and other people. Teach children how to solve conflicts . Being able to work out conflicts is an important skill in getting along with others. If parents know the children have a conflict, let them work it out on their own. Only step in if it is really necessary, for example, an argument is getting physical. Give children chances to practice staying together. Have children play games that require team work and group problem solving skills. For example, races are fun and provide plenty of practice in teamwork. \\"In what ways didn't you work well together?

Oil, Banks Drag Dow Down 1.1% Stocks declined Monday on renewed concerns that some big banks may have issues repaying federal bailout funds and as a slide in oil prices weighed on both energy and materials firms. After rallying about 100 points to start off Monday's session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended lower by 104.22 points, or 1.1%, at 9867.96. A slide in oil prices began just before the stock market's turn into the red, with crude futures settling down 1.82 at 78.68 a barrel. Within the Dow, 27 of its 30 components fell, including energy giants Chevronand Exxon Mobil. As for financials, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that Bank of America's attempt to repay federal bailout funds and escape the government's grasp has been snagged by a disagreement over how much additional capital the bank must raise to satisfy regulators, according to people familiar with the situation. Bank of America slid 5.1%, the biggest decliner on the Dow. Along with the banking and oil concerns, traders cited a flood of other factors depressing stocks, including a gain for the dollar and conflicting reports on whether Congress will extend the tax credit for first-time home buyers. More broadly, traders said the market's decline on Monday reflected increasing skepticism about a seven-month rally in stocks that pushed the Dow to its highest point of the year late last week. \\"The action today is very impulsive and that has added a little more credence to the fear there could be a larger correction in equity markets coming,\\" said Christian Bendixen, director of technical research for Bay Crest Partners. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 12.65, or 1.2%, to 1066.95, weighed down by its materials and financial sectors, which each declined 2.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 12.62 points, or 0.6%, to 2141.85. The decline in oil and other commodities prices restarted a round of concern about global demand in the coming months, a fear that percolated last week as two railroad giants posted weak quarterly reports and transportation stocks fell precipitously. Investors had come into the week somewhat on edge with the Dow up nearly 3% for the month, especially given stocks were up even more in September before a slide in the month's final week. Moreover, any strength for the dollar has been a selling sign for stock traders. After some slight morning gains, the dollar was rallying lately against both the euro and the yen. \\"This gain in the dollar has been building for a couple days,\\" said Adam Boyton, a foreign exchange strategist with Deutsche Bank. As for stocks, Mr. Boyton said \\"people just aren't going to get long the market into the end of the month right now.\\" Treasurys fell, with the two-year note sliding 1/32 to yield 1.029%, and the 10-year note falling 21/32 at 3.567%. The indirect bid for Treasury's reopened five-year TIPS was above average, but market participants were expecting a higher indirect bid since it was the first five-year TIPS sale since Treasury changed auction-bidder rules in June.

Poetry is a form of literary art which uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, prosaic ostensible meaning. Poetry has traditionally been distinguished from prose by its being set in verse;[a] prose is cast in sentences, poetry in lines; the syntax of prose is dictated by meaning, whereas that of poetry is held across metre or the visual aspects of the poem. Prior to the nineteenth century, poetry was commonly understood to be something set in metrical lines; accordingly, in 1658 a definition of poetry is \\"any kind of subject consisting of Rythm or Verses\\". Possibly as a result of Aristotle's influence (his Poetics), \\"poetry\\" before the nineteenth century was usually less a technical designation for verse than a normative category of fictive or rhetorical art.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What will Clinton do if she is elected president? What will Trump do if elected president? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The questions you have posed are not the same, as they pertain to the potential actions of two different individuals, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, if they were elected president. Although both questions address what each candidate would do if elected, the expected actions and policies of these two candidates are distinct due to their differing political affiliations and ideologies. Here, I will provide a detailed analysis of what each candidate might have done if they were elected president. Hillary Clinton: As a former Secretary of State, U.S. Senator, and First Lady, Hillary Clinton has a long history in public service and has laid out several policy proposals during her presidential campaign in 2016. If Hillary Clinton were elected president, we could expect the following actions: 1. Healthcare: Clinton would likely aim to defend and expand the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, with a focus on lowering costs and expanding coverage. She has also advocated for a public insurance option, prescription drug affordability, as well as women's health and reproductive rights. 2. Climate change and clean energy: Clinton has expressed commitment to combating climate change and promoting clean energy development. She would probably support policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, investing in renewable energy infrastructure, and transitioning away from fossil fuels. 3. Economic policies: Clinton proposed raising the federal minimum wage, investing in infrastructure projects to create jobs, and implementing policies to reduce income inequality. Moreover, she would likely push for equal pay for women and measures to support working families, such as affordable child care and paid family leave. 4. Education: Clinton would likely advocate for universal pre-kindergarten education, making college more affordable through debt-free tuition programs for middle-class families, and supporting student loan refinancing options. 5. Immigration: Clinton's stance on immigration includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, defending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and investing in border security. 6. Foreign policy: Clinton would likely continue with existing foreign policy approaches, maintaining the United States' commitment to NATO, supporting Israel, addressing terrorism, and promoting diplomacy over military intervention when possible. Donald Trump: Donald Trump, a businessman turned politician, served as the 45th president of the United States from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021. As observed during his term in office, if elected president again, Trump's actions might include the following: 1. Healthcare: Trump would continue to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, advocating for a free-market healthcare system and pushing for policies like allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines. 2. Climate change and clean energy: Trump has expressed skepticism towards climate change and would likely not make it a priority. He could continue to roll back environmental regulations, promote the use of fossil fuels, and withdraw from international agreements on climate change, such as the Paris Agreement. 3. Economic policies: Trump would emphasize tax cuts, particularly for corporations and the wealthy, in an attempt to stimulate economic growth. He might continue to pursue protectionist trade policies, renegotiating or withdrawing from trade agreements, and potentially imposing tariffs on imports. 4. Education: Trump would probably advocate for school choice, promoting policies that allow families to use public funds to send their children to private or charter schools, and possibly reducing the federal government's role in education. 5. Immigration: Trump would likely continue his hardline stance on immigration, expanding and fortifying the border wall between the United States and Mexico, further restricting legal immigration, and tightening asylum policies. 6. Foreign policy: Trump's foreign policy has been characterized by an \\"America First\\" approach. He might continue to question the United States' involvement in international alliances, seek to negotiate new trade agreements, and pursue a more isolationist foreign policy stance. In conclusion, both questions you asked are not the same but rather focus on the potential actions of two different presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Each candidate would pursue different policies and approaches in handling various issues, including healthcare, climate change, economic development, education, immigration, and foreign policy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Given the fact that:  In erosion, the higher the elevation, the farther the stream is from where it will reach base level and the more cutting it has to do.  Answer the question:   A stream going across a low plain will have to do much or little cutting? The answer is:","output":"A stream going across a low plain will have to do little cutting.  This is because, in erosion, the gradient or steepness of the land plays a significant role in determining the rate at which a stream will erode its bed and banks. As the elevation decreases, the gradient of the stream also decreases, leading to a reduced flow velocity, which in turn reduces the erosive force of the stream.  When a stream flows through a low plain, it is closer to its base level, which is the lowest point to which a stream can erode its bed. As a result, the stream has relatively less energy and therefore less erosive potential, so it requires less cutting of its bed and banks. In addition, the lower gradient of the land in a low plain tends to result in less turbulent flow, further reducing the stream's ability to downcut or erode laterally.  In summary, a stream going across a low plain will have to do little cutting because of the reduced gradient, proximity to its base level, and more gentle, less turbulent flow."},{"instruction":"Remy showed everyone how to bake a delicious cake in the oven.

Hammer et al. found that the Y-chromosome of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews contained mutations that are also common among Middle Eastern peoples, but uncommon in the general European population. This suggested that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East. The proportion of male genetic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with \\"relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim,\\" and a total admixture estimate \\"very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%.\\" This supported the finding that \\"Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.\\" \\"Past research found that 50–80 percent of DNA from the Ashkenazi Y chromosome, which is used to trace the male lineage, originated in the Near East,\\" Richards said.","output":"To extract the answer to the question, I will follow these steps: 1.

Information:  - Wheat (\\"Triticum\\" spp., most commonly \\"T. aestivum\\") is a cereal grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), originally from the Levant region but now cultivated worldwide. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century.  - Islay is the southernmost island of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. Known as \\"The Queen of the Hebrides\\", it lies in Argyll just south west of Jura and around north of the Irish coast. The island's capital is Bowmore where the distinctive round Kilarrow Parish Church and a distillery are located. Port Ellen is the main port.  - Buckwheat (\\"Fagopyrum esculentum\\") is a plant cultivated for its grain-like seeds and as a cover crop. To distinguish it from a related species, \\"Fagopyrum tataricum\\", it is also known as Japanese buckwheat and silverhull buckwheat.  - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.  - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin.  - Amaranthaceae is a family of flowering plants known as the amaranth family. It now includes the former goosefoot family Chenopodiaceae, and contains about 165 genera and 2,040 species. making it the most species-rich lineage within the flowering plant order of Caryophyllales.  - Argyll, archaically Argyle (\\"Earra-Ghàidheal\\" in modern Gaelic ), is an ancient shire of western Scotland. Its area corresponds with most of the modern council area of Argyll and Bute, excluding the island of Bute and the Helensburgh area, but including the Morvern and Ardnamurchan areas of the Highland council area. At present, Argyll (sometimes anglicised as Argyllshire) is one of the registration counties of Scotland.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - Lamiaceae (or ) or Labiatae is a family of flowering plants commonly known as the mint or deadnettle family. Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla. Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as \\"Coleus\\". Others are grown for seed, such as \\"Salvia hispanica\\" (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as \\"Plectranthus edulis\\", \\"Plectranthus esculentus\\", \\"Plectranthus rotundifolius\\", and \\"Stachys affinis\\" (Chinese artichoke).   - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is the local government council for \\"Na h-Eileanan Siar\\" council area of Scotland, comprising the Outer Hebrides.  - The Polygonaceae are a family of flowering plants known informally as the knotweed family or smartweedbuckwheat family in the United States. The name is based on the genus \\"Polygonum\\", and was first used by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789 in his book, \\"Genera Plantarum\\".

It forms part of the area administered by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar or the Western Isles Council.  - Eriskay, from the Old Norse for \\"Eric's Isle\\", is an island and community council area of the Outer Hebrides in northern Scotland. It lies between South Uist and Barra and is connected to South Uist by a causeway which was opened in 2001. In the same year Eriskay became the ferry terminal for travelling between South Uist and Barra. The Caledonian MacBrayne vehicular ferry travels between Ceann a' Ghàraidh in Eriskay and Ardmore in Barra. The crossing takes around 40 minutes.  - The Outer Hebrides, also known as the Western Isles (Scottish Gaelic: ' or ' ), \\"Innse Gall\\" (\\"islands of the strangers\\") or the Long Isle or Long Island (Gaelic: \\"An t-Eilean Fada\\"), is an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland. The islands are geographically coextensive with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, one of the 32 unitary council areas of Scotland. They form part of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch, the Little Minch and the Sea of the Hebrides. Scottish Gaelic is the predominant spoken language, although in a few areas English speakers form a majority.  - Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain. Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles.

It is grown as a grain crop primarily for its edible seeds. It is a pseudocereal rather than a true cereal, as it is not a grass. Quinoa is closely related to species such as beetroot and spinach and amaranth, another pseudocereal (which it closely resembles). After harvest, the seeds are processed to remove the coating containing the bitter-tasting saponins. Generally, the seeds are cooked the same way as rice and can be used in a wide range of dishes. The leaves, meanwhile, are sometimes eaten as a leaf vegetable, much like amaranth, but commercial availability of quinoa greens is limited.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.  - A LAND (Local Area Network Denial) attack is a DoS (Denial of Service) attack that consists of sending a special poison spoofed packet to a computer, causing it to lock up. The security flaw was first discovered in 1997 by someone using the alias \\"m3lt\\", and has resurfaced many years later in operating systems such as Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP SP2.  - Kirkwall is the largest town and capital of the Orkney Islands of Scotland. The town is first mentioned in \\"Orkneyinga saga\\" in the year 1046 when it is recorded as the residence of Rögnvald Brusason the Earl of Orkney, who was killed by his uncle Thorfinn the Mighty. In 1486, King James III of Scotland elevated Kirkwall to the status of a royal burgh; modern roadsigns still indicate \\"The City and Royal Burgh of Kirkwall\\".  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile).  - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals.  - Endosperm is a tissue produced inside the seeds of most of the flowering plants following fertilization. It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch, though it can also contain oils and protein. This can make endosperm a source of nutrition in the human diet. For example, wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread (the rest of the grain is included as well in whole wheat flour), while barley endosperm is the main source of sugars for beer production. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are coconut \\"meat\\" and coconut \\"water\\", and corn. Some plants, such as orchids, lack endosperm in their seeds.  - Health food is food considered beneficial to health in ways that go beyond a normal healthy diet required for human nutrition. No human being being the same as any other, different dietary practices can be considered healthy by different people.  - Bere , pronounced \`\` bear , '' is a six - row barley currently cultivated mainly on 5 - 15 hectares of land in Orkney , Scotland . It is also grown on Shetland , Caithness and on a very small scale by a few crofters on some of the Western Isles , i.e. North Uist , Benbecula , South Uist , Islay and Barra . It is probably Britain 's oldest cereal in continuous commercial cultivation . Bere is a landrace adapted to growing on soils of a low pH and to a short growing season with long hours of daylight , as found in the high latitudes of northern Scotland . It is sown in the spring and harvested in the summer . Because of its very rapid growth rate it is sown late but is often the first crop to be harvested . It is known locally as \`\` the 90 - day barley . ''  - Caithness (, ; Old Norse: \\"Katanes\\") is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area of Scotland.  - South Uist is an island of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. In the 2011 census it had a usually resident population of 1,754, a fall of 64 since 2001. There is a nature reserve and a number of sites of archaeological interest, including the only location in Great Britain where prehistoric mummies have been found. The population is about 90% Roman Catholic. The island, in common with the rest of the Hebrides, is one of the last remaining strongholds of the Gaelic language in Scotland. In 2006 South Uist, and neighbouring Benbecula and Eriskay were involved in Scotland's biggest community land buyout to date. In the north west there is a missile testing range. Its inhabitants are known in Gaelic as \\"\\"Deasaich\\"\\" (Southerners).  - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.    What entity does 'bere ' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?","output":"The information given does not explicitly mention the parent taxon of 'bere'. However, it is mentioned that bere is a six-row barley, which implies that its parent taxon could be the genus Hordeum, as barley, or Hordeum vulgare, belongs to that genus."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Review: read my lips  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The movie review sentence \\"read my lips\\" can be interpreted in various ways as it lacks enough context to clearly determine whether it carries a positive or negative connotation. The phrase \\"read my lips\\" is typically used to emphasize a statement or request that follows, indicating that the speaker is serious about what they are saying. However, in this brief sentence, there is no direct reference to any movie or specific aspect of a movie. If we imagine the sentence as part of a larger review, we can explore both positive and negative interpretations. Positive interpretation: This could be a positive statement if it's followed by a compliment or recommendation. For example: \\"Read my lips – this movie's acting is phenomenal, and the cinematography is breathtaking. I highly recommend watching it!\\" In this context, the phrase is used to draw the reader's attention and emphasize the positive aspects of the movie, making it a positive statement. Negative interpretation: On the other hand, it could also be negative if followed by a critique or warning. For example: \\"Read my lips – this movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is poorly structured, and the characters are underdeveloped.\\" Here, the phrase is employed to stress the negative attributes of the movie, and the statement is decidedly negative. Given the ambiguity of the sentence \\"read my lips\\" as a stand-alone statement, it is impossible to definitively categorize the sentence as either wholly positive or negative. Without further context, a conclusive judgment cannot be made."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The original Renaissance Cruises company had ten ships in its fleet. Here's a breakdown of those ships' current owners and names:  1. Renaissance I - Was scrapped in 2005 after a period as the casino ship Blue Dream.  2. Renaissance II - Was scrapped in 2005 after a period as the casino ship Neptune.  3. Renaissance III - Operated by Silversea Cruises as the Silver Discoverer; currently laid up. 4. Renaissance IV - Operated by Noble Caledonia as the MS Island Sky. 5.

Answer the question...who painted la primavera a painting of the roman goddess flora??","output":"La Primavera, a painting depicting the Roman goddess Flora, is a masterpiece by the Italian Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli. Born Alessandro di Mariano Filipepi in 1445, Sandro Botticelli belonged to the Florentine School during the Early Renaissance period under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici. He produced several prominent art pieces in his lifetime, with 'La Primavera' being one of his most famous works. The painting, which is also known as the Allegory of Spring, was created around 1477-1482 and measures approximately 202 x 314 cm. It is currently housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. In the painting, Botticelli used tempera paints on a wood panel, a common practice of the time. His style was typified by linear grace, flowing lines, and a superb use of color and contrasts. La Primavera features nine figures, including the Roman goddess Flora, arranged on a grassy meadow adorned with a vibrant variety of flowers. The primary characters in the artwork are mythological figures from Roman and Greek mythology. From left to right, they are Mercury, the messenger of the gods; the Three Graces, who embody beauty, charm, and grace; Venus, the goddess of love; Flora, the goddess of flowers and spring; Chloris, the nymph whom Zephyrus, the god of the West Wind, is pursuing; and finally, Zephyrus himself. One of the most striking elements of the painting is the marvelous depiction of the garlanded figure of Flora. She is adorned with flowers that many believe to be botanically accurate, demonstrating Botticelli's attention to detail and ability to expertly capture the beauty of the natural world. Flora is shown scattering flowers and symbolizes the renewal of life as well as the abundance and fertility that comes with springtime. The painting has attracted significant scholarly attention, and various interpretations of its allegorical meaning have been proposed. Some believe that La Primavera is a representation of Neoplatonic love, while others argue that it highlights the theme of marriage and was commissioned on the occasion of a wedding. There are still more interpretations that revolve around the humanist ideals pervading Renaissance Florence. In summary, La Primavera, featuring the Roman goddess Flora, is a remarkable painting that was created by the Early Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli. Combining mythological themes and figures, skillful use of color, and an evident appreciation of beauty and renewal, this artwork has earned its place as an iconic piece of the Italian Renaissance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Broncos responded, with a 13-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos added to their lead, when return specialist Trindon Holliday took the opening kickoff of the second half 105 yards for a touchdown. However, the Bengals would reel off 17 unanswered points, consisting of a 10-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Andy Dalton to wide receiver A. J. Green, a 49-field goal by Nugent followed in the fourth quarter by running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis rushing for a 2-yard touchdown, with the latter two scores coming off Manning interceptions. This gave Cincinnati a 20-17 lead early in the fourth quarter. The Broncos re-claimed the lead on their next possession, with Manning connecting on a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joel Dreessen. Ten plays into the Bengals' next possession, Dalton was intercepted by cornerback Champ Bailey at the Bengals' 46-yard line, and the Broncos subsequently added to their lead eight plays later, with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Decker.

News article: Not A Hack: U.S. Office Of Government Ethics Tweets At Trump      Enlarge this image U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR      The federal ethics watchdog isn't the kind of agency that typically airs its positions on Twitter — let alone in a snarky tone, with exclamation points.      But it's been an all-around weird day at the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.      It started Wednesday morning, when President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter to address concerns about his ability to lead the U.S. government while also holding massive business interests around the world.      \\"While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,\\" Trump tweeted, adding that \\"legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations\\" and that he will be leaving his \\"great business in total.\\"      What exactly that means remains unclear. But the verified Twitter account of the typically decorous federal ethics office chimed in with statements that appeared to goad Trump about divesting his businesses — something he hasn't specifically promised to do.      \\"Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest . Good call!\\" the agency tweeted, mimicking Trump's own tweeting style. And: \\"OGE is delighted that you've decided to divest your businesses. Right decision!\\"      And then things kept getting weirder.      All of the tweets disappeared. Twitter erupted in confusion. Observers were suggesting this was a hack or the work of a rogue employee, as The Washington Post posited:      \\"Maybe the OGE has inadvertently leaked that Trump intends to sell off his assets, a dramatic move that the president-elect may have intended to save for his 'major news conference' Dec. 15. Maybe the tweets are a hacker's social-media joke. Or maybe an OGE official went rogue with the agency's social-media accounts, as a way to sarcastically poke at Trump or, having misread the news, cheer him on.\\"      But then, some hours later, the tweets returned — re-posted all over again, sending a new wave of confusion.      U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR      An OGE spokesman, Seth Jaffe, who is the chief of the agency's ethics law and policy branch, emailed a statement to NPR:      \\"Like everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the President-elect's twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest. OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don't know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.\\"      The statement suggested that the tweets have been deliberate all along. And, in fact, the OGE later confirmed to NPR that this was not a hack.      A few things remained a mystery, among them: Did the OGE know something about Trump's plans that he hasn't made public? As NPR's Scott Detrow has reported:      \\"Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised to turn the Trump Organization over to three of his children. But Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump all remain close political advisers and members of his transition team, so it's hard to see how the Trump Organization and the Trump administration would remain separate, if that remains the case.\\"      Almost two hours after the first statement, the OGE issued another one:      \\"The tweets that OGE posted today were responding only to the public statement that the President-elect made on his Twitter feed about his plans regarding conflicts of interest. OGE's tweets were not based on any information about the President-elect's plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. OGE is non-partisan and does not endorse any individual.\\"      The agency's officials still haven't answered why the tweets — if they were deliberate — initially were deleted.      And more fundamentally, why did the usually straitlaced OGE decide to break character and publicly vocalize its opinion?      Perhaps it's part of a new, Trump-inspired era of governing and social media.

The president-elect made the announcement Wednesday morning on Twitter, telling his followers, “I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”      Story Continued Below      After cryptically posting and then deleting tweets directed at Trump earlier in the day, the OGE sent a flurry of posts praising the president-elect for his “divestiture” from his business holdings. But Trump did not say anything about divesting in his Tuesday morning announcement, and previously pledged only to give control of his companies to his three eldest children, not to remove his financial interests in them.      “.@realDonaldTrump We can't repeat enough how good this total divestiture will be,” the OGE posted to its verified Twitter account, launching the string of tweets. “.@realDonaldTrump Brilliant! Divestiture is good for you, very good for America!”      In some posts, the OGE seemed to mimic Trump’s staccato style on Twitter, writing “.@realDonaldTrump OGE is delighted that you've decided to divest your businesses. Right decision!” and “.@realDonaldTrump Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest . Good call!”      Other posts published by OGE say that the office has had contact with Trump’s lawyers and that it had informed them that “divestiture is the way to resolve these conflicts.” In another post, the OGE wrote: “[W]e told your counsel we'd sing your praises if you divested, we meant it.” Trump’s legal team did not immediately respond to questions about any communication it has had with the OGE.      Historically, presidential candidates have pledged to put their assets into a blind trust if they were to win the White House, a threshold Trump would not meet by simply handing over control of his businesses to his children. Since his surprise victory on Election Day, the Trump children who would take control of his companies have taken on leadership roles on his transition team and have sat in on phone calls and meetings with world leaders.      In a statement released after the posts went public on the OGE’s Twitter account, a spokesman clarified that the office in fact remains unaware of the details of Trump’s plans but nonetheless “applauds” his intentions. It urged him to divest from his business empire, differentiating from the Twitter posts, which suggested Trump has already made such a decision.      “Like everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the President-elect’s twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest,” OGE spokesman Seth Jaffe said. “OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don’t know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.”      Jaffe later clarified that OGE's tweets were responding only to Trump's public comments, \\"not based on any information about the President-elect’s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed.\\"      He added: \\"OGE is non-partisan and does not endorse any individual.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The U.S. Office of Government Ethics, a federal agency, posted some tweets that looked like they were making fun of Donald Trump about his business interests. People thought maybe someone had hacked their Twitter account or that an employee was playing a joke. However, the agency said they were not hacked and they were just excited to see that Trump wants to avoid conflicts of interest with his businesses. They were trying to encourage him to sell his businesses to truly avoid any problems, but it is still not clear what Trump plans to do."},{"instruction":"Given the below context:  The Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company) was established in 1867 by William Austin. Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875. The company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford. A third London estate was planned at Cann Hall, and a site of 61 acres (0.25 km2; 0.10 sq mi) was purchased.However, the Queen's Park project...  Guess a valid title for it!

The mention of students in the line \\"the students mess with them\\" implies the narrator to likely be an authority figure, or teacher, observing the students' interactions with the laptops. Furthermore, the narrator's hope that they receive a decent laptop when their desktop gets replaced, suggests that they may be a part of the same system or institution as the students. While it is true that the statement could potentially be from a student as well, given the options provided, choice iii (the narrator is a teacher) is the most reasonable option.  Choice ii (the narrator is a student) is less probable as such a statement regarding the students' activities sounds more like an authoritative perspective.

Summarize this article: White, French, or sourdough sandwich bread will work great for this, but you can also use other types as well, such as wheat. Do not use baguette for this. For a tasty twist, use mayonnaise instead of butter. Place one of the bread slices, buttered-side-down on the cutting board. Layer the ham and cheese on top, then press the final bread slice on top. Make sure that the buttered side is facing up. When you grill the sandwich, the butter will help make the bread nice and crispy.  The number of slices of ham and cheese does not have to be exact. You can use more/less of ham or cheese depending on your personal taste. Cheddar is the most popular choice, but you can also use other cheeses as well, such as Comté, Gouda, Gruyere, Monterey Jack, or Swiss. For an added punch of flavor, add some ranch dressing on top of the ham and cheese before you put the final slice of bread down. Place a skillet on the stove and let it get hot; you do not need to add any butter on it. Once the skillet is hot enough, place the sandwich on it and let it cook for 2 to 3 minutes. The sandwich is ready when the cheese melts and the bread turns golden brown. Use a heavy pot to press the sandwich down before you flip it and just before you take it off the skillet. This will flatten the sandwich and make it easier to eat. You can serve it as it is, or add a side, such as chips or fries. Summary:","output":"To make a crispy grilled ham and cheese sandwich, choose a suitable bread and consider using mayonnaise instead of butter. Assemble the sandwich with your preferred type and amount of ham, cheese, and optional ranch dressing. Cook the sandwich in a hot skillet for 2-3 minutes until the cheese melts and the bread turns golden brown, using a heavy pot to press it down for easier eating.

(Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\".

Here are possible answers to this question: - depression - revelation - new thought - fatigue - knowledge  I believe the correct choice is \\"fatigue\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"fatigue. When we think hard and long about something, our brain uses a considerable amount of energy to process that information. This, in turn, can lead to mental exhaustion, also known as cognitive fatigue. When we experience cognitive fatigue, our brain function slows down, and our ability to concentrate, retain information, and make decisions become impaired. While the other options like revelation, new thought, and knowledge can indeed be outcomes of hard and long thinking, they do not directly result from the act of thinking itself. On the other hand, fatigue is a direct consequence of extended mental effort. Depression is not the correct choice because, while excessive rumination may exacerbate or contribute to depressive symptoms in some individuals, thinking hard and long is not inherently tied to depression, nor does it cause depression in a general sense. In conclusion, cognitive fatigue best represents the direct outcome of thinking hard and long, making it the correct choice for this question."},{"instruction":"Q: Changing the shape of an elastic material gives it what type of energy?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. All films made before 1912 really need to be viewed with a sense of time and place. In 1894, the Lumiere-family men [father: Antoine (1840-1911), sons: Auguste and Louis] owned and managed a factory that manufactured photographic plates and paper. Not a small enterprise; the factory had more than 200 employees who received pension and social security benefits - innovative for that time. It was located at Montplaisir in the suburbs of Lyon, France. What caused Louis Lumiere to become interested in building a Cinematagraph, in 1894, remains open for speculation. My suggestion is that the appearance of the Edison organization's Kinetoscope (peep-show machine), in Paris during the fall of 1894, provided the catalyst. W.K.L. Dickson, of Edison's staff, invented a motion-picture camera about the size of an upright piano that was patented in February 1893. It was electrically operated (using power from from heavy storage batteries. This massive machine pumped celluloid film strip (newly developed by the Eastman company) past a lens at about 40 frames-per-second (fps). It was ensconced, as an almost immovable object, in the \\"Black Maria\\" (essentially the first movie studio.) The Kinetescope machines showed staged presentations (less than one-minute long)that were filmed in this studio. During 1894, Louis Lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing a moving-picture camera. He had determined that, even at 16 fps on celluloid film, the persistence-of-vision of the human eye/brain would allow for normal motion to be perceived. His camera, dubbed the Cinematograph, was about the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a detachable film magazine that provided storage for enough film to make a shoot last about one minute when it was had cranked past the lens at 16 fps. The size and light weight, of the camera (it could be converted into a printer or a projector by the addition of a light source) made it portable enough that it could be taken to any location to record an event (provided there was enough sunlight available.) In the spring of 1895, Louis filmed: trick-riding by some cavalry men; a house on fire with firemen arriving and dousing the engulfed building with water; and a number of other scenes in and around Lyon. Using a Molteni bulb, he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists assembled in the reception room of the Revue Generales des Science. The images were projected on a screen five-meters distant from the lens. The screen was stretched in a doorway between two rooms. At a meeting of professional photographers, that same year, Louis photographed the arriving delegates and the same evening showed them motion pictures of their arrival. With accolades from both the scientific and photographic communities, Louis decided to have a public exhibition of his invention by the end of the year. Since each of his films would be about one-minute long, he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation. For one of these films he set up his camera at the entrance to his factory, photographing the egress of employees at quitting-time. The public venue chosen by Antoine - who offered himself as the \\"fairground barker\\" for the Cinematograph - was the Salon Indien of the Grand Cafe on the boulevard des Capucines in Paris. It was a wintry Saturday night on 28 December, 1895. As the first audience sat, they were presented with a projected view of the exterior of the Lumiere factory (with closed gates.) Some were chagrined that they were just going to see a routine slide show of Lumiere photographs. But then the crank on the camera/projector was turned and movement began. Louis had an innate sense for motion picture taking. This film has a beginning, a middle and an end. In the beginning, the doors are opened and people begin to leave their workplace; during the middle, the people stream out - with many trying to ignore the camera, and the cameraman, as they seem to be happy to leave a day of labor behind them. At the end, the gates to the factory are being closed. And this was the first film projected for the entertainment of the general public. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"This review can be seen as informative and neutral, as it provides a detailed historical background on the development of motion pictures and the Lumiere family's contribution to the field before 1912. It does not express any positive or negative opinions about the films made during that time, but instead offers an understanding of their significance and the context in which they were created and viewed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Upon the kingdom's establishment soon after World War I, the country suffered from economic decline, budget deficits, and high inflation as a result of the loss of economically important territories under the Treaty of Trianon, including Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The land losses of the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 caused Hungary to lose agricultural and industrial areas, making it dependent on exporting products from what agricultural land it had left to maintain its economy. Prime Minister István Bethlen's government dealt with the economic crisis by seeking large foreign loans, which allowed the country achieve monetary stabilization in the early 1920s. He introduced a new currency in 1927, the pengő. Industrial and farm production rose rapidly, and the country benefited from flourishing foreign trade during most of the 1920s. Following the start of the Great Depression in 1929, the prosperity rapidly collapsed in the country, especially in part due to the economic effects of the failure of the Österreichische Creditanstalt bank in Vienna, Austria. From the mid-1930s to the 1940s, after relations improved with Germany, Hungary's economy benefited from trade. The Hungarian economy became dependent on that of Germany. Question: How many years after the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 did the start of the Great Depression take place? Answer:","output":"The Treaty of Trianon took place in 1920, and the Great Depression started in 1929. To find the number of years between these two events, we can subtract the earlier year from the later year: 1929 (start of the Great Depression) - 1920 (Treaty of Trianon) = 9 years So, the start of the Great Depression took place 9 years after the Treaty of Trianon in 1920."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals - Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes. The answer to this question is:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is the formation of clouds through the process of evaporation and condensation. This essential step is responsible for the initial formation of clouds, which later leads to the development of snowflakes. Here's the detailed explanation of the entire process, including the missing first step: 1. Evaporation and Condensation: The process begins when the Sun's energy heats up water present on the Earth's surface (such as rivers, lakes, and oceans), causing it to evaporate and transform into water vapor. This water vapor then gets carried up into the atmosphere by air currents. As it rises, it cools down and condenses, forming small water droplets around tiny dust particles present in the air. These water droplets eventually cluster together to form clouds. 2. Water droplets are in clouds: Clouds consist of these tiny water droplets that have condensed onto dust particles in the atmosphere. The density and size of the water droplets determine the type of clouds formed (e.g., cumulus, stratus, or cirrus). 3. The air gets cold: For snow to form, the temperature needs to be cold enough so that the water droplets in the cloud will freeze rather than staying in their liquid state or turning into rain. When air currents carry the clouds higher or the surrounding temperature drops, the water droplets in the clouds begin to cool down. 4. Water droplets turn into ice crystals: As temperatures reach or fall below freezing (0°C / 32°F), the water droplets in the clouds start turning into tiny ice crystals. At this stage, these ice crystals are still microscopic and don't yet resemble snowflakes. 5. Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes: As the temperature continues to stay below freezing, the ice crystals in the clouds begin to accumulate and stick together to form snowflakes. When enough ice crystals adhere to one another, they create the distinct snowflake shape we are familiar with. Snowflakes can consist of anywhere from 2 to 200 separate ice crystals, and their unique structure is determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure at the time of formation. Once the snowflakes have formed, they continue to grow and eventually fall to the ground as snow if the atmospheric conditions remain favorable. If the temperature increases before reaching the ground, the snowflakes may melt and turn into rain or other types of precipitation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to reliable sources close to Bonas, the 25-year-old dancer and model has confided in friends that she has no intention of becoming a royal bride within the next year, despite the couple's recent two-year anniversary. The young couple, who were introduced by Princess Eugenie, have been dating since 2012 and Harry has made it abundantly clear that he has fallen head over heels for the lovely Cressida. The 33-year-old prince, who is currently sixth in line for the British throne, has always been candid about his desire to settle down and start a family as his older brother, Prince William, has done with the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton. Friends and insiders close to Bonas claim that although she deeply cares for Harry and their relationship has grown more serious in recent weeks, she is hesitant about taking the plunge into married life. According to their close acquaintances, Cressida is enjoying her career as a dancer and model and is currently at a stage in her life where she is not prepared for the immense responsibility and life changes that come with becoming a royal bride. This hesitancy may come as no surprise for those familiar with the intense public scrutiny and expectations that the royal family endures. As a young woman aspiring to develop her career and make a name for herself in her chosen industry, Bonas may simply not be ready to take on the many obligations that come with marrying into such a prominent family. It is worth mentioning that Cressida has had some experience dealing with media attention, as her half-sister, Isabella Calthorpe, was once romantically linked to Prince William before he married Kate Middleton. However, she may still be cautious about the additional attention and scrutiny she would face if she were to become engaged to Prince Harry, or the possibility of her personal life overshadowing her professional accomplishments. In the meantime, Prince Harry seems to be patiently waiting for his lady love to come around, As he remains smitten with her and prepared to be committed to their relationship. The couple continues to enjoy their time together and build a long-lasting bond. In conclusion, while many royal watchers eagerly await news of a potential engagement, it appears that for now, Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas are content with their current level of commitment. As friends of this young couple have stated, they are very much in love, but Cressida is simply not prepared for the next steps towards marriage at this time. Fans of the royal family will no doubt continue to keep a close eye on this relationship, as they hope that one day, Cressida will warm to the idea of becoming Prince Harry's wife and embracing her role as a member of the British monarchy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells.  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog.

Does \\"Original Loar-signed instruments are sought after and extremely valuable.\\" correctly answer the question of When was the Gibson F-5 largely replicated?","output":"No, the statement \\"Original Loar-signed instruments are sought after and extremely valuable.\\" does not correctly answer the question of when the Gibson F-5 was largely replicated. The statement emphasizes the value and desirability of original Loar-signed instruments, but it does not address the timeline of replication for the Gibson F-5. The Gibson F-5 is a renowned mandolin that was designed by sound engineer and luthier Lloyd Loar in the early 1920s. With its innovative design and superb sound quality, the F-5 mandolin set a new standard for the instrument and influenced countless luthiers in the subsequent years. Lloyd Loar was an acoustical engineer and a skilled musician who worked for Gibson from 1919 to 1924. His primary contributions include the design of the Master Model instruments, among which the Gibson F-5 mandolin was the crown jewel. The original models that Loar personally signed are considered incredibly rare and valuable, often fetching high prices in the collector market. The replication of the Gibson F-5 mandolin began largely in the 1970s and 1980s, when numerous luthiers in the United States and around the world started making their own versions of this iconic instrument. These luthiers aimed to capture the essence of the original F-5 design while adapting it to modern production techniques. Some of the replication efforts were even undertaken by Gibson themselves, in an attempt to reproduce the grace of the original F-5 models. Various factors, such as the scarcity of the Loar-signed F-5 mandolins and the demand for similar high-quality instruments, contributed to the surge of replication in the latter part of the 20th century. Presently, several luthiers and companies manufacture Gibson F-5 inspired or replica mandolins, catering to musicians and collectors who appreciate the exceptional sound and craftsmanship of this historical instrument. In summary, while the statement provided highlights the value of original Loar-signed instruments, it does not address the question of when the Gibson F-5 was largely replicated. Instead, it is essential to know that the replication process began mainly during the 1970s and 1980s and continues till today, as luthiers and companies produce their own versions of the esteemed Gibson F-5 mandolin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

England recovered from a false start at Twickenham and the early loss of full-back Mike Brown to maintain their RBS Six Nations title quest with a resounding win. Stuart Lancaster’s national team were behind for the first quarter of this match, as they struggled to generate the level of intensity shown during their seismic triumph in Cardiff eight days earlier. But when they needed inspiration, it was delivered in stunning fashion by Jonathan Joseph. Following his try-scoring heroics at the Millennium Stadium, the on-song Bath centre illuminated proceedings on his first start in a home Test. The 23-year-old scored twice – either side of half-time – as England made light of their initial problems to cut loose.

A 7-foot-1 former NBA star has been arrested for attempted armed robbery after neighbors spotted him and a friend with masks over their faces trying to break into a rural Washington State home in broad daylight. This is just the latest trouble for 29-year-old Robert Swift, who blew his NBA 20million earnings and was evicted from his Seattle home in 2013. At the time of his arrest, he was a fugitive from justice, wanted for failing to show up for court to answer charges of possession of a sawed-off shotgun from last November. Swift and 28-year-old Carlos Abraham Anderson were busted on Tuesday near Gold Bar, Washington, as they were trying to break into a home there, police told to KIRO-TV. He played four seasons of NBA basketball, but was saddled with injuries, but hasn't been on an","output":"NBA roster since 2009. After his short-lived NBA career concluded, Swift's life spiraled downward. His financial struggles, substance abuse issues, and legal troubles have tarnished his image and led him to a path filled with despair. Born in Bakersfield, California, Swift was a highly-touted high school prospect and was drafted 12th overall by the Seattle SuperSonics in 2004, directly out of high school. Known for his height and shot-blocking ability, he was considered a promising talent that was supposed to help anchor the SuperSonics' frontcourt for years to come. However, his NBA career never took off as anticipated. Plagued by injuries, his athleticism, and skills on the court never translated into consistent playing time. He only averaged around 15 minutes per game during his stint with the SuperSonics (which later became the Oklahoma City Thunder). Over the span of his NBA career, he played in just 97 games, averaging a mere 4.3 points, 3.9 rebounds, 0.6 assists, and 0.9 blocks per game. After being released by Oklahoma City in 2009, Swift tried to revive his basketball career by playing in the NBA Development League, but he never found his way back to the big league. Beyond his basketball struggles, Swift's life off the court took a turn for the worse. His NBA earnings of 20 million were squandered on luxuries, irresponsible financial decisions, and substance abuse problems. In 2013, he was evicted from his Seattle mansion, which had been found trashed after he left. Swift's legal troubles began in 2011 when he was charged with third-degree malicious mischief and fourth-degree assault after an incident with his girlfriend. The charges were later dismissed, but it was the beginning of a string of legal problems. In November 2015, he was arrested for possession of a sawed-off shotgun, which was discovered during a traffic stop. Swift initially failed to appear in court for the firearm charge, warranting his fugitive status. The attempted armed robbery resulted in his arrest with accomplice Carlos Abraham Anderson. The duo was caught in the act of breaking into a Gold Bar, Washington home while wearing masks over their faces. Swift was charged with first-degree attempted burglary and second-degree unlawful possession of a firearm, a clear indication of his deep descent into a life of crime. Robert Swift's story serves as a cautionary tale of how success and fortunes earned through talent and hard work can be squandered away due to poor decision-making and an inability to handle newfound wealth. In Swift's case, the culmination of injuries, shortcomings on the court, and personal struggles off the field ultimately led to the downfall of a once-promising NBA career and a descent into a life of crime. It's a tragic reminder of the importance of seeking help and maintaining a support system amidst the pressures and trials that come with success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: While applying to college may seem easy, getting in can be tough! When you apply for college, you will have to be honest with yourself and do a bit of research to find the right fit. Here are three steps to take when applying to colleges for the best chances at getting into the best college for you. Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone. The number of colleges you apply to can vary, from applying to 1 school (not recommended) to 30 schools (not recommended),each applicant can choose how many colleges they apply to. Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee.          . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success. Talk to an admissions counselor at your high school if you have questions about this. Step 3: Completing and Sending Applications to Colleges Once your list is complete you are ready to apply to college by completing and sending in applications! College applications take time to complete --you have to write essays, ask for recommendations and get test scores sent to schools--so stay organized! All colleges will require these types of application materials, so start thinking about these items well before October or December. Once you complete and send them, then you have successfully applied to college. Question: Which of the following statements is WRONG?

Is \\"Also, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like amic \\"(male friend\\") vs. amiga (\\"female friend\\").\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, your statement about final obstruent devoicing and the example of amic/amiga in Catalan is correct, but this is just one aspect of the various types of endings that Catalan words have. Here's a more comprehensive explanation: Catalan, a Romance language spoken in Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, and some parts of Italy and France, exhibits a wide range of word endings due to its linguistic history, morphology, phonetics, and gender and number distinctions. Some characteristic features of Catalan word endings are: 1. Final obstruent devoicing: As you mentioned, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, which is a phonological process where voiced obstruents (i.e., consonants that produce sound through vocal fold vibration) become voiceless at the end of a word. This can occur in words like \\"amic\\" (male friend) and \\"amiga\\" (female friend). 2. Nouns and adjectives: Like other Romance languages, Catalan has gender (masculine and feminine) and number distinctions (singular and plural). Most nouns and adjectives exhibit different endings to show these distinctions:    a. Masculine nouns and adjectives typically end in '-o' (singular) and '-s' (plural), e.g., \\"gat\\" (cat) and \\"gats\\" (cats).        b. Feminine nouns and adjectives usually end in '-a' (singular) and '-es' (plural), e.g., \\"gata\\" (female cat) and \\"gates\\" (female cats).        c. Exceptions exist, such as some masculine nouns and adjectives ending in '-a', e.g., \\"poeta\\" (poet). 3. Verb conjugation: Catalan verbs have different endings to convey information about tense, mood, and the subject of the action. There are three main groups of regular Catalan verbs: '-ar', '-er', and '-re' verbs. Each of these groups has distinct conjugation patterns:    a. '-ar' verbs: \\"parlar\\" (to speak)        b. '-er' verbs: \\"poder\\" (to be able to)        c. '-re' verbs: \\"vendre\\" (to sell) 4. Diminutive and augmentative endings: Catalan also uses diminutive and augmentative suffixes to indicate a change in the size or intensity of a noun. Some common diminutive suffixes include '-et', '-eta', '-ó', and '-ona'. For example:    a. 'Gatet' or 'gato' (little cat)        b. 'Casaeta' or 'casona' (little house) In conclusion, Catalan words exhibit a rich variety of endings due to the language's grammatical structures, distinctions in gender and number, and phonological processes such as final obstruent devoicing. Additionally, the language's verb conjugations and diminutive and augmentative suffixes contribute to the diversity of word endings in Catalan."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"Cuple\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

A:","output":"No, \\"A picture of the 1924 Baseball team\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question \\"who died on the Florida Gators college baseball team in 2010?\\" as it does not provide relevant information regarding any death on the team in 2010, and instead, refers to a completely different time period, i.e., 1924.  To properly answer the question, it is necessary to investigate and identify any player from the Florida Gators college baseball team in 2010 who may have passed away. After researching this topic, there is no particular individual who appears to have died on the team in that year. The Florida Gators college baseball team is a part of the University of Florida's athletic program, competing in NCAA Division I and the Southeastern Conference. The team has a long and storied history that has been filled with numerous accomplishments and achievements, including multiple College World Series (CWS) appearances, conference titles, and individual awards. In 2010, the Florida Gators baseball team, coached by Kevin O'Sullivan, performed well in their season. They finished the season with an impressive 47-17 record and ultimately advanced to the College World Series. However, they were eliminated after a loss to Florida State University. Despite the apparent absence of a death involving a team member in 2010, it is important to note that college baseball teams, like other sports teams, are not immune to tragic events. Over the years, there have been instances in which athletes from various college programs have faced untimely deaths due to accidents, health issues, or other unforeseen circumstances. These incidents serve as sobering reminders of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing our time with those we care about. In conclusion, \\"A picture of the 1924 Baseball team\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question about a death on the Florida Gators college baseball team in 2010. Instead, it is essential to address the specific year, team, and circumstances involved while acknowledging that no reported death seems to have occurred for the team in 2010."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Carrie gets her first period, and after becoming distressed, cries out for help. Instead of helping, the other girls ridicule and harass her, throwing out tampons, sanitary towels and toilet paper to her. Teacher Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) rushes in to stop the commotion. White, who appears to be bottling extreme rage, snaps a light bulb. After questioning Carrie, Miss Collins realizes that Carrie is unaware of the concept of menstruation. Because of this, Miss Collins asks the school principal to excuse Carrie from gym class for a week because of the trauma. Upon her way home, Carrie uses her recently discovered telekinesis to stop a boy from teasing her. While at home, Carrie is tormented by her delusional mother (Piper Laurie), who locks Carrie in a closet and forces her to pray--she believes that Carrie received her period due to sinning.Miss Collins, still livid about the incident, berates the other girls and forces them through a detention, deliberately physically exhausting them. The leader of the clique, Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen), refuses to participate, and as punishment, is banned from the upcoming prom. Furious, she blames Carrie for her misfortune. Meanwhile, another one of the girls, Sue Snell (Amy Irving), feels guilty about her part in teasing Carrie, so she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (William Katt), to take Carrie to the prom.

If I tell you that An animal must find a mate to ensure survival, and ask you the question \\"what must an animal find to ensure survival?\\", is the correct answer \\"disaster\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"disaster.\\" Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that an animal must find a mate to ensure survival. This is because finding a mate is essential for the reproduction and continuation of a species. In the context of the question, \\"disaster\\" is not relevant. While some animals may need to be resilient in the face of disasters, such as natural catastrophes or environmental changes, this does not address the need for an animal to find a mate. To ensure survival, each animal species needs to have a sustainable population size to propagate its genes. When animals reproduce, they pass on their genetic material to their offspring, ensuring the continuation of their species. Apart from finding a mate, there are several other factors that contribute to an animal's survival, including: 1. Access to food and water: For an animal to survive, it must have access to a reliable source of food and water. Animals need nutrients and sustenance to maintain their health, grow, and reproduce. 2. Shelter and habitat: An animal must find a suitable habitat or shelter that meets its specific needs related to shelter, protection from predators, and environmental conditions. The habitat should provide adequate cover from predators and be well-suited for the animal's lifestyle and physical attributes. 3. Ability to adapt to changing environments: Animals must be able to adapt to changes in their environment in order to survive. This is especially relevant in the case of climate change or habitat destruction, where an organism's environment may change dramatically, requiring flexibility and adaptability on the part of the animal. 4. Avoidance of predation: To ensure their survival, animals must be able to avoid or escape from predators. This may involve developing physical adaptations, such as camouflage or speed, or behavioral adaptations, such as living in groups or engaging in defensive behaviors like fighting back or warning calls. 5. Successful competition: For an animal to survive, it must be able to successfully compete with other members of its species for resources such as food, water, and mates, as well as with other species that occupy the same ecological niche. In conclusion, while disaster resilience can be important for some animals, the main factors contributing to an animal's survival include finding a mate, having access to food and water, finding a suitable habitat, avoiding predation, and being able to adapt to its environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Why was this rejection problematic?\\" is in \\"The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic. This can also be said of the Roman upper classes, were Stoicism was dominant, as seen in the Meditations of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the works of Cicero.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Write an article based on this \\"\\"I am telling the West,\\" said Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on television last Tuesday, \\"that dropping bombs from the air will not provide a solution.\\"\\"","output":"Title: The Importance of a Comprehensive Approach to Counter-Terrorism: Insights from President Erdogan's Call for Perspective Introduction On a recent television broadcast last Tuesday, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged the Western powers to reconsider their approach to combating terrorism. \\"I am telling the West,\\" he said, \\"that dropping bombs from the air will not provide a solution.\\" Erdogan's statement highlights the need for a more holistic and nuanced response to the complex and ever-evolving global issue of terrorism. In this article, we will explore the limitations of a purely military approach to counter-terrorism, the potential benefits of alternative strategies, and the importance of international cooperation in the fight against terror. Limitations of a Solely Military Approach While airstrikes can serve as valuable tools in targeting terrorist leaders or disrupting their operations, President Erdogan's comment emphasizes the reality that a purely military response cannot, on its own, eradicate terrorism. For one, airstrikes run the risk of causing civilian casualties, and this collateral damage can foster resentment and disillusionment among the local populations - emotions that terrorist organizations often exploit. Additionally, a focus on military action alone may neglect some of the root causes of terrorism, such as socio-political marginalization, economic disparities, and radical ideologies, which must be addressed to prevent the emergence of new generations of extremists. Alternative Strategies and Their Benefits President Erdogan's call to reconsider the use of airstrikes offers an opportunity to explore alternative strategies in combating terrorism. Some of these alternative strategies include: 1. Intelligence-led operations: Strengthening intelligence gathering and analysis can help identify and neutralize potential terrorist threats. Enhanced collaboration between national and international security agencies can be especially beneficial in this regard. 2. Supporting socio-political and economic development: Addressing the underlying socio-economic issues that can fuel radicalization and extremism is critical in curtailing the spread of terrorism. Investment in education, healthcare, and economic development can help to create stable societies that are less susceptible to radicalization. 3. Countering extremist ideologies: Engaging with religious and community leaders, as well as leveraging social media platforms, can play a vital role in challenging and discrediting extremist narratives. 4. Promoting international cooperation: No single country can effectively counter global terrorist networks. Therefore, fostering strong international partnerships is crucial in ensuring a unified and collaborative response to terrorism. The Importance of International Cooperation As President Erdogan's statement emphasizes, effective counter-terrorism efforts require a deep understanding of the causes and nuances of terrorism and collaboration at a global level. By sharing resources and intelligence, countries can pool their expertise, thereby increasing their capacity to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. Equally important is the need for nations to engage in diplomatic dialogues and initiatives aimed at building trust, promoting regional stability, and establishing security norms. Conclusion President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's recent plea to the Western nations serves as a strong reminder of the importance of pursuing a comprehensive strategy for counter-terrorism. While military action may constitute a necessary component of this strategy, a sustainable and lasting resolution to terrorism requires addressing its root causes, investing in alternative approaches, and fostering collaborative efforts with international partners. In recognizing the limitations of an exclusively military response to terrorism, the global community can begin the essential task of developing more efficient, adaptive, and cooperative strategies for ensuring a safer world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two highly conserved residues in the peptide were identified as being important for the membrane ordering effect. Aggregation of large unilamellar vesicles induced by the peptide was also found to be correlated with the membrane ordering effect of the peptide, indicating that an increase in membrane ordering, i.e., membrane dehydration, is important for vesicle aggregation.

All the passers-by stop to have a look. You ought to see it.\\" I told her I would, but I soon forgot about the tree. Three days later, I was jogging down the street when a splash of bright orange caught my eyes. For an instant, I thought someone's house had caught fire. Then I remembered the tree. I approached the tree to look at it closely. There was nothing remarkable about the shape of the tree. It was a medium-sized maple. But Mrs. Gargan had been right about its colors. Like the mess of an artist's palette , the tree blazed a bright crimson on its lower branches and burned with vivid yellows and oranges in its center, and deep red at its top. Through these colors were light green leaves as yet untouched by autumn. Walking closer I noticed several bare branches near the top, their small black branches scratching the air like claws. The fallen leaves lay like a red carpet around the trunk. As I was amazed at this beauty, I thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson's comments about the stars. \\"If the constellations appeared only once in a thousand years, imagine what an exciting event it would be. But because they're up there every night, we barely give them a look,\\" he made a remark in Nature. I felt the same way about the tree. Because its beauty will last only a week, it should be especially precious to us. And I had almost missed it. Once in the 19th century when a man noticed a brilliant display of northern lights in the sky over Massachusetts, he rang a church bell to alert the whole town's people. That's what I felt like doing about the tree. I wanted to awake the countryside to its wonder.

Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us.

I was about half in. I wait thinking he will realize it was a not so smart action and he will pull back in to let me pass since forward is an easier safer plan. He doesn't do that we sit for anout 30 seconds and he is determined to stay. I was a fairly new driver in my first car. I get irritated and shut my motor off basically saying, buddy I entered the street first you were parked never looked before you hurriedly pulled forward. So he shuts off his motor and smiled good as to say stalemate. I'm thinking I have no place I have to be, I'll wait rather than trying to back up half the block without hitting somebodies car.

It also meant that the factory was much less efficient than it could have been. At the same time, we should not be pessimistic  . More and more the modern world depends on having people who are in the job because they are good enough, not just because their faces fit. There is a story of a factory owner who sent for an engineer to see to a machine which would not go. He examined it, then took out a hammer and tapped, once. The machine started up immediately. When he presented his bill, the owner protested, \\"This can't be right!  100 just for tapping a machine with a hammer?\\" The engineer wrote out a new bill: \\"For tapping a machine, 1; for knowing where to tap. 99.\\" The engineer who repaired the machine was right in charging  100 because  _  .

First question: How can we find 1's complement and 2's complement (for both positive and negative decimal numbers)? Second question: Why does 2's complement is preferred to represent negative numbers over 1's complement? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. Let's answer each question step by step. 1. How can we find 1's complement and 2's complement (for both positive and negative decimal numbers)? To find 1's and 2's complement of a number(constant), you need to follow these steps: Step 1: Convert the decimal number to its binary representation. For positive decimal numbers: - Use the standard binary conversion method: Divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. For negative decimal numbers: - Convert the magnitude of the number into binary (ignoring the negative sign) - Find the 2's complement of the binary number (explained below) Step 2: Find 1's complement. - In the binary representation, invert all the bits, i.e., replace 1's with 0's and 0's with 1's. Step 3: Find 2's complement. - Add 1 to the 1's complement. - If there is a carry-out (extra 1) from the most significant bit, discard it. So to find 1's and 2's complement of positive and negative numbers: For positive decimal numbers: - Convert the number to binary directly (step 1) - Find 1's complement (step 2) - Find 2's complement (step 3) For negative decimal numbers: - Convert the magnitude to binary (step 1) - Find the 2's complement of the binary number (step 3) - The 1's complement will be one less than the 2's complement 2. Why is 2's complement preferred to represent negative numbers over 1's complement? There are several reasons why 2's complement is preferred over 1's complement to represent negative numbers: - In 1's complement, there are two representations of zero - 00000000 (positive zero) and 11111111 (negative zero). This can cause confusion and require extra steps to handle during computation. 2's complement has only one representation of zero. - 2's complement makes it easy to perform arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction. For example, when you add two numbers in 2's complement representation, you do not need to worry about the sign of the numbers. The result in 2's complement representation will also correctly represent the signed outcome (i.e., positive or negative). - Overflow detection is simpler in 2's complement representation. When performing addition and subtraction, an overflow can be detected when the carry-in and carry-out in the most significant bit have different values. In contrast, overflow checking in 1's complement is more complex and less efficient. In conclusion, the two questions are different. The first question is about finding 1's and 2's complement of decimal numbers, while the second question discusses the reasons for preferring 2's complement over 1's complement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's break down the reasons behind this perception by analyzing the components that contribute to its positive sentiment. 1. The choice of the adjective \\"superb\\" suggests excellence and superior quality, indicating that the performances being described greatly surpassed expectations and standards. In comparison to other positive adjectives like \\"good\\" or \\"great,\\" \\"superb\\" carries a stronger and more exceptional connotation. The word choice here plays a key role in conveying the positive sentiment of the sentence. 2. The addition of the adverb \\"throughout\\" implies consistency and thoroughness in the high quality of the performances. This means that the positivity extends across the entire length or duration of the performances, without any instances of decline or disappointment. This consistently high level of excellence further reinforces the positive sentiment associated with this sentence. 3. The context in which the sentence might be used could involve describing an event, concert, theatrical production, or even a season of a sports team. In any of these situations, praising all aspects of the performances demonstrates appreciation, enthusiasm, and admiration for the performers or participants involved. This further contributes to the positive sentiment of the sentence. To sum up, the sentiment of the sentence \\"superb performances throughout\\" is likely to be perceived as highly positive due to the choice of the words \\"superb\\" and \\"throughout,\\" and the context in which it might be used. The sentence effectively communicates admiration and appreciation for the consistent excellence of the performances being discussed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Who doesn’t like babies? Well . . . Adapted from an online discussion. Hi, Carolyn! My husband and I recently had our first baby. My husband’s brother and his wife are happily child-free and have shown zero interest in our daughter — they’ve never interacted with her, never ask about her, never respond to the few pictures my husband sends them, and have told us outright they “don’t like babies.” I don’t expect them to act like she is the center of their world, but our extended family is tiny, and we’d hoped our daughter would have a strong relationship with her aunt and uncle. Am I wrong to think it’s generally polite to feign interest in things that are clearly important to people you love? Do we hope they take an interest when she’s older? Or accept that our once-close relationship has changed for good? My husband is hurt by his brother’s lack of interest, but neither of us can think of a productive way to talk with them about this. Cold-Shouldered: Yes, it’s generally polite for the people who love us to give some minimal level of a damn about the things we care about (see also here, second letter: bit.ly/EekAbaby). Yes, people who avoid babies can become more interested as the child grows more interesting, though you don’t become Uncle Awesome by skipping the hard years. And, yes, do accept that the relationship has changed, because there was no way it wouldn’t change after adding a child. What I don’t suggest is tacking on the needlessly extreme “for good.” Who knows what’s in store. Maybe you’ll keep drifting apart, maybe you’ll get over this obstacle quickly, maybe you’ll reconnect after peak child-immersion has passed. I also suggest not letting stand their remark that they “don’t like babies”: “Few people in their right minds ‘like’ babies — we like you two, though, and miss you, and want Baby to know you as she grows up.” Back that up by asking, talking and caring about their lives as well. Re: Babies: It’s not socially acceptable to say, “I don’t like old people,” or, “I don’t like gay people,” so why is it okay to say, “I don’t like kids”? Anonymous: These aren’t equivalent at all. Being old or gay is just one facet of the abundance of them that make us who we are, and judging the whole person on these single traits makes the judge, to use your term, “socially unacceptable,” though that’s going easy. Being a baby, on the other hand, means your menu of behaviors is limited to crying, screaming, pooping, sleeping, upchucking, needing and occasionally dazzling someone with a smile or eye contact. Plus, they don’t know when you dodge them. Re: Babies: Babies are terrible. No one in their right mind likes babies. Once you have a kid, your brain chemistry is rewired to force you to think your baby is amazing. That’s why we give them so much nurturing. The aunt and uncle will be more involved as the baby turns into an actual interesting person, rather than a selfish blob. Anonymous 2: Indeed.

Which friend started taking statins for his disease?  Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.  Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

Movie title: I'll Never Heil Again Movie plot: I'll Never Heil Again follows much the same pattern as You Nazty Spy!. It opens at the estate of King Herman the 6 7/8s, the deposed, abeit exiled king of Moronica. Meanwhile, Ixnay, Ohnay and Amscray, the war profiteers from the first film have realized they've made a monster out of Hailstone and his cronies in letting them be too power hungry. They decided that they have had enough of the dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. Herman refuses to accept thier help until he finds out that they were sorry about the whole scenario about wanting to start a war and are willing to pay the price for their actions. To this end, he sends his daughter, the princess Glinda (disguised as Matty Herring in the first film) to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. Dictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Curly and Larry for a turkey (that is a parody of Hitler possibly wanting control in Turkey. Larry parodies the attempts to control Greece by saying, \\"I'll wipe out grease.\\") The winner of that battle is a picture of Napoleon who grabs the bird from the bewildered Stooges. Glinda enters, and starts to place in Moe's mind the idea that his allies, the \\"Axle\\" partners, are plotting against him. After doing this she replaces the 13 ball on Hailstone's pool table with an exploding 13 ball and flees as Hailstone begins a pool game with his partners. Throughout the game the cue ball inexplicably defies the laws of physics avoiding the exploding ball by swerving around it and jumping over it colliding with Herring's head. The result of this was Herring 'barking' at the exploding ball and upon Hailstone's order to put it down he rips off his mustache, causing Hailstone to remark the well remembered line \\"give me my personality.\\"The film's climax occurs when the \\"Axle\\" partners arrive for a meeting and Hailstone orders the \\"Axle\\" partners Chizzilini (a parody of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini), the Bey... The answer is:","output":"King Herman was deposed as the king from the fictional country of Moronica in the movie \\"I'll Never Heil Again.\\" This comedy film presents a satirical take on the political landscape of the time, specifically targeting the dictatorial regimes in power during World War II. The movie plot revolves around King Herman the 6 7/8s, who is in exile, and his attempts to regain his throne with the help of war profiteers Ixnay, Ohnay, and Amscray. These war profiteers initially supported Moe Hailstone (a parody of Adolf Hitler), but later realize the consequences of their actions and decide to aid King Herman in reclaiming his position as ruler of Moronica. King Herman dispatches his daughter, Princess Glinda (disguised as Matty Herring), to assassinate Hailstone using an explosive pool ball.

Body: Diafra Sakho, who has been sidelined for a significant period due to a shoulder injury, is finally expected to make his comeback for the Hammers. The Senegalese striker's return will provide West Ham with a timely lift, as they have missed his presence and goal-scoring ability upfront.  Manager Sam Allardyce will be hoping that Sakho's return can help the team maintain their impressive start to the season. Both Sakho and Allardyce have recently been rewarded for their performances, receiving the Premier League player and manager of the month awards respectively.  In another positive development for West Ham fans, Andy Carroll may also make his first appearance this season after recovering from a long-term injury. The English striker's physical presence and aerial prowess will be instrumental in bolstering the Hammers' attack, providing them with a different dimension to their forward line.  However, the upcoming match will prove to be a challenge for their opponents Aston Villa, who have been struggling in recent weeks. Villa's miseries were compounded last week when their Belgian striker, Christian Benteke, received a red card and a subsequent three-match ban. His absence will be a significant blow to the team, as they desperately seek to end their losing streak. Aston Villa has lost six consecutive league games for the first time since 1967, and the mounting pressure on manager Paul Lambert is palpable. The Villans will need to dig deep and produce a spirited performance to overcome their recent poor form and avoid further dropping down the Premier League table. Conclusion: In conclusion, West Ham United's clash against Aston Villa is shaping up to be an enthralling encounter as both teams aim to secure a vital three points. With key players returning from injury and impressive awards under their belt, the Hammers will be confident of extending their good run. In contrast, Aston Villa will need to display resilience and determination to avoid a record-breaking seventh consecutive league defeat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The relationship and role of the father is maintained: John Firth Forest (original) and John Firth Wald (paraphrase); both versions mention that the father managed a jewellery and watchmaking business in Scotland. The main differences can be observed in the structure of the sentences and the choice of words: 1. The original sentence is written as one sentence with the use of commas, whereas the paraphrase is divided into two sentences. 2. The father's name is slightly altered: Forest (original) vs. Wald (paraphrase); this doesn't greatly impact the understanding of the sentence since it preserves the father's role and business. 3. The paraphrase changed \\"led in Scotland\\" to \\"ran a... business in Scotland,\\" which makes the sentence clearer and more concise.

Miner became the first Barnard International Fellow and studied at the Bedford College of the University of London. She studied medieval manuscript illumination with Meyer Schapiro at Columbia University in 1928–29 and received a fellowship to continue working on her dissertation on a Carolingian Apocalypse manuscript the following year. Miner was hired by the Pierpont Morgan Library to prepare an exhibition of illuminated manuscripts in 1933–34 and the director of the library, Belle da Costa Greene, recommended her for the position of keeper of manuscripts at the Walters Art Gallery, in Baltimore, Maryland. She got the job and became of the first professionally trained art historians working in an American museum. She was also curator of Islamic and Near Eastern Art as well as the head of the reference library for several years.

Choices:  - animal shelter - backyard - own home - basket - garage  The rationale to choose \\"basket\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"A basket is an ideal choice for a small dog to sleep in for several reasons. The reasons are listed and explained below: 1. Provides Comfort and Security: A basket provides a small dog with a comfortable and snug place to rest. Since a dog's natural instinct is to find a secure and sheltered place to sleep, the enclosed structure of a basket offers the sense of security they seek. This sense of security helps reduce stress and anxiety in pets, which in turn promotes a healthy lifestyle. 2. Retains Warmth: A well-chosen dog basket, especially one with soft padding or cushions, effectively retains warmth. This is particularly important for small dogs as they tend to lose body heat more quickly than larger dogs. A warm and cozy basket not only ensures a comfortable sleep but also protects the dog from catching a cold or suffering from joint pains caused by cold surfaces. 3. Easy to Clean and Maintain: Baskets, unlike some other dog bedding options, are generally easy to clean and maintain. Most baskets come with removable, washable cushion covers or liners, which can be machine-washed, keeping the dog's sleeping area fresh and hygienic. Additionally, the basket itself can be easily wiped down and sanitized regularly. 4. Mobility and Portability: Baskets are lightweight and can be easily moved around the house, allowing you to place them in different rooms as needed. This helps to ensure that your dog always has a comfortable and familiar place to sleep wherever they are in the home. 5. Space Saving: A basket occupies minimal space as it can be chosen according to the size of the dog. A small dog will need a small basket, which can be easily placed in a corner of a room or under a table, thus not taking up too much space in the home. 6. Prevents Damage to Furniture: Dogs can be prone to scratching, biting, or chewing on furniture, and some may even prefer to sleep on sofas or beds if given the chance. A designated sleeping area like a basket not only protects the furniture from potential damage but also helps to set boundaries and establish routines for your pet. 7. Customizable: Baskets can be customized to suit the specific needs of your dog. For example, a dog with orthopedic issues might need a basket with better support, and baskets can be found that cater to their needs. Moreover, you can add your dog's favorite blanket or toy to make the basket more inviting and comforting. 8. Aesthetically Pleasing: Baskets come in a variety of designs, materials, and colors, allowing you to choose one that complements your home's decor. A well-chosen basket adds a touch of elegance to your living space while ensuring your dog's comfort and wellbeing. In conclusion, a basket is the optimal choice for a small dog's sleeping area as it offers comfort, security, warmth, and a customizable and hygienic environment that caters to their needs. The portability and space-saving features of a basket, along with the fact that it can be an aesthetically pleasing addition to the home, make it a superior choice compared to the other options listed."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Many private institutions of higher education around the country are in danger. Not all will be saved, and perhaps not all deserve to be saved. There are low-quality schools just as there are low-quality businesses. We have no duty to save them simply because they exist. But many promising institutions that deserve to continue are threatened. They are doing a fine job educationally, but they are caught in a financial squeeze, with no way to reduce rising cost or increase income significantly. Raising tuition doesn't bring in more income, for each time tuition goes up, the enrollment goes down, or the amount that must be given away in student aid goes up. Schools are bad businesses, whether public or private, not usually because of mismanagement but because of the nature of the enterprise. They lose money on every customer, and they can go bankrupt either from too few students or too many students. Even a very good college is a very bad business. It is such colleges, promising but threatened, that I worry about. Low enrollment is not their chief problem. Even with full enrollment, they may  _ . Efforts to save them, and preferably to keep them private, are a national necessity. There is no basis for arguing that private schools are inherently   better than public schools. There are many examples to the contrary. Anyone can name state universities and colleges that rank as the finest in the nation and the world. It is now inevitable that public institutions will be dominant, and therefore diversity is a national necessity. Diversity in the way we support schools tends to give us a healthy diversity in the forms of education. In an imperfect society such as ours, uniformity of education throughout the nation could be dangerous, In an imperfect society, diversity is a positive good. Supporters of public higher education know the importance of sustaining private higher education.

One day over 800 years ago, a young human warlord named Niran fell in love with one of the song neng, a woman named Sang. Niran wanted Sang for his own, so he killed her husband and son. In her pain and rage, Sang attacked and bit Niran during a Songkran (New Year) solar eclipse, turning him into a vampire. From Niran's bloodline have come many jai tham (vampires who drink human blood and kill for pleasure). Only Sang can end the jai tham's nightly attacks on humans. Doing so, however, will end the entire bloodline and turn every vampire, song neng as well as jai tham, into mere mortals again. Since the coming Songkran festival will feature the first solar eclipse in 800 years, Sang intends to kill herself by exposing herself to the sun's rays at the end of the eclipse and thus wipe out all the vampires in Thailand. Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and Amanda (Meredith Monroe) are vacationing in Thailand during this year's Songkran festival. Connor, trained since childhood in Muay Thai (Thai boxing), takes Amanda to see a match. However, Amanda cannot take the brutality and goes back to their hotel alone. On the way, she gets lost in the Phang Nga market, and Mr Nice Guy (Dom Hetrakul) offers to show her the way to her hotel. He leads her on a short cut down a deserted alley, then turns into the vampire Niran, drinking her blood and carrying her off on a motorcycle. Connor tries to follow, but he is stopped by another vampire, obviously intent on killing him. Just as the vampire is about to succeed, a bald-headed man appears and chops off the vampire's head. Connor begs for his help finding Amanda, but he warns Connor to leave Thailand immediately and threatens to kill Connor if he follows him. Connor stealthily follows Kiko (Roger Yuan) home to Kong Sai House. When the police refuse to consider Amanda missing until 48 hours have passed, Connor goes back to Kong Sai House, only...

Twitter finally flicks the switch on 10,000 character DMs Twitter users can now send direct messages (DM) of up to 10,000 characters, three months after the company announced the forthcoming change to users and developers on its development blog. The new DMs, which are intended to be of effectively unlimited length for the typical user, are part of the company’s long-running effort to upgrade its messaging service to make it a more competitive alternative to market leaders such as Facebook’s WhatsApp and Messenger apps. Sachin Agarwal, Twitter’s DM product manager, said: “We believe that private messaging is a core part of the twitter experience. Where we see our advantage [over apps such as WhatsApp] is that there’s so much amazing content on Twitter already, that we want to enable people to have private conversations about those things.” After years spent all-but-abandoned, the company turned its attention to updating its direct messages towards the end of 2014, first enabling group DMs with multiple participants, and then announcing the change in DM length earlier this year. As a result, Agarwal accepted that Twitter still has to win back trust from users before they will devote time to the feature. Nonetheless, he said: “We’ve won back a lot of trust, but we still have a long way to go. Users are really excited about it, we’re seeing our numbers skyrocket.” Unusually for Twitter, the change in DM length was pre-announced. Agarwal said that it was important to make sure that all third-party clients are updated before the feature is turned on. “What we didn’t want was for it to be enabled for one client but not for others,” because that way users may be sent messages that they couldn’t read. Typically, Twitter is unconcerned about third-party clients, preferring users to stick to the company’s own software, but Agarwal said that a big target for unlimited DMs is business users, who will appreciate being able to hold real conversations with customers in DM. Since enterprise users are often on third party clients such as Hootsuite, they need the time to switch over. “One of the really interesting uses of DM is talking to business and getting customer support, and those are using third party clients. We have a number of partners that build clients for these businesses and so we wanted to make sure they had the time to update and be ready. “Let’s say that I’m talking to a business and I write them a direct message that is 160 characters long and that business doesn’t read the last 20, for me as a consumers thats a really bad experience. And that was how we looked at it, the users’ perspective, making sure they have a really great experience.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Twitter has now enabled its users to send direct messages (DMs) of up to 10,000 characters, a significant increase from the previous limit of 140 characters. This change was announced back in June and is part of Twitter's ongoing effort to improve its messaging service and compete with other messaging platforms such as Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger apps. Twitter's DM Product Manager, Sachin Agarwal, said that private messaging is a core part of the Twitter experience, and the platform's advantage is the abundant content available on Twitter that can spark private conversations among users. The company had previously added the ability to create group DMs with multiple participants and realized that they still had to regain users' trust in this feature. As a result of these changes, Twitter's DM usage numbers have been growing rapidly. The increased character limit was pre-announced to ensure that third-party clients would have it enabled before the feature went live. Agarwal mentioned that a significant target for unlimited DMs is business users, who will benefit from holding more in-depth conversations with customers through DMs. Many enterprise users rely on third-party clients like Hootsuite, so they needed time to transition and update to the new feature. In summary, Twitter has extended the character limit for DMs to 10,000 characters as part of its effort to improve messaging services and compete with other messaging apps. The company aims to win back user trust and target business users who can benefit from more detailed conversations with customers through the enhanced DM feature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The correct answer is A because the griddle is the appropriate surface for cooking pancakes. Cooking pancakes on a griddle provides even heat distribution, which helps them to cook evenly and achieve a golden brown color on both sides. Flipping the pancakes when bubbles rise ensures that they are cooked properly. Option B is incorrect because it suggests scooping the batter onto the counter, which is not a suitable surface for cooking pancakes.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Get rid of the cooking grate, set the top aside, and open the bottom vents of the grill. You want as much air as possible to get to your charcoal in order to start an even, strong burning fire. Clean out any ash now, as it will smother your fire and keep the charcoal from lighting evenly. Aim the opening of the bag into the center of the grill when dumping out the briquettes to naturally form a pyramid. Then use your hands or a pair of long-handled tongs to stack any other pieces of charcoal along the sides on the pyramid. Start with roughly half the number of briquettes outlined below to start your grill. Once it's hot, add charcoal, 5-7 piece at a time, to get the grill up to full strength.  For a small, portable grill, you want 25-30 briquettes, or pieces of charcoal, when you start cooking. For a medium to average sized grill, you'll want roughly 40 briquettes. For a large or industrial grill, you will need 1 bag or more of charcoal to cook. You don't want to drench your charcoal in the fluid, as it takes a while to burn and will make a thick, unappetizing smoke. Simply squirt the fluid for no more than a count of \\"2 Mississippi\\" around the center of the pyramid, trying to get the fluid in the middle.  You can also start your pyramid, douse the inner briquets with fluid, then pile the \\"top\\" of the pyramid above the lighter fluid soaked briquets to make sure the whole pile gets hot. A mistake that many grillers make is using too much lighter fluid, which then imparts a petroleum-like tinge to the taste of their food. You do not need a lot of fluid, just enough to get a few pieces of charcoal smoking. These pieces will then help the rest of the pile catch. Do not light the grill immediately. Waiting allows the lighter fluid to soak into the top layer of charcoal, helping it to burn evenly. Lightly squirt the pyramid with a few bursts of lighter fluid in several places, only letting it soak in for a few seconds. This is what will \\"catch,\\" so you don't want to drown the charcoal in fluid or you risk a dangerous flair up. You just want a few little areas of fluid to start your fire. Though lighter fluid is not made to flare up, it should still be treated with respect. Light the pile in 2-3 places where you put the lighter fluid, aiming to get the middle of the pile lit where possible. The fire will likely start large, with big flames leaping around the charcoals, but this is just the lighter fluid burning. Once the flames die down, the center of the pile should be smoking and developing white/gray coloring. This means your fire has caught. Once you can barely see any black, the fire is ready for cooking. The inner coals of your pyramid should be glowing red. Spread the coals in your desired pattern, adding more if you plan on grilling for a long time. As a general rule of thumb, you should add a handful or two of coals every 30 minutes if you plan on continuing to grill.  You want 1-2 layers of charcoal over your entire grilling area, not patches of charcoal or solitary, exposed coals. Charcoal maintains heat by staying clustered together, much like ice in a pack stays cold longer than separated cubes. If you've added charcoal, wait 5-6 minutes for them to catch. Since the heat of the rest of the charcoals is already hot enough, it should not take long. Use a clip to seal the top of the bag if you have leftovers in the bag. The additives in the charcoal will evaporate, making them harder to light next time with or without lighter fluid. Summary:","output":"This article provides detailed instructions on how to properly set up a charcoal grill by cleaning out ash, arranging briquettes, using lighter fluid safely, and maintaining an even distribution of heat for optimal cooking results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"A: Rizwan Khan, the protagonist in the movie \\"My Name Is Khan,\\" suffers from Asperger's Syndrome. Asperger's Syndrome is a type of neurodevelopmental disorder that falls on the autism spectrum. It is characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and repetitive or restricted patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. People with Asperger's Syndrome usually have average or above-average intelligence and do not experience the same degree of delay in language development as those with other forms of autism. In the film, Rizwan Khan, played by Shah Rukh Khan, is a Muslim man from India who has been living in the United States with his family. Throughout the movie, his character showcases various symptoms and characteristics associated with Asperger's Syndrome. Due to Rizwan's condition, he struggles to understand social cues and norms, often resulting in awkward and challenging situations in his relationships with others. The film highlights his journey to deal with the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the prejudice faced by Muslims in America while also showcasing his unique perspective and determination to prove his innocence. The portrayal of Rizwan Khan's character as a protagonist with Asperger's Syndrome was praised by many for raising awareness about the disorder and reducing the stigma associated with autism. The film showcases the strengths and potential of individuals with autism and emphasizes their ability to make a difference, overcome obstacles, and thrive despite their condition. Moreover, \\"My Name Is Khan\\" encourages empathy, understanding, and acceptance for those who may be perceived as different due to their neurological differences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat.  The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1]  Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring lands experienced different climates. In Iceland, the actions of its people lead to a loss of animal and plant species. Denmark tried to keep the environment untouched as they understood its importance and the climate was unaffected.

Each piece seemed to be intricately linked to another, creating a seamless network of components that worked in harmony, like a well-orchestrated symphony. It was clear that the creator of this armor was a genius – and perhaps a dangerous one at that. After finally removing the last piece of armor, they carefully wrapped the individual components in a specialized material to prevent any potential damage during transport to the lab. Once everything was secured, they turned their attention back to the unconscious man, who remained eerily still throughout the entire process. \\"We need to get him to a secure location,\\" she said, her concern for the man's wellbeing evident in her voice. \\"We don't know how long he's been wearing this armor or what kind of physical or psychological toll it may have taken on him.\\" He nodded in agreement, swiftly lifting the man into a fireman's carry. As they made their way out of the area, they couldn't help but glance back at the discarded armor, realizing that their discovery could have far-reaching implications. The potential for advanced military applications, enhanced human capabilities, or even the possible involvement of a hostile foreign power weighed heavily on their minds. Upon arriving at the lab, they quickly set to work analyzing the armor's components, delving into every detail of its design and studying the high-tech materials that comprised it. Meanwhile, their unconscious captive was placed under constant observation, with medical professionals on standby to provide any necessary treatment. In the days and weeks that followed, the armor would yield many secrets, including the true extent of its capabilities and the identity of its mysterious creator. And as they unraveled these discoveries, they would find themselves embroiled in a high-stakes game of international intrigue and espionage – one that could shake the very foundations of their world. But for now, all they could do was work diligently, their minds focused on the task at hand, knowing that the answers they sought were concealed within the sophisticated technology before them. And with each new revelation, they grew increasingly aware that they were not just dealing with a simple piece of armor, but something much greater – a technological marvel that could forever change the course of human history."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: Scientists have transformed men's minds into avirtual woman's body in an experiment that could throw light upon how humans distinguish themselves form others. In a study at Barcelona University, men wore a virtual reality headset that allowed them to see and hear the world as a female character. When they looked down, they could even see their new body and clothes. The \\"body-swapping\\" effect was so convincing that the men's sense of self was transferred into the virtual woman, causing them to react to events in the virtual world they wereimmersed . \\"This work opens up another avenue for virtual reality, which is not just to transform your sense of place, but also your sense of self,\\" said Mel Slater, \\"If you can temporarily give people the illusion that their bodies are different, then the evidence suggests it also affects their behavior and the way they think. They can have new experiences: a person who is thin can know what it is like to be fat. A man can have an experience of what it's like to be a woman.\\" During the experiment, a \\"female\\" approached and hit the face of the character another man was playing. \\"Their reaction was immediate,\\" said Slate. \\"They would take in a quick breath and maybeflinch .

In 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to record their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. The album included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, \\"Jugband Blues\\". Waters began to develop his own songwriting, contributing \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\", \\"Let There Be More Light\\" and \\"Corporal Clegg\\". Wright composed \\"See-Saw\\" and \\"Remember a Day\\". Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on \\"Remember a Day\\", Smith stepped in as his replacement. Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, \\"Norman gave up on the second album ... he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'\\". As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of the album's title track, they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking \\"like an architectural diagram\\".Released in June 1968, the album featured a psychedelic cover designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The first of several Pink Floyd album covers designed by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI permitted one of their groups to contract designers for an album jacket. The release peaked at number 9, spending 11 weeks on the UK chart. Record Mirror gave the album an overall favourable review, but urged listeners to \\"forget it as background music to a party\\". John Peel described a live performance of the title track as \\"like a religious experience\\", while NME described the song as \\"long and boring ...

Circadian rhythm Melatonin is absent from the system or undetectably low during daytime. Its onset in dim light, dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO), at roughly 21:00 (9 p.m.) can be measured in the blood or the saliva. Its major metabolite can also be measured in morning urine. Both DLMO and the midpoint (in time) of the presence of the hormone in the blood or saliva have been used as circadian markers. However, newer research indicates that the melatonin offset may be the more reliable marker. Benloucif et al. found that melatonin phase markers were more stable and more highly correlated with the timing of sleep than the core temperature minimum.

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: To tell if your indoor plants need water","output":"Telling if your indoor plants need water is a crucial aspect of maintaining their health and growth. An appropriate watering schedule ensures that the plants receive just the right amount of water, as overwatering and underwatering can be harmful. Here is a comprehensive guide with several methods to evaluate if your indoor plants need water: 1. Soil moisture test: This is the most reliable and common method to check your plant's water requirements. Gently stick your finger in the soil up to the second knuckle and feel for moisture. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water the plant. If it still feels damp, give it some more time before the next watering session. 2. Weight test: Familiarize yourself with the weight of your plant and its container after watering it. The weight of the pot will give you a clear gauge of whether it needs more water or not. As the soil dries and the plant absorbs water, the weight decreases. If the pot feels significantly lighter, it's probably time to water. 3. Visual inspection: Keep an eye on the appearance of your plants as they often exhibit signs of needing water. Wilting and yellowing leaves, curling edges, and drooping stems are some of the common indicators. If any of these signs are present even after watering, it could indicate a more significant problem like root rot or pest infestation. 4. Use a moisture meter: A moisture meter is a small device that measures the moisture content in the soil. Insert the probe into the soil, typically halfway between the edge of the pot and the plant's stem, getting as close to the roots as possible. If the meter indicates that the soil is dry, the plant needs water. 5. Surface soil examination: Observe the color and texture of the soil surface. Dry soil usually becomes lighter in color and cracks start to form. Even if the surface appears dry, it's important to check the moisture deeper in the soil with the finger test, as plants can still extract water from deeper soil layers. 6. Plant species requirements: Understand the specific water requirements of the plants you own. Some plants like succulents and cacti need to be watered less frequently, while others may need more frequent watering. Doing proper research about your individual plant's watering needs will help you make a more informed decision. 7. Observe drainage: A pot with proper drainage holes is crucial for your plant's health. Look for excess moisture at the bottom of the pot or saucer if present. If there is standing water or dampness, this could be a sign of overwatering. Conversely, if the pot feels dry, it's time to water the plant. 8. Light and temperature conditions: Different plants have different water requirements based on the environmental circumstances. Generally, plants placed in well-lit and warm locations require more frequent watering than those in shaded, cooler spaces. 9. Container material: The type of container your plant is housed in can also impact its watering requirements. Porous materials like terracotta or clay lose moisture more quickly than plastic or glazed ceramic pots. This means that plants in terracotta pots may need more frequent watering. By carefully monitoring and incorporating these methods, you will be able to effectively determine when your indoor plants need water, ensuring they remain healthy and thriving. Regular observation of your plants and understanding their specific needs is invaluable for any indoor gardener."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century.

Ben and Andy researched significant greenhouse gasses in Earth's atmosphere. Andy researched more about carbon dioxide, while Ben researched methane gas.  Hint: Carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.  Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid.

In this post-nuclear society, Caesar tries to cultivate peace between the apes and the surviving humans. A gorilla general named Aldo (Claude Akins) however opposes this and plots Caesar's downfall. Caesar is married to Lisa (Natalie Trundy), the female ape of the previous film, and they have a son named Cornelius (Bobby Porter) in honor of Caesar's father. Caesar regrets never having known his parents until his human assistant MacDonald (Austin Stoker) tells him about an archive film of his parents where he can also learn about the future. The archives are located in the Forbidden City, now a radioactive ruin. After obtaining a geiger counter and weapons from the armory, Caesar travels with MacDonald and orangutan Virgil (Paul Williams) to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the archives. However, there are mutants (radiation-scarred humans) still living there under the command of Governor Kolp (Severn Darden). Caesar and his party view the recordings of Cornelius and Zira and learn about the future of the world, but barely have time to study the tapes before they have to escape being captured. Caesar assembles a meeting to report his discoveries at the Forbidden City. Aldo objects when some humans show up and he leads the gorillas away. A team of scouts sent by Governor Kolp return and tell him about the Ape City. Kolp considers this covert trip by Caesar an act of espionage. His assistant MÃ©ndez (Paul Stevens) believes they did nothing wrong and should be left alone, but Governor Kolp stubbornly declares war on Ape City, mustering the mutant humans to destroy the ape society.

Fallon said he was \\"shocked. Shocked.\\" \\"They raised this money to help Johnny Bobbitt get money for food.\\" The couple, who started the campaign after Bobbitt used his last 20 to help McClure get gas after she ran out late at night, deny the claims in the suit, saying they're wary of giving Bobbitt large sums because they fear he will buy drugs. GoFundMe rep Bobby Whithorne says the company is working with law enforcement to ensure that Bobbitt gets the money raised for him, the AP reports. The crowdfunding site says it will guarantee any misspent money, 6 ABC reports. \\"While we assist law enforcement with their ongoing investigation, GoFundMe is also working with Johnny's legal team to ensure he's receiving support while the remaining funds are being recovered,\\" Whithorne said in a statement, adding that the company gave 20,000 to an account set up by Bobbitt's attorney \\"to provide assistance\\" to him during the investigation.

They say they've given Bobbitt about half the money raised, but Fallon says Bobbitt has only received about 75,000, including a camper and a 1999 Ford Ranger.

The funds were raised for Johnny Bobbitt, whose selfless act of using his last 20 to help a stranded woman, Kate McClure, pay for gas led to his story going viral on social media. McClure and her boyfriend, Mark D'Amico, started the GoFundMe campaign with the aim of helping Bobbitt get back on his feet. Chris Fallon, Bobbitt's attorney, mentioned that he was \\"shocked\\" to learn during a call with McClure and D'Amico's lawyers that the entire amount raised has been spent. \\"They raised this money to help Johnny Bobbitt get money for food,\\" said Fallon. However, McClure and D'Amico have denied allegations mentioned in Bobbitt's lawsuit that they mismanaged the funds. They stated that they had been reluctant to give Bobbitt large sums of money, fearing that he might use it to purchase drugs. GoFundMe representative Bobby Whithorne announced that the company is working closely with law enforcement officers to ensure that Bobbitt receives all the donations made for him. GoFundMe has stated that it will cover any misspent funds, according to 6 ABC reports. In a statement, Whithorne said, \\"While we assist law enforcement with their ongoing investigation, GoFundMe is also working with Johnny's legal team to ensure he's receiving support while the remaining funds are being recovered.\\" The company has also contributed 20,000 to an account set up by Bobbitt's attorney to provide assistance during the ongoing investigation. McClure and D'Amico's attorney, Ernest Badway, has not made any comments regarding the case. Although the couple has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, D'Amico has revealed that Bobbitt, a Marine veteran, spent 25,000 in less than two weeks in December on drugs, legal bills, and sending money to his family. The couple asserts that they have given Bobbitt around half of the money raised; however, Fallon claims Bobbitt has only received approximately 75,000, which includes a camper and a 1999 Ford Ranger. The New Jersey judge presiding over the case has ordered McClure and D'Amico to transfer the funds into an escrow account by Friday and hire an accountant to review their financial records within 10 days. However, it appears that the couple has missed this deadline. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday to discuss the matter further. This case highlights the unfortunate reality that acts of kindness and trust can sometimes be overshadowed by corruption and deceit. The story of Johnny Bobbitt's selflessness transformed into a heartbreaking example of how a well-meaning crowdfunding initiative can turn into a nightmare. It serves as a stark reminder that transparency, accountability, and rigorous monitoring are crucial while managing funds raised for someone in need.

He has been called \\"one of the most innovative and influential American photographers...\\" and \\"one of the masters of 20th century photography.\\" Over the course of his 40-year career Weston photographed an increasingly expansive set of subjects, including landscapes, still lifes, nudes, portraits, genre scenes and even whimsical parodies. It is said that he developed a \\"quintessentially American, and specially Californian, approach to modern photography\\" because of his focus on the people and places of the American West. Weston was a prolific writer. His Daybooks were published in two volumes totaling more than 500 pages in the first edition. This does not include the years of the journal he kept between 1915 and 1923; for reasons he never made clear he destroyed those before leaving for Mexico. He also wrote dozens of articles and commentaries, beginning in 1906 and ending in 1957, and he hand-wrote or typed at least 5,000 letters to colleagues, friends, lovers, his wives and his children.  In addition, Weston kept very thorough notes on the technical and business aspects of his work. The Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona, which now houses most of Weston's archives, reports that it houses 75 linear feet of pages from his Daybooks, correspondence, financial records, memorabilia, and other personal documents in his possession when he died.  Among Weston's most important early writings are those that provide insights into his development of the concept of previsualization. He first spoke and wrote about the concept in 1922, at least a decade before Ansel Adams began utilizing the term, and he continued to expand upon this idea both in writing and in his teachings. Historian Beaumont Newhall noted the significance of Weston's innovation in his book The History of Photography, saying \\"The most important part of Edward Weston's approach was his insistence that the photographer should previsualize the final print before making the exposure.\\"  In his Daybooks he provided an unusually detailed record of his evolution as an artist. Although he initially denied that his images reflect his own interpretations of the subject matter, by 1932 his writings revealed that he had come to accept the importance of artistic impression in his work. When combined with his photographs, his writings provide an extraordinarily vivid series of insights into his development as an artist and his impact of future generations of photographers. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did Weston write about?","output":"Edward Weston wrote about many things, including his experiences and thoughts on photography, his concept of previsualization, and his own development as an artist.

Longchamp refused to work with Puiset and became unpopular with the English nobility and clergy. John exploited this unpopularity to set himself up as an alternative ruler with his own royal court, complete with his own justiciar, chancellor and other royal posts, and was happy to be portrayed as an alternative regent, and possibly the next king. Armed conflict broke out between John and Longchamp, and by October 1191 Longchamp was isolated in the Tower of London with John in control of the city of London, thanks to promises John had made to the citizens in return for recognition as Richard's heir presumptive. At this point Walter of Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen, returned to England, having been sent by Richard to restore order.

Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt).

Mash your words together and spread your vowels out for the Long Island classic accent. Use some local, if cliched, colloquialisms. Listen to native New Yorkers, online or in person, to get the subtle range of different accents.\\"","output":"Title: The Art of Mastering the Classic Long Island Accent: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction: The Long Island accent, known for its distinct character, is instantly recognizable and often imitated. Whether you're trying to learn the accent for a performance or just want to explore its depth and uniqueness, there are several key factors to bear in mind. Through proper techniques and practice, you can assimilate this iconic accent and make it your own. In this article, we delve into the aspects of speaking nasally, adjusting your speech rhythm, vocal blending, and using local colloquialisms to master the Long Island accent. 1. Embrace the nasal and constricted throat: One of the most crucial components of the Long Island accent is its distinct nasality. To achieve this, speak through your nose and narrow your throat, almost as if you are mimicking a congested individual. This will create a higher pitch and add resonance to your speech, which is essential for emulating the characteristic nasal tone of the regional accent. While practicing, ensure that the constricted throat doesn't compromise your vocal clarity. 2. Capture the \\"attitude\\" in your speech rhythm: The attitude and rhythm of the Long Island accent are heavily influenced by its East Coast roots. To recreate this distinct \\"swagger,\\" speed up your speech and emphasize natural contractions such as \\"gotta\\" instead of \\"got to\\" or \\"wanna\\" in place of \\"want to.\\" This will help to infuse your speech with the casual, confident demeanor that typifies the Long Island persona. 3. Blend words together and elongate vowels: Another essential aspect of the Long Island accent involves blending words and elongating vowels. By combining words together, you can create a fluid flow to your speech, simulating the rapid pace of a native New Yorker. At the same time, make sure to elongate vowel sounds, as this can give your rendition a distinguishable Long Island touch. Practice these techniques by reciting phrases and sentences that feature strong vowel sounds, such as \\"Let's go to the store for coffee.\\" 4. Engage in local colloquialisms: To truly personify the Long Island accent, incorporate popular colloquialisms and expressions used by locals. Use phrases like \\"Waiting on line\\" instead of \\"waiting in line\\" and \\"Lawn Guyland\\" for \\"Long Island.\\" These authentic expressions will add depth and credibility to your accent, taking it to the next level. 5. Listen to native New Yorkers: Finally, expose yourself to the various accents present within the region by listening to native New Yorkers. This can be achieved through watching movies or television shows set in the area, listening to podcasts recorded by locals, or even observing interactions in person if you live or visit the area. This will enable you to pick up on subtle nuances and variations within the dialect, fostering your understanding of the Long Island accent. Conclusion: Mastering the Long Island accent is a process that requires dedication, practice, and a keen ear for nuance. By focusing on maintaining a nasal tone, capturing the attitude in your speech rhythms, merging words, elongating vowels, engaging in local colloquialisms, and absorbing the subtleties of native speakers, you can gradually tune your speech patterns to resemble the iconic Long Island accent."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Annelid In 2007 Torsten Struck and colleagues compared 3 genes in 81 taxa, of which 9 were outgroups, in other words not considered closely related to annelids but included to give an indication of where the organisms under study are placed on the larger tree of life. For a cross-check the study used an analysis of 11 genes (including the original 3) in 10 taxa. This analysis agreed that clitellates, pogonophorans and echiurans were on various branches of the polychaete family tree. It also concluded that the classification of polychaetes into Scolecida, Canalipalpata and Aciculata was useless, as the members of these alleged groups were scattered all over the family tree derived from comparing the 81 taxa. In addition, it also placed sipunculans, generally regarded at the time as a separate phylum, on another branch of the polychaete tree, and concluded that leeches were a sub-group of oligochaetes rather than their sister-group among the clitellates. Rouse accepted the analyses based on molecular phylogenetics, and their main conclusions are now the scientific consensus, although the details of the annelid family tree remain uncertain.

This first-rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement, romance, and James Stewart to the screen. \\"The Far Country\\" is the only one out of all five Stewart-Mann westerns that is often overlooked. Stewart, yet again, puts a new look on the ever-present personalities he had in the five Stewart-Mann westerns. Jeff Webster (Stewart) is uncaring, always looking out for himself, which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him. Ironically, he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without. This displays that he might just care for one person- his sidekick, Ben Tatum, played by Walter Brennan, since Tatum is the one that gave it to him. Mann, yet again, puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five Stewart-Mann westerns. He displays violence, excitement, plot twists, romance, and corruption. The story is that Jeff and Ben, through a series of events, wind up in the get rich quick town of Dawson, along with gold partners Calvet and Flippen, and no-good but beautiful Roman and her hired men. They are unable to leave, because crooked sheriff Mr. Gannon (McIntire) and his \\"deputies\\" will hang them, since the only way out is through Skagway, which is Gannon's town. But, eventually, McIntire comes to them, but not to collect Stewart and/or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government. What is McIntire there for? He is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money. People are killed. A sheriff for Dawson is considered needed, and Calvet elects Stewart because he is good with a gun. Stewart, however, refuses the job, because he plans to get all the gold he can, and then pull out. He also refuses it because he does not like to help people, since law and order always gets somebody killed. So, Flippen is elected instead. A miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of Gannon's men, a purely evil, mustachioed fancy gunman named Madden, who carries two guns, played by Wilke. Flippen attempts to arrest Madden and see that justice be done, but he cannot stand up to him, so he becomes the town drunk. A man named Yukon replaces Flippen. Stewart and Tatum start to pull out, but are ambushed by Gannon's men. Tatum is killed, and Stewart is wounded. Stewart finally realizes that he must do something, or Gannon will take over Dawson, set up his own rules, and it will become his town, just like Skagway. The audience also realizes what Stewart must do. Another thing that the audience realizes is that Stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and Gannon. If Stewart leaves, Gannon would take over the town. If Stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it, the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly. This is where a great scene occurs. Stewart walks into his cabin. He has a sling on his arm. For a few seconds, his gun, in the gunbelt, is hanging on a post beside his bed, the gun is close up, Stewart is in the background, just inside the door. He stares at it for a few seconds. He tosses the sling away. The sling lands on the back of a chair, and falls to the floor. This is symbolic, because he is throwing away his old life, which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself. He comes into his new life, of helping people when they need help.

In this article, we shall delve into the steps you can take to excel in these areas to increase your chances of becoming a country music sensation. Step 1: Learn to Sing The first step to achieving your country music aspirations is to learn how to sing. While some may be naturally talented, it's important to remember that singing, like any skill, can be improved with practice and guidance. Some ways to develop your singing abilities include: 1. Voice Lessons: Hiring a vocal coach or attending group singing lessons can provide you with the guidance necessary to strengthen your voice, improve pitch control, and expand your vocal range. You'll receive immediate feedback on your performance and access to tailored exercises designed to target your specific needs. 2. Choral Groups: Singing in a choir or glee club is another excellent way to improve your vocal abilities. By participating in group settings, you'll hone your ability to harmonize and blend your voice with others, skills essential to country music success. 3. Online Resources: Numerous websites, YouTube tutorials, and mobile applications offer support and lessons for beginners, intermediates, or advanced singers. These resources allow you to refine your skills at your own pace and within the comfort of your own home. Step 2: Sing Along to Country Singers Once you've developed your singing foundation, it's time to immerse yourself in country music. By singing along to your favorite country songs and closely studying the techniques of renowned country artists, you'll gain invaluable insights and inspiration to shape your own unique sound.  By studying the vocal styles of legends such as Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, and Garth Brooks, or modern stars like Carrie Underwood, Chris Stapleton, and Luke Combs, you'll learn how to infuse your own voice with the passion, grit, and heart characteristic of country music.

Step 4: Learn to Play the Guitar Finally, becoming proficient in playing the guitar can significantly boost your chances of succeeding as a country singer. The guitar is an integral part of country music, often accompanying singers to provide rhythm and melody. To become a skilled guitarist: 1. Guitar Lessons: Enroll in private guitar lessons, group classes, or online courses that focus on country guitar techniques, such as fingerpicking and country-style strumming patterns. 2. Practice Regularly: As with singing, practice is of paramount importance in developing guitar skills. Dedicate time daily to practicing chords, scales, and songs to build muscle memory and increase proficiency. 3. Play with Others: Joining a guitar group or jamming with friends offers more practice opportunities and helps develop improvisational skills essential to country music.

Question 2: What are crop circles? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"To answer these questions, I will first conduct some research and gather relevant information on crop circles. Step 1: Research crop circles and their origins Crop circles are large patterns created by the flattening of crops, usually in fields of wheat, barley, or other grain. They have been appearing in fields around the world, most notably in England, since the 1970s. Many theories have been proposed to explain their formation, ranging from natural phenomena and man-made hoaxes to extraterrestrial activities. Question 1: Why did crop circles start appearing? Based on my research, crop circles started appearing due to various reasons such as: 1. Hoaxes: Many crop circles have been created by pranksters as a form of artistic expression or for amusement. Some of the most well-known hoaxers are Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, who confessed in 1991 that they had been creating crop circles in England since 1978. 2. Natural phenomena: Some scientists have suggested that crop circles could be the result of natural causes, such as wind vortices or whirlwinds. This theory, however, does not fully explain the complexity and precision of the patterns seen in many crop circles. 3. Unexplained phenomena: While many crop circles have been explained as hoaxes or natural events, some still remain unexplained, leading to speculation about extraterrestrial involvement or other mysterious forces. Question 2: What are crop circles? Crop circles are large, often intricate patterns created by the flattening of crops, usually in fields of wheat, barley, or other grain. These formations can appear overnight and have been reported in various locations around the world, with the majority occurring in England.

The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod.

The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms.  and the situation: A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy.  Answer the following question: Is electron shielding higher or lower in Sampline? The answer to this question is:","output":"Electron shielding is higher in Sampline. Since Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine, it means that Sampline has more electron shells than Mardine. As the number of electron shells increases, the effect of electron shielding becomes more significant. Electron shielding is the phenomenon where inner electrons block the attractive force exerted by the nucleus on the outer electrons. In elements with more electron shells, the shielding effect is stronger because there are more electrons between the nucleus and the outer electrons. This leads to a decrease in effective nuclear charge felt by the outer electrons, resulting in a reduction of the electronegativity of the element as we go down a column in the periodic table. In conclusion, since Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine, its electron shielding is higher, and its electronegativity is lower."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Users Report Burning Temperatures Apple’s newly released iPad is proving to be one of the hottest items of the year, literally. Since the iPad’s release, Apple’s comment boards have become electrified with reports about the gadget overheating. One user said that the new iPad burned her thighs, leaving them red for 15 minutes. Another said his “new iPad 32 GB Wi-Fi had been getting hot enough to go into shutdown mode when using the NetFlix App after 30 minutes.” Consumer Reports weighed in, running a series of tests comparing Apple’s new iPad to the iPad 2. It found that it ran roughly 12 degrees hotter than its predecessor when gaming for 45 minutes, reaching a top temperature of 116 degrees Fahrenheit. Paul Reynolds, electronics editor at Consumer Reports, told ABC News, “We don’t consider these temperatures to be a real concern. … These are not the temperatures that are going to cause a burn, even for a fairly sustained period we think, it’s not likely. “This is not an unsafe device because of these temperatures,” he added. ”At most, you may have some discomfort. Depending on where you’re holding it, you may need to adjust your hands, but this is not going to be a safety hazard.” An Apple spokesperson told ABC News: “The new iPad delivers a stunning Retina display, A5X chip, support for 4G LTE plus 10 hours of battery life, all while operating well within our thermal specifications. If customers have any concerns, they should contact AppleCare.” ABC News has noticed warmer temperatures on the new iPad in the bottom corner when LTE is on and when playing processor-intensive games. We haven’t found it to be uncomfortable to use in our last four days of testing. Read our full review of the new iPad here.

Answer:","output":"The question appears to have some confusion within it. Mount Everest is not in Sri Lanka; it is situated at the border between Nepal and China's Tibet Autonomous Region. The peak of Mount Everest is the highest point in the world, standing at a height of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) as of 2020. However, I believe what you're asking may be about the first Sri Lankan to climb Mount Everest. That title goes to Johann Peries and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala. They were both part of the Everest Expedition in 2016 to represent Sri Lanka. Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala became the first Sri Lankan to reach the summit of Mount Everest on May 21, 2016. Before attempting to climb Everest, Jayanthi had been involved in mountaineering and adventure sports for many years. She summited Mount Imja Tse (Island Peak) in the Himalayas in 2012 and Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa in 2014. Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala, a human rights activist, and Johann Peries, a hairstylist, began their journey with a team of climbers and guides. They reached the summit by following a series of predetermined waypoints and climbing stages. Like all climbers, they faced technical challenges and altitude-related complications during the two-month expedition. During this expedition, Johann Peries faced some difficulties and had to turn back just a few hundred meters short of the summit. However, he continued his mountaineering pursuits and summited Mount Everest successfully on May 22, 2018, becoming the second Sri Lankan to do so. The achievements of these climbers have not only brought pride to Sri Lanka but have also inspired many others to push their boundaries in the field of mountaineering and adventure sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: California Reaches Beyond Its Borders With Rules, From Ethanol To Eggs Tharaldson Ethanol Plant No. 1: Blindsided by California global-warming regulations. Tharaldson Ethanol Plant No. 1 sits just west of Casselton, N.D., population 2,329, a gleaming collection of silver fermentation vats and grain-storage silos with capacity to produce 153 million gallons of alcohol a year. The 250 million plant was built with California’s strict fuel regulations in mind. It’s close to rail lines leading straight to the Golden State, and for the first two years of its existence, Tharaldson No. 1 sent 25% of its output to refineries operated by BP BP, Shell and Valero. “California was our whole business model,” says Ryan Thorpe, manager of the Tharaldson plant. “We’re on the Burlington Northern railroad. We’re a westward-facing plant.” Then California decided it didn’t like North Dakota ethanol. Under the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard that went into effect in 2010, Tharaldson was judged according to its “lifecyle” greenhouse-gas emissions and penalized for the high amount of coal burned in local power plants. California ethanol producers, who use electricity from gas and hydropower, had an edge. Tharaldson now sells less than 1% of its ethanol to California. Normally, the Constitution prohibits such shenanigans. Under the Interstate Commerce Clause, states aren’t allowed to erect barriers to the free flow of goods, and the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down state laws that give advantages to local producers of everything from milk to garbage. But so far, California seems to be getting a pass. A three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals approved the state’s ethanol regulations in September, and a month earlier the same court upheld a California law that prohibits the sale of foie gras from force-fed ducks (there’s no other kind). Out-of-state egg producers are fighting another law that bans the importation of eggs from hens that haven’t been kept in California-compliant cages (apparently, the state’s voters were disturbed by videos showing hens in cramped quarters). There’s no question states can ban products they think are unhealthy or dangerous. But it’s a stretch for California to effectively ban ethanol from the Midwest because the diesel burned in a farmer’s tractor in North Dakota contributes to the global warming that one day will threaten multimillion-dollar beach houses in Malibu. “You are allowed to regulate within your borders,” says Jonathan Adler, an expert on interstate commerce law at Case Western University Law School. Courts are supposed to distinguish between legitimate safety regulations and disguised trade barriers, however, “and California seems to be crossing that line.” California argues that since all ethanol is chemically identical, it has to look beyond the molecule to how it is produced in order to address the problem of global warming. To do that, it has a complex formula that accounts for everything from how far the grain fields are from the silo to how much fuel locomotives burn hauling the ethanol to California. Under that formula, Brazilian ethanol produced from sugar-cane waste scores better than Midwest ethanol from coal-burning states. “They’re not going to take my ethanol that’s only a few hundred miles away by train, but they’ll take it from thousands of miles away by ship,” Thorpe says. California also reached beyond its borders with the foie gras law, passed under stiff pressure from animal-rights activists alarmed by the centuries-old practice of force-feeding ducks for the 21 days before they are slaughtered in order to expand their livers. “Our point is pretty simple: You can’t induce a disease in an animal just to make it taste better,” says Carter Dillard, a lawyer for the Animal Legal Defense Fund, who says the ducks suffer progressive liver failure in the three weeks before they are killed. Foie gras producers in New York and Canada counter that they are selling a safe and federally-approved product that is still legal even in California. Unlike child pornography or machine guns, Californians can still ship all the foie gras into the state they want. The law just prohibits California businesses – read: expensive restaurants – from selling it to consumers. Even the California Food and Agriculture Dept. found the procedure isn’t cruel and urged then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to veto the bill (he didn’t). “What is the legitimate local interest here?” asks Michael Tenenbaum, a Santa Monica lawyer who is pressing the Ninth Circuit to rehear a challenge to the foie gras law. “California doesn’t have a legitimate interest in getting New York farmers to change their methods.” California voters, again outraged by undercover videos, passed Proposition 2 in 2008 requiring veal calves, hens and pregnant pigs to be raised in cages or pens large enough for the animals to “lie down, stand up, fully extend their limbs and turn around freely.” Fair enough: Californians are entitled to tell their farmers how to raise animals within state borders. Summary:","output":"California has enacted strict fuel regulations, with regulations such as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, affecting out-of-state ethanol producers like Tharaldson Ethanol Plant No. 1 in North Dakota. The plant was built for the California market and initially sent 25% of its output to the state; however, California's fuel standards have reduced sales to California to less than 1% of Tharaldson's total output. While the US Constitution prohibits states from creating such trade barriers, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals approved California's ethanol regulations in September, sparking debate on the legitimacy of these actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. A list of hobbies is lengthy and always changing as interests and fashions change. By continually participating in a particular hobby, one can acquire substantial skill and knowledge in that area. Engagement in hobbies has increased since the late nineteenth century as workers have more leisure time and advancing production and technology have provided more support for leisure activities. As some hobbies have become less popular, like stamp collecting, others have been created following technological advances, like video games.  - Model building as a hobby involves the creation of models either from kits or from materials and components acquired by the builder . Categories of modelling include : Scale model building Live steam models Matchstick models Military models Model aircraft Model cars Model commercial vehicles Model construction vehicles Building models Architectural models Model figures Model military vehicles Rail transport modelling Model rockets Model ships Freelance model Cardboard engineering Firearm models ( See Airsoft guns ) Gundam Models  - The hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever items are of interest to the individual collector. The scope of collecting is unlimited: \\"If something exists, somebody somewhere collects them.\\"  - Leisure has been defined as a quality of experience or as free time.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Stamp collecting is the collecting of postage stamps and related objects. It is related to philately which is the study of stamps. It has been one of the world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service, but is now in decline with the rise of the internet which has sharply reduced the number of postal items arriving in households. Stamp collecting proved to be an almost perfect hobby for collectors because there was a never ending stream of new stamps as each country sought to advertise its distinctiveness through its stamps. Because some stamps became rare, a thriving international trade in stamps was created.

Movie plot title: Bad Kids Go to Hell Movie plot: A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Meganâs inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before itâs found.

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Bad Kids Go to Hell,\\" the character Jacob Rainwater is not killed by the students or anyone else during the course of the film. Jacob, an Apache Native American, owned the land on which Crestview Academy was later built. His land was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by General Andrew Winston Clarke, and it was then taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. The students believe that the library is haunted, possibly due to the history of the land and its connection to Jacob Rainwater.

Here is a news article: The fresh allegations follow several made by actresses in the US against Weinstein - four of rape and more than 30 of sexual harassment - and come as the organisation behind the Oscars expelled Weinstein.      Bafta had already suspended the producer and on Tuesday Weinstein's wife, British designer Georgina Chapman, said she was leaving him.      Actress Anthony, 54, told The Sunday Times she met the producer when she starred in 1982 sci-fi film Krull and the alleged assault occurred a few years later.      She said it was a \\"pathetic, revolting\\" attack that had left her \\"disgusted and embarrassed\\".      On Wednesday, Anthony tweeted that she had just reported a historical crime, adding \\"feel sick... so sad\\".      Fellow British star Kate Winslet also spoke of her recollections of Weinstein, saying it was \\"absolutely deliberate\\" that she did not thank the director when she won her best actress Oscar, despite the fact his company financed and distributed the film.      Winslet, who won the Academy Award in 2009 for The Reader - in which she played a woman hiding her past as a guard at a Nazi concentration camp - thanked 19 people by name but deliberately excluded Weinstein. ||||| Many were young, powerless and afraid to speak out in case their careers were ruined.      For nearly three decades their accusations remained bottled up, some suppressed by pay-offs.      More than 30 women have now come forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, the man once described as 'God' of the film industry.      The accusations, including from some of the world's most famous actresses, range from inappropriate massages to rape.      Here is a list of those who have come forward so far.      Kate Beckinsale In an Instagram post the Underworld star said Weinstein made a move on her when she was just 17.      'When I arrived reception told me to go to his room. He opened the door in his bathrobe. I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him. After declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed. A few years later he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting.I realized he couldn't remember if he had assaulted me or not.'      Teen assault: Kate Beckinsale says Weinstein tried to ply her with alcohol and met her in his bathrobe when she was just 17      Gwyneth Paltrow      The star said that when she was 22, Weinstein touched her and suggested having joint massages in a hotel bedroom before she started shooting the 1996 Jane Austen adaptation Emma.

Paltrow (pictured with Weinstein in 2002) told the New York Times that when she was 22 Weinstein touched her and suggested having joint massages in the bedroom      She said she told her then boyfriend Brad Pitt about the incident and he confronted the mogul. She said Weinstein then told her not to tell anyone and she feared getting fired.      Gwyneth Paltrow, 45, is an American actress, singer, and food writer who made her name starring in Seven (1995) and Emma (1996).      Angelina Jolie      The actress told the New York Times she had to turn down advances from Weinstein in 1998 and chose never to work with him again. She said she warned other women about him.      She said: 'I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did.'      Angelina Jolie, 42, is cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. She made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982).      Jolie (pictured speaking ahead of a screening of her new film In the Land of Blood and Honey) told the New York Times she had to turn down advances from Weinstein in 1998      Cara Delevigne      The model wrote on her Instagram page about a meeting with Weinstein in which he 'asked her to kiss another woman.'      She wrote: 'As soon as we were alone he began to brag about all the actresses he had slept with and how he had made their careers and spoke about other inappropriate things of a sexual nature. He then invited me to his room. I quickly declined and asked his assistant if my car was outside. She said it wasn't and wouldn't be for a bit and I should go to his room.      'At that moment I felt very powerless and scared but didn't want to act that way hoping that I was wrong about the situation. When I arrived I was relieved to find another woman in his room and thought immediately I was safe. He asked us to kiss and she began some sort of advances upon his direction. I swiftly got up and asked him if he knew that I could sing. And I began to sing....i thought it would make the situation better....more professional....like an audition....i was so nervous. After singing I said again that I had to leave.He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room'.      Cara Delevigne, 25, is an English fashion model and actress. She signed with Storm Model Management after leaving school in 2009.      Eva Green      Green's mother says Weinstein sexually harassed her during a meeting at his suite in Paris.      The Bond Girl, 37, managed to escape however after being summoned to the movie mogul's hotel room, her mother Marlene Jobert said in a radio interview on Friday.      'He operated with her the exact same way he acted with all the others, under the pretext of a professional meeting, of a script that had to get to her with a nice part into the bargain,' said Jobert.      'Since his office was also in his hotel suite, she [Eva] followed him, and the exact same thing happened to her as to the others. She managed to escape, but he threatened to destroy her professionally.'      Jobert added: '[It was] the usual scenario, the same pattern he used for all the other victims.'      Weinstein allegedly harassed French actress Eva Green in his suite in Paris      Lea Seydoux      The French actress accused the mogul of jumping on her and trying to kiss her.      She wrote in The Guardian: 'We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He’s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. He tried more than once. This was never going to be about work. He had other intentions – I could see that very clearly. All throughout the evening, he flirted and stared at me as if I was a piece of meat.      The French actress (pictured in Spectre) accused the mogul of jumping on her and trying to kiss her      'It was hard to say no because he’s so powerful. I’m an actress and he’s a producer. We are in the same industry, so its impossible to avoid him. I’ve seen how he operates: the way he looks for an opening. The way he tests women to see what he can get away with. That’s the most disgusting thing. Everyone knew what Harvey was up to and no one did anything. It's unbelievable that he’s been able to act like this for decades and still keep his career.'      Lea Seydoux, 35, starred in Bond film Spectre and was nominated for the César Award for Best Actress for her role as a lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette in the film Farewell, My Queen (2012).

Kelly said that she agreed to the meeting but refused to go to Weinstein's room, and instead met him at the restaurant inside his hotel with an assistant.      'He bulls*** me for 5 minutes re: movies he could put me in, then asked the assistant to excuse us,' said Weinstein.      'As she walked away, he said, \\"I know you were feeling what I was feeling when we met the other night” and then regaled me with offers of a lavish life filled with trips around the world on private planes etc.      'IF I would be his girlfriend.'      Kelly posted a photo of a cross stitch alongside her post that read: 'Boys will be Boys.'      The second 'boys' was crossed out at the bottom however, and stitched in was 'held accountable for their f***ing actions.'      Kelly claimed the alleged encounter was the day-to-day b***shit of being an actress.'      Minka Kelly said she met Weinstein at an event and soon after was asked by her agent if she would be willing to meet him at his hotel room to discuss her career      Tara Subkoff      The actress claims Weinstein sexually harassed her when she was up for a part in one of his movies in the 1990s.      She told Variety: 'That night I was offered the role, and I went out to a premiere after party that was also at.

'I remember him telling me all the actresses who had slept with him and what he had done for them.'      I wasn't drinking the cool aid [sic], I knew Harvey was a master manipulator.      'He also announced to me at the last dinner I had with him at Dominic's that his pilot knew to be on standby because he could never get me to sleep with him, to which I did what I always did, make light of the situation, a joke here or there and moved on.'

Unnamed woman      A woman who did not wish to be named because she feared Weinstein's connections told The New York Times that the producer had summoned her to his hotel at an unknown date and raped her. ||||| They took a seat on the couch, and Ms. Battilana began showing Mr. Weinstein her modeling photos on a tablet computer as they discussed the possibility of her working as a lingerie model, according to the account she later gave police. When the topic turned to whether her breasts looked real, Mr. Weinstein lunged forward and grabbed them. She protested and pushed his hands away, but Mr. Weinstein was persistent, putting his hand up her skirt and asking to kiss her, the police report says.      Ms. Battilana reported the encounter to police within hours of leaving Mr. Weinstein’s office, and quickly detectives from the Special Victims Unit were brought into the investigation. The model was going over the details of her allegation with them when her phone rang. It was Mr. Weinstein, asking to meet her for a drink, and the investigators seized the moment, whispering to her to accept an invitation to see him the following night at the bar of the TriBeCa Grand Hotel. They would fit her with a recording device.      Mr. Weinstein showed up at the bar the next night seemingly eager for a reunion, according to the audio recording. He had no idea that the TriBeCa Grand, which has since been renamed the Roxy Hotel, was swarming with undercover detectives.      Mr. Weinstein invited her up to his room, saying he needed to take a shower, the police said. Ms. Battilana went upstairs, but refused to enter the room. In a tense exchange in the hallway, she asked him why he had touched her breasts the day before.      As his tone grew belligerent, a detective, concerned for Ms. Battilana’s safety, intervened. Pretending to be a reporter from TMZ, he loudly badgered Mr. Weinstein for an interview, causing enough of a scene for Mr. Weinstein to retreat from the hallway, investigators said.      Once they were back downstairs, Ms. Battilana slipped out a side door, and Mr. Weinstein was once again confronted by a detective. This time, the detective made it known he was from law enforcement, and that the police wanted to talk to him.      Undermining an Accuser      Mr. Weinstein, 65, had faced allegations of sexual misconduct before, the investigations by The Times and The New Yorker found, but this was the first time police were known to have been involved. The Times found that in at least seven other cases, he had quietly made payments to female accusers in exchange for their silence, effectively preventing them — and their accusations — from emerging in the public eye. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"More than 30 women have come forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The accusations, including those from some of the world's most famous actresses, range from inappropriate massages to rape. Some accusations were suppressed by pay-offs, and alleged victims include Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Beckinsale, and Cara Delevingne. The revelations have led to Weinstein's expulsion from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organizes the Oscars, and to the suspension of his membership of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But, not for very long! My apologies as I need to give a little back story first. Please bear with. I first came to the DC/NOVA area via the US Army. It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay.

Article: The man who invented Coca-Cola was not a native Atlanta, but on the day of his funeral every drugstore in town shut up the shop in honor of him. He was John Styth Pemberton, born in 1833 in Knoxville, Georgia, eighty miles away. Pemberton was a chemist, sometimes known as Doctor, who, during the Civil War, became an officer and led a cavalry troop. He settled in Atlanta in 1869, and soon began making such patent medicines as Triplex Liver Pills and Globe of Flower Cough Syrup. In 1885, he registered a trademark for something called French Wine Coca-Ideal Nerve and Tonic Stimulant. A few months later, he formed the Pemberton Chemical Company, and hired an accountant named Frank M. Robinson, who had not only a good head for figures, but, attached to it, so unique a nose that he could judge the ingredients of a batch of syrup merely by sniffing it. In 1886 --- a year in which, as contemporary Coca-Cola officials like to point out, the English writer Conan Doyle made Sherlock Holmes known publicly and France found the truth about the Statue of Liberty --- Pemberton invented a syrup that he called Coca-Cola. It was a change of his French Wine Coca. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and, when the end product tasted awful, had thrown in some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his back yard and swishing it around with an oar. He distributed it to soda fountains in used beer bottles, and Robinson, with his elegant account's script, instantly designed a label, on which \\"Coca-Cola\\" was written in the style which is still employed. Pemberton looked upon his mixture less as a drink than as a headache cure. One morning in 1886, a man suffering from a headache dragged himself into an Atlanta drugstore and asked for a bottle of Coca-Cola. According to usual practice, druggists should pour a teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of water, but at that time, the man on duty was too lazy to walk to the fresh-water tap. Instead, he mixed the syrup with some soda... Question: How did Pemberton change French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious? - He mixed it with several oils instead of water. - He put some beer into the mixture. - He added more coffee into the mixture than before. - He added some cola nut oil and a few other oils. Answer:","output":"Pemberton changed the French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious by adding some cola nut oil and a few other oils to the mixture. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and when the end product tasted awful, he threw in the mentioned oils, which improved the taste of the concoction that would eventually become Coca-Cola."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Article:","output":"Title: Facebook Faces Criticism Over Anti-Semitic Ads and Promises More Human Oversight Facebook is once again finding itself in hot water, this time over claims that it allowed anti-Semitic ads to be shown to users who posted hate speech online. The social media giant has come under fire in the past for the role its ads played in the US presidential election, and now a recent report from ProPublica has revealed that Facebook's algorithm-generated ad system allowed advertisers to target profiles with references to \\"Jew hater\\" and \\"How to burn Jews\\". In response to the controversy, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg announced on Wednesday that the company would add \\"more human review and oversight\\" to prevent its automated processes from being misused. Sandberg stated in a Facebook post, \\"The fact that hateful terms were even offered as options was totally inappropriate and a fail on our part.\\" As a Jewish woman herself, Sandberg expressed her frustration over the deeply offensive terms that were written in the education and employer fields on Facebook profiles. These fields are used to help advertisers target specific audiences, and while they were missed initially because they \\"were used so infrequently,\\" Sandberg confirmed that they have since been deleted. Going forward, Sandberg said that Facebook is working on a program that will allow users to report potential ad abuses. The news was welcomed by Ad Age, which reported on the developments. By addressing the issue head-on and pledging to implement human oversight and user control, Facebook aims to demonstrate its commitment to preventing future ad controversies.

Premise: \\"These organizations range from groups that disseminate information on immediate threats and vulnerabilities, to those that seek to facilitate information sharing between public and private entities on industry-specific threats, to those that promote coordination across infrastructure sectors and on an international scale.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The groups are not allowed to share information with anyone.\\"?","output":"If the premise is true, it tells us that there is a diverse range of organizations involved in disseminating information on threats and vulnerabilities, as well as facilitating information sharing and coordination between various public and private entities on local, industry-specific, and international levels. The premise suggests that information sharing and coordination between these groups is not only a key practice but also an essential component of their overall mission. Given the premise, we can analyze the hypothesis: \\"The groups are not allowed to share information with anyone.\\" To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or contradicts it, we must examine both the content and implications of each statement. The hypothesis claims that these organizations are not permitted to share information with any external entity or individual. This statement is in direct contradiction with the premise, which underlines the importance of information sharing and coordination between the various groups as a central aspect of their objective. Considering the roles of these organizations as described in the premise, it is evident that their activities revolve around the dissemination of information concerning threats and vulnerabilities. This involves the sharing of information between different groups, both public and private, to create a more robust and integrated system of threat detection, prevention, and response. Additionally, the premise highlights the cross-sector and international collaboration these organizations are engaged in, demonstrating that they are sharing information not only within the confines of a particular industry or nation, but across multiple sectors and geographical borders. Moreover, the premise implies a sense of trust and collaboration between these organizations, as they work together to identify and counter potential threats to infrastructure and security. By sharing information, they can pool their resources and expertise, better understand the nature of threats, and develop effective countermeasures and strategies to protect public and private entities alike. In conclusion, the premise shows a landscape where organizations are engaged in sharing information and coordinating with each other on various levels to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities effectively. This involvement directly contradicts the hypothesis that \\"the groups are not allowed to share information with anyone.\\" Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true or entailed by the premise, as it is inconsistent with the key activities and objectives of the organizations mentioned in the premise. Instead, the premise reveals that information sharing amongst these groups is vital for their mission and the overall security of infrastructure and nations, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts and communication channels."},{"instruction":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how does the mls schedule work Suggested answer: The league's closed membership makes it one of the world's few soccer leagues not using promotion and relegation .

Question: What is farthest west, Paris, Brussels or Rouen? Context: Paris is located in northern central France. By road it is 450 kilometres (280 mi) south-east of London, 287 kilometres (178 mi) south of Calais, 305 kilometres (190 mi) south-west of Brussels, 774 kilometres (481 mi) north of Marseille, 385 kilometres (239 mi) north-east of Nantes, and 135 kilometres (84 mi) south-east of Rouen. Paris is located in the north-bending arc of the river Seine and includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream of the city, established around 7600 BC. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river. Overall, the city is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft). Montmartre gained its name from the martyrdom of Saint Denis, first bishop of Paris, atop the Mons Martyrum, \\"Martyr's mound\\", in 250.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"The answer provided does not accurately answer the original question about the number of nuclear countries in the world. The response seems to discuss countries that are opposed to nuclear power, rather than focusing on those possessing nuclear weapons or utilizing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. To help you validate the correct answer, let's break down the question into two main categories: countries with nuclear weapons and countries with nuclear power reactors for civilian use. 1. Countries with nuclear weapons: As of 2022, there are nine countries known to possess nuclear weapons. These countries are the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. These nations are either officially recognized as nuclear-weapon states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) or are known to possess nuclear weapons outside of the treaty's framework. 2. Countries with nuclear power reactors for civilian use: While there are nine countries with nuclear weapons, several more countries have nuclear power reactors for civilian purposes, such as generating electricity. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as of January 2022, there are 31 countries operating nuclear power reactors. Some of these countries include the United States, Russia, China, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, South Korea, India, the United Kingdom, and many others. In summary, the original answer provided does not accurately address the question. There are nine countries with nuclear weapons, and 31 countries have nuclear power reactors for non-military purposes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. amusing tale or skits for your comic. Come up with a joke you want to share with the world. Scribbling down some basic dialogue for your characters may be helpful. Make use of subjects that interest you and what you find funny, then try to fit it into your own sense of humor.  A lot of literary work comes from personal experience. Your past may be rich with stories you can tell. You can also put yourself in new situations to get more inspiration. For example, Bill Watterson’s Calvin and Hobbes is about a boy and his stuffed tiger. Scott Adams’s Dilbert lampoons office culture. Ask yourself what age group your comic is meant for. Complicated jokes are more appropriate for teens and adults, for instance. Tone down the joke if you’re writing for children. Before setting pencil to paper, make a final decision about your comic’s subject matter. This is very important since it determines how you design the rest of your comic. Select a scenario that is easy for you to imagine. It may not seem laugh out loud hilarious yet, but it can be a good starting point. Even ideas that seem insignificant at first can turn out to be very funny. For example, imagine drawing a child pretending to be Superman. You can take this concept in many different directions. Once you have settled on the story you want to tell, think of who you need in the comic to tell it. Most short comics involve a limited number of characters, usually less than 3 or 4 at a time. The comic’s story can be driven by the personalities of a few characters and how they interact.  You do not need to have multiple characters. For instance, picture a child blowing bubble gum until it pops all over her. Her actions and reaction, driven by her personality, create the humor. If your comic is short, having a lot of characters can be overwhelming and obscure the writing. Keep your comic simple so it stays funny. Ask yourself what your characters are doing. You should have a basic idea of this from brainstorming funny ideas earlier. Expand on your idea before beginning to draw. Any characters you use should contribute to the joke presented in your comic.  This may help you come up with more amusing situations or dialogue. Take into account the character’s personality. Keep their actions true to their character. The reason doesn’t have to be complex, but it does keep the humor cohesive. For example, a child may dress up as a Superhero because superheroes are fun and they want to fly. The setting may be a very important part of your joke. If this is the case, you will need to draw the setting into your panel. Close your eyes and try to imagine your characters in the location you chose. You should be able to see the background and any important plot details you need to draw in.  If your character visits a zoo, for example, plan on drawing cages, animals, and possibly walkways and other scenery. If your comic can take place anywhere, having a specific setting isn’t necessary. Many black and white comics use a white background. Color comics keep the background an unobtrusive color like blue. Think about when your comic takes place. The time of day, season, or year may not make a difference in some situations. For others, it can be very important. Many comics are funny because they address present-day issues that readers relate to. Also, your choice of time period can affect your comic’s background.  For instance, a comic set in autumn looks different than one set in summer. Instead of a bright, radiant sun, you may end up drawing piles of leaves. For example, Hagar the Horrible is about a viking. The setting is the Middle Ages, so you won’t see cars, vending machines, skyscrapers, or computers laying around. Most funny stories can be told within 3 or 4 individual panels. Each panel gives you space to tell a part of the joke. The first panel sets up a situation, the second panel shows what happens, and the last panel explains what happens, completing the joke.  Many short comics have a 3-act structure, similar to lots of books and plays. Having a beginning, middle, and end is a simple, classic way to arrange comics. Not all comics are in this format. Many good comics are 1 panel, such as those printed in magazines like The New Yorker and Women’s World. Comics can also be much longer than 4 panels. Summary:","output":"This article discusses the process of creating a comic, including developing a joke, selecting the subject matter, designing the characters and setting, and determining the comic's length and format."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A teenager who put a man through two months of torment by falsely accusing him of rape has been spared jail. Sophie Hooper, 19, told police she had been forced to have sex against her will with a man she had only just met in the pub. But two months later her conscience got the better of her and she wrote a letter to the police confessing she had lied about the allegations. Hooper had claimed she went with the unnamed man to his home where he held her down by the neck on his bed and raped her. After she called police, who came out in the middle of the night, the man was arrested and held in custody for more than seven hours. Sophie Hooper, 19, told police she had been raped but two months later confessed that she had lied. She escaped a jail sentence at Southampton Crown Court today. Victims and alleged victims of rape have been granted anonymity since 1976 to spare women from humiliation and encourage more victims to report attacks.The law originally gave the same protection to those charged with rape.But anonymity for defendants was withdrawn in 1988 after judges protested that it prevented police from appealing for witnesses.Judges also said that the acquittal of a man charged with rape was enough to clear his name and reputation.Maura McGowan, a deputy High Court judge and chief of the professional body for barristers, recently called for the identities of men accused of rape and other sex crimes to be kept secret unless they are found guilty in court.The leading lawyer said the names of those charged with sex offences should not be released because the crimes carry 'such a stigma’. But John Cooper, a human rights barrister, disagreed with this and said anonymity for people accused of sex crimes is 'unworkable'. But there was no truth in Hooper's. allegations. She didn't admit this for over two months, before she eventually told police she was lying. Southampton Crown Court heard how police began investigating and found inconsistencies with her version of events. Hooper accused the man of raping her in June 2011 but by August that year officers told him he wouldn't face prosecution. ]A. short time later police received a letter from Hooper, who has just. become a mum, in which she said 'maybe calling it rape was wrong'. The teenager from Eastleigh, Hampshire, was later arrested in September 2011 on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. But it wasn't until January 2012 that 'she fully accepted the lies she had told' said prosecutor Carolyn Branford-Wood.Hooper. revealed how, in fact, the pair had gone to his home from the pub,. began kissing and the sex 'just happened', adding she didn't say yes or. no. When she left his home she returned to the pub run by friends of her family who told her she had been raped and to call 999. In. court Hooper apologised by saying 'I shouldn't have lied, I am sorry' and added that if she could turn the clock back she would. The. court was told how the man described in a victim impact statement. feeling 'sick to the stomach' and anxious following the accusation. He was also unable to go out because, even though he knew he was innocent, he felt he would be tarred. He said he could not sleep properly and resorted to taking anti-depressants. Mitigating. for Hooper, Fern Russell said it was not a sophisticated plot - she was. in a state and made a bad decision out of stupidity rather than malice. Recorder Stuart Jones QC handed the teenager an eight-month prison term suspended for two years. He told her she was lucky not to have gone to jail for what the court deems a very serious offence. Crying wolf: Sophie Hooper, 19, appeared at Southampton Crown Court yesterday. Mr Jones said: 'The consequences for the man accused must have been traumatic in the extreme.' He added that Hooper had just come out of a difficult period of adolescence and her mental health was far from robust. The teenager was ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article revolves around the case of teenager Sophie Hooper, who falsely accused a man of rape and later confessed to her lie.

This article: Shaw and Crompton is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the River Beal at the foothills of the South Pennines,  2.3 miles (3.7 km) north of Oldham, 3.6 miles (5.8 km) southeast of Rochdale, and 8.7 miles (14 km) to the northeast of the city of Manchester. It is regularly referred to as Shaw. Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was originally known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system. The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution initiated a process of rapid and unplanned urbanisation. A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century, when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce. By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated mill town. Forty-eight cotton mills—some of the largest in the United Kingdom—have been recorded as existing in the area. At its spinning zenith, as a result of an interwar economic boom associated with the textile industry, Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in the region's textile industry during the mid-20th century; Shaw and Crompton's last mill closed in 1989. Shaw and Crompton, which covers 4.5 square miles (11.7 km2), is a predominantly suburban area of mixed affluence with a population of 21,065 as of 2011.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Victor Jara was born in 1932 in Lonquen, near Santiago, to two peasants, Manuel Jara and Amanda Martinez. His father was illiterate and encouraged his children to work from an early age to help the family survive, rather than attend school. By the age of 6, Jara was already working on the land. His father could not support the family on his earnings as a peasant at the Ruiz-Tagle estate, nor was he able to find stable work. After joining the choir at the University of Chile in Santiago, Jara was convinced by a choir-mate to pursue a career in theater. He subsequently joined the university's theater program and earned a scholarship for talent. He appeared in several of the university's plays, gravitating toward those with social themes, such as Russian playwright Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths, a depiction of the hardships of lower-class life.  In 1957, he met Violeta Parra, a singer who had steered folk music in Chile away from the rote reproduction of rural materials toward modern song composition rooted in traditional forms, and who had established musical community centers called penas to incorporate folk music into the everyday life of modern Chileans. Jara absorbed these lessons and began singing with a group called Cuncumen, with whom he continued his explorations of Chile's traditional music. He was deeply influenced by the folk music of Chile and other Latin American countries, and by artists such as Parra, Atahualpa Yupanqui, and the poet Pablo Neruda.  In the 1960s, Jara started specializing in folk music and sang at Santiago's La Pena de Los Parra, owned by Angel Parra. Through these activities, he became involved in the Nueva Cancion movement of Latin American folk music. He released his first album, Canto a lo humano, in 1966, and by 1970, he had left his theater work in favor of a career in music. His songs were inspired by a combination of traditional folk music and left-wing political activism. From this period, some of his best-known songs are \\"Plegaria a un Labrador\\" (\\"Prayer to a Worker\\") and \\"Te Recuerdo Amanda\\" (\\"I Remember You Amanda\\").

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What work's entrance chorus fit the situation almost exactly?  \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is the best known piece from Thespis, as it was transplanted in 1879 into one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful operas, The Pirates of Penzance. In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from Thespis fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead.Several scholars have doubted that explanation. In Sullivan's autograph score for the later work, the first part of \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is actually taken from a Thespis copyist score, with the Thespis words cancelled and the new words written in, which raises the question of why Sullivan had a Thespis score to hand, if not for that purpose.Some suggest that other music from Thespis could have been used in Pirates. Goldberg suggests that \\"It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his Thespis music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which The Pirates of Penzance was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair.\\" Reginald Allen says that \\"it seems certain\\" from its \\"rhythmic structure\\" that part of the Act I finale of Thespis, \\"Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys\\" became the original Act II finale in Pirates, \\"At length we are provided with unusual felicity\\", which was later deleted.

We have been here quite a few times in the past few months and I have come to the realization that CK's is just okay most of the time. They do a few things really well and most others not so much. I really like the original burger sliders and the pulled pork sliders. I also enjoy the boneless hot wings. Other than that, my experience has not been very good.  Service is pretty good most of the time. Tonight it took at least ten minutes after being seated to be greeted. Our waitress did apologize and she look stressed so I felt for her. We ordered the pepperjack cheese dip with tortilla chips. It was not good. It was pretty much velveeta heated up in a cup and the chips were extremely stale, tasted like they had been sitting around for at least a month in an opened bag. I ordered the french dip sandwich for my entree (see attached pic). It looked pretty good. Looks can be deceiving. It was bad. The beef tasted off. Like beef that had been sitting around too long. Very unappetizing. After two bites I was done. All of the food in general looked old and not at all fresh tonight. A huge turn off. If our dinner was this bad, how bad was the food in kitchen? Just an all around bad experience tonight.  I still gave two stars because I think that this place still has potential. I am asking that if the manager or owner read this, please take note of this experience tonight. Take a look in the kitchen and make some improvements.

Chris works for MSF, an organization also known as Doctors Without Border . Since 1971, MFS has sent trained doctors all over the world to help people who have suffered from disasters, such as wars and illnesses. Chris is a doctor from France who has traveled to many places to organize programs that help people. At the moment, over 27,000 trained doctors have taken part in MSF projects. The organization received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999. All kinds of doctors can volunteer for MSF. They need to be ready to go almost anywhere in the world and, of course, they should face difficulties. Most of MSF's work is in Africa. When MSF chooses a doctor for a task, they have to go for at least six months. When doctors have completed a few tasks, they might be sent on an emergency  task following a disaster, such as an earthquake. But why would doctors leave a comfortable life and a good pay to join MSF? According to Chris, the experience they have is a great help in their life. What's more, just like the explorers of the past, they need to keep an open mind and learn to get on well with the people they meet.

Some ancient people believed that lightning and thunder were the weapons of the gods.  In reality, lightning is a flow of electricity formed high above the earth. A single flash of lightning 1.6 kilometers long has enough electricity to light one million light bulbs . The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, was the first to show the connection between electricity and lightning in 1752. In the same year he also built the first lightning rod  . This device protects buildings from being damaged by lightning. Modern science has discovered that one stroke of lightning has a voltage   of more than 15 million volts  . A flash of lightning between a cloud and the earth may be as long as 13 kilometers, and travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second. Scientists judge that there are about 2,000 million flashes of lightning per year. Lightning hits the Empire State Building in New York City 30 to 48 times a year. In the United States alone it kills an average of one person every day. The safest place to be in case of an electrical storm is in a closed car.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Thomas Wesley Pentz (born November 10, 1978), better known by his stage name Diplo, is an American DJ, record producer, rapper and songwriter based in Los Angeles, California. He is the co-creator and lead member of the electronic dancehall music project Major Lazer, and along with producer and DJ Skrillex, part of the electronic duo Jack U. He founded and manages record company Mad Decent, as well as co-founding the non-profit organization Heads Decent. Among other jobs, he has worked as a school teacher in Philadelphia. Diplo was born on November 10, 1978, in Tupelo, Mississippi, the son of Barbara Jean (nee Cox) and Thomas Pentz. He is of German and English descent. The influence of home-grown rap played a key role in helping shape his production style. He spent the majority of his youth in Miami, where he got a taste for the characteristic Miami bass. He began attending the University of Central Florida in 1997, and then moved to Philadelphia to continue his studies at Temple University, where he first garnered attention as a DJ. After frequently running into fellow DJ Low Budget, the two began throwing parties under the Hooked on Hollertronix moniker in 2003 as a way of maintaining control of what they were able to play during DJ gigs in Philadelphia. The success of these parties allowed the two to release mixtapes, both separate and together, gathering acclaim across the country. One such mixtape, Never Scared, was named one of the New York Times top ten albums of 2003, and the Hollertronix name became synonymous with parties featuring guests like Maluca Mala, Bun B, Spank Rock, M.I.A., among others. Hollertronix's sound has been described as \\"disparate genres to be smashed together for maximum attention-grabbing impact\\" an aesthetic which takes from the \\"organic, cohesive, whole\\" aesthetic of acts such as Bun B, Lil Jon, Drama, M.I.A., Bjork, Busta Rhymes, and others.  Diplo accentuated the club aesthetic of his Hollertronix music for a more reflective sound on his solo debut, Florida, which was released on the Ninja Tune imprint, Big Dada Records. The album Florida was pressed twice, first with a CD and the second with a CD and DVD. The DVD was created by System D-128, another artist who has collaborated with Diplo on some audio and video projects. Before Florida's DVD accompaniment, another DVD surfaced called Diplo: \\"Banned in Libya\\" which was released by Money Studies, the first label to release a solo project by Diplo under his original DJ name Diplodocus. It was a 45 rpm record called \\"Thingamajawn\\" for which there is also a music video System D-128 directed. Similar to the Florida DVD, \\"Banned in Libya\\" is an experimental audio and video mix of some of Diplo's original music blended with a number of other unidentified sources. His particular affinity for one genre of music called baile funk, or favela funk, would spawn a series of mixtapes (Favela on Blast, Favela Strikes Back), which served to bring the Brazilian dance music of the ghettos to the United States.  It was not long before his Hooked on Hollertronix parties would provide him the success necessary to move to the next logical step and build a studio where music would become his full-time focus. With this goal in mind, Diplo built \\"The Mausoleum,\\" a video studio, recording studio, record label office, gallery, and event space in Philadelphia. Since its inception, The Mausoleum has become the home to recordings by artists like Christina Aguilera, Shakira, M.I.A., Santigold, Spank Rock, Plastic Little, Blaqstarr, Paper Route Gangstaz, and hosted concerts by Glass Candy, Skream, Boys Noize, Nicos Gun, and more. Who else performed on the album?","output":"The article does not provide specific information on other artists who performed on Diplo's album \\"Florida.\\" However, it mentions numerous artists with whom Diplo has collaborated or hosted concerts at his recording studio, \\"The Mausoleum,\\" such as Christina Aguilera, Shakira, M.I.A., Santigold, Spank Rock, Plastic Little, Blaqstarr, and Paper Route Gangstaz.

Question: What is the first name of the person who suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Zappa expressed opinions on censorship when he appeared on CNN's Crossfire TV series and debated issues with Washington Times commentator John Lofton in 1986. On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the United States Senate Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of then-senator Al Gore. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content. During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the \\"Blank Tape Tax.\\" Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship, and called their proposal for voluntary labelling of records with explicit content \\"extortion\\" of the music industry.In his prepared statement, he said: The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In an NaCl crystal, how can sodium and chloride each make 6 bonds while their valency is one? In an NaCl crystal, how can each of them make 6 bonds while their valency is 1? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The questions you posed essentially ask the same thing, with slightly different wording. Both inquire about the formation of 6 bonds between sodium and chloride in an NaCl crystal considering their valency is one. Therefore, I will provide an in-depth answer that addresses the main subject of your questions. In an NaCl (sodium chloride) crystal, it is important to understand that the crystal structure is not based on the sharing of electrons through covalent bonds, which the concept of valency typically refers to. Instead, NaCl is an ionic compound, forming ionic bonds that result in the regular arrangement of sodium (Na+) cations and chloride (Cl-) anions. These ionic bonds form through the electrostatic attraction between positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-). Due to the ionization of the atoms, the valency of one in each atom is satisfied. The NaCl crystal structure can be described as a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice of chloride ions with sodium ions occupying all the octahedral holes. To elaborate, in the fcc arrangement, each chloride ion is surrounded by 6 sodium ions, and conversely, each sodium ion is surrounded by 6 chloride ions. This 6-fold coordination is the result of ionic packing which determines the position and geometrical arrangement of ions in the crystal lattice. The crucial factor here is the efficient packing, not the valency. Even though the valency of Na and Cl is one, the 6-fold coordination in the crystal structure is due to the need for an efficient packing arrangement in the lattice and not the electrostatic interaction of valencies to make bonds. Therefore, when considering NaCl's ionic bonding, there is still only one full electrostatic interaction between one sodium ion and one chloride ion. In the fcc lattice, each ion is at the center of an octahedron formed by the six nearest ions of the opposite charge. The confusion arises when one tries to apply the concept of valency for covalent bonds to an ionic compound. While valency indeed refers to the number of bonds that an atom can form in covalent bonds, this principle does not translate directly to ionic compounds. Ionic bonds, like those in an NaCl crystal, are formed instead through the electrostatic interactions between charged particles. In conclusion, while the valency of sodium and chloride is one, their 6-fold coordination in an NaCl crystal structure is due to efficient packing, and not the formation of 6 covalent bonds. Ion arrangement in the crystal lattice is determined by the need for efficient packing rather than the electrostatic interaction of valencies as in the case of covalent bonds."},{"instruction":"Question: Pick one category for the following text.

How do batteries work? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Yes, both questions essentially ask for the same information, which is an explanation of how batteries function. I'll provide an explanation of the inner workings of a battery, addressing the request from both questions. Step 1: Understand the basic components A battery typically consists of three main components: a cathode (positive terminal), an anode (negative terminal), and an electrolyte. These components are housed within a container. Step 2: Identify the key processes The fundamental process behind a battery's function is the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. This is achieved through redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions occurring between the cathode, anode, and electrolyte. Step 3: Explain the redox reactions During a redox reaction, electrons are transferred between the cathode and anode. Usually, the anode undergoes oxidation, losing electrons, while the cathode undergoes reduction, gaining electrons. The electrolyte helps to facilitate this electron transfer by conducting ions, but not electrons, maintaining charge neutrality within the battery. Step 4: Explain the role of the external circuit An external circuit connects the anode and cathode, providing a path for electrons to flow from the anode (where they are in excess) to the cathode. When a device is connected to this circuit, the flow of electrons provides electrical energy to power the device. Step 5: Describe the battery discharge process As the battery discharges, the redox reactions deplete the chemicals within the anode and cathode, and the battery's potential difference (voltage) starts to drop. Eventually, the battery will be unable to deliver the required electrical energy, at which point it is considered \\"dead\\" or depleted. Step 6: Explain rechargeability (for rechargeable batteries) In rechargeable batteries (e.g., lithium-ion, nickel-metal hydride), the redox reactions can be reversed by connecting the battery to an external electrical energy source. This recharging process replenishes the chemicals within the anode and cathode and restores the battery's potential difference, allowing it to deliver electrical energy once again. By breaking down the process into these steps, I've explained the inner workings of a battery and addressed both of the user's questions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Food and Drug Administration are reviewing what establishments should be forced to display calorie counts on their menus, with the idea that many people - ordering at a diner, for example - would pass on that bacon double cheeseburger if they realized it had 1,000 calories. The food industry is closely watching what the FDA will chose to include in their new menu labeling rules, which are due out this year. Grocery stores, convenient stores, movie theaters and airplanes are under review - and many aren't happy about it. Non-restaurant establishments have lobbied hard for exemption, which has lead to a delay in the release of the rules. Calorie count menus, which have been commonplace at establishments like McDonalds (pictured) since 2008, look set to be expanded into a whole new line of places that serve prepared food. The FDA believes people would order healthier if they were more aware of the calories in each menu item. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg told Congress earlier this month that writing the rules has been 'much more challenging than expected'. The agency issued proposed rules in 2011 but has faced pressure to revise them to exclude retail outlets like grocery and convenience stores. The FDA has sent the rules to the White House, meaning they could be released soon. The restaurant industry pushed for menu labeling and helped it become law as part of health overhaul in 2010. Chain restaurants that operate all over the country wanted the federal standards because of an evolving patchwork of state and local laws that require calorie labeling and could have forced those outlets to follow different rules in different locations. Not all restaurants are happy with menu labeling, though. Pizza restaurants, led by delivery giant Domino's, say it doesn't make sense to force their franchisees to order expensive new menu boards when few people walk into their brick-and-mortar outlets. They argue for putting the information online. The pizza companies say there are more than 34 million ways to order a pizza, and they need more flexibility on labeling than other restaurants. Against: Domino's are one of the main establishments fighting the would-be rules, claiming it is intellectual for them to overhaul their menu boards when rarely do people actually order food over-the-counter. Supporters of the rules say pizzas are no different from sandwiches or other foods that have a variety of toppings. The rules will only apply to restaurants with 20 or more outlets, so independent eateries are exempt. Bakeries, coffee shops and ice cream parlors are all expected to be included if they have enough stores to qualify. But alcohol won't have to be labeled in any of those places under the proposed rules. The FDA proposed exempting it. Perhaps the most unhappy with the rules that the FDA proposed in 2011 were the supermarket and convenience store industries were . The agency proposed requiring those stores to label calories for prepared foods on menu boards and displays. The restaurant industry has pushed for those outlets to be included, arguing that many of them are promoting their prepared food sales and directly competing with restaurants. Nutrition advocates have also called for those stores to be included, saying that a rotisserie chicken labeled with a calorie count at a restaurant should also be labeled at the grocery store takeout next door. Same with baked goods like muffins, pies or loaves of bread. Target: Movie theaters are among those most likely to display their calories under the FDA rules, with their snacks often being so unhealthy. The supermarket industry estimates it could cost them a billion dollars to put the rules in place — costs that would be passed on to consumers. Along with convenience stores, the supermarkets say the ever-changing selection at salad bars, deli counters and other prepared food stations would make it difficult and costly to nail down accurate calorie counts and constantly update signs. Both industries argue that the law is intended for restaurants and not for them. They say the labeling rules will be much easier to put in place at restaurants with fixed menus. 'The cost of compliance for a convenience store is different than a one-time cost to McDonald's,' says Lyle Beckwith of the National Association of Convenience Stores. Movie theater chains lobbied to be exempt and appeared to win that fight when they were exempted in the 2011 proposed rules. But nutrition groups are lobbying to include them in the final rules, especially because movie treats can be so unhealthy. Nutrition lobbyist Margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest says many people don't realize they are eating a day's worth of calories when they stop by the movie concessions counter and grab a large popcorn and extra-large soda. Vending machines will also display signs indicating the calories of each treat. 'If a company is going to serve you 2,000 calories and call it a snack, the least they can do is tell people how many calories are in it,' Wootan says. Passengers will most likely be able to purchase food calorie-blind in the air and on the rails. Along with movie theaters, airlines and trains were exempted from the proposed labeling rules in 2011. The FDA said that it would likely exempt food served in places where the 'primary business activity is not the sale of food' and that don't 'present themselves publicly as a restaurant'. That also includes amusement parks, sports stadiums and hotels, unless restaurants set up in those places are part of a larger chain. Vending machines will be required to have labels, but the industry — comprised mostly of smaller operators — is asking for flexibility in how they are required to post them. Eric Bell of the National Automatic Merchandising Association says the group estimates the rules could cost operators up to 42,000 a year, which he calls a \\"huge burden\\" on those small businesses. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is thinking about which places should show how many calories are in the food they serve. This will help people know if the food they are ordering is healthy or not. Some places like McDonald's are already doing this. But other places like grocery stores, movie theaters, and airplanes are not happy about it because they don't want to spend money to change their menus. Pizza restaurants like Domino's say it's better to put the information online, because they have many ways to order pizza and people usually don't walk inside their stores. The rules will only apply to places with 20 or more locations, so smaller independent restaurants don't have to worry about it. The FDA is still deciding which places should show calorie counts and some places like movie theaters and amusement parks might not have to do it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Each of these rooms has six doors , one on each face of the cube , which lead into adjacent , identically decorated rooms , only differing by colour . Some of these rooms are \`\` safe '' , while others are equipped with deadly booby traps such as flamethrowers and razorwire . In some cases it is possible to detect a trap by throwing an object into the room first , although this method is not always reliable due to the trigger mechanism of certain traps . In each case , a group of strangers awakens in this mysterious structure , without any knowledge of how or why they are there . In order to escape from the prison , they must band together and use their combined skills and talents to avoid the traps and navigate out of the maze , while also trying to solve the mystery of what the cube is and why they are in it . However , the pressure of being in the Cube generally turns one of the prisoners into a homicidal maniac who preys on the others . Cube Zero was slightly different from the first two films in that it also dealt with the people on the outside of the Cube whose job it was to control the cube and oversee those within . In March 2011 , Lionsgate announced it was considering an additional film in the series , tentatively titled Cube 3D . In April 2015 , The Hollywood Reporter announced that Lionsgate Films are planning to remake the original movie under the title Cubed , with Saman Kesh as director .  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

(CNN) -- If the first presidential debate in Denver was a game changer,Tuesday night's was not. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a spirited, heavyweight bout with several consequential moments. President Obama entered the second presidential debate needing to make up serious ground after his first debate performance. He turned around the narrative from the first debate -- that he was listless and lethargic and on the defensive -- but showing up is one thing, winning is another. Obama needed a convincing win Tuesday night, and he did not get it. Gov.

He turned around the narrative from the first debate -- that he was listless and lethargic and on the defensive -- by showing up with energy and determination. In fact, Obama actually said, \\"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.\\" This statement highlighted his dedication to maintaining the nation's strength and resilience in the face of adversity. However, showing up is one thing, winning is another. Obama needed a convincing win Tuesday night, and he did not get it. Gov. Romney came into Tuesday night's debate needing to prove that his first performance wasn't a fluke -- in other words, that he wasn't Jimmy Carter in the Reagan-Carter debates, when Carter won early on but went on to get dominated by a Reagan comeback. Tuesday night Romney delivered again and proved his performance was consistent and legitimate. He has established himself as a legitimate alternative to the president. Both candidates shared passionate exchanges on a number of issues, with Romney highlighting his plans for job creation and economic growth, while Obama emphasized his administration's accomplishments on healthcare, education, and foreign policy. The intense nature of the debate allowed both candidates to present their respective visions for the country's future, helping undecided voters make a more informed choice. In the end, the second debate did not provide the knockout blow that Obama supporters had hoped for, but it did give the president an opportunity to regain some of the momentum he had lost after the first debate. Similarly, Romney continued to prove his credibility as a strong challenger. The debate did not change the overall dynamics of the presidential race significantly, but it did serve to emphasize the stark differences between the two candidates and reinforced the importance of their leadership in guiding the nation in difficult times."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Identify the animal in question. 2. Identify the birth year of the animal. 3. Identify the death year of the animal (if applicable). 4. Calculate the difference between the birth year and death year. Step 1: Identify the animal in question. The animal who had a role in the 2010 FIFA World Cup was an octopus named Paul. Sonny Wool, a sheep, was the prediction-making animal for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Since the task mentions both events, I will assume that the user is interested in the 2010 FIFA World Cup animal, which is Paul the octopus. Step 2: Identify the birth year of the animal. Paul the octopus was born in January 2008. Step 3: Identify the death year of the animal (if applicable). Paul the octopus passed away in October 2010. Step 4: Calculate the difference between the birth year and death year. Since Paul was born in January 2008 and died in October 2010, he lived for approximately 2 years and 9 months.

Goal: microwave Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, there needs to be clarity regarding the specific goal that involves a microwave. Since the provided goal \\"microwave\\" is not sufficient to understand the intended outcome, I will cover two common scenarios in which a microwave is involved. These scenarios will be A) purchasing a microwave and B) heating food in a microwave. For each scenario, I will discuss reasonable methods in accomplishing the goal. Scenario A: Purchasing a Microwave 1. Research and compare microwave models online: Visiting websites such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart will help you do thorough research on various microwave models available in the market. You can compare features, specifications, pricing, and user reviews before making a decision. This method provides the convenience of researching multiple models and comparing them side by side, from the comfort of your home.  2. Visit a local electronics store: Visiting a nearby electronics or appliance store is another reasonable method for purchasing a microwave. By doing this, you can inspect the microwaves in-person, consult with sales personnel, and make a more informed decision based on their recommendations. This option also may provide the opportunity to negotiate price and take immediate possession of the appliance. Scenario B: Heating Food in a Microwave 1. Follow the food item's instructions: If you are heating a prepackaged food item such as a frozen meal, the most reasonable method is to follow the instructions provided on the package. These directions have been specifically designed for the item and should provide the optimal heating time and power settings for your microwave. 2. Utilize the sensor cooking feature (if available): Modern microwaves often come with sensor cooking features that automatically adjust the cooking time and power level based on the moisture content of the food. By placing the food in the microwave and selecting the appropriate sensor cooking mode, the microwave will automatically determine the best time and power settings for the food item. This method is a convenient option for those who are unsure about the required heating time and power settings.  3. Estimate heating time using general guidelines: If neither the food item's instructions nor microwave sensor cooking features are available, a reasonable method in this situation would be to estimate the heating time based on general guidelines. For example: - For frozen meals, a standard guideline would be to microwave it for 3 to 4 minutes per 100 grams of food, at half power. - For reheating leftovers or precooked meals, the typical recommendation is around 2 minutes at full power for a single portion. It is important to note that these guidelines should be considered as a starting point and that monitoring the food item while heating is essential to avoid overcooking or uneven heating. Reheating in intervals (pausing to stir or reposition the food) may also be helpful to achieve desired results. Given the multiple scenarios and methods provided, it's not possible to determine which method is more reasonable without more information about the specific goal involving a microwave. However, the scenarios demonstrate various methods, tailored to different goals, that are reasonable and practical in achieving the intended outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His saw was too big to fit with all his wrenches and screwdrivers in his metal what? - toolbox - cabinet - basement - tool shed - tool kit  The best answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"To decide the best answer, let's examine each option and justify the appropriateness of each one: 1. Toolbox: A toolbox is usually a portable storage container for tools, including saws, wrenches, and screwdrivers. However, the question states that the saw is too big to fit with all the other tools, making this option less suitable. 2. Cabinet: A cabinet is a storage unit with shelves and drawers, typically larger than a toolbox. Since the saw is too big to fit with other tools, a cabinet may be a suitable option as it can provide additional and separate storage space. 3. Basement: A basement is a large space beneath a building, providing ample room for storage. However, it does not specifically cater to organizing tools and may not be the most appropriate solution. 4. Toolshed: A toolshed is a small building used for storing tools and equipment. This option is suitable given the size of the saw and the need to store it with other tools. 5. Tool kit: A tool kit usually contains a specific set of tools designed to perform particular tasks. Since the saw is too big to fit with the other tools, it's unlikely to fit in a general tool kit. Justification: Considering all the options, the most suitable answer is \\"tool shed\\" as it provides enough space for storage and is specifically designed for organizing tools. The answer to this question is: tool shed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: Jake asks Joey if he fought with Salvy because of who? Movie plot title: Raging Bull Movie plot: The film opens in 1964, where an older and fatter Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) practices his stand-up comic routine before his debut at a comedy nightclub. A flashback shifts to his boxing career in 1941 against his opponent, Jimmy Reeves, in the infamous Cleveland bout. Losing the fight by a fixed result causes a fight to break out at the end of the match. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey has a word with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. When Tommy Como hears... The answer to this question is:","output":"Jake asks Joey if he fought with Salvy because of Vickie. In the movie Raging Bull, Jake becomes increasingly jealous of the attention his wife, Vickie, receives from other men. He suspects that she may have feelings for someone else, especially Tony Janiro, whom Jake eventually beats in a fight to display his dominance. As the movie progresses, Joey gets into a fight with Salvy, in part due to a tense dynamic between the characters and rising suspicions about Salvy's connection to Vickie. This leads Jake to confront Joey about his motives for the fight and question if it was because of Vickie that Joey fought with Salvy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to wear appropriate colors for a job interview  Understand that colors can signify different personality traits.  Different colors and shades make our environment, and they also send different signals to our brain and invoke varied responses. Because of this, it is important to think about the colors you are wearing and what they say about you. OPT: [-] Finding an outfit to wear with color for job interviews can go a long way towards achieving your desired look and tone. Dress in bright colors, but wear something comfortable.; [-] Otherwise, you may not be as aware of what the environment will hold, for example. The color blues, blues, and greens are often used for formal events.; [-] A recently published survey by careerbuilder revealed that black and blue are regarded as the best colors to wear on a job interview while orange is the worst. In a professional setting, the safest bet is to go for a conservative color.; [-] Draw out any emotions in your already-happy demeanor. These \\" emotions \\" can only be classified as \\" shyness \\" or \\" boredom.;","output":"[-] A recently published survey by CareerBuilder revealed that black and blue are regarded as the best colors to wear on a job interview while orange is considered the worst. In a professional setting, it is always safe to lean towards a conservative color palette. Interestingly, black signifies leadership qualities while blue suggests that the wearer is dependable and trustworthy. On the contrary, curious as it may seem, orange is least preferred since it often hints at the wearer being either unprofessional or overly audacious, neither of which are generally desirable traits in a professional setting. Navigating the color spectrum, one can consider other colors like green and brown which suggest calmness, stability, and reliability but they may not represent dynamism. For a pop of color, a burgundy tie or lavender blouse can demonstrate confidence and creativity without crossing the line of professionalism. White is another safe option that communicates simplicity, cleanliness, and precision. If you're going for a lighter palette, pastel shades, especially of blue and pink, can help project a calm and cooperative nature. However, it's important to balance these color implications with factors like the interview's context, your role, the company culture, and even the industry you're in. For instance, if you're interviewing for a creative role, brighter colors might be welcome and could illustrate your vibrant creativity. In contrast, financial and legal industries lean towards classic, deep colors to represent tradition and stability. In conclusion, when choosing an outfit for a job interview, steer clear of excessively bright colors or bold patterns that might distract or even put off the interviewer. Instead, promote a professional image by opting for more subdued, conservative colors. While black and blue are safe bets, do not hesitate to incorporate subtle variations based on the industry, role, and company culture. After all, the goal is to feel confident and present a smart, well-put-together professional image, and appropriately chosen colors can play a crucial role in achieving that."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I will discuss each step in this four part series. ————————————————— EAT WHAT YOU WANT DOES YOUR FOOD SING TO YOU? Have a look in your fridge and cupboards. Does the food in there sing to you, does it call your name, and are you looking forward to eating it? Do you eat it because you enjoy it or because you think you should? By choosing only to eat what sings to me, I have discovered (again!) that I am not a big fan of meat and would rather eat a predominantly vegetarian diet. Occasionally I’ll eat chicken leg and I love bacon but beyond that I’m not fussed. FOOD DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE There are no good and bad foods. There are no trigger foods or forbidden foods. There is nosuch thing as junk. There is a place in your diet for your favourite indulgences in moderation. Believe me that when you let yourself eat cheesecake, chocolate and hot chips, the novelty soon wears off. I mostly eat unprocessed food, not because it’s “good” but because I love the taste and prefer how it makes me feel.

They can be used to guide new workers through simple tasks during job training, or to assist a worker who is performing a task temporarily due to a coworker's absence. When making a flowchart, you'll write a box for each task within the process, and connect them with arrows to show which order you perform these tasks. Start at the left-hand side or the top of the page, just as you would when writing. Sequencing the steps in this order makes it easy to tell at a glance which to follow.  If you are working in a language with a different direction of writing than English, use that direction instead. For instance, a flowchart written in Arabic moves from right to left. Use arrows to make the direction clear. Don't just draw lines without arrows between the tasks. If your flowchart is small enough to fit in one row or column, you may not need this circle. For more complicated flowcharts, having an obvious circle labeled \\"start\\" is useful. Draw an arrow pointing from the \\"start\\" circle to a box with the first task inside it. For instance, \\"take customer's order.\\" This arrow points to the next box, with the second task written inside it. If there is a decision to make or a question to answer before the second task can be performed, write the question inside a diamond instead. Use a different color for the diamond than the boxes, if possible. For example, say the box with the task \\"Take customer's order\\" leads to a diamond, with the question \\"was water ordered?\\" Draw two arrows leaving the diamond. On one arrow, write \\"yes\\" or \\"y\\" and lead to a box labeled \\"give customer water.\\" On the second arrow, write \\"no\\" or \\"n\\" and lead to a box labeled \\"give order to cook.\\" Summary:","output":"This article describes the process of creating flowcharts to visually represent tasks and decision-making, using boxes, arrows, and diamonds to indicate steps, directions, and choices in various contexts and languages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting.  and the situation: James is driving down the street in his town. For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside.  Answer the following question: Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb? The answer to this question is:","output":"the vapor light is more energy efficient than the regular light bulb.  There are a few reasons why vapor lights are more energy efficient compared to regular light bulbs. Firstly, vapor lights, like sodium vapor and mercury vapor lights, have a higher efficiency by converting a greater portion of electrical energy into visible light. This is primarily due to the process of electroluminescence, which occurs when an electric current passes through the gases within the bulb. This causes the solid sodium or mercury to vaporize and emit visible light. The higher efficiency directly translates to lower energy consumption for the same amount of light output produced. In terms of luminous efficacy, which is a measure of how well a light source converts electricity into visible light, vapor lights are superior to regular light bulbs. For instance, sodium vapor lights typically have a luminous efficacy of around 100-150 lumens per watt, whereas mercury vapor lights can have values between 35-65 lumens per watt. In comparison, traditional incandescent light bulbs have a much lower luminous efficacy of 10-17 lumens per watt. This means that vapor lights produce much more visible light for the same amount of electricity consumed, making them more energy efficient.  Additionally, vapor lights are known for their longer lifespans in comparison to regular light bulbs. Sodium vapor and mercury vapor lights can last between 12,000 to 24,000 hours, whereas traditional incandescent light bulbs have an average lifespan of 1,000 to 2,000 hours. This longer lifespan reduces the need for frequent replacements, which not only saves energy but also reduces maintenance costs and contributes to less waste generation. Another factor to consider is that vapor lights are generally used in outdoor applications, such as streetlights, where they need to provide sufficient illumination over large areas. In these situations, energy efficiency is crucial to cater the needs of a large-scale lighting infrastructure with minimal energy consumption and maintenance efforts. In conclusion, based on the process of electroluminescence, higher luminous efficacy, and longer lifespan, vapor lights are more energy-efficient compared to regular light bulbs, making them suitable as a more sustainable and cost-effective lighting solution, particularly in outdoor applications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It signifies the dissatisfaction and annoyance experienced by the person who posted the tweet, potentially due to a personal experience they may have had related to the subject matter. This sentiment likely stems from multiple factors, including expectations being set by the airlines and then not being met, as well as the inconvenience caused by unexpected delays or altered travel plans. The statement conveys a sense of disappointment and mistrust, as the person feels misled or deceived by these inaccurate claims. It also highlights an underlying belief or expectation that airlines should be transparent and truthful about their flight schedules and any potential changes thereof. In addition to expressing annoyance, the tweet implies the potentially negative impact that such practices can have on the reputation of airlines. It suggests that this dishonest or unreliable behavior might lead to a loss of credibility, consumer trust, and customer loyalty. This criticism could be particularly revealing, given that people often rely on airlines to provide seamless transportation and expect them to be reliable and efficient. The choice of the word \\"lie\\" in the tweet also suggests a strong emotional response. It implies deliberate deception, which contributes to the feeling of betrayal and mistrust that the person tweets about.

Here's the negative movie review for \\"Transformers: Age of Extinction\\" (2014): \\"Transformers: Age of Extinction,\\" directed by Michael Bay, is a disappointing addition to the popular Transformers movie franchise. The film utilizes an excessive runtime of 165 minutes to deliver a convoluted and overblown plot that ultimately falls short of audience expectations. The story, centering around the battle between Autobots and Decepticons, appears to have undergone a transformation of its own - into a confusing, disjointed mess.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians.

Translate to English","output":"I advocate for a Europe-wide mandatory installation of automatic fire extinguishing systems in the engine compartment, which already exist in motorsports. Your concerns about vehicle safety are valid, especially when it comes to preventing fires in the engine compartment. The benefits of mandating automatic fire extinguishing systems in the engine compartment of all vehicles across Europe would go beyond motorsports and could potentially save lives and reduce damages caused by vehicle fires. Firstly, implementing such systems can significantly enhance passenger and driver safety. Engine fires can be life-threatening and can lead to severe accidents; therefore, having an automatic fire-extinguishing system in place can help limit these risks by swiftly detecting and suppressing a fire. This early intervention can prevent fires from spreading to other areas of the vehicle or causing further damage to the vehicle's surrounding environment. Moreover, these fire-suppression systems benefit the environment by reducing air pollution caused by vehicle fires. By promptly extinguishing a fire, the system would minimize the release of hazardous chemicals and smoke into the atmosphere. This is particularly important as the automotive industry moves towards a greener future. In addition, implementing such systems in all vehicles across Europe would indirectly contribute to economic benefits. With quicker fire detection and suppression, fewer vehicles will end up being destroyed as a result of engine fires, reducing claims under insurance policies and resulting in lower premiums for consumers. This would also mean less expense for emergency services, as they would have to respond to fewer vehicle fire incidents. Furthermore, the mandatory installation of automatic suppression systems would create new opportunities for manufacturers to develop cutting-edge fire safety technology for the automotive industry. This would not only open up a lucrative market for new technologies but would also lead to the development of advanced systems, enhancing the fire safety in vehicles even further. Lastly, implementing such systems in vehicles would raise public awareness about fire safety and the importance of having effective fire-protection measures. This could lead to more responsible behavior on the part of drivers, ultimately reducing the number of vehicle fires. In conclusion, making the installation of automatic fire-extinguishing systems mandatory across Europe would benefit vehicle safety, the environment, and the economy. It would lead to increased innovation in the automotive industry and promote a greater sense of responsibility among drivers. The investment in such systems is likely to pay off in the long run, resulting in a safer and more sustainable future for European motorists."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two questions are both asking when the best time to visit Luxembourg is if you want to look for a job in banking. So, they're basically the same question.  Now, the answer choices (i) no and (ii) yes don't really make sense in this context, because they're not giving us any options for the best time to visit. But to answer whether these two questions would have the same answer, I'll say (ii) yes. They both ask about the best time to visit Luxembourg for banking job search, so their answers would be the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please write the text above using proper case.","output":"Because of the threats and despotic policies employed by the Darwinist dictatorship, people have been unable to openly express their opposition to Darwinism, and have even had to role play, up until today. The concept of a Darwinist dictatorship refers to a hypothetical authoritarian regime where the principles of Darwinism, especially the ideas of natural selection and evolution, are forced upon the population without allowing room for dissent or alternative viewpoints. This hypothetical scenario is often used as a criticism against the scientific validity and moral implications associated with the theory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin. It is important to note that the term \\"Darwinist dictatorship\\" is primarily used by critics of Darwinism and does not represent a real-world political system. It is often used as a rhetorical device to showcase the perceived authoritarian nature of Darwinism being taught as the primary explanation for the origin and diversity of life on Earth. Critics argue that by not allowing room for alternative theories, such as those related to intelligent design or creationism, a metaphorical dictatorship is created in the educational and scientific communities. The notion of a Darwinist dictatorship silencing opposition and coercing individuals into role-playing as supporters of Darwinism is not grounded in factual evidence. In reality, scientific discourse and academic debate are encouraged in most democratic societies. The theory of evolution is widely accepted by the scientific community because of its strong empirical backing and its ability to accurately explain and predict various biological phenomena.  However, the idea of a Darwinist dictatorship highlights the need for open discussion and critical evaluation of scientific theories, including evolution, in order to ensure that scientific advancements are not hindered by ideological dogma or political agendas. It is essential for society to foster a respectful and inclusive environment for scientific inquiry and debate, with the understanding that scientific knowledge is provisional and subject to revision as new evidence emerges. Ultimately, this allows for intellectual growth and the advancement of human understanding of the natural world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Если суды не смогут действовать, CALDH передаст дело Межамериканскому Суду по Правам Человека в Сан-Хозе на Коста-Рике или, возможно, в Европу. Translate to English","output":"If the courts are unable to act, CALDH will transfer the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in San José, Costa Rica, or possibly to Europe. The translation provided above illustrates the scenario where the CALDH (Center for Legal Action on Human Rights) might need to transfer a case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights if local or national courts are incapable of providing a fair and just resolution. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, situated in San José, Costa Rica, is an autonomous judicial institution responsible for upholding and promoting human rights in the American continent. Established in 1979, the Court not only settles cases (contentious jurisdiction) but also issues advisory opinions (advisory jurisdiction) to member states of the Organization of American States (OAS). The mention of transferring the case to Europe suggests that if the Inter-American Court of Human Rights proves to be ineffective in resolving the matter, more options might be available to seek justice in Europe, perhaps in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR is a supranational court established in 1959, which enforces the European Convention on Human Rights, a treaty signed by the 47 member states of the Council of Europe. Its primary function is to hear claims of human rights violations by individuals or entities against the member states. Although the primary jurisdictions of both Courts (Inter-American Court of Human Rights and European Court of Human Rights) are geographically and organizationally distinct, it is worth noting that in some circumstances, international collaboration and cooperation might be required to address certain human rights issues effectively. Furthermore, some countries have established tribunals or courts tailored to address specific human rights violations, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), making it possible for cases to be transferred to Europe in certain circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Burrel's innovative design, which combined the low production cost of an Apple II with the computing power of Lisa's CPU, the Motorola 68K, received the attention of Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple. Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, he began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. Team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs' ideas than Raskin's. After hearing of the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC, Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and its Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at Xerox PARC and were combined with the Macintosh group's own ideas. Jobs also commissioned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger to work on the Macintosh line, resulting in the \\"Snow White\\" design language; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers. However, Jobs' leadership at the Macintosh project did not last; after an internal power struggle with new CEO John Sculley, Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985.

Herbert Hepburn Calvert was born in London on December 30 , 1870 , and was the first son of the journalist Thomas Calvert and his wife Grace ( near Hepburn ) . Herbert Hepburn Calvert was born on 30 December 1870 in London . He was the first son of journalist Thomas Calvert and his wife Grace ( née Hepburn ) . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Step 1: Read both sentences carefully and understand the information provided in each sentence. Sentence 1: Herbert Hepburn Calvert was born in London on December 30, 1870, and was the first son of the journalist Thomas Calvert and his wife Grace (near Hepburn). Sentence 2: Herbert Hepburn Calvert was born on 30 December 1870 in London. He was the first son of journalist Thomas Calvert and his wife Grace (née Hepburn). Step 2: Identify the information given in both sentences. Sentence 1: - Herbert Hepburn Calvert's birth in London - Birthdate: December 30, 1870 - First son of journalist Thomas Calvert and his wife Grace - Grace's maiden name: near Hepburn Sentence 2: - Herbert Hepburn Calvert's birth in London - Birthdate: 30 December 1870 - First son of journalist Thomas Calvert and his wife Grace - Grace's maiden name: née Hepburn Step 3: Compare the information provided in both sentences to evaluate if they mean the same thing. The information shared in both sentences is similar with one minor difference. In Sentence 1, Grace's maiden name is given as \\"near Hepburn,\\" while in Sentence 2, it is rightly given as \\"née Hepburn.\\" Since 'née' means 'originally born as' or 'formerly known as', the phrase 'née Hepburn' in Sentence 2 indicates that Grace's maiden name was Hepburn before her marriage. The word \\"near\\" in Sentence 1 seems to be a typographical error. Step 4: Summarize the evaluation. Aside from the minor difference in how Grace's maiden name is presented, both sentences convey the same overall meaning. They both provide information about Herbert Hepburn Calvert's birth, his parents, and his mother's maiden name. Apart from the typographical error in Sentence 1, the sentences mean the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jill had hypertension, while her sister Beth had normal blood pressure.  But I can use this background: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate.  What is an answer for this question: Which sister has to make diet changes?

Given the question: Robin asked Jesse if would like to leave on a camping day.  Given the context: How would Robin feel afterwards?  Possible answers: scared, free, angry The answer is:","output":"To determine how Robin would feel after asking Jesse if they would like to leave on a camping day, let's analyze the context and each possible emotion step by step. 1. Analyzing the context: Robin is inviting Jesse on a camping trip, which indicates that they are likely friends or at least acquaintances. This suggests that Robin is trying to engage in a fun, social activity, and therefore would likely experience positive emotions associated with making plans and spending time together. 2. Analyzing the emotions:     a) Scared: This emotion may occur if there were any threats or dangers associated with the camping trip, or if Robin were afraid of rejection or negative responses from Jesse. However, based on the context provided, there is no indication of any threats or fears involved.     b) Free: This emotion may occur if Robin feels a sense of liberation or release after proposing the camping trip. As the activity involves spending time outdoors and away from daily life responsibilities, there is a possibility that Robin would feel free as a result of their invitation.     c) Angry: This emotion may occur if there was a conflict or a negative encounter between Robin and Jesse. However, based on the context provided, there is no indication of any reason for anger. Considering each emotion and the context given, it is most likely that Robin would feel \\"free\\" after asking Jesse if they would like to leave on a camping day, as this corresponds with the positive emotions associated with engaging in an enjoyable activity with another person and the escapism from daily life that camping often provides."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kate finds out she is pregnant, which complicates the whole situation because she is not sure if she truly does want to breakup with Ollie or not. However, Kate does not want to have a baby, but does not want to wait weeks for a clinical abortion, so her herbalist friend, Chloe tells her that being on a parsley diet can make you have a natural abortion. Kate then goes on to constantly eat parsley and at one point in the film, even bathe in parsley. Ollie is \\"the king of contraception\\", where he counsels people on contraception for his job. Kate's friends see Kate and Ollie's relationship as the greatest relationship there could ever be and they envy her for it, even her lesbian friend thinks she would be crazy to leave him. Kate decides it is for the best not to tell Ollie about the pregnancy, despite her friends telling her she should. The film suggests that Kate may have had an affair with her \\"slow student\\" and may be the real reason why she wants an abortion.

They are joined by Reneeâs irresponsible boyfriend, Michael (Michael Copon), and his friend, Ian (Travis Van Winkle), and sail off at Ian's uncle, Wade's (Tyler Mane) lakeside cabin.

The two men then begin poolside horseplay, one of them throwing the other one into the pool. the man who was thrown into the pool","output":"Let's think step-by-step about what likely happens next: 1. The man who was thrown into the pool would resurface after hitting the water. The impact of being pushed into the pool would cause him to go briefly underwater before coming back up. Justification: When a person is thrown into a pool, especially during horseplay, it is natural for them to go underwater initially due to the force of the push and gravity pulling them down. 2. The man who was thrown into the pool would probably splash water around and react to the situation. He might either laugh or express surprise, depending on his personality and the context of their horseplay. Justification: People's reactions to being thrown into a pool can range from amusement to annoyance, but considering the two men were engaging in horseplay, a lighthearted reaction is more likely. 3. The wet man in the pool might decide to take revenge on his friend by attempting to pull him into the pool as well. This could be either through reaching out to grab his friend's arm or gesturing for him to join him in the pool. Justification: Good-natured horseplay often involves reciprocation, like taking turns in splashing water or trying to push one another into the pool. 4. As the horseplay continues, other people around the pool might join in or simply watch the action unfold. Some may laugh or cheer while others might prefer to keep their distance in order to avoid getting splashed. Justification: When a lively event like poolside horseplay occurs, it can either attract more people and deepen the excitement or deter others who are not interested in participating. So, the next events in the paragraph might read: \\"The man who was thrown into the pool resurfaced, laughter bubbling forth as he wiped water from his face. Seeing the grinning face of his friend who pushed him in, he reached out his hand to attempt to pull him into the pool as well. The playful commotion began to draw the attention of others around the pool, some cheering them on as others retreated to avoid the splashing water.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"yeah yes exactly um-hum i also hm thought about it because i was uh waiting to talk to you that another thing that occurred to me is there's not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isn't but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someone's gonna invade my privacy very quickly and\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"I always know how to behave.\\" true?","output":"To carefully analyze the premise and evaluate the hypothesis \\"I always know how to behave,\\" let's break down the text and its key components. The speaker acknowledges that they know \\"how to behave such that there isn't\\" an invasion of their privacy. It suggests that the individual is aware of the social norms, standards, and expectations that are necessary to maintain their privacy. The speaker also alludes to the fact that if they were to \\"deviate from social norms of behavior,\\" such as running up and down the street yelling, their privacy will be invaded. This highlights the speaker's perceived consequences of deviating from expected behavior. Now, regarding the hypothesis \\"I always know how to behave,\\" several factors need to be taken into consideration. 1. Awareness of Social Norms: The speaker seems to be aware of the social norms and the importance of adhering to these standards to maintain their privacy. This awareness could suggest that the individual generally understands how to behave appropriately within a societal context. 2. Variable Circumstances: The speaker states that they have thought about their behavior and the possible ramifications. However, it is essential to acknowledge that different situations may call for different behavioral responses. While the speaker seems confident in their ability to behave in a way that protects their privacy, it cannot be assumed that they will know how to behave in every situation they may face. 3. The Ability to Adapt: The hypothesis also doesn't account for the individual's ability to adapt to new or changing situations. As society evolves, so do its norms and expectations. A person's ability to alter their behavior in response to these changes is a critical aspect of knowing how to behave. 4. Personal Growth and Development: Another factor that may impact the truthfulness of the hypothesis is the speaker's ability to learn and grow over time. As an individual matures and engages in a variety of experiences, their understanding of social norms and appropriate behavior also evolves. Considering these factors and the premise's context, the hypothesis \\"I always know how to behave\\" could be viewed as partially true. Although the speaker demonstrates an awareness of social norms and the consequences of deviating from them, it is important to recognize that situations vary and knowing how to behave in one instance does not guarantee appropriate behavior in every situation. Furthermore, understanding social norms is a continuous learning process, and the individual's ability to adapt, learn, and grow contributes significantly to their overall mastery of behavioral expectations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of making pet treats, we'll take these simple steps that are easy to understand: 1. Choose the type of pet treats: First, decide if you want to make treats for a dog, cat, or another pet. Different pets have different tastes and dietary needs, so it's important to pick treats that will be tasty and healthy for your pet. 2. Find a recipe: Look for a pet treat recipe that is easy to follow and uses ingredients that are safe for your pet. You can find recipes online, in pet treat cookbooks, or even ask your veterinarian for recommendations. 3. Gather the ingredients: Once you have a recipe, make a list of all the ingredients you'll need. You might already have some of the ingredients at home, but you might need to visit a store to buy the rest. 4. Get your tools ready: Before starting, make sure you have all the tools you need, like bowls, spoons, cookie cutters, and a baking sheet. 5. Follow the recipe: Carefully read the recipe and follow the steps to prepare the pet treat dough. Make sure to mix the ingredients well and ask an adult for help if needed. 6. Shape the treats: Once the dough is ready, use cookie cutters or your hands to shape the treats into fun shapes that your pet will enjoy. 7. Bake or dry the treats: Some pet treats need to be baked in the oven, while others may need to be air-dried. Follow the instructions in the recipe to finish making the treats. 8. Let them cool: After the treats are done, let them cool down for a bit. This is important because hot treats can hurt your pet's mouth. 9. Store the treats: Once the treats are cool, put them in an airtight container to keep them fresh. You can store the container in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cupboard. 10. Enjoy: Finally, give your pet the tasty and healthy homemade treats you made, and watch them enjoy their special snack!

Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum’s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of “green spaces” such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine. In particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation. For Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli’s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance. For Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication. Though floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated—the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented—this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly “scattered” floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, “The tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific. Alex and I will continue to explore the potential meaning within this botanical and arboreal chaos.” Sacred...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Richard I (8 September 1157 - 6 April 1199) was King of England from 1189 until his death. He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine and Gascony, Lord of Cyprus, Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine, and Nantes, and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was known as Richard Coeur de Lion or Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior. Richard had already taken the cross as Count of Poitou in 1187. His father and Philip II had done so at Gisors on 21 January 1188 after receiving news of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin. After Richard became king, he and Philip agreed to go on the Third Crusade, since each feared that during his absence the other might usurp his territories.  Richard swore an oath to renounce his past wickedness in order to show himself worthy to take the cross. He started to raise and equip a new crusader army. He spent most of his father's treasury (filled with money raised by the Saladin tithe), raised taxes, and even agreed to free King William I of Scotland from his oath of subservience to Richard in exchange for 10,000 marks. To raise still more revenue he sold the right to hold official positions, lands, and other privileges to those interested in them. Those already appointed were forced to pay huge sums to retain their posts. William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely and the King's Chancellor, made a show of bidding PS3,000 to remain as Chancellor. He was apparently outbid by a certain Reginald the Italian, but that bid was refused.  Richard made some final arrangements on the continent. He reconfirmed his father's appointment of William Fitz Ralph to the important post of seneschal of Normandy. In Anjou, Stephen of Tours was replaced as seneschal and temporarily imprisoned for fiscal mismanagement. Payn de Rochefort, an Angevin knight, was elevated to the post of seneschal of Anjou. In Poitou the ex-provost of Benon, Peter Bertin, was made seneschal, and finally in Gascony the household official Helie de La Celle was picked for the seneschalship there. After repositioning the part of his army he left behind to guard his French possessions, Richard finally set out on the crusade in summer 1190. (His delay was criticised by troubadours such as Bertran de Born.) He appointed as regents Hugh de Puiset, Bishop of Durham, and William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex--who soon died and was replaced by Richard's chancellor William Longchamp. Richard's brother John was not satisfied by this decision and started scheming against William. When Richard was raising funds for his crusade, he was said to declare, \\"I would have sold London if I could find a buyer\\".  In September 1190 Richard and Philip arrived in Sicily. After the death of King William II of Sicily his cousin Tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in 1190 as King Tancred I of Sicily, although the legal heir was William's aunt Constance, wife of the new Emperor Henry VI. Tancred had imprisoned William's widow, Queen Joan, who was Richard's sister, and did not give her the money she had inherited in William's will. When Richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance; she was freed on 28 September, but without the inheritance. The presence of foreign troops also caused unrest: in October, the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave. Richard attacked Messina, capturing it on 4 October 1190. After looting and burning the city Richard established his base there, but this created tension between Richard and Philip Augustus. He remained there until Tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on 4 March 1191. The treaty was signed by Richard, Philip and Tancred. Its main terms were:  Joan was to receive 20,000 ounces (570 kg) of gold as compensation for her inheritance, which Tancred kept.  Richard officially proclaimed his nephew, Arthur of Brittany, son of Geoffrey, as his heir, and Tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to Arthur when he came of age, giving a further 20,000 ounces (570 kg) of gold that would be returned by Richard if Arthur did not marry Tancred's daughter.  The two kings stayed on in Sicily for a while, but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men, with Philip Augustus plotting with Tancred against Richard. The two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement, including the end of Richard's betrothal to Philip's sister Alys (who had supposedly been the mistress of Richard's father Henry II).  In April 1191 Richard left Messina for Acre, but a storm dispersed his large fleet. After some searching, it was discovered that the ship carrying his sister Joan and his new fiancee Berengaria was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, along with the wrecks of several other vessels, including the treasure ship. Survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island's ruler, Isaac Komnenos.  On 1 May 1191 Richard's fleet arrived in the port of Lemesos (Limassol) on Cyprus. He ordered Isaac to release the prisoners and treasure. Isaac refused, so Richard landed his troops and took Limassol. Various princes of the Holy Land arrived in Limassol at the same time, in particular Guy of Lusignan. All declared their support for Richard provided that he support Guy against his rival, Conrad of Montferrat.  The local magnates abandoned Isaac, who considered making peace with Richard, joining him on the crusade, and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by Richard. Isaac changed his mind, however, and tried to escape. Richard's troops, led by Guy de Lusignan, conquered the whole island by 1 June. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. Richard named Richard de Camville and Robert of Thornham as governors. He later sold the island to the master of Knights Templar, Robert de Sable, and it was subsequently acquired, in 1192, by Guy of Lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom.  The rapid conquest of the island by Richard is more important than it may seem. The island occupies a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea. Cyprus remained a Christian stronghold until the battle of Lepanto (1571). Richard's exploit was well publicised and contributed to his reputation, and he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island. Richard left Cyprus for Acre on 5 June with his allies.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who was involved?","output":"Richard I, also known as Richard Coeur de Lion or Richard the Lionheart, was involved as the King of England and a great military leader.

No; The statement \\"In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae , spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax.\\" does not address the question about which type of spider has the most eyes. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question would be: Most spiders possess eight eyes that are vital for their survival as they rely on them for sensory information, especially in terms of locating prey and detecting threats. However, some species might have fewer eyes, like the cave spiders (Meta menardi), which only have six eyes arranged in a U-shape pattern. The number of eyes does not necessarily indicate how well a spider can visually perceive its surroundings. For example, the jumping spider (Salticidae) family, which has eight eyes, has some of the best vision among spiders. Their anterior median eyes are particularly large and highly advanced, facilitating their ability to recognize suitable prey, potential mates, and other stimuli. In general, the number of eyes in spiders does not differ vastly between different species, but their arrangement, eye structure, and visual capabilities vary greatly. Consequently, it is not possible to pinpoint a specific spider type that has the \\"most eyes\\" as it is not a defining characteristic among spider varieties.

Answer the following question: Marcus is working with a sealed container of oxygen. He is trying see how temperature effects its deviations from ideality.  He slowly increases the temperature of the oxygen and continues to measures its deviations.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will increasing the pressure cause the expected volume be more or less? Answer:","output":"Given the scenario, Marcus is working with a sealed container of oxygen and is focusing on the effects of temperature on deviations from ideality. However, you asked about the effect of increasing pressure on the expected volume. In general, when dealing with gases, the Ideal Gas Law can be used as an approximation to describe their behavior. The Ideal Gas Law is represented by the equation PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.  When pressure increases while keeping the number of moles of gas and the temperature constant (as it is in a sealed container), the expected volume will decrease according to the Ideal Gas Law. This is because, when pressure increases, the molecules of the gas are compressed into a smaller space, which reduces the volume occupied by the gas.  However, real gases deviate from the behavior of an ideal gas as pressure and/or temperature change. This deviation can be quantified using the compressibility factor (Z), which is the ratio of the real molar volume to the ideal molar volume (Z = V_real / V_ideal).  For real gases like oxygen, increasing the pressure may result in deviations from ideality, which could lead to an expected volume that is more or less than predicted by the Ideal Gas Law. The extent of deviation will depend on the specific gas and the conditions under which it is being measured. In the case of oxygen, for low to moderate pressure and high temperature, deviations from ideality are generally small. However, at high pressures and low temperatures, deviations may become more significant. In summary, increasing the pressure will generally cause the expected volume to be less according to the Ideal Gas Law. However, due to deviations from ideality, it is crucial to consider factors such as the specific gas being studied and the conditions under which the experiment is performed, as these factors may affect the real behavior of the gas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Zhao Ju, vice-president of CMB, said the cooperation with Didi was an important step in its mobile Internet finance strategy. \\"CMB's mobile payment is going to enter a new chapter by leveraging Didi Kuaidi's vast user base,\\" he said.  According to a report by China Internet Network Information Center earlier this month, Didi holds 87.2 percent of China's private car hailing market. The company said it has received 1.43 billion car-hailing requests on its platforms in 2015, which means 1.43 billion payments were made via smartphones.  CMB is expected to use Didi to reach the core users of China's mobile payment market. Jean Liu, president of Didi, said many of the expats prefer payment by credit card rather than Alipay or WeChat. \\"The new partnership will help improve service quality and customer loyalty,\\" she said. The investment makes CMB part of Didi's existing investors, including Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and China Investment Corporation. Both of the companies declined to reveal the actual amount of the investment.  Liu, who showed up on Tuesday for the first time in public after her treatment for breast cancer, said the cooperation with CMB is for the long run and \\"the capital investment is only part of it\\".  Under the partnership, CMB and Didi will cooperate on a wide range of initiatives on financial services and online-to-offline cooperation. Apart from the in-app credit card payments, the two companies are going to launch joint credit cards in late February and automobile financing services for Didi's car owners. CMB's branches across China are expected to help Didi recruit more drivers.  \\"There is a lot of room for imagination in our partnership,\\" Li said, adding in future people may use their CMB credit card reward points to pay for the ride on Didi.  Li Chao, an analyst with iResearch Consulting Group, said the partnership may not significantly boost CMB's mobile payment business. \\"Didi has educated the market for three years and its customers have formed the habit of paying by WeChat or Alipay. So I think CMB can only turn a very smart proportion of Didi users into its payment customer,\\" he said. \\"But the move shows that China's traditional banking industry is finally thinking out of the box and looking for outside partners in Internet finance competition,\\" he said.  Statistics from Big-Data Research showed that more than 90 percent of China's 9.3 trillion yuan (1.41 trillion) worth of third party mobile payment market is donated by Alibaba and Tencent.

As they approach the airport the plane short circuits due to an electrical storm but regains power. They find their Swedish business partner, Skyler (Joel Kinnaman), has betrayed them and already made a deal with the Russians, using a knockoff application. They go to a nightclub and meet Natalie (Olivia Thirlby), an American, and her Australian friend Anne (Rachel Taylor). The lights go out in the club and everyone heads outside. There, they witness what appears to be an aurora. Balls of light fall from the sky and then fade away. When a policeman investigates he is disintegrated. The invisible entities begin hunting and disintegrating people, sending them into a panic. Ben, Sean, Natalie, Anne, and now Skyler hide in the club's storeroom for seven days.

Review: I like Lora Leigh's books for the steamy, hot sexual scenes and believable suspense. However, this book made me uncomfortable several times because the sex between Elizabeth and Dash always felt one step away from being rape rather than being consensual. Dash was completely domineering and it felt to me like he often forced his \\"mate\\" into uncomfortable sexual experiences. He threatens to sodomize her for not following his orders, he spanks her when he is mad at her and he gets off on dominating her. He finally does sodomize her until she passes out...sorry, none of that is my idea of a loving relationship. This goes down as my least favorite (so far) Lora Leigh novel.","output":"To determine whether the customer was satisfied or dissatisfied, let's analyze the key points of the review: 1.

Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. - The premise states that Mohammed Ali had a vision for his new domain, meaning he had a plan or strategy in mind. - The hypothesis suggests that Mohammed Ali relied on instinct or intuition instead of following a clear plan. Step 3: Evaluate if the premise entails the hypothesis. - The premise and hypothesis seem to contradict each other. Having a vision usually implies that there is some degree of planning or strategic thought, while flying by the seat of one's pants implies an absence of a plan and reliance on instincts.

Iain Duncan Smith is a British Conservative Party politician who serves as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Chingford and Woodford Green, a constituency located in Greater London. He was first elected as MP for the area in 1992, and he has held the seat ever since. Iain Duncan Smith, full name George Iain Duncan Smith, was born on April 9, 1954, in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and later pursued a military career, serving in the Scots Guards from 1975 to 1981. After leaving the military, he worked in various business roles before entering politics. In 1997, Iain Duncan Smith was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Social Security, and in September 2001, following the Conservatives' failure to win the general election, he became the leader of the Conservative Party. He replaced William Hague as the new party leader, beating Kenneth Clarke in the leadership election. Under his tenure as party leader, Iain Duncan Smith faced several challenges, including internal disputes and disagreements within the party. His leadership faced widespread criticism from his party as well as the media, ultimately resulting in a vote of no confidence by Conservative MPs in October 2003, which led to his resignation as party leader. He was succeeded by Michael Howard. After stepping down from the leadership, Iain Duncan Smith remained active in British politics, focusing on various social issues. In 2004, he founded the Centre for Social Justice, a think tank focused on addressing social problems in the United Kingdom. When the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government came to power in 2010, Iain Duncan Smith was appointed the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, a role he held until March 2016 when he resigned over proposed changes to the welfare system. In recent years, he has continued to serve as a backbench MP and has been outspoken on a range of issues, including Brexit and the UK's relationship with the European Union.

US Internet speeds lag many in Asia, Europe Cambridge-based Akamai Technologies recently issued it State of the Internet report, based on information about trillions of data transfers. Despite ambitious plans by private companies and governments to boost the adoption of broadband technology, the average Internet connection speed in the United States is still slower than those of many other countries. Cambridge-based Akamai’s latest State of the Internet report found the average US connection speed to be 11.7 megabits per second last quarter, about half the speed of top-ranked South Korea. Akamai, which helps Web companies boost their loading speeds by distributing Web files to locations that are closer to end users, compiled the information from the trillions of data transfers its network makes every quarter. The United States ranked 16th in terms of average Internet speeds, behind the United Kingdom and ahead of Canada. In addition to South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore had higher average speeds, as did Israel and a number of Northern Europe countries. Speeds in the United States barely budged in the last year, rising slightly from an average of 11.4 Mbps, past Akamai reports show. And eight months after the Federal Communications Commission increased the standard for broadband download speeds to 25 Mbps from 4 Mbps, no state’s average was that fast. In five places, at least 10 percent of connections met that benchmark:the District of Columbia, Delaware, Utah, Washington, and Massachusetts. A fourth of South Korean connections hit that benchmark, and the figure was around 16 percent in second-ranked Hong Kong. There are many ways to measure Internet speeds. Download speeds are often faster than upload speeds, peak speeds are different from average speeds, and including mobile connections can skew the metrics. Netflix reports how fast it delivers movies and TV shows to different groups of customers, while the company Ookla reports results from its website Speedtest.net. The federal government has its own standard. Among states, Akamai said, Massachusetts connections were the third-fastest, averaging 15.3 Mbps. At the top was Washington, D.C., with average connection speeds of 19 Mbps, while Delaware was second, averaging 16.7 Mbps. Compared to those in much of the world, US connection speeds are relatively fast, topping every other country in the Americas. The global average was 5.1 Mbps, less than half of the US average, but 17 percent higher than it was last year. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The United States has been found to have slower internet connection speeds compared to many other countries, according to Akamai Technologies' State of the Internet report.

Article: Inland waters may be grouped into two general classes: standing waters and flowing waters. As is often the case, the boundary between these two classes is not sharp and clear. A pond is an example of standing water. But most ponds are fed by springs or brooks and most have an outlet. Thus some current of changing water flows through them. On the other hand, a river is an example of flowing water. In some places, however, a river may have such a slow current that it is very difficult to detect. Standing inland waters differ in size, in age, and in many _ environmental characteristics. They range in size from roadside puddles to the Caspian Sea. Puddles may last for only a few days or weeks; ponds, for a few hundred to a thousand years. In general, lakes are older, though the waters of some tropical \\"lakes\\" disappear completely during each dry season. Standing waters vary from very shallow to very deep, from clear to muddy, from fresh to salty. In flowing waters we roughly distinguish between brooks, creeks, and rivers. The size and age of flowing waters are unimportant. Speed of flow, clearness, oxygen content, and other chemical characteristics are used by scientists in studying flowing-water ecosystems.

The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - Island Records is a Jamaican-English record label that operates as a division of the Universal Music Group (UMG). It was founded by Chris Blackwell, Graeme Goodall and Leslie Kong in Jamaica in 1959. Blackwell sold the label to PolyGram in 1989. Both Island and another label recently acquired byPolyGram, A&M Records, were both at the time the largest independent record labels in history, with Island in particular having exerted a major influence on the progressive UK music scene in the early 1970s.   - Cold Chillin' Records was a record label that released some music in the golden age of hip hop from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. A producer-and-crew label founded by manager Tyrone Williams and run by Len Fichtelberg (d. November 4, 2010), most of the label's releases were by members of the Juice Crew, a loosely knit group of artists centered on producer Marley Marl. In 1998, the label shut down and the majority of its expansive catalog was bought by Massachusetts-based LandSpeed Records (now Traffic Entertainment).  - Hip hop is a subcultural art movement that was formed during the early 1970s primarily by African-American and Afro Puerto Rican youths residing in the South Bronx in New York City. Art historian Robert Farris Thompson describes the demographics of the youth that characterize the South Bronx in the early 1970s as \\"English-speaking blacks from Barbados\\" like Grandmaster Flash, \\"black Jamaicans\\" like DJ Kool Herc, \\"thousands of Nuyoricans\\", who introduced the rhythms from Salsa (music), as well as Afro conga and bonga drums, as well as many who emulated the sounds of Tito Puente and Willie Colón with existing styles of musical styles from jazz to funk associated with African Americans prior to the 1970s. Hip hop music became popular outside of the African-American community in the late 1980s. After the rise of new media platforms and Web 2.0 technology of the Internet, fans would primarily consume the musical genre through social networking sites (SNS) beginning with Myspace evolving to notable mobile apps like YouTube, Worldstarhiphop, SoundCloud, and Spotify.  - \`\` Mother Mother '' is a song by Tracy Bonham from her debut album The Burdens of Being Upright .

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).

Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo. While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down.

Take about 2 tablespoons of flour and mix it with some water to make a smooth paste. Then, slowly add this paste into the stew while stirring constantly. The flour will help the stew become thicker as it cooks. 2. Cornstarch: Another option is using cornstarch. Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water. This will make a slurry. Slowly pour this slurry into the stew while stirring. This will also make the stew thicker. 3. Cook longer: You can also let the stew cook for a longer time. As it cooks, some of the liquid will evaporate, making the stew thicker. Make sure to keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn or stick to the bottom of the pot. Remember to always stir gently while adding flour or cornstarch to avoid creating lumps in the stew.

In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion.

The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

Question: Who, of the artists whose death years are mentioned in the passage, did not live to see the 1450s? Context: The large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building, as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved, as in the Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea. Painted or carved wooden relief altarpieces became common, especially as churches created many side-chapels. Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck (d. 1441) and Rogier van der Weyden (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of incunabula, or works printed before 1500, by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others. Very small woodcuts, nearly all religious, were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century.

Given these facts, what can be water vapor condensing in air be a hindrance to among the following options: - eating  - driving  - survival  - rain  - movement  - farming  - vehicles  - cooking A:","output":"Among the given options, water vapor condensing in the air, leading to fog, can typically be a hindrance to driving, movement, farming, and vehicles. 1. Driving: Fog poses a significant danger while driving, as it severely reduces visibility for drivers. Poor visibility can lead to slower reaction times and an increased likelihood of collisions. Drivers need to be extremely cautious during foggy conditions, using their fog lights and low-beam headlights to improve visibility, while also decreasing their speed to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. Hazards on the road may also be harder to perceive, further increasing the risk of accidents. 2. Movement: Reduced visibility caused by fog can impact any mode of transport, including walking, cycling, and even aviation. Limited sight can create difficulties in determining one's location, direction, and distance from obstacles. Navigating in foggy conditions requires added caution, as it is easier to miss signs, landmarks, and other crucial navigational aids. Moreover, fog hampers the detection of approaching vehicles or pedestrians, increasing the risk of accidents. 3. Farming: Excessive or long-lasting fog can have detrimental effects on farming, particularly in terms of sunlight availability. Many crops rely on an adequate amount of sunlight for photosynthesis, which is crucial for their growth and development. Extended periods of fog can block sunlight and reduce solar radiation, which may lead to decreased crop yields. Additionally, high humidity levels during foggy conditions can promote the growth of fungal diseases, further affecting the health of crops and decreasing their productivity. 4. Vehicles: Foggy conditions can affect the overall performance of vehicles, especially when visibility is severely limited. During fog, condensation can form on vehicle windows and mirrors, reducing the driver's ability to see surrounding traffic and potential hazards. External sensors on vehicles, such as rearview cameras and proximity sensors used for parking, may become obstructed by fog, rendering these safety features less effective. Moreover, fog can lead to the accumulation of moisture in sensitive areas of vehicles like the engine and electrical components, potentially causing malfunctions and increasing the risk of accidents. Overall, water vapor condensing in the air and the formation of fog can pose challenges for people in various activities, with the primary hindrance being the significant reduction in visibility. This reduction in visibility makes driving, movement, farming, and vehicles more challenging or dangerous, making caution and preparedness essential when dealing with foggy conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is the property of the fabulously wealthy Nora Hunter, who has secretary and friend Sylvia Lockwood impersonate her in public. Longtime guardian Jonathan Connors protects his ward's privacy zealously. During a ship launching, a press photographer takes Nora's picture, but Connors sees to it that the camera film is ruined. Sylvia tells Nora that she is quitting so that she can accompany her husband, Phil Vernon, whose job requires him to move to Washington. Nora decides to marry her fiance Donald so that Sylvia can be her maid of honor at her wedding, but when Donald returns from military duty, he breaks the news that he has fallen in love with someone else. Nora hosts a tea, but has Sylvia again pretend to be her. There she meets and takes a liking to Tony, but he is more interested in Sylvia. On hearing him vow that love is more important to him than money, Nora and Sylvia invite him to a weekend at Nora's beach house.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor.  - Orestis Makris ( Greek :   ; September 30 , 1898 -- January 29 , 1975 ) was a Greek actor and tenor . He graduated from the Greek Odeum of Athens and first entered the scene as a tenor in the troupe of Rosalia Nika in 1925 . He later joined the Papaioannou troupe , before moving to more comedic roles . Makris excelled in the portrayal of folk characters , especially the stock role of the \`\` drunkard '' . Makris also participated in about forty movies , mostly as an over-strict father . He is considered one of the most significant modern Greek actors . He was decorated with the Order of the Phoenix . He died on January 29 , 1975 in Athens and is buried at the First Cemetery in a family grave .  - Vocal range is the measure of the breadth of pitches that a human voice can phonate. Although the study of vocal range has little practical application in terms of speech, it is a topic of study within linguistics, phonetics, and speech and language pathology, particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders. However, the most common application of the term \\"vocal range\\" is within the context of singing, where it is used as one of the major defining characteristics for classifying singing voices into groups known as voice types.  - Spinto (from Italian, \\"pushed\\") is a vocal term used to characterize a soprano or tenor voice of a weight between lyric and dramatic that is capable of handling large musical climaxes in opera at moderate intervals. (Sometimes the terms \\"lirico-spinto\\" or \\"jugendlich-dramatisch\\" are used to denote this category of voice.)  - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted.  - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock.  - In music, an octave (: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. It is defined by ANSI as the unit of frequency level when the base of the logarithm is two. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the \\"basic miracle of music\\", the use of which is \\"common in most musical systems\\".    What is the relationship between 'orestis makris' and 'opera'?","output":"Orestis Makris was a Greek actor and tenor, known for his significant contributions to Greek theater and cinema. His relationship with opera lies in his early career as a tenor, when he graduated from the Greek Odeum of Athens and entered the scene as a tenor in the troupe of Rosalia Nika in 1925. As a tenor, he participated in opera and classical singing performances. Later, he transitioned to more comedic roles in theater and cinema, where he excelled in portraying folk characters. Though his career eventually moved away from opera, his background and training as a tenor established a connection between Orestis Makris and the world of opera."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What animal normally represents the box of low market share and low market growth in the Boston Matrix (or 'BSG Matrix' or 'Growth-Share Matrix') marketing model?","output":"The Boston Matrix, also known as the BCG Matrix or Growth-Share Matrix, is a marketing model developed by the Boston Consulting Group in the early 1970s. It is a strategic analysis tool that helps businesses evaluate the performance and potential of their products or services by categorizing them into four different quadrants based on their market share and market growth. In the Boston Matrix, animals are often used as symbols to represent these quadrants, and the animal that normally represents the box of low market share and low market growth is the \\"Dog.\\" Below is a detailed explanation of the Boston Matrix and its four quadrants: 1. Stars (High Market Share, High Market Growth) These are products or services that have a high market share in a steadily growing segment. They generate significant revenue and are considered leaders in their market. Companies should invest in these products or services to maintain or even increase market dominance. 2. Cash Cows (High Market Share, Low Market Growth) These products or services have a high market share in a mature, slow-growing industry. They generate substantial cash flow but have low growth potential. Companies should focus on maintaining their market share and extracting profits from these products or services. 3. Question Marks (Low Market Share, High Market Growth) These products or services have low market share in a fast-growing market. They have potential for growth and can possibly become Stars or Cash Cows in the future, but they also require significant investment. Companies need to carefully analyze these products or services and decide whether to invest in them or reallocate resources elsewhere. 4. Dogs (Low Market Share, Low Market Growth) These are the products or services that have a low market share in a stagnant or declining market segment. \\"Dogs\\" typically generate low revenue and have limited potential for growth. Companies should carefully evaluate the performance of these products or services and consider divesting or phasing them out if they are not generating significant profits or contributing positively to the business. In summary, the \\"Dog\\" quadrant represents products or services with low market share and low market growth in the Boston Matrix. These products or services are not significant contributors to a business's overall growth or profitability and often require careful evaluation and strategic decision-making to either eliminate or turn them around."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Cricketers, eatType = pub, customer rating = 3 out of 5, familyFriendly = yes, near = Ranch Sentence:","output":"The Cricketers, a family-friendly pub near the Ranch, holds a customer rating of 3 out of 5.  Step 1: Looking at the various pieces of information provided, I need to construct a descriptive sentence about a restaurant. For this, I need to ensure I include the name, eatType, customer rating, if it's family-friendly and its location. Step 2: My first point of reference is the name - The Cricketers. This is the subject of my sentence and it will be introduced first. Step 3: I have to give details about this restaurant. The next information I have is the 'eatType' - it's a pub. I've seen that 'eatType' refers to the type of establishment. It's also typical in English to follow the introduction of a business's name with the kind of business it is, adding this immediately after the name. Step 4: A predicate to the subject is that it's family-friendly. I need to incorporate this piece of information as part of the main characteristics of the subject (pub), as this attribute would be a decisive factor for the target customers. Step 5: The next detail to give is the customer rating. It helps to add legitimacy and reputation to the business. Putting this towards the middle to end of the sentence can ensure that the information flow is smooth, easing the reader into this bit of potentially perplexing data. Step 6: The last component is the location of the restaurant - near the Ranch. Location is a crucial detail when describing a business. It tells customers where they may find it, and can impact their decision on whether the place is convenient for them or not. It is, therefore, significant to mention it at the end of the sentence, to leave the reader with an accurate description of where the restaurant is located. Step 7: While placing the pieces of information, I ensured proper grammar usage, coherence, and progression of thoughts to make the sentence easy to comprehend and engaging to the reader."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: tin foil","output":"To determine which solution is best for using tin foil, we must first understand the goal or application for which the tin foil will be used. Tin foil, also commonly referred to as aluminum foil, is a thin, pliable sheet of aluminum that has a wide range of uses in both domestic and industrial settings. Let's consider various options and applications to help you choose the best solution for your specific goal: 1. Food Packaging and Preservation: Aluminum foil is an excellent choice for various food packaging and preservation purposes. Its ability to form a barrier against light, oxygen, moisture, and microorganisms makes it ideal for wrapping and preserving food items. As a result, a 1) heavy-duty aluminum foil with a thickness between 16 and 24 microns is recommended for effectively protecting and preserving different types of food. 2. Cooking: Tin foil can be used in cooking techniques such as baking, grilling, and steaming. For example, wrapping food items in foil before cooking can help maintain moisture and flavor while reducing cooking time. In this case, 2) a standard aluminum foil with a thickness of approximately 12 to 16 microns should suffice, as it can withstand the heat and force required for various cooking methods. 3. Heat Insulation and Reflectivity: If the goal is to use the tin foil for its heat insulation and reflectivity properties, such as creating a solar oven or an insulated container, then 3) aluminum foil with a reflective side (which typically has a shiny finish) would work best. This foil variant can reflect up to 95% of the sunlight and help maintain a consistent internal temperature. 4. Art and Craft Purposes: Aluminum foil is widely used for various art and craft projects due to its flexibility and ease of manipulation. If your goal is to use the tin foil for artistic or creative purposes, then a 4) colored or embossed aluminum foil can add an aesthetic appeal to your project. These foils can come in various thicknesses depending on the intricacy and structural requirements of your artwork. 5. Industrial Uses: In certain industrial applications like manufacturing, insulation, or electronics, the use of tin foil might require specific properties like electrical conductivity, higher thickness levels, or added chemical resistance. In these cases, a 5) specialized aluminum foil tailored for the specific industry's requirements will be the best choice. Consult with an expert in the field to determine the most suitable foil type for your needs. Depending on the intended use of the tin foil, one of these solutions will be better than the others for your goal. Assess the requirements and applications of your project, and choose the appropriate aluminum foil solution accordingly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The use of the term \\"misogynist\\" implies that the film displays distasteful or offensive attitudes and behavior towards women, while \\"evil\\" suggests that such elements are not just problematic but morally reprehensible. Consequently, the reviewer likely found the movie objectionable and disagreeable on ethical grounds, which confirms a negative perception of the film.  Negative reviews like this one could potentially discourage audiences from watching the movie, particularly those who value fair representation and treatment of women in media.

Near East This view reveals a somewhat less than altruistic Christian intent of the British Empire; however, it was paradoxical from the beginning, as Simpson and most other writers pointed out. The Ottomans were portrayed as the slavers, but even as the American and British fleets were striking at the Barbary pirates on behalf of freedom, their countries were promulgating a vigorous African slave trade of their own. Charles George Gordon is known as the saint of all British colonial officers. A dedicated Christian, he spent his time between assignments living among the poor and donating his salary on their behalf. He won Ottoman confidence as a junior officer in the Crimean War.

Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to effectively impress your parents with a thorough cleaning of the house: 1. Prepare the cleaning supplies: Gather all your cleaning supplies, such as a vacuum cleaner, cleaning cloths, floor cleaner, window cleaner, a broom, and a mop. Making a list of the rooms and the necessary supplies for each helps in streamlining your cleaning process. 2. Start from the top: Begin your cleaning routine with high, hard-to-reach areas like ceiling fans, shelves, and light fixtures. Use a long-handled duster or a dusting brush with an extension pole to dust these areas. This ensures that dust or debris from higher places doesn't settle on newly cleaned lower surfaces. 3. Dust off the furniture: Wipe all the furniture, including tables, chairs, and bookshelves, using a microfiber cloth to remove dust and dirt. 4. Clean the windows: Spray window cleaner onto the windows and wipe them down with a clean cloth, ensuring no streaks are left behind. This should be done for all the windows in the house, including those in your parents' room, which you have already opened for ventilation. 5. Vacuum the floors: Vacuum carpets and rugs thoroughly, taking care to vacuum underneath furniture and in corners. Use the vacuum's brush attachment for baseboards and other hard-to-reach areas. 6. Sweep and mop hard floors: After vacuuming, sweep the hard floors using a broom and dustpan, ensuring all debris is collected. Following this, mop the floors using an appropriate cleaning solution and allow the floors to dry. 7. Deep clean the kitchen: Wipe down countertops, appliances, and the stovetop. Clean the insides of cabinets and drawers, as well as the refrigerator. Disinfect the sink and clean the faucet. Sweep and mop the kitchen floor. 8. Tackle the bathroom: Scrub the toilet, sink, and bathtub or shower using bathroom-specific cleaning products. Clean the bathroom mirrors and wipe down all other surfaces, including countertops and shelves. Sweep and mop the bathroom floor. 9. Organize personal items: Put away any items that are out of place, such as clothes, shoes, or books. Make sure all personal belongings are properly stored in their designated places to give your house a neat and organized appearance. 10. Take care of the trash: Empty all trash cans throughout the house and replace the liners. Ensure that all garbage is appropriately disposed of, and recycling items are placed in the correct bins. 11. Add final touches: Re-arrange any throw pillows or decorative items to add flair to your cleaned home, and place fresh flowers or plants strategically around the house to give it a lively and inviting atmosphere. 12. Notify your parents: Once the cleaning process is complete and you have ensured that all rooms are well-ventilated, inform your parents about your accomplishment and invite them to evaluate your hard work.

Options:  A. movie  B. casino  C. theatre  D. show  E. comedy The answer is:","output":"A. Movie In line with common sense, the most common form of entertainment that people generally watch on a screen is a movie. Movies are visual storytelling experiences that are available in various genres and formats on various platforms such as streaming services, television, and cinemas. These visual experiences entertain, educate, and engage the audience with gripping narratives and stunning visual effects. While the other options, such as casino (B), theatre (C), show (D), and comedy (E), might be related to screen-based entertainment, they have some limitations compared to movies. For instance: B. Casino - Casinos are generally places where people go for gambling, and although they might have screens for virtual games or monitoring purposes, they are not primarily associated with entertainment on a screen. C. Theatre - Theatre is a more traditional form of entertainment involving live performances, primarily witnessed in-person. While there are cases where theatre performances are recorded or adapted into movies, the primary experience of theatre is not screen-based. D. Show - A show, including TV shows, series, or talk shows, can be considered screen-based entertainment. However, the term \\"show\\" is slightly less specific than \\"movie\\" and could encompass a wider range of entertainment styles, formats, and genres. Hence, selecting \\"movie\\" makes more sense in this context. E. Comedy - Comedy is a genre often associated with movies, TV shows, and stand-up comedy acts, among others. Although comedy can be entertaining on a screen, it is not a form of entertainment per se but a category or genre within various entertainment forms. Therefore, selecting \\"movie\\" as the primary option for entertainment on a screen is more appropriate."},{"instruction":"Process: - Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals - Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes.

Answer:","output":"2. grill a hamburger patty on a bbq grill, and place the cooked patty onto a hamburger bun with a slice of cheese and a piece of lettuce. The reason why option 1 is incorrect is because placing a raw patty onto the hamburger bun would make it unsafe to eat. Consuming raw or undercooked meat can lead to foodborne illnesses caused by harmful bacteria such as E.coli or Salmonella.

Here is a news article: Karl Martin’s toothbrush holder. Courtesy Hansons Auctioneers and Valuers Ltd      During the Bronze Age, around 4,000 years ago, in what is now Afghanistan, an artisan from the Indus Valley (or Harappan) civilization made a ceramic pot. The four-inch-tall vessel was distinguished by a doe-eyed antelope painted across its flank. We’ll never know who used it, or for what—at least before 2013.      That’s when Karl Martin, a valuer at Hansons Auctioneers in Derbyshire, England, purchased the pot at a car boot sale, a kind of English flea market. And why not? He got it and another pot for a total of £4—or, £1 for every thousand years since it had been made.      Of course Martin didn’t know at the time that he was buying an authentic artifact from one of the cradles of civilization. All he knew, he said in a Hansons release, was that he “liked it straight away,” so he gave it a place of honor in his household where he would see it every day. It was in the bathroom, where it held his toothbrush and toothpaste. There it sat for years.      And there it would have stayed, if not for the fact that Martin often encounters antiquities in his line of work. One day, he was helping a Hansons colleague unload some items headed for the block when he spotted some familiar-looking pottery, coated with patterns and animals like those on his toothbrush-holder. He brought his holder to the colleague, James-Seymour Brenchley, Hansons’ Head of Ancient Art, Antiquities & Classical Coins. Brenchley was able to link the pot’s painting style to that of other Indus Valley artifacts. He speculates that the pot had arrived in the United Kingdom via British tourists. Martin decided to put it up for auction at Hansons, where it sold this week for £80—“not a fortune,” Martin admits, but still a 1,900 percent profit, not adjusting for inflation.      Mohenjo-Daro, a major Indus Valley city and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Quratulain/CC BY-SA 3.0      The Indus Valley Civilization flourished in the northwestern part of South Asia between 2600 and 1900 BC, across parts of modern-day India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Its most distinctive artifacts are probably carved seals used to mark trade goods with symbols that may or may not represent one of mankind’s earliest written languages. (The Indus script is the subject of much heated scholarly debate.)      But the Indus Valley pot is not the only antiquated item in the United Kingdom that had been unintentionally repurposed for modern times. Earlier this week, researchers realized that Henry VII’s unidentified bed was used to decorate film and television sets between the 1970s and 1990s. That’s at least two items for a first-class master bedroom suite. ||||| A piece of pottery snapped up for a song at a Midlands car boot sale has turned out to be a genuine ancient antiquity made in 1900 BC – making it 4,000 years old.      The pottery jar, featuring a painting of an antelope, was spotted on a stall at Willington car boot sale five years ago by Derby man Karl Martin – and he bought it along with another pot, £4 for the pair.                  “I liked it straight away,” said Mr Martin, 49, a keen collector who followed his passion for all things old, quirky and collectable by joining the team at Derbyshire’s Hansons Auctioneers seven years ago.            “I used it in the bathroom to store my toothpaste and toothbrush – it even ended up getting a few toothpaste marks on it.      “I suspected it might be very old but forgot all about it.Then, one day at work, I was helping Hansons’ antiquities expert James Brenchley unload a van and noticed some pottery which was similar to my toothbrush pot. The painting style looked the same and it had similar crudely-painted animal figures.      “I rescued the pot from my bathroom and asked him to examine it for me. He confirmed it was a genuine antiquity from Afghanistan and dated back to 1900 BC.      “That means it’s around 4,000 years old – made 2,000 years before Christ was born. It’s amazing, really. How it ended up at a South Derbyshire car boot sale, I’ll never know.      “I like the pot but decided to sell it at Hansons’ November antiquities auction just to see how it would do. There was interest straight away with advance bids placed and it eventually sold for £80 – not a fortune but a decent profit. Perhaps I should have held on to it. I feel a bit guilty about keeping my toothbrush in it now.”                  James Brenchley, head of antiquities at Hansons Auctioneers, said: “This is an Indus Valley Harappan Civilisation pottery jar dating back to 1900 BC. This was a Bronze Age civilisation mainly in the north western regions of South Asia.      “Along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early cradles of civilisations of the Old World, and of the three, the most widespread. The civilisation was primarily located in modern-day India and Pakistan as well as Afghanistan.”      “I do come across items like this from time to time and was familiar with the painting technique. It was probably brought back to the UK years ago by wealthy travellers.”      The pottery was sold at Hansons Auctioneers on November 26.

Question 2: Is there a currently evolving tendency towards nasty, trashy behavior in sports? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Hello! I'll explain the answers to both of your questions one by one and then compare them. Question 1: RT News, which stands for Russia Today News, is a news channel that sometimes presents news or stories with a different perspective than other news channels. Some people believe that they have a tendency to talk about or support conspiracy theories more often. In simple words, conspiracy theories are when people think something big or secret is happening, but it's not really true. So, some people may say RT News talks more about such stories than other channels. Question 2: In the world of sports, sometimes people's behavior gets worse, and they do mean or trashy things. Just like in any part of life, we see good and bad behavior. Recently, there have been some incidents in sports where players or fans acted badly, but not everyone in sports is like that. So, there is a mix of good and bad behavior, and sometimes, we might notice the bad behavior more. Now to answer your question about whether the answers to these two questions are the same, I would say, no. They are not the same because one question talks about a news channel and conspiracy theories, while the other question talks about behavior in sports.

What are the pros and cons of swimming in underwear?","output":"No, these two questions are not the same. They address different topics and contexts. I'll provide detailed answers for both questions: 1. Why didn't Horace Slughorn edit the potions recipes like Snape? To understand why Horace Slughorn did not edit the potions recipes like Snape, it is essential to consider their characters and roles in the Harry Potter series. Horace Slughorn is the Potions Master and Head of Slytherin House for part of the series. He is known for his love of comfort, his selective associations with people he considers influential or talented, and his adherence to tradition. Slughorn follows potions recipes strictly, as they are presented in textbooks, and he values their established nature. He could also be motivated by the intent not to confuse students with an alternative approach to the potions-making process. On the other hand, Severus Snape, another Potions Master and Head of Slytherin House, is more innovative and experimental in his methods. In his student years, Snape made modifications to the potions recipes by adjusting the ingredients, quantities, or process in a way that improved the outcomes. He documented these changes in his old potions textbook, and Harry would later rely on these modifications. Snape's approach to potions suggests he valued skill and mastery beyond simply adhering to the instructions. In summary, Horace Slughorn did not edit the potions recipes like Snape due to differences in their characters, their approaches to potions-making, and their adherence to tradition versus the pursuit of mastery. 2. What are the pros and cons of swimming in underwear? Pros: - Accessibility: Swimming in underwear can be more immediately accessible, especially in a spontaneous situation where swimwear isn't available. - Comfort: Some people may find their underwear more comfortable than swimwear, as they are generally designed for everyday wear and fit. - Cost efficiency: If you do not have a bathing suit or do not want to invest in one, underwear can be a cost-effective alternative. - Less restrictive: Underwear can provide a feeling of freedom and reduced restriction, especially in comparison to tight, form-fitting swimwear. Cons: - Hygiene: Swimming in underwear can raise hygiene concerns, particularly in public pools, where there may be restrictions on proper swimwear to minimize bacterial contamination. - Ill-suited fabric: Most underwear is made from materials that were not designed for swimming, such as cotton, which retains water and takes longer to dry than swimwear fabrics. - Transparency: Wet underwear might become partially transparent. This could make you feel uncomfortable or self-conscious, especially in a public setting. - Durability: Regular underwear is not meant for swimming and may wear out or degrade more quickly due to the exposure to water and the chlorine or minerals found in swimming pools or other bodies of water. - Social norms: Swimming in underwear might be viewed as inappropriate or disrespectful in some environments, such as public pools or beaches, due to cultural norms and expectations. In summary, while swimming in underwear can offer certain benefits like accessibility, comfort, and being less restrictive, it may raise hygiene concerns, be ill-suited for swimming, lead to transparency and durability issues, and potentially violate social norms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How many Armenians were slaughtered between 1894-1896 Answer: While Western Armenia still remained under Ottoman rule, the Armenians were granted considerable autonomy within their own enclaves and lived in relative harmony with other groups in the empire (including the ruling Turks).  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"No, the question was not answered in a satisfactory fashion. Allow me to provide a more accurate and detailed response. The events that took place between 1894-1896, often referred to as the Hamidian massacres, were a series of government-sanctioned mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire carried out under the rule of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The exact number of the Armenian deaths during this period is subject to some debate, but the historically accepted estimates range between 100,000 and 300,000. There are several factors that contribute to the wide range in numbers: 1. Lack of accurate official records: During that period, official records from the Ottoman government are limited, and what does exist is often either not detailed enough or biased. Therefore, many historians and scholars rely on reports from other sources, like foreign diplomats and missionaries, to base their estimates on. 2. Discrepancies in contemporary accounts: During the time of these massacres, the international press, missionaries, and foreign diplomats were reporting wildly different figures, depending on their political leanings and affiliations. Some exaggerated the mortality rates to create more sympathy for the Armenian cause, while others downplayed the numbers to avoid international condemnation of the Ottoman Empire. 3. Definition of \\"slaughtered\\": The term \\"slaughtered\\" can include not only those directly killed but also those who perished due to indirect causes like starvation, disease, and exposure, resulting from displacement and deprivation of resources. This broader interpretation of the term leads to higher mortality figures. Taking these factors into account, most historians and scholars agree that at least 100,000 Armenians were killed during the Hamidian massacres between 1894-1896, but the numbers possibly go up to 300,000. It is crucial to emphasize that the estimates are subject to interpretation, and discrepancies in contemporary accounts make it challenging to pinpoint a specific number definitively. Regardless of the exact figure, the tragic loss of life and human suffering resulting from these events had a significant and long-lasting impact on Armenian communities all across the Ottoman Empire and contributed to the brewing ethnic conflicts that eventually culminated in the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He leaves behind Wendy, his flaky, New Age mother and Goat Man, a weed-smoking goat trekker and botanist. Goat Man is the only real father  Ellis has ever known, since his biological father, Frank, left when he was a baby. Upon arriving Gates Academy, Ellis befriends his roommate Barney Cannel, a cross-country runner, and Rosenberg, who usually does not get anything higher than a C in his classes, but is smart enough to sneak in marijuana. Ellis also takes an interest in Minnie, a local girl who works in the school library; his friends often refer to her as a prostitute, according to rumors. Meanwhile, Goat Man and Wendy have been incommunicado, which Barney points out often. On a phone call, Ellis discovers that his mother has a new boyfriend named Bennet, who is rude and disrespectful. One day, Ellis receives a letter in the mail from his long-estranged father from Washington, DC, requesting for Ellis to spend Thanksgiving dinner with him. Ellis decides to fly to Washington with Barney, who is also having Thanksgiving with his mother there. Ellis finally meets his father and his father's pregnant and kind-hearted wife, Judy. One night, Ellis gets a call from Barney telling him that he is in possession of marijuana. Ellis sneaks out for the night, but Frank finds out that he left.
