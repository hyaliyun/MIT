The cities and their connections based on the given tickets are: - Санкт-Петербург to Тверь - Ярославль to Нижний Новгород - Москва to Казань - Нижний Новгород to Казань - Москва to Тверь - Москва to Нижний Новгород 2. **Analyzing the Graph:** To understand where the journey could start, note that every city is connected in such a way that Egor Sergeevich can visit each city exactly once. The goal is to find all valid starting cities that allow him to visit each city once and only once. 3. **Degree of Vertices:** The degrees (number of connections) for each city in the graph are: - Санкт-Петербург: 1 - Тверь: 2 - Ярославль: 1 - Нижний Новгород: 3 - Москва: 3 - Казань: 2 Cities with a degree of 1 (degree is the number of edges incident to a vertex) must be either the starting or ending points of the journey since each has only one route leading into or out of it. 4. **Identifying Potential Starting and Ending Cities:** From the degrees, the cities with a degree of 1 are Санкт-Петербург and Ярославль. This implies: - Санкт-Петербург and Ярославль could either be the starting or the ending city. For these cities to be a starting point, we must be able to form a path that visits all cities exactly once. 5. **Constructing a Valid Path:** Since each ticket allows travel in either direction, consider starting at Санкт-Петербург: - Санкт-Петербург -> Тверь - Тверь -> Москва - Москва -> Нижний Новгород - Нижний Новгород -> Казань - Казань -> Ярославль Alternatively, reversing the path or starting at Ярославль would also form the same complete path: - Ярославль -> Нижний Новгород - Нижний Новгород -> Казань - Казань -> Москва - Москва -> Тверь - Тверь -> Санкт-Петербург 6. **Conclusion:** With these analyses, we determine that both Санкт-Петербург and Ярославль can serve as valid starting points for the journey where each city is visited exactly once.

Prove that [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{x_{i}^{2}}{x_{i+1}} geq sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} ] where ( x_{n+1} = x_{1} ). 1. We start by observing that Jensen's inequality is useful for convex functions when applied to sequences. However, in this problem, we use a different method. 2. We use the rearrangement inequality which applies to ( sum_{i=1}^n frac{x_i^2}{x_{i+1}} ). Applying this inequality, we can state that for sequences sorted in descending order, the rearrangement inequality provides us with a precise balance. 3. Another key observation to make is related to the weighted AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality that supports our balance: [ frac{x_i^2 + x_{i+1}^2}{2} geq x_i x_{i+1} ] Using cyclic symmetric sums and properties, this inequality transforms our reasoning: [ sum_{i=1}^n frac{x_i^2}{x_{i+1}} geq sum_{i=1}^n x_i. ] 4. To understand this deeper, we need to divide both sequences approximately equally and handle them properly within the cyclic sum boundary provided by ( x_{i+1} ): begin{align*} sum_{i=1}^n frac{x_i^2}{x_{i+1}} &= sum_{i=1}^n x_i cdot frac{x_i}{x_{i+1}} &= sum_{i=1}^n x_i left(frac{x_i}{x_{i+1}}right) &= sum_{i=1}^n x_i left(1 cdot frac{x_i}{x_{i+1}}right) &geq sum_{i=1}^n x_i end{align*} 5.

Half of 30 is 15, so at least 15 numbers are greater than 4. To maximize the number of numbers greater than 4, we want to minimize the numbers that are less than or equal to 4. Let's assume that the other 15 numbers are all equal to 4 (which is the maximum value they can have without being greater than 4). The sum of these 15 numbers would be: 15 * 4 = 60 Now, we have used up 60 out of the total sum of 120 with 15 numbers that are not greater than 4. This leaves us with another 60 to distribute among the remaining 15 numbers, which must all be greater than 4 to maximize the count. If we distribute this remaining sum of 60 among the 15 numbers such that each of these numbers is just a tiny fraction more than 4 (for example, 4 + ε, where ε is a very small positive number), we can have all of these 15 numbers greater than 4. Therefore, the maximum number of numbers that can be greater than 4 is boxed{15,} which is exactly half of the total number of numbers.

By using the knowledge of the terms in the sequence, we can calculate the sum of the first five terms and then establish an equation to solve for the common difference d, which will allow us to find the value of S_{10}.

In each of these 49 pairs, one of two conditions holds: - The person on the right is taller than the person on the left (15 pairs containing the tall people). - The person on the right is shorter than the person on the left. 4. In the first case, the person on the right is one of the 15 tall people. So, there are 15 pairs where the tall person is on the right position within a pair. 5.

The calculation is as follows: [P_{n+1} = 0.6P_{n} + 0.2(1 - P_{n}) = 0.4P_{n} + 0.2] This equation shows that the probability that player A takes the (n+1)-th shot depends on the probability that player A took the n-th shot. Simplifying the equation gives us: [P_{n+1} - frac{1}{3} = 0.4(P_{n} - frac{1}{3})] Given that P_{1} = 0.5, we find that P_{1} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6}. This indicates that {P_{n} - frac{1}{3}} forms a geometric sequence with the first term frac{1}{6} and a common ratio of 0.4. Therefore, we can express P_{n} as: [P_{n} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{n-1}] Thus, the probability that player A takes the i-th shot is boxed{P_{i} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{i-1}}.

In this scenario: - Each of the first ( n ) people will increase their number of acquaintances by one. - Since previously, none of any three persons out of the ( n ) had the same number of acquaintances, increasing each person's acquaintance count by one will not create three people with the same number of acquaintances.

Thus, each vertex (a_n) is a different odd number. 4. **Assign values to the midpoints:** The numbers at the midpoints of the edges must be even since the odd numbers are used for the vertices. Let the number at the midpoint of the edge between (a_n) and (a_{n+1}) (considering (a_{2007} = a_0)) be (m_n). 5. **Determine the common sum:** Let the common sum be 6022. We need to show that: [ a_n + a_{n+1} + m_n = 6022 ] Solving for (m_n), we get: [ m_n = 6022 - a_n - a_{n+1} ] 6. **Verify the midpoint values:** - **Case 1:** (1 leq a_n leq 2007) - Then (a_{n+1} = a_n + 2006). The midpoint value is: [ m_n = 6022 - a_n - (a_n + 2006) = 4016 - 2a_n ] - Since (a_n) is odd, (4016 - 2a_n) is even and lies in the range ([2, 4014]). Each (4016 - 2a_n) is a different even number equivalent to (2 pmod{4}). - **Case 2:** (2009 leq a_n leq 4013) - Then (a_{n+1} = a_n + 2006 - 4014 = a_n - 2008). The midpoint value is: [ m_n = 6022 - a_n - (a_n - 2008) = 8030 - 2a_n ] - Since (a_n) is odd, (8030 - 2a_n) is even and lies in the range ([4, 4012]). Each (8030 - 2a_n) is a different even number equivalent to (0 pmod{4}). 7. **Conclusion:** We have used each of the first 4014 positive integers exactly once, and the numbers are distributed such that the sum of the numbers along each side is 6022. Therefore, the distribution is valid.

At most how many distinct unit vectors can be selected in mathbb{R}^n such that from any three of them, at least two are orthogonal?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of distinct unit vectors in mathbb{R}^n such that from any three of them, at least two are orthogonal. We will use linear algebra and combinatorial arguments to achieve this. 1. **Define the Unit Vectors and Projections:** Let v_1, v_2, ldots, v_m in mathbb{R}^n be the unit vectors. Define P_i as the orthogonal projection onto v_i, given by: [ P_i(v) = frac{langle v, v_i rangle}{langle v_i, v_i rangle} v_i ] Since v_i are unit vectors, langle v_i, v_i rangle = 1, so: [ P_i(v) = langle v, v_i rangle v_i ] 2. **Properties of Projections:** - P_i is self-adjoint and idempotent, i.e., P_i^2 = P_i. - The trace of P_i is 1, i.e., text{tr}(P_i) = 1. - If v_i and v_j are orthogonal, then P_iP_j = P_jP_i = 0. 3. **Trace of the Sum of Projections:** Define T = P_1 + P_2 + cdots + P_m. T is self-adjoint and positive semidefinite, so it has real non-negative eigenvalues. 4. **Evaluate text{tr}(T^3):** [ text{tr}(T^3) = text{tr}left(sum_{i,j,k} P_i P_j P_kright) ] - Terms with the same P_j three times: text{tr}(P_j^3) = text{tr}(P_j) = 1. - Terms with the same P_j twice: text{tr}(P_i P_j P_j) = text{tr}(P_j P_j P_i) = text{tr}(P_j P_i P_j). - Terms with three distinct P_j's: text{tr}(P_i P_j P_k) = 0 if any two of v_i, v_j, v_k are orthogonal. Therefore: [ text{tr}(T^3) = text{tr}(T) + 6 sum_{i < j} text{tr}(P_i P_j) ] 5. **Evaluate text{tr}(T^2):** [ text{tr}(T^2) = text{tr}left(sum_{i,j} P_i P_jright) ] - Terms with the same P_j twice: text{tr}(P_j^2) = text{tr}(P_j) = 1. - Terms with different P_j's: text{tr}(P_i P_j). Therefore: [ text{tr}(T^2) = text{tr}(T) + 2 sum_{i < j} text{tr}(P_i P_j) ] 6. **Relate text{tr}(T^3) and text{tr}(T^2):** [ text{tr}(T^3) = 3 text{tr}(T^2) - 2 text{tr}(T) ] 7. **Eigenvalues of T:** Let lambda_1, lambda_2, ldots, lambda_n be the eigenvalues of T. Then: [ text{tr}(T) = sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i ] [ text{tr}(T^2) = sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i^2 ] [ text{tr}(T^3) = sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i^3 ] Using the relation: [ sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i^3 = 3 sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i^2 - 2 sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i ] 8. **Maximize the Expression:** We need to maximize 2m = 2 text{tr}(T) = -sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i^3 + 3 sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i^2. The function -x^3 + 3x^2 has a maximum value of 4 over positive reals. Therefore: [ 2m leq 4n ] Hence, the maximum number of distinct unit vectors is m = 2n.

How many ways can this be done? b) Prove that you can choose 4 face planes of an icosahedron such that they will be the face planes of a regular tetrahedron.","output":"Part (a): 1. The task requires us to prove that it is possible to select 8 faces of the icosahedron such that they form the faces of an octahedron, and to determine the number of such selections. 2. Recall from geometry that an icosahedron has 20 faces, and an octahedron has 8 faces. An essential insight is that we can \\"embed\\" the octahedron within the icosahedron. Specifically, each vertex of the octahedron comes from splitting each vertex of the icosahedron. 3. According to the result of problem 9.4, it is possible to choose 8 faces of the icosahedron such that these faces will correspond to the 8 faces of an octahedron. 4. This embedding means that from each vertex of the icosahedron, exactly one edge emerges that does not lie within the plane of the octahedron's face. This aspect identifies those edges as belonging to the octahedron. 5. Next, to determine the number of distinct ways to choose such 8 faces: - For any vertex of the icosahedron, choosing any of the 3 edges emerging from it and not lying on the face plane yields a unique octahedron configuration. 6. Given 12 vertices in an icosahedron, we utilize the combinatorial property such that each selection of an edge uniquely identifies one octahedron: - Therefore, for each edge at a vertex, we have numerous distinct octahedron selections. 7. Considering the structure and symmetry of the icosahedron, it can be shown (without loss of generality) that there are 5 distinct possible ways to embed an octahedron in an icosahedron. Conclusion: [ boxed{5} ] Part (b): 1. The task requires us to demonstrate that we can select 4 faces of the icosahedron such that they form the faces of a regular tetrahedron. 2. We start by noting that a regular tetrahedron has 4 faces, and we need to choose these 4 faces from the 8 faces that form an embedded octahedron within the icosahedron (proven in part a). 3. Each face of the tetrahedron is shared by faces of the octahedron. 4. Since octahedron itself is made through symmetrical passes through certain vertices and faces of the icosahedron, choosing sets of concentric vertices and ensuring the faces are valid form the sets we seek. 5. From the octahedron embedded in the icosahedron, we select any combination of 4 faces that form a valid tetrahedron structure (adjacent and congruent). 6. Since each tetrahedron faces counts equally and maintains the regular structure, and the octahedron's property ensures rotational symmetry, these face combinations ensure neat tetrahedral formations. Conclusion: A tetrahedron made from 4 faces out of 8 faces from the icosahedron embedded octahedron verifies constructing a valid regular tetrahedron.

Using the triangle inequality in triangles triangle ADP and triangle BDC, we obtain: [ AD + DP > PA ] [ DC + CB > DB ] Since D lies on AC, we can decompose AC into segments AD and DC.

Hence, the equation of the plane is: [-x + z = 0.] This plane is perpendicular to the diagonal of the face parallel to the y-axis and cuts through the cube from A diagonally upwards in the z-direction. Since the plane doesn't pass through the center of the cube (which is at (1,1,1) for a cube of side 2), it implies it divides the cube asymmetrically. Calculating the volume of the solids: The larger solid includes vertex C and, by symmetry considering the plane's orientation, will encompass more than half of the cube when projected along the diagonal AC (which is in the plane). The volume of the cube is 8, and it is reasonable without rigorous integration or complex geometry, to estimate by symmetry and the orientation of the cut that the larger volume would be a little over half the cube's volume. A rigorous approach would require integration or more advanced geometric decomposition. By an approximate decomposition, assuming the plane slightly favors side C due to its diagonal and midpoint-based orientation, an estimate could be around 5 cubic units for the larger section, although this is coarse without exact calculation methods like integration available here.

Consider the fraction (frac{34}{275}) and convert it to a decimal. We find: [ frac{34}{275} = 0.123636363ldots = 0.123(63) ] Here, the non-periodic part is 123, and the periodic part is 63. We'll discuss why the non-periodic part appears and show that (frac{1}{221}) does not possess a non-periodic part. 2. The key detail is that for (frac{34}{275}), the digit 3 repeats every time the remainder 100 appears during division by 275. The same remainder 100 is obtained from different digits 650 and 1750 due to the multiplicative property: [ 10r_{1} = 650 ] where (r_{1} = 65) from division of 340 by 275; and [ 10r_{2} = 1750 ] where (r_{2} = 175) from addition inside the division. The difference gives: [ 1750 - 650 = 10(r_{2} - r_{1}) ] And such a discrepancy is only possible because 275 (made of 5 and 55) is not relatively prime to the base 10. However, for (frac{1}{221}), such non-periodic calculations aren’t applicable as discussed later. 3.

Nickels: We cannot use any nickels because adding even one nickel (5 pennies) to the current total of 380 pennies (250 from half-dollars + 130 from dimes) would exceed the target amount. 6.

What is the value of ( m^{3} )?","output":"1. We start with the problem of minimizing the expression ( x + 2y + 3z ) subject to the constraint ( x^3 y^2 z = 1 ). 2. To find the minimum, we will employ the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality). The AM-GM Inequality states that for non-negative real numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n): [ frac{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n}{n} geq sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 cdots a_n} ] with equality if and only if (a_1 = a_2 = cdots = a_n). 3. In order to apply AM-GM to the expression ( x + 2y + 3z ), we need to break it down into terms that correspond to the exponents in the given constraint ( x^3 y^2 z ). 4. We rewrite ( x ) such that each instance of ( x ) is split into three equal parts. Similarly, we split ( 2y ) into two equal parts and leave ( 3z ) as it is: [ x + 2y + 3z = left(frac{1}{3}x + frac{1}{3}x + frac{1}{3}xright) + (y + y) + 3z ] 5.

Solving for ( x + 2y + 3z ): [ x + 2y + 3z geq 6 cdot sqrt[6]{frac{1}{9}} ] 10. It is essential to verify if this value can actually be reached. Equality in the AM-GM inequality holds when: [ frac{1}{3}x = y = 3z ] 11. Correspondingly for the constraint ( x^3 y^2 z = 1 ), we substitute ( y = frac{1}{3}x ) and ( 3z = frac{1}{3}x ). 12. By verifying: [ x = 3(sqrt[6]{frac{1}{9}}) ] [ y = sqrt[6]{frac{1}{9}} ] [ z = frac{1}{3} sqrt[6]{frac{1}{9}} ] 13.

Calculating the product of all these invertible modules and then taking modulo 120, we may simplify. However, the key here is that the product modulo 120 of the set of numbers relatively prime to 120 follows Wilson's Theorem, which suggests that the product of all numbers from 1 to p-1 is -1 mod p for a prime p. Even though 120 is not a prime, its prime components (2, 3, 5) collectively form analogous patterns due to the Chinese remainder theorem, indicating the potential for the product to resolve to pm 1 mod 120. For simplification, this vast multiplication is typically covered under higher number theory, predicting, due to the symmetry and properties of the numbers, -1 mod 120.

If the total cost with a 20% tip is 18, we can set up an equation to find the original cost (let's call it x): x + 0.20x = 18 Combining like terms, we get: 1.20x = 18 Now, divide both sides by 1.20 to solve for x: x = 18 / 1.20 x = 15 So, the original cost of the taxi ride is 15.

Start by assuming that we have a consistent 2-configuration of order 4 on a finite set ( A ). 2. Consider that this configuration has just one cell, meaning all pairs belong to a single subset of ( A ). 3. We wish to show that such a configuration has a subset that forms a consistent 2-configuration of order 2. To achieve this, we'll construct a sequence of elements from ( A ): [ a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n ] where not all elements are necessarily distinct. This sequence will be chosen such that each pair: [ {a_0, a_1}, {a_1, a_2}, ldots, {a_{n-1}, a_n}, {a_n, a_0} ] appears exactly once in the 2-configuration. 4. Consider the longest sequence such that these pairs are all distinct elements of the 2-configuration. Note that the finiteness condition ensures that such a maximal sequence exists, and may take ( n = 0 ) if necessary. 5. Each element of ( A ) occurs an even number of times among these pairs (as each occurrence in the sequence contributes to two pairs). 6. If every element occurs 4 times or 0 times, then the elements forming this sequence are a cell because they occur nowhere else in the 2-configuration. Therefore, these elements are all of ( A ), implying our sequence involves all pairs in the 2-configuration. 7. Otherwise, there exists an element ( a_i ) that appears exactly twice. Select ( b_1 ) such that ( {a_i, b_1} ) is one of the two pairs not used by our sequence. Then choose ( b_2 ) so that ( {b_1, b_2} ) is another such pair. Continue this procedure, selecting new elements ( b_k ) where ( {b_k, b_{k+1}} ) is an unused pair until no unused pairs remain. 8. At this point, we have pairs: [ {a_0, a_1}, ldots, {a_{n-1}, a_n}, {a_n, a_0}, {a_i, b_1}, {b_1, b_2}, ldots, {b_{k-1}, b_k} ] Every element is used in an even number of these pairs, except possibly ( a_i ) and ( b_k ). ( a_i ) appears in three pairs, and ( b_k ) must appear in one or three pairs unless ( a_i = b_k ), in which case the element occurs four times. 9. Since continuing the sequence is impossible, ( b_k ) must have been used four times, thus ( b_k = a_i ). 10. Now construct the following sequence: [ {a_0, a_1}, ldots, {a_i, a_{i+1}}, {a_i, b_1}, {b_1, b_2}, ldots, {b_{k-1}, a_i}, {a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}}, ldots, {a_{n-1}, a_n}, {a_n, a_0} ] This sequence is longer than the originally assumed maximal sequence, leading to a contradiction. 11. Therefore, the initial sequence must use all pairs in the 2-configuration. 12. Since each element appears in four pairs, we select every second pair from the sequence: [ {a_0, a_1}, {a_2, a_3}, ldots, {a_{2m-2}, a_{2m-1}} ] ensures each element of ( A ) occurs in exactly two pairs, forming a consistent 2-configuration of order 2. 13. If ( A ) has more than one cell, apply the above procedure for each cell.

To satisfy f(x)leqslant t^{2}-2at+1 for all xin[-1,1] and ain[-1,1], we need t^{2}-2at+1geqslant 1, which simplifies to t^{2}-2atgeqslant 0. Let g(a)=t^{2}-2at. We require g(a)geqslant 0 for all ain[-1,1]. This is true if the minimum value of g(a) on [-1,1] is greater than or equal to 0. When t=0, the condition is satisfied. If t < 0, we need g(-1)geqslant 0, and if t > 0, we need g(1)geqslant 0. Solving these inequalities, we get tleqslant -2 or t=0 or tgeqslant 2.

Let's first identify what Vasya calls an almost-square. An almost-square is a rectangle where the difference between its side lengths is exactly (1). For example, a rectangle with sides (5) and (6) is an almost-square because (6 - 5 = 1). 2. Consider a very basic almost-square in the form of a (2 times 1) domino tile. Clearly, the difference between (2) and (1) is (1), so it qualifies as an almost-square. 3. Now, we are tasked with finding an almost-square that can be cut into exactly (2010) almost-squares. 4. Take a nearly-square rectangle with dimensions (2009 times 2008). The difference between the side lengths is (2009 - 2008 = 1), thus it is an almost-square. 5. To achieve a total of (2010) almost-squares, we will augment the (2009 times 2008) almost-square by adding strips of dominoes: - Attach a vertical strip composed of (1004) (2 times 1) dominoes on one side of the (2009 times 2008) rectangle. - Add a horizontal strip made up of (1005) (2 times 1) dominoes on the other side of the rectangle. 6. The configuration can be visualized as follows: - The original (2009 times 2008) almost-square contains (2009 times 2008 = 4{,}018{,}072) unit squares. - Adding the vertical strip of (1004) dominoes contributes an additional (1004 times 2 = 2008) unit squares. - Similarly, the horizontal strip of (1005) dominoes adds (1005 times 2 = 2010) unit squares. 7. This construction results in an almost-square whose dimensions are (2009 + 2 = 2011) (with vertical and horizontal additions) and (2008 + 2 = 2010). The total number of almost-squares used in the cutting is (1) large almost-square plus (1004) plus (1005) small almost-squares, which sum up to (2010) almost-squares. 8.

We need to determine the path described by a point on this moving line that divides the segment between its points of intersection with lines (a) and (b) in a constant ratio. 1. Let’s consider the sequence of positions ((A_1, B_1), (A_2, B_2), (A_3, B_3), ldots) that the moving line takes as it intersects lines (a) and (b). 2. The point that divides the segment between intersections with (a) and (b) in a constant ratio moves through the positions (M_1, M_2, M_3, ldots). 3. We analyze the intersection using auxiliary lines and planes: - Draw a line (a') through a point (P) on line (b) such that (a') is parallel to (a). - Assume (A_1) and (B_1) lie in plane (alpha), and that (a') intersects (alpha) at (A_1'). - The parallel lines (A_1' B_1, A_2' B_2, A_3' B_3, ldots) result due to the motion of the given line. 4.

Consider the points (M_1', M_2', M_3') that divide these segments (M_1 M_1', M_2 M_2', M_3 M_3') proportionally: - The proportional division implies that these points lie on a single straight line. - Specifically, since (M_1' M_2' M_3') are proportionally dividing segments parallel to each other, all these points (M_i') lay on a line parallel to the intersection of (a) and (b) projected on the auxiliary plane. 6.

If ( p(x) ) is an integer for one integer value of ( x ), it is trivially an integer for all ( x in mathbb{Z} ). - **Inductive Step:** Assume the lemma holds for some ( n geq 1 ). Let ( f(x) ) be a polynomial of degree ( n ) such that ( f(x) ) is an integer for ( x = i, i+1, ldots, i+n ). Consider the polynomial ( q(x) = f(x+1) - f(x) ). The degree of ( q(x) ) is ( n-1 ), and ( q(x) ) is an integer for ( x = i, i+1, ldots, i+n-1 ). By the induction hypothesis, ( q(x) ) is an integer for every ( x in mathbb{Z} ). Since ( f(k+1) - f(k) = q(k) ), an induction on ( k ) shows that ( f(x) ) is an integer for every integer ( x ). 2. **Main Proof:** - **Base Case:** For ( n = 0 ), the polynomial ( f(x) ) is a constant. The condition ( frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} ) being an integer is trivially satisfied since ( f(x) = f(y) ). - **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for ( n-1 ). Let ( f(x) ) be a polynomial of degree ( n ) that satisfies the given condition. Write ( f(x) = x p(x) + f(0) ), where ( p(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n-1 ). We have ( p(x) = frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x} ), which is an integer for ( x = 1, 2, ldots, n ). By the lemma, ( p(x) ) is an integer for every ( x in mathbb{Z} ). Thus, ( frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x} ) is an integer for every integer ( x ). 3. **Consider the Polynomial ( q(x) = f(x+1) - f(x) ):** - The degree of ( q(x) ) is ( n-1 ). We have ( frac{q(x) - q(y)}{x - y} = frac{f(x+1) - f(y+1)}{(x+1) - (y+1)} - frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} ). - By the given condition, ( frac{q(x) - q(y)}{x - y} ) is an integer for ( 0 leq x < y leq n-1 ). By the induction hypothesis, ( frac{q(x) - q(y)}{x - y} ) is an integer for every distinct integers ( x, y ). 4. **Conclusion:** - Using the results from the lemma and the induction hypothesis, we conclude that ( frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} ) is an integer for every distinct integers ( x, y ).

The center is at (1, 1) and the radius r can be calculated as: r = frac{1}{2} sqrt{2^2+2^2-4} = 1. There are two possibilities for the slope of line l. Case 1: The slope of line l is undefined. This corresponds to a vertical line, which would have the equation x = -1. However, this does not satisfy the conditions of the problem since it does not result in a chord of length sqrt{2} when intersecting the circle. Case 2: The slope of line l is k. We can then write the equation of the line l as y + 2 = k(x + 1), which can be rewritten as kx - y + k - 2 = 0. The distance d from the circle's center (1, 1) to the line l is given by: d = frac{|k - 1 + k - 2|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = frac{|2k - 3|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}}. Since the chord length created by l intersecting the circle is sqrt{2}, we use the formula for the chord length based on the distance d from the center to the line, which is: sqrt{2} = 2sqrt{1 - left(frac{|2k - 3|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}}right)^2}.

Residents of the city sometimes replace old batteries with new ones. It is known that 18,000 batteries are exhausted in a single day and the city covers an area within a radius of 10 kilometers. Prove that there is at least one point in the city that is illuminated by more than one street light at some moment.","output":"1. **Coordinate System and Time Representation**: Let's consider a three-dimensional space with a coordinate system where we use the ( Z )-axis to represent time. We then study the variation of the illuminated area by streetlights within this three-dimensional space. At a specific time ( t ), the illuminated area on the plane ( z = t ) is given by the set ({(x, y, z) mid z=t}). 2. **Time of Battery Replacement**: Suppose a streetlight's battery is replaced at time ( t_{0} ), and the streetlight is located at coordinates ((x_{0}, y_{0})). At time ( t_{0} ), the streetlight illuminates a circular area ( S(t_{0}) ) with a center at ( O(x_{0}, y_{0}, t_{0}) ) and a radius of 200 meters. 3. **Illumination Reduction Over Time**: For ( t_{0} < t < t_{0} + 20 ), the illuminated area is a circle ( S(t) ) centered at ( O_{1}(x_{0}, y_{0}, t) ) with a radius of ( 200 - 10(t - t_{0}) ) meters. When ( t = t_{0} + 20 ), the illuminated area reduces to a point ( S(x_{0}, y_{0}, t_{0} + 20) ), which corresponds to the streetlight turning off. 4. **Volume of Illumination**: Hence, after replacing a battery, the illuminated range forms a conical frustum with the circular base ( S(t_{0}) ) and height equal to 20. We refer to this conical frustum as the *light cone* of the streetlight. 5. **Volume Calculation**: In one night, the city uses 18,000 batteries, resulting in 18,000 light cones. Each light cone has a volume calculated by: [ V_{0} = frac{pi}{3} times (200)^{2} times 20 = frac{8}{3} pi times 10^{5} ] 6. **Combined Volume**: If none of these light cones intersect, their combined volume would be: [ V = 18,000 times V_{0} = 18,000 times frac{8}{3} pi times 10^{5} = 48 pi times 10^{8} ] 7. **City Dimensions and Total Volume**: The city has a radius of 10,000 meters, thus the light cones' bases are all within a circle of radius ( 10,000 + 200 ) meters. The height where the light cone’s apexes lie ranges from ( z = t_{0} ) to ( z = t_{0} + 20 ), implying the bases are between ( z = t_{0} - 20 ) and ( z = t_{0} ).

To increase a by 25 percent, we multiply a by 1.25 (since 25 percent is 0.25 and increasing by 25 percent is the same as multiplying by 1 + 0.25): x = a * 1.25 We are given that m is b decreased by some percentage, let's call this percentage p. To decrease b by p percent, we multiply b by (1 - p/100): m = b * (1 - p/100) We are also given that m/x = 0.2. Let's substitute x and m with the expressions we have: (b * (1 - p/100)) / (a * 1.25) = 0.2 Now, we can substitute a with 4/5 * b (from the ratio a/b = 4/5): (b * (1 - p/100)) / ((4/5 * b) * 1.25) = 0.2 Simplify the right side of the equation: (b * (1 - p/100)) / (b * 1) = 0.2 Now, we can cancel out b from both the numerator and the denominator: (1 - p/100) = 0.2 Now, we solve for p: 1 - p/100 = 0.2 1 - 0.2 = p/100 0.8 = p/100 Now, multiply both sides by 100 to find p: p = 0.8 * 100 p = 80 So, the percentage decrease of b to get m is boxed{80%} ."},{"instruction":"Given that a and b are nonzero real numbers and a lt b, which of the following propositions is true?

However, we also have the additional constraint that the number of pencils given to each student must be a prime number. Let's first find the GCD of the three numbers without considering the prime number constraint: GCD(1080, 920, 680) = GCD(GCD(1080, 920), 680) GCD(1080, 920) = 160 (since 1080 = 6 * 180 and 920 = 5 * 180 + 40, and 180 and 40 have a GCD of 40, and 40 * 4 = 160) GCD(160, 680) = 160 (since 680 = 4 * 160 + 40, and 160 and 40 have a GCD of 40, and 40 * 4 = 160) So, the GCD of 1080, 920, and 680 is 160.

The number 23 is the largest prime factor.

Thus, the final answers are boxed{d = -1, c = 0, b = 3} for part (1), boxed{text{minimum value} = a - 2, text{maximum value} = a + 2} for part (2), and boxed{a = 2 text{ or } a = -2} for part (3)."},{"instruction":"A library has an average of some visitors on Sundays and 240 on other days.

Since the month begins with a Sunday, there will be 5 Sundays in the month. The remaining days of the month are 30 - 5 = 25 days. The average number of visitors on the other days (non-Sundays) is given as 240. The total number of visitors in the month is the sum of the visitors on Sundays and the visitors on the other days. So, the total number of visitors on Sundays is 5 * S, and the total number of visitors on the other days is 25 * 240. The average number of visitors per day for the entire month is given as 300. The total number of visitors in the month is the average per day multiplied by the number of days in the month, which is 300 * 30.

Given: 1. The unit selling price of type A is 30 less than the unit selling price of type B. This gives us the equation: y - x = 30. 2. The total sales amount for 2 type A toys and 3 type B toys is 740. This gives us the equation: 2x + 3y = 740. Solving these equations simultaneously: - From the first equation, we can express y in terms of x: y = x + 30. - Substituting y = x + 30 into the second equation: 2x + 3(x + 30) = 740. - Simplifying the equation: 2x + 3x + 90 = 740. - Combining like terms: 5x + 90 = 740. - Subtracting 90 from both sides: 5x = 650. - Dividing by 5: x = 130. - Substituting x = 130 back into y = x + 30: y = 130 + 30 = 160. Therefore, the selling prices are: - Type A children's toy: boxed{130} dollars. - Type B children's toy: boxed{160} dollars. Part (2): Maximizing Total Profit Given: - Cost price per unit of type A: 90. - Cost price per unit of type B: 110. - Total toys to purchase: 80. - Total purchase cost not exceeding 8400. Let: - The number of type A toys purchased be m. - The number of type B toys purchased be 80 - m. The total purchase cost is: 90m + 110(80 - m) leqslant 8400. Simplifying: - 90m + 8800 - 110m leqslant 8400. - -20m leqslant -400. - Dividing by -20: m geqslant 20. Let the total profit be w dollars: - w = (130 - 90)m + (160 - 110)(80 - m). - Simplifying: w = 40m + 50(80 - m). - Further simplification: w = 40m + 4000 - 50m. - Combining like terms: w = -10m + 4000. Since -10 < 0, the total profit w decreases as m increases. Therefore, to maximize profit, m should be minimized, given m geqslant 20. Hence, the optimal purchase strategy is: - Type A children's toys: boxed{20} units. - Type B children's toys: boxed{60} units (since 80 - m = 80 - 20 = 60).

Prove that the midpoints of the segments of the four common tangents to these circles lie on a straight line.","output":"1. **Initial Configuration and Tangents**: Given that the distance between the centers of the two circles is greater than the sum of their radii, the circles do not intersect and are positioned outside one another. This geometric arrangement implies the existence of two external tangents and two internal tangents between the circles. 2. **Defining the Tangents and Midpoints**: Suppose a tangent line touches the circles at points ( A ) and ( B ). Let ( M ) be the midpoint of the segment ( AB ). Our goal is to show that the midpoint ( M ) lies on a specific line, which we will argue is the radical axis of the circles. 3. **Property of the Midpoint on the Tangent Line**: By the definition of midpoint, the distances from ( M ) to ( A ) and ( B ) are equal: [ MA = MB ] This balance indicates that any segment formed by tangents from a point to two circles has equal tangents. 4. **Radical Axis Relation**: To demonstrate that ( M ) lies on the radical axis of the two circles, recall that the radical axis of two circles is the locus of points from which tangents drawn to both circles have equal lengths. Given that ( MA = MB ), ( M ) must lie on the radical axis of the circles. 5. **Confirming the Result for Other Tangents**: This argument extends symmetrically to the other three tangents (one more pair of external tangents and two pairs of internal tangents). The midpoints of these tangent segments, by the same reasoning, also lie on the radical axis. 6. **Conclusion**: The midpoints of the segments formed by the four common tangents to the two circles all lie on the radical axis of the circles. Thus, these midpoints are collinear, lying on the same straight line.

Each edge length remains constant as the tetrahedron deforms. There are two pairs of opposite edges in the tetrahedron which are situated on two mutually skew (non-parallel and non-intersecting) lines.

Considering distances between points under the second transformation, we get: [ begin{cases} AB rightarrow BC BC rightarrow CD CD rightarrow DE DE rightarrow EA end{cases} ] Since this transformation is congruence, it preserves distances, implying: [ AB = BC = CD = DE = EA ] 5.

After three hours, they would have removed: 3 hours * 4 ounces/hour = 12 ounces of sugar. The bag originally had 24 ounces of sugar. After removing 12 ounces, there would be: 24 ounces - 12 ounces = 12 ounces of sugar left.

Write down your purchasing method and calculate the amount needed.","output":"# Solution: Part 1: - **Option 1 Calculation:** The cost of 20 water dispensers is 20 times 350 = 7000 yuan. Since the customer buys more than 20 water dispenser barrels, they get 20 barrels for free. Thus, they only pay for (x - 20) barrels. The cost for the remaining barrels is (x - 20) times 50 = 50x - 1000 yuan. Therefore, the total cost under Option 1 is 7000 + (50x - 1000) = 50x + 6000 yuan. So, the customer needs to pay boxed{50x + 6000} yuan if purchasing according to Option 1. - **Option 2 Calculation:** The discounted price for one water dispenser is 350 times 90% = 315 yuan. The discounted price for one water dispenser barrel is 50 times 90% = 45 yuan. Therefore, the total cost under Option 2 is (315 times 20) + (45 times x) = 6300 + 45x yuan. So, the customer needs to pay boxed{45x + 6300} yuan if purchasing according to Option 2. Part 2: - **Option 1 with x=50:** Substituting x = 50 into the formula for Option 1, we get 50 times 50 + 6000 = 8500 yuan. - **Option 2 with x=50:** Substituting x = 50 into the formula for Option 2, we get 45 times 50 + 6300 = 8550 yuan. Therefore, purchasing according to Option 1 is more cost-effective since boxed{8500} yuan < boxed{8550} yuan. Part 3: - **More Cost-Effective Purchasing Option:** - **Buying 20 Water Dispensers According to Option 1:** The cost is 20 times 350 = 7000 yuan, with 20 free water dispenser barrels included. - **Buying 30 Water Dispenser Barrels According to Option 2:** The cost is 50 times 90% times 30 = 1350 yuan. - **Total Cost:** The total cost is 7000 + 1350 = 8350 yuan.

We will show that if lim_{x to infty} f(x) neq 0, then lim_{x to infty} left(f(x) + frac{f'(x)}{x}right) neq 0. 1. Assume lim_{x to infty} f(x) neq 0. This means there exists an varepsilon > 0 and a sequence (x_k)_{k in mathbb{N}} such that |f(x_k)| > varepsilon for all k. Without loss of generality, assume f(x_k) > varepsilon for all k. 2. Since f is continuous, there exists an interval around each x_k where f(x) > varepsilon. Define ell_k = inf { 0 < eta < x_k : f(x) > varepsilon , forall x in (eta, x_k) }. It is clear that the sequence (ell_k) is non-decreasing: [ 0 leq ell_1 leq ell_2 leq dots ] 3. Consider two cases: **Case 1:** The sequence (ell_k) assumes only a finite number of values. This means there exists an M > 0 such that ell_k = ell for all k geq M. In this case, f(x) > varepsilon for all x > ell. - If f'(x) leq -1 for all large x, then for a fixed large x_0 and all y > x_0: [ f(y) = f(x_0) + f'(K_y) (y - x_0) leq f(x_0) - (y - x_0) to -infty ] This is a contradiction since f(x) > varepsilon for all x > ell. - Therefore, there must exist a sequence (y_k)_{k in mathbb{N}} subset left( max left { ell, frac{2}{varepsilon} right }, infty right) such that f'(y_k) > -1. For these y_k's, we have: [ f'(y_k) > -1 > -frac{varepsilon}{2} y_k ] Thus, [ frac{f'(y_k)}{y_k} > -frac{varepsilon}{2} ] and [ f(y_k) + frac{f'(y_k)}{y_k} > frac{varepsilon}{2} ] **Case 2:** There exists a subsequence (ell_{varphi(k)})_{k in mathbb{N}} of distinct elements: [ 0 < ell_{varphi(1)} < ell_{varphi(2)} < dots ] At the points ell_{varphi(k)}, due to the properties of the infimum and the continuity of f, it must be that f(ell_{varphi(k)}) = varepsilon. Therefore, [ f'(ell_{varphi(k)}) = f'_+(ell_{varphi(k)}) = lim_{x to {ell_{varphi(k)}}^+} frac{f(x) - f(ell_{varphi(k)})}{x - ell_{varphi(k)}} geq 0 ] and [ f(ell_{varphi(k)}) + frac{f'(ell_{varphi(k)})}{ell_{varphi(k)}} geq varepsilon > frac{varepsilon}{2} ] 4. In both cases, we have shown that there exists a sequence (y_k) such that: [ f(y_k) + frac{f'(y_k)}{y_k} > frac{varepsilon}{2} ] Hence, lim_{x to infty} left(f(x) + frac{f'(x)}{x}right) neq 0.

Translation invariance: ((x circ y) + z = (x + z) circ (y + z)) Let's proceed step by step. Step 1: Symmetry Property Firstly, we focus on property (a), which states: [ x circ y = y circ x ] This tells us that the function ( circ ) is commutative. Step 2: Translation Invariance Now, consider property (c): [ (x circ y) + z = (x + z) circ (y + z) ] Rewriting this, we see that the operations interact with addition in a specific way. Let's assume that ((x circ y)) is defined as: [ x circ y = f(x, y) ] From property (c), we can infer the form of the function ( f ): [ f(x, y) + z = f(x + z, y + z) ] This implies that ( f(x, y) ) depends on (x) and (y) in such a way that adding (z) to both arguments of (f) is equivalent to adding (z) to the result. A likely candidate is the arithmetic mean: [ f(x, y) = frac{x + y}{2} ] Step 3: Distribution over Multiplication Next, let’s validate this candidate using property (b): [ (x circ y) cdot z = (x cdot z) circ (y cdot z) ] Substituting ( f(x, y) = frac{x + y}{2} ): [ left( frac{x + y}{2} right) z = left( frac{xz + yz}{2} right) ] Simplify both sides: [ frac{(x + y)z}{2} = frac{xz + yz}{2} ] Since both expressions are equivalent, our candidate function satisfies property (b). Step 4: Conclusion We now have an expression for ( (x circ y) ): [ x circ y = frac{x + y}{2} ] Finally, for the given problem, substitute ( x = 1975 ) and ( y = 1976 ): [ 1975 circ 1976 = frac{1975 + 1976}{2} = frac{3951}{2} = 1975.5 ] Therefore, the number that Otto assigns to the pair ((1975, 1976)) is: [ boxed{1975.5} ]"},{"instruction":"Bob started out the week with 80.

First, distribute the 3/8 to the terms inside the parentheses: 40 - T - (3/8) * 40 + (3/8) * T = 20 Now, simplify the equation: 40 - T - 15 + (3/8) * T = 20 Combine like terms: 25 - T + (3/8) * T = 20 Now, let's isolate T on one side of the equation: T - (3/8) * T = 25 - 20 T * (1 - 3/8) = 5 T * (5/8) = 5 Now, divide both sides by (5/8) to solve for T: T = 5 / (5/8) T = 5 * (8/5) T = 8 So, Bob spent 8 on Tuesday.

We need to show that ( k leq m ), i.e., ( k > m ) leads to a contradiction. 3. **Setup of contrary assumption:** - Assume ( k > m ). Let ( A ) be a person with ( k ) friends, denoted ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k ), and let ( S = {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k} ). 4. **Choosing subsets:** - Take any subset of ( S ) with ( m-1 ) elements, denoted ({ B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, ldots, B_{i_{m-1}} }). By the problem's condition, the set ( {A, B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, ldots, B_{i_{m-1}} } ) has a unique common friend, say ( C_i ). - Since ( C_i ) is a common friend of ( A ) and ( B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, ldots, B_{i_{m-1}} ), we must have ( C_i in S ).

In other words, we have a one-to-one correspondence between the subsets of ( S ) of size ( m-1 ) and the elements of ( S ). 6. **Counting the subsets:** - The number of such subsets is given by (binom{k}{m-1}). Since this is the number of different ( (m-1) )-element subsets of ( S ), we must have (binom{k}{m-1} leq k). 7. **Analyzing the binomial coefficient:** - Recall that for ( m geq 3 ), we get ( m-1 geq 2 ), and hence [binom{k}{m-1} = frac{k(k-1)(k-2)cdots(k-m+2)}{(m-1)!} > k text{ for } k > m.] - This inequality ( binom{k}{m-1} > k ) is apparent from the combinatorial properties as the left-hand side grows much faster than ( k ). 8. **Conclusion and final contradiction:** - Thus, having ( k > m ) leads to a contradiction because ( binom{k}{m-1} ) exceeds ( k ), which can't happen. - Therefore, the assumption ( k > m ) is false. It follows that ( k leq m ). 9. **Maximal number of friends:** - Consequently, the maximum number of friends that any person can have among ( m geq 3 ) people with a unique common friend is ( m ).

Therefore, the assumption of green balloon at position 1 is incorrect. 5. **Case 2: Blue balloon at position 1**: - Now, we assume the first balloon (position 1) is blue to satisfy the condition properly. - This would make blue balloons at remaining even positions: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. - Green balloons must be placed in the remaining odd positions: 3, 5, 7, 9. - Calculations of pairs of all balloons with respective spaces: - Blue balloons in position 1, 2, 4: - Between 1 and 2: ( 0 ) (Even) - Between 1 and 4: ( 2 ) (Even) - Between 1 and 6: ( 4 ) (Even) - Between 1 and 8: ( 6 ) (Even) - Between 1 and 10: ( 8 ) (Even) - Green balloons in position 3, 5, 7, 9: - Between positions 3 and 5: ( 1 ) (Odd) - Between positions 3 and 7: ( 3 ) (Odd) - Between positions 3 and 9: ( 5 ) (Odd) - Between positions 5 and 7: ( 1 ) (Odd) - Between positions 5 and 9: ( 3 ) (Odd) - Between positions 7 and 9: ( 1 ) (Odd) 6. **Contradictions** - Given our ordering of blue and green balloons, the arrangement will still violate the conditions, leading to fertile contradictions. 7. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, it is not possible to arrange 10 blue and green balloons such that between any two blue balloons there is an even number of balloons, and between any two green balloons, there is an odd number of balloons.

The inscribed sphere touches the face ( BCD ) at point ( X ), and the exscribed sphere touches the face ( BCD ) at point ( Y ). 2. **Line through the centers:** The line ( ell ) passing through the centers ( I ) and ( J ) also passes through the vertex ( A ) of the pyramid due to homothety. This means that ( A ), ( I ), and ( J ) are collinear. 3. **Positioning the plane ( BCD ):** Place the plane ( BCD ) horizontally with ( A ) above it. This implies that the line ( ell ) is not vertical because if it were vertical, the points ( X ) and ( Y ) would coincide, which contradicts the given condition that they are different points. 4. **Analyzing the vertical plane containing ( ell ):** Consider the vertical plane that contains the line ( ell ). Since ( ell ) is tilted, it means that ( I ) and ( J ) are not directly above each other. Let’s assume ( ell ) is tilted to the right. 5. **Relative positions of ( X ) and ( Y ):** - Point ( X ) is directly below ( I ) on the face ( BCD ). - Point ( Y ) is directly above ( J ) on the face ( BCD ). Since ( ell ) is tilted to the right, ( X ) will be to the right of ( A ) when viewed from above, and ( Y ) will be even further to the right of ( A ). 6. **Forming triangle ( AXY ):** In the vertical plane containing ( ell ), the points ( A ), ( X ), and ( Y ) form a triangle. Since ( Y ) is further to the right than ( X ), the angle ( angle XAY ) will be obtuse. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the triangle ( AXY ) is an obtuse triangle because the angle ( angle XAY ) is greater than ( 90^circ ).

We need to ensure that a and b are relatively prime, which we will check later. **Step 2: Check that a and b are relatively prime.** The greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b is gcd(2x+1, 2x-1). Since the difference between 2x+1 and 2x-1 is 2, the gcd can be at most 2. However, since both 2x+1 and 2x-1 are odd, their gcd must be 1. Thus, a and b are relatively prime. **Step 3: Verify the divisibility condition a^b + b^a equiv 0 pmod{a+b}.** We need to show that (2x+1)^{2x-1} + (2x-1)^{2x+1} equiv 0 pmod{4x}. **Claim 1: (2x+1)^{2x-1} + (2x-1)^{2x+1} equiv 0 pmod{4}.** - (2x+1) equiv 3 pmod{4} and (2x-1) equiv 1 pmod{4}. - Therefore, (2x+1)^{2x-1} equiv 3^{2x-1} pmod{4} and (2x-1)^{2x+1} equiv 1^{2x+1} pmod{4}. - Since 3^{2x-1} equiv (-1)^{2x-1} equiv -1 pmod{4} (as 2x-1 is odd) and 1^{2x+1} equiv 1 pmod{4}, their sum is -1 + 1 equiv 0 pmod{4}. **Claim 2: (2x+1)^{2x-1} + (2x-1)^{2x+1} equiv 0 pmod{x}.** - (2x+1) equiv 1 pmod{x} and (2x-1) equiv -1 pmod{x}. - Therefore, (2x+1)^{2x-1} equiv 1^{2x-1} equiv 1 pmod{x} and (2x-1)^{2x+1} equiv (-1)^{2x+1} equiv -1 pmod{x}. - Their sum is 1 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{x}. **Claim 3: (2x+1)^{2x-1} + (2x-1)^{2x+1} equiv 0 pmod{4x}.** - From Claims 1 and 2, and using the Chinese remainder theorem, we conclude that (2x+1)^{2x-1} + (2x-1)^{2x+1} equiv 0 pmod{4x}. **Conclusion:** Since a+b = 4x, we have shown that a^b + b^a equiv 0 pmod{a+b} for our choice of a and b.

So, when he walks at 5 m/min, he is ( T ) minutes late, which means: ( S + T = frac{630}{5} ) And when he walks at 7 m/min, he is 30 minutes early, which means: ( S - 30 = frac{630}{7} ) Now we have two equations: 1) ( S + T = frac{630}{5} ) 2) ( S - 30 = frac{630}{7} ) Let's solve these equations to find ( T ). First, calculate the time taken at each speed: ( frac{630}{5} = 126 ) minutes ( frac{630}{7} = 90 ) minutes Now plug these values into the equations: 1) ( S + T = 126 ) 2) ( S - 30 = 90 ) From equation 2), we can find ( S ): ( S = 90 + 30 ) ( S = 120 ) minutes Now we can find ( T ) using equation 1): ( 120 + T = 126 ) ( T = 126 - 120 ) ( T = 6 ) minutes So, the child is boxed{6} minutes late when walking at 5 m/min."},{"instruction":"Calculate the sum of dfrac{1}{1 times 2} + dfrac{1}{2 times 3} + dfrac{1}{3 times 4} + ldots + dfrac{1}{99 times 100}.","output":"Firstly, observe that the general term of the series can be written in the form of partial fractions, as follows: dfrac{1}{n(n+1)} = dfrac{1}{n} - dfrac{1}{n+1} Therefore, we can express the series sum using partial fraction decomposition: begin{align*} S &= left(1 - dfrac{1}{2}right) + left(dfrac{1}{2} - dfrac{1}{3}right) + left(dfrac{1}{3} - dfrac{1}{4}right) + ldots + left(dfrac{1}{99} - dfrac{1}{100}right) &= 1 - dfrac{1}{2} + dfrac{1}{2} - dfrac{1}{3} + dfrac{1}{3} - dfrac{1}{4} + ldots + dfrac{1}{99} - dfrac{1}{100} end{align*} Observe that most terms in the sequence cancel out, except the first term, 1, and the last term, -dfrac{1}{100}.

The second circle passes through B and P and has a radius lambda times the length BP, where lambda is a constant greater than frac{1}{2}. 2. **Consider the two cases for circle centers:** We analyze the centers O_1 and O_2 of the circles k_1 and k_2, respectively, assuming they lie on the same side of the line extending AB and not on AB itself because lambda > frac{1}{2}. 3. **Establish the triangle similarity:** Since O_1A = O_1P = lambda cdot AP and O_2B = O_2P = lambda cdot BP, the triangles APO_1 and PBO_2 are similar because the ratio of their sides is 1 : lambda : lambda. Consequently, angle A O_1 P = angle P O_2 B. 4. **Identify the constant angle omega:** The angle angle A O_1 P = angle P O_2 B is independent of the position of P on AB and depends only on lambda. Let this constant angle be denoted as omega. As such, angle A M P = angle P M B = frac{omega}{2} and angle A M B = frac{omega}{2} + frac{omega}{2} = omega. 5. **Geometric locus of second intersection M:** The point M, the second intersection of the circles which is not P, must lie on the arc of a circle that subtends an angle of omega at points on AB. 6. **General case for interior points:** Considering a point M^* on this arc other than A and B, there exists a point P^* such that the circles intersect again at M^*. The angle angle A M^* P^* = angle P^* M^* B = frac{omega}{2} implying M^* is on the circles associated with P^* precisely. 7. **Reflection and broader geometric context:** If point O_1 lies on one side (F') while O_2 is on the opposite side (F''), the analysis remains symmetric due to the circular properties. When O_2 lies on F'', it is always the reflection of the previous O_2 across AB. Here, O_2'', P, and O_1 are collinear, making P the only second common intersection point. 8. **Final geometric locus determination:** Thus, the geometric locus of the second intersection point is the pair of arcs of circles (i', i'') seen from AB subtending an angle omega, and the segment AB excluding the endpoints A and B. # Conclusion: boxed{M} The geometric locus consists of the arcs i' and i'', and the segment AB excluding the endpoints A and B."},{"instruction":"For any number x, define two operations: x& = 8 x and &x = x 8.

Let A(x_{1}, y_{1}), B(x_{2}, y_{2}), from begin{cases} y = k(x - 4) frac{x^{2}}{4} + frac{y^{2}}{3} = 1 end{cases}, we get (4k^{2} + 3)x^{2} - 32k^{2}x + 64k^{2} - 12 = 0. Since triangle > 0, we have - frac{1}{2} < k < frac{1}{2}. Thus, x_{1} + x_{2} = frac{32k^{2}}{4k^{2} + 3}, x_{1}x_{2} = frac{64k^{2} - 12}{4k^{2} + 3}. Let the midpoint of A and B be P(x_{0}, y_{0}), then x_{0} = frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} = frac{16k^{2}}{4k^{2} + 3}, y_{0} = k(x_{0} - 4) = frac{-12k}{4k^{2} + 3}. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of segment AB is l': y - y_{0} = - frac{1}{k}(x - x_{0}), which simplifies to y = - frac{1}{k}x + frac{4k}{4k^{2} + 3}. Setting x = 0, we get m = frac{4k}{4k^{2} + 3}, where k in (- frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}). When k = 0, m = 0. When k neq 0, m = frac{4}{4k + frac{3}{k}}. It's easy to see that f(k) = 4k + frac{3}{k} has a range of (-infty, -8) in (- frac{1}{2}, 0) and (8, +infty) in (0, frac{1}{2}). Thus, m = frac{4}{4k + frac{3}{k}} has a range of (- frac{1}{2}, 0) in (- frac{1}{2}, 0) and (0, frac{1}{2}) in (0, frac{1}{2}).

If (x_k = 0), by definition, either (x_{k-1} = 0) or (left{ frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} right} = 0), implying ( frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} ) is an integer, thus (x_{k-1}) is rational. - If (x_k neq 0), then (x_k) is given by: [ x_k = left{ frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} right} = frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} - leftlfloor frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} rightrfloor ] 4. **Back Substitution Method:** If (x_k) is rational, we write (x_k = frac{a}{b}) where (a, b ) are integers. From the definition: [ x_{k-1} = frac{p_k}{x_k + leftlfloor frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} rightrfloor } ] Replace (x_k) and the floor function, solve to conclude (x_{k-1}) is rational. 5. **Iterative Rationality:** It follows recursively that if one term (x_k) is rational, all preceding terms must also be rational. Specially, if (x_k = 0), then for some previous (j < k), (x_j neq 0) and eventually reaches (x_i = 0). 6. **Rationality of (x_0):** Now consider the term (x_0) itself can be written as: [ x_0 = frac{m}{n}, 0<m<n ] - Continuing the sequence: [ x_{k} = left{ frac{p_k}{frac{m}{n}} right} = left{ frac{n cdot p_k}{m} right} = frac{r}{m}, 0 < r < m ] Here (r) is the remainder when (n cdot p_k) is divided by (m). 7. **Eventually Reaching Zero:** Every non-zero term (x_k) reduces the denominator such that each iterative denominator is less than the previous, leading after a finite number to 0, enforcing the sequence must reach 0: ((m_0) > (m_1) > (m_2) > cdots = 0) 8. **Conclusion:** We have shown any (0 < x_0 < 1) being rational ensures the sequence will eventually contain zero.

Note that the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors of angle BAC, angle ABC, and angle BCA. Hence, the angles formed by the incenter I with vertices A, B, and C are as follows: [ angle AIB = 180^circ - frac{alpha + beta}{2} ] 3. Point S lies on the angle bisector of angle BAC and the perpendicular bisector of BC.

Point T lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC and the angle bisector of angle CBA: [ angle TCB = angle CBT = frac{beta}{2} ] 5. Next, we use the angle sum at point C. Since T and S are symmetric about the perpendicular bisector of BC, we get the summation: [ angle TCS = frac{alpha + beta}{2} ] 6. From the properties of a cyclic quadrilateral (which necessitate that opposite angles sum to 180^circ), we analyze the quadrilateral TISC.

Note that some subsets may generate the same edges (multiedges), but there cannot be any self-loops. 2. **Degree of Vertices**: Given that each element (e in mathcal{S}) appears in exactly (2k) subsets (S_i), each vertex in the graph (G) has a degree of (2k). Therefore, (G) is a (2k)-regular graph, meaning every vertex is connected by exactly (2k) edges. 3. **Eulerian Circuit**: A (2k)-regular graph is Eulerian because the degree of each vertex is even. By Euler's Circuit Theorem, an undirected graph is Eulerian if and only if every vertex has an even degree and the graph is connected. Since our (G) may have multiple connected components, consider each connected component of (G) separately. 4. **Connected Components**: Let (C) be any connected component of (G).

The proposition q states that for all x in mathbb{R}, ax^{2}+4x+a geq -2x^{2}+1. This can be rewritten as: [ left(a+2right)x^{2}+4x+a-1 geq 0 ] Let's consider two cases based on the value of a: **Case 1: a = -2** Substituting a = -2 into the inequality, we get: [ 4x - 3 geq 0 ] This inequality does not always hold for all x in mathbb{R}. For example, when x = 0, 4(0) - 3 = -3, which is not greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, a = -2 does not satisfy the proposition for all x in mathbb{R}. **Case 2: a neq -2** For the inequality to always hold, the quadratic function must either always be non-negative or the parabola opens upwards and its discriminant Delta leq 0 to ensure it does not cross the x-axis. This leads to two conditions: 1. a + 2 > 0, which simplifies to a > -2. 2. The discriminant Delta = 16 - 4(a+2)(a-1) leq 0. Solving the discriminant inequality for a, we get two possible ranges for a to ensure Delta leq 0: a leq -3 or a geq 2. Combining this with the first condition a > -2, we find that the only valid solution is a geq 2. **Conclusion:** For proposition q to be true, we found that a geq 2. Therefore, for proposition q to be false, a must be outside this range, which means a < 2. Hence, the range of real numbers a for which proposition q is false is: [ boxed{(-infty, 2)} ]"},{"instruction":"Jo adds up all the positive integers from 1 to 100.

What is the ratio of the percent increase in the units sold to the combined percent decrease of the original price, considering both the initial reduction and the additional discount for specific days and customers?","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. The company decreased the price of its main product by 20%. If the original price was ( P ), the new price after the decrease is ( P - 0.20P = 0.80P ). 2. The number of units sold increased such that the total revenue remained unchanged. This means that if the original number of units sold was ( U ), and the revenue was ( R = P times U ), the new number of units sold ( U' ) after the price decrease must satisfy ( 0.80P times U' = P times U ). Therefore, ( U' = frac{P times U}{0.80P} = frac{U}{0.80} = 1.25U ). This is a 25% increase in the number of units sold. 3. The company offers a further 10% discount on the product on weekends and for their loyalty customers. This means the price on weekends and for loyalty customers is ( 0.80P - 0.10 times 0.80P = 0.80P times (1 - 0.10) = 0.80P times 0.90 = 0.72P ). 4. The combined percent decrease of the original price considering both the initial reduction and the additional discount is from ( P ) to ( 0.72P ). This is a decrease of ( P - 0.72P = 0.28P ), which is a 28% decrease from the original price. 5. Now, we need to find the ratio of the percent increase in the units sold to the combined percent decrease of the original price. The percent increase in units sold is 25%, and the combined percent decrease in price is 28%. The ratio is ( frac{25%}{28%} = frac{25}{28} ). Simplifying the ratio, we get ( frac{25}{28} = frac{25 div 25}{28 div 25} = frac{1}{frac{28}{25}} = frac{1}{1.12} ).

We will denote the sum of all small triangle values as S and need to demonstrate that S is odd. 4. **Contribution from Interior Segments:** Each interior segment is shared between two small triangles, contributing twice to the sum. Hence, its sum would be an even number. 5. **Boundary Segments Contribution:** Each boundary segment is only shared by one small triangle. Thus, these will determine the odd/even nature. 6. **Odd-Even Analysis:** Summarize that since every boundary segment contributes 1 or 0 and interior segments contribute even numbers, if the boundary segments sum to an odd value, \`S\` is guaranteed to be odd. 7. **Summarize Interior and Boundary Contributions:** Since the triangle triangle ABC is divided and shares its segments among smaller triangles, the overall sum \`S\` includes an odd sum due to boundary segments.

Equal values would imply 0. 3. **Contributions of Directed Segments:** Analyzing small triangles: - If a triangle's orientation matches the original (A,B,C order), its internal segment value contributes positively. - If the orientation is reverse, its segment contributes negatively. 4. **Sum Analysis by Segments Orientation:** Demonstrate the total directional sum of values by reordering and mapping through smaller triangles, ensuring that the overall acted sum validates the initial orientation. 5. **Conclusion of Directional Contributions:** Since the total sum is a combination influenced by the boundary and matching small triangles in orientation, an assessment of individual contributions confirms that at least one small triangle retains the same orientation as triangle ABC.

Step-by-Step Construction: 1. **Identifying Points and Properties**: Let P and Q be the required points. By considering a homothety centered at B with a coefficient frac{AB}{BP} = frac{CB}{BQ}, the segment PQ will be transferred to AC, and point M will be transformed into a point N on AC. At this stage, angle ANC = angle PMQ = 90^circ. Hence, point N will lie on the semicircle with diameter AC (on the side opposite to triangle ABC). 2. **Construct Semicircle**: Draw a semicircle with diameter AC. Let N be the point where the line BM intersects this semicircle. 3. **Parallel Lines through M**: Draw two lines through point M parallel to AN and CN respectively. 4. **Finding Intersection Points**: The points where these lines intersect sides AB and BC will be points P and Q respectively. 5. **Verification**: By construction, angle ANC = 90^circ and since PQ runs parallel to AC, angle PMQ is also 90^circ. Additionally, due to the similarity of triangles BAN and BPM: [ frac{AB}{PB} = frac{NB}{MB}, ] and due to the similarity of triangles BCN and BQM: [ frac{CB}{QB} = frac{NB}{MB}. ] Therefore: [ frac{AB}{PB} = frac{CB}{QB}. ] Applying the Thales theorem, we confirm that PQ parallel AC.

Let (N) be the total number of candies in the box initially. After Míša's operations, one-third of the candies were left in the box, implying that ( frac{1}{3} N ) candies remain. 2. Since four columns were left, and this corresponds to one-third of (N), the box originally had ( 3 times 4 = 12 ) columns. 3. The number of candies per row is thus 12. 4. Before Míša's second reorganization, there were 24 candies arranged in three complete rows (since after removing candies from the incomplete fourth row, each row still had 12 candies). 5. When Míša filled five columns but one candy was missing, he had 25 candies initially filling those five columns. 6. Each column, therefore, had ( frac{25}{5} = 5 ) candies. 7.

Each row contains all integers from 1 to 25. Additionally, the table is symmetric with respect to the diagonal running from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. Step 2: State the Goal We need to prove that every number from 1 to 25 appears on this diagonal. Step 3: Assume the Contrary Assume that not all numbers from 1 to 25 appear on the diagonal. Let's suppose some number, say k, is missing from the diagonal. This means k appears solely above or solely below the diagonal due to the symmetry. Step 4: Use Symmetry Argument Because the table is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, if k is missing on the diagonal, then k must appear in pairs — once above and once mirrored below the diagonal. This pairing contradicts the setup since k should appear exactly once in each row due to the problem's conditions. Step 5: Collapse the Contradiction Let's formalize the contradiction: 1. Each row must contain k exactly once. 2. Each column must contain k exactly once (since each column also contains the integers from 1 to 25). 3. By symmetry, if k is above the diagonal in position (i, j), it should also appear below in position (j, i). This implies k is counted twice (above and below) per symmetry contrary to the unique appearance in each row and each column required by the problem. Step 6: Conclude Validity via Contradiction Since assuming the number missing from the diagonal leads to an inconsistency with the count of k, the initial assumption must be incorrect. Hence, all numbers from 1 to 25 must indeed appear on the diagonal. # Conclusion Thus, we conclude that on the diagonal running from the top-left to the bottom-right in this 25 times 25 table, all numbers from 1 to 25 must appear exactly once. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"f the average of 744, 745, 747, 748, 749, 752, 752, 753, 755 and x is some number, and the value of x is 755, what is the average of these numbers?","output":"To find the average of these numbers, we first need to add them all together and then divide by the number of values.

Thus, we have the inequality: 5 > 3 + sqrt{-b}, which simplifies to 2 > sqrt{-b} or 4 > -b. This implies that b > -4. Case 2 (one circle contained within the other): The distance between the centers of the circles is less than the absolute difference of their radii. This leads us to the inequality: 5 < |3 - sqrt{-b}|. This will give us two cases to consider: If sqrt{-b} > 3: 5 < sqrt{-b} - 3, (sqrt{-b} - 3)(sqrt{-b} + 3) > 5^2 - 3^2, -b - 9 > 16, -b > 25, b < -25. However, since we derived this from the assumption that sqrt{-b} > 3, and sqrt{25} = 5, the range from this case is actually b < -25 (not just b < -64 as the original solution states, since the circle with radius sqrt{-b} must have a greater radius than the circle with radius 5 to contain it and not intercept). If sqrt{-b} < 3: 5 < 3 - sqrt{-b}, 5 + sqrt{-b} < 3, sqrt{-b} < -2, which is impossible since sqrt{-b} is positive given that b is negative. Combining the two cases, the possible range for b is: -4 < b < 0 text{ or } b < -25. Therefore, we can conclude that b must be in the following range: [ boxed{-4 < b < 0 text{ or } b < -25.} ]"},{"instruction":"The tenth and twelfth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 15 and 21, respectively.

When we do not select two boys or two girls, we must be selecting one boy and one girl. 3. **Calculate the Probability of A cup B:** - The probability of event A (selecting two boys) is given as P(A) = frac{1}{3}. - The probability of event B (selecting two girls) is given as P(B) = frac{2}{15}. - Since A and B are mutually exclusive, P(A cup B) = P(A) + P(B). - Thus, P(A cup B) = frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{15} = frac{5}{15} + frac{2}{15} = frac{7}{15}. 4. **Find the Probability of C:** - Since A cup B and C are complementary, P(C) = 1 - P(A cup B). - Therefore, P(C) = 1 - frac{7}{15} = frac{15}{15} - frac{7}{15} = frac{8}{15}. Hence, the probability of selecting exactly one girl among the two selected students is boxed{frac{8}{15}}. **Analysis:** By defining the events and understanding their relationships, we utilized the concepts of mutually exclusive events and complementary events to find the required probability. This approach adheres closely to classical probability models and the fundamental principles of probability theory. **Review:** This problem serves as a basic application of classical probability models, highlighting the importance of identifying and understanding the relationships between different events, especially when dealing with mutually exclusive and complementary events."},{"instruction":"The slope of the secant line passing through two points on the curve (y=2^{x}), which are ((0,1)) and ((1,2)), is ______.","output":"Solution: According to the geometric meaning of the average rate of change, we know (k= dfrac{2-1}{1-0}=1).

There are (frac{100 - 3}{6} + 1 = 17) such numbers (every sixth number starting from 3). - For multiples of 5, (5, 15, 25, ..., 95) need to be removed.

Let's denote the 4-digit number by ( x ). According to the problem, the number ( x ) is 8802 less than the number formed by writing its digits in reverse order. 2. First, we define the number ( x ) in general form. For a 4-digit number ( x ), the form can be written as: [ x = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ] where ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) are the digits of the number ( x ), and ( a neq 0 ) because ( x ) is a 4-digit number. 3.

Simplify the equation: [ 999(a - d) = -8802 ] [ a - d = frac{-8802}{999} ] [ a - d = -9 ] 7. Since ( a ) and ( d ) are digits (0 through 9) and ( a neq 0 ), we need to find the integer solutions for ( a ) and ( d ). 8. From ( a - d = -9 ): [ a = d - 9 ] The only digit for ( a ) to be positive and be a valid digit (since ( a neq 0 )) is when ( a = 1 ) and ( d = 9 ). 9.

According to the given information, B is obtained by multiplying A by 9 and then adding 13. So, we can write B as: B = 9A + 13 Now, we want to find the remainder when B is divided by 9. To do this, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. When we divide a number by 9, the remainder is the same as the remainder of the sum of its digits divided by 9 (this is because 9 is a factor of 10^n - 1 for any positive integer n). However, in this case, we can simply look at the expression for B. Since 9A is a multiple of 9, it will not contribute to the remainder when B is divided by 9.

This implies the distance from O to each side of the n-gon is exactly r. 2. **Construction of a New n-Gon**: We will translate each side of the n-gon inward to contact the circle odot(O, r). This results in a new regular n-gon A_1'A_2'cdots A_n', where each vertex A_i' lies on the circle odot(O, r) (illustrated as Figure 1.5). 3. **Constructing and Proving Properties**: - Since the original n-gon A_1A_2cdots A_n and the new n-gon A_1'A_2'cdots A_n' have corresponding sides parallel, the corresponding angles are also equal. - Given that the angles in regular n-gon A_1A_2cdots A_n are all equal, the angles in the new n-gon A_1'A_2'cdots A_n' are also equal by parallelism. 4. **Verification**: - Since the new n-gon A_1'A_2'cdots A_n' inscribes the circle odot(O, r), we analyze the triangles formed, such as triangle OA_1'A_2' and triangle OA_1'A_n'. Notice the symmetry: - The angle properties reveal angle O A_{1}^{prime} A_{2}^{prime} = frac{1}{2} angle A_{n}^{prime} A_{1}^{prime} A_{2}^{prime}. This implies congruent triangles triangle OA_1'A_2' cong triangle OA_1'A_n' due to equal angles and radii being consistent (OA_1' = OA_2' = r). 5. **Consequence**: - Consequently, all sides A_1'A_2', A_2'A_3', cdots, A_{n-1}'A_n' of the newly formed n-gon A_1'A_2'cdots A_n' are equal. Thus, A_1'A_2' = A_2'A_3' = cdots = A_{n-1}'A_n'. 6. **Final Observation**: - The new regular n-gon A_1'A_2'cdots A_n' is entirely inscribed within the original n-gon A_1A_2cdots A_n, implying its area is smaller or equal to that of A_1A_2cdots A_n. Therefore, its side length is not greater than that of the original n-gon. **Conclusion**: The perimeters establish that the side length of the n-gon inscribing the circle odot(O, r) is the least, which completes the proof. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Let f(x) be a function defined on (0, +infty) such that for all x > 0, f(x) + xf'(x) > 0 and f(1) = 2.

Define the points and segments as follows: - Let ( K_1 ) be the midpoint of (AA_1). - Let ( K_2 ) be the midpoint of (BB_1). - Let ( K_3 ) be the midpoint of (CC_1). 2. Consider the cevians (AA_1), (BB_1), and (CC_1). These cevians intersect the opposite sides at (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1), respectively. 3. Suppose (M) is the midpoint of (AA_1), lying on the cevians (AA_1). Similarly, define midpoints (N) on (BB_1) and (O) on (CC_1). 4. In triangle (ABC): - The line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides (e.g., the midline) is parallel to the third side, and its length is half the length of the third side (Midpoint Theorem). 5.

This line would divide the plane into two half-planes. According to Dirichlet's principle, two vertices of the triangle (A), (B), and (C) must lie in one of these half-planes. 3. Without loss of generality, assume (A) and (B) are in the same half-plane. 4. The side (AB) connecting vertices (A) and (B) must therefore not intersect the hypothetical line. 5. However, if ( K_1 ), ( K_2 ), and ( K_3 ) are midpoints of cevians within triangle (ABC) and lie on this line, (AB) would have to intersect this line due to the construction of midpoints and the positions within the triangle. 6.

Sandy sells the scooter for 1260 and has a gain of 5%. How much did Sandy spend on repairs?","output":"First, let's find out how much Sandy's total cost was, including the purchase price and the repair costs. Since Sandy had a gain of 5%, the selling price (1260) is 105% of the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as C. Then we can write the following equation: 105% of C = 1260 To express 105% in decimal form, we divide 105 by 100, which gives us 1.05. Now we can rewrite the equation as: 1.05 * C = 1260 To find C, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.05: C = 1260 / 1.05 C = 1200 Now we know that the total cost (purchase price + repair costs) was 1200. Since Sandy bought the scooter for 900, we can find the repair costs by subtracting the purchase price from the total cost: Repair costs = Total cost - Purchase price Repair costs = 1200 - 900 Repair costs = 300 Sandy spent boxed{300} on repairs."},{"instruction":"Let x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{10} be a permutation of 1, 2, ldots, 10.

This is equivalent to saying that the function g(x) = ln x + 1 - 4ax has exactly two zero points, which is further equivalent to g'(x) having a unique extreme value that is not equal to 0 in the interval (0, +infty). g'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 4a = frac{1 - 4ax}{x}. 1. When a leqslant 0, g'(x) > 0, f'(x) is monotonically increasing, so g(x) = f'(x) has at most one zero point, which contradicts the given condition, so this case should be discarded. 2. When a > 0, setting g'(x) = 0 gives x = frac{1}{4a}. Since x in (0, frac{1}{4a}), g'(x) > 0, the function g(x) is monotonically increasing; when x in (frac{1}{4a}, +infty), g'(x) < 0, the function g(x) is monotonically decreasing. Therefore, x = frac{1}{4a} is the maximum point of the function g(x), so g(frac{1}{4a}) > 0, i.e., ln frac{1}{4a} + 1 - 1 = -ln(4a) > 0. Thus, ln(4a) < 0, which implies 0 < 4a < 1, i.e., 0 < a < frac{1}{4}. So when 0 < a < frac{1}{4}, g(x) = 0 has two roots x_1 and x_2, and x_1 < frac{1}{4a} < x_2. Also, g(1) = 1 - 4a > 0, so x_1 < 1 < frac{1}{4a} < x_2. Thus, the function f(x) is decreasing in the interval (0, x_1), increasing in the interval (x_1, x_2), and decreasing in the interval (x_2, +infty). Therefore, f(x_1) < f(1) = -2a < 0 and f(x_2) > f(1) = -2a > -frac{1}{2}. Hence, the answer is boxed{text{A}}. First, find f'(x), set f'(x) = 0, and obtain ln x = 4ax - 1 with two solutions x_1 and x_2. This is equivalent to the function g(x) = ln x + 1 - 4ax having exactly two zero points, which is further equivalent to g'(x) having a unique extreme value that is not equal to 0 in the interval (0, +infty). By using the relationship between the derivative and the extreme value of the function, the result can be obtained. This problem tests the method of using derivatives to study the extreme values of functions, the idea of classification and discussion, and requires reasoning and computational abilities, making it a difficult problem."},{"instruction":"Given that overrightarrow{i} and overrightarrow{j} are mutually perpendicular unit vectors, the vector overrightarrow{a_n} satisfies: overrightarrow{i} cdot overrightarrow{a_n} = n, overrightarrow{j} cdot overrightarrow{a_n} = 2n+1, (n in mathbb{N}^*).

Hence, overrightarrow{i} = (1, 0) and overrightarrow{j} = (0, 1). Let overrightarrow{a_n} = (x_n, y_n). Given that overrightarrow{i} cdot overrightarrow{a_n} = n and overrightarrow{j} cdot overrightarrow{a_n} = 2n + 1 for n in mathbb{N}^*, we infer that x_n = n and y_n = 2n + 1, which implies overrightarrow{a_n} = (n, 2n + 1). Since theta_n is the angle between overrightarrow{i} and overrightarrow{a_n}, we have: tan theta_n = frac{y_n}{x_n} = frac{2n + 1}{n} = 2 + frac{1}{n} As n increases, frac{1}{n} decreases, which implies that tan theta_n is a decreasing function of n. Consequently, theta_n decreases as n increases. Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{B}. By establishing a coordinate system along overrightarrow{i} and overrightarrow{j}, we translate the vector dot product into a coordinate representation, allowing us to determine tan theta_n and conclude based on the monotonicity of the function.

By adding these up, we find that the 15th number is the first number in the group of 5 odd numbers, which is boxed{25}. For the 2014th number, we note that the sequence alternates between even and odd groups. Each group's size increases by 1 each time, starting from 1. To find the group that contains the 2014th number, we need to sum the series of natural numbers until we exceed 2014. This sum can be represented by the formula frac{n(n+1)}{2}, where n is the number of terms. We are looking for the smallest n such that frac{n(n+1)}{2} geq 2014. However, since the sequence alternates between even and odd numbers, we must consider that the total count of numbers up to a certain point is the sum of two consecutive groups (one even, one odd) for our purposes. Therefore, we adjust our approach to find the specific group (even or odd) and its position within that group for the 2014th number. After calculating, we find that the 2014th number falls within a group of even numbers and is the last number in that group. By determining the starting number of that group and counting up to the 2014th position, we find that the 2014th number is boxed{3965}."},{"instruction":"The speed of a car is 90 km in the first hour and some km in the second hour.

Since the vectors sum to zero, they form a closed quadrilateral when laid out tip-to-tail.

The terms ( sin x cos y ), ( sin y cos z ), and ( sin z cos z ) can be interpreted as areas of right triangles formed by drawing vertical lines from each point to the x-axis.

Since all component geometric areas sum to less than the sector area they are bounded by, we conclude: [ frac{pi}{4} > sin x (cos x - cos y) + sin y (cos y - cos z) + sin z cos z, ] which confirms our required inequality: [ frac{pi}{4} + sin x cos y + sin y cos z > sin x cos x + sin y cos y + sin z cos z. ] Thus, the original inequality is proven.

From the given conditions:    - angle DYC = angle DCB    - angle DBZ = angle DBC 2. **Power of a Point:**    Using the Power of a Point Theorem, we can assert that point M, the midpoint of BC, lies on the radical axis of the two circumcircles (DBZ) and (DYC). The radical axis is also the locus of points with equal power with respect to those two circles. Thus:    - M and D both lie on the radical axis. 3. **Coordinate Connection:**    Since M is the midpoint of BC and A relates to segments BY and CZ. We use the condition given for D, M, and A being collinear:    - M lies on AM with AM being the median. 4. **Radical Axis Property:**    By the radical axis property:    - A must also lie on the radical axis of the circles omega and gamma.

Each box contains 30 highlighter pens, so in total, he has 12 * 30 = 360 highlighter pens. He rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each. Since each box has 30 highlighters, five boxes would have 5 * 30 = 150 highlighters. Dividing these into packages of six, he would have 150 / 6 = 25 packages. He sold these packages for 3 each, so from these packages, he earned 25 * 3 = 75. The rest of the highlighters, which were not packaged, amount to 360 (total highlighters) - 150 (packaged highlighters) = 210 highlighters. He sold these at the rate of three pens for 2.

Therefore, sin C = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}sin Bleft(sin Atimes frac{1}{2} + cos Atimes frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right). 5. Since C = pi - A - B, we have sin C = sin(A+B). Substituting this into the equation, we get sin(A+B) = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}sin Asin B + sin Bcos A. 6. Using the angle sum identity for sin(A+B), we have sin Acos B + cos Asin B = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}sin Asin B + sin Bcos A. 7. Simplifying, we find sin Acos B = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}sin Asin B, which implies tan B = sqrt{3}, given that sin A > 0. 8. Therefore, B = frac{pi}{3}. # Part (Ⅱ): Range of Possible Values for the Perimeter 1. Using the Law of Cosines for side b, we have b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2accos B. 2.

The profit is calculated as 35% of the original price, so we have: Profit = 0.35 * S The selling price is the sum of the original price and the profit, so: 550 = S + 0.35 * S 550 = S * (1 + 0.35) 550 = S * 1.35 Now, we solve for S: S = 550 / 1.35 S = 407.41 (approximately) 2. For the vintage painting: The selling price is 1500, and the profit is 50%. Let's denote the original price of the painting as P. Profit = 0.50 * P The selling price is the sum of the original price and the profit, so: 1500 = P + 0.50 * P 1500 = P * (1 + 0.50) 1500 = P * 1.50 Now, we solve for P: P = 1500 / 1.50 P = 1000 3. For the antique vase: The selling price is 1000, and the profit is 25%. Let's denote the original price of the vase as V. Profit = 0.25 * V The selling price is the sum of the original price and the profit, so: 1000 = V + 0.25 * V 1000 = V * (1 + 0.25) 1000 = V * 1.25 Now, we solve for V: V = 1000 / 1.25 V = 800 Finally, to find the total original price for all three items, we add the original prices of each item: Total original price = S + P + V Total original price = 407.41 + 1000 + 800 Total original price = 2207.41 (approximately) So, Jim originally paid approximately boxed{2207.41}  for all three items."},{"instruction":"Evaluate the expression sqrt{16  8sqrt{5}}  sqrt{16 + 8sqrt{5}}.

The intersection points are:    - (R) at the intersection of (AY) and (DX).    - (S) at the intersection of (BY) and (CX).

First, identify the key points and lines in the problem. The points (A) and (A_1) are symmetric with respect to the center (O) of the circle. The rays (AP) and (A_1P_1) are parallel (co-linear in direction), and so are the rays (AQ) and (A_1Q_1). 2. Denote the points (P), (P_1), (Q), and (Q_1) on the circumference of the circle. We need to show that the intersection of the lines (P_1Q) and (PQ_1) lies on the line (AA_1). 3. Let's extend the rays (PA) and (QA) to intersect the circle again at points (P_2) and (Q_2) respectively. Since (PA) and (QA) are radii, the lines (P_1P_2) and (Q_1Q_2) are diameters of the circle. This means that (P_2) and (Q_2) are opposite points on the circle with respect to (P) and (Q). 4. Now consider the hexagon formed by points (P, P_2, P_1, Q, Q_2, Q_1). We can apply Pascal's Theorem to this hexagon. Pascal's Theorem states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a conic (in this case, a circle), the pairs of opposite sides, when extended, meet in three points which are collinear. 5. In our hexagon (P, P_2, P_1, Q, Q_2, Q_1):     - The line through points (P) and (P_2) intersects the extension of line through points (Q) and (Q_2) at point (A).     - The line through points (P_1) and (P_2) intersects the line through points (Q_1) and (Q_2) at point (O).     - The line (P_1Q) and line (Q_1P), when extended, intersect at a point which Pascal's Theorem assures us lies on the line joining the other two intersection points. 6. Therefore, the intersection of the lines (P_1Q) and (PQ_1) must lie on the line passing through points (A) and (O), which simplifies to just line (AA_1) since points (A) and (A_1) are symmetric with respect to (O).

So, the daily profit from selling 5 posters is the total revenue minus the cost of producing the posters.

A line passing through ( O ) intersects ( odot P ) at points ( C ) and ( D ). A line passing through ( P ) intersects ( odot O ) at points ( E ) and ( F ). Prove that the circumcenter of quadrilateral ( CEDF ) lies on the line ( AB ), and that the lines ( AB ), ( CD ), and ( EF ) intersect at one point.  1. **Circumcenter of Quadrilateral ( CEDF )**:    - Let the circumcircle of quadrilateral ( CEDF ) be denoted as ( odot Q ). This means that points ( C, E, D, ) and ( F ) lie on circle ( Q ).     2. **Möbius Inversion Theorem**:     - The Möbius Inversion Theorem states that if four points ( C, E, D, ) and ( F ) lie on a circle, and if the lines ( CD ) and ( EF ) intersect at a point ( R ), then the circle through ( C, E, D, F ) has its center on the orthogonal circle passing through point ( R ). 3. **Intersection Point**:    - To prove that the lines ( AB ), ( CD ), and ( EF ) intersect at one point, we observe that due to the intersecting chords theorem, the radical axis of the circles ( odot O ) and ( odot P ) intersects the line ( AB ) at point ( K ). Hence, ( K ) is the radical center of the circles. 4. **Proof Details**:    - Let ( Q ) be the circumcenter of quadrilateral ( CEDF ). By the property of radical axes, it follows that the line ( AB ) is the radical axis of ( odot O ) and ( odot P ).    - Lines ( CD ) and ( EF ) passing through ( K ) implies that point ( K ) lies on both lines ( CD ) and ( EF ). Therefore, ( K ) is the common intersection point.    - Since point ( K ) lies on ( AB ), and considering the orthogonal circles’ properties, it follows that the circumcenter of ( CEDF ) must lie on the line ( AB ). # Conclusion [ boxed{A} ] Thus, by using the properties of the radical axis and the intersecting chords theorem, we have shown that the lines ( AB ), ( CD ), and ( EF ) intersect at one common point ( K ), and the circumcenter of quadrilateral ( CEDF ) lies on line ( AB )."},{"instruction":"the figure, PA is tangent to semicircle SAR, PB is tangent to semicircle RBT, and SRT is a straight line.

This is because the rotation of a point maintains its distance from the center, and since both (D) and (A) are vertices of the square, their corresponding rotations will lie on the perpendicular line segments (DK) and (AL). 3. **Orthogonality from Rotation**:     - Because (DK) maps to (AL) upon (90^circ) rotation, they are perpendicular. That is, (DK perp AL).     - Similarly, (DL) upon (90^circ) rotation maps to (CK), indicating (DL perp CK). 4. **Right Triangles in the Square**:     - Since (AL) and (CK) are perpendicular to (DK) and (DL), respectively, the lines (AL) and (CK) can be seen as extensions through the orthocenter property of the right triangle formed by triangle (DKL). 5. **Orthocenter Consideration**:     - In any triangle, the orthocenter is the intersection point of its three altitudes.     - Since (AL) and (CK) are perpendiculars from (D) in the context of the right triangle (DKL), the point (P) where these lines intersect acts as the orthocenter of (triangle DKL). 6. **Conclusion**:     - Since (P) is the orthocenter of (triangle DKL), the altitude from vertex (D) will be perpendicular to the base (KL).

Part 2: Conjecturing and proving the nth equation # Conjecture: The nth equation is conjectured to be: boxed{frac{n+1}{(n+1)^{2}-1}-frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)}=frac{1}{n+1}}. # Proof: Starting with the left side of the conjectured equation: 1. frac{n+1}{(n+1)^{2}-1}-frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} 2. =frac{n+1}{(n+1-1)(n+1+1)}-frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} (Expanding (n+1)^2-1) 3. =frac{n+1}{n(n+2)}-frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} (Simplifying the denominator) 4. =frac{(n+1)^2-1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} (Combining the fractions) 5. =frac{n^2+2n+1-1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} (Expanding (n+1)^2-1) 6. =frac{n(n+2)}{n(n+1)(n+2)} (Simplifying the numerator) 7. =frac{1}{n+1} (Simplifying the fraction) Thus, we have shown that boxed{frac{n+1}{(n+1)^{2}-1}-frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)}=frac{1}{n+1}} holds true, completing the proof."},{"instruction":"A sequence ( a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, ldots ) of positive integers satisfies ( a_{1} > 5 ) and ( a_{n+1} = 5 + 6 + cdots + a_{n} ) for all positive integers ( n ).

Using the sum of the arithmetic series from 5 to (a_n):    [    a_{n+1} = sum_{k=5}^{a_n} k = frac{(a_n - 4)(a_n + 5)}{2}    ]    This simplifies to:    [    a_{n+1} = frac{a_n(a_n + 1)}{2} - 10    ] 3. **Consideration for Odd Prime (p):**    Let (p > 2) be an odd prime. We will choose (a_1) such that (a_1 equiv -4 pmod{p}). This simplifies the congruence calculations for future terms in the sequence:    [    2a_2 equiv (-4 - 4)(-4 + 5) = -8 pmod{p}    ]    Since (p) is odd, we have:    [    a_2 equiv -4 pmod{p}    ] 4. **Induction Hypothesis:**    Assume for (a_n equiv -4 pmod{p}) for some (n):    [    a_{n+1} equiv frac{(-4)(-3)}{2} - 10 pmod{p}    ]    Which also implies:    [    2a_{n+1} equiv (-4 - 4)(-4 + 5) = -8 pmod{p}    ]    Thus, (a_{n+1} equiv -4 pmod{p}). 5. **Conclusion for Odd Primes:**    By induction, (a_n equiv -4 pmod{p}) for all (n), and specifically not (0 pmod{p}). Hence, the sequence need not contain a multiple of (p) if (p > 2). 6. **Consideration for Even Number:**    Now, we need to show the sequence must contain an even number regardless of (a_1). Assume (a_n) is odd for all (n). 7. **Expression for Differences:**    Calculating the difference between subsequent terms:    [    a_{n+1} - a_n = frac{a_n(a_n + 1)}{2} - frac{a_{n-1}(a_{n-1} + 1)}{2}    ]    Simplifies further to:    [    a_{n+1} - a_n = frac{(a_n - a_{n-1})(a_n + a_{n-1} + 1)}{2}    ] 8. **Evaluation of Parity:**    The term (a_n + a_{n-1} + 1) is odd by assumption. Observing the valuation of 2:    [    v_2(a_{n+1} - a_n) = v_2(a_n - a_{n-1}) - 1    ]    This implies a decrease each step.  9. **Contradiction:**    Eventually, we'd reach (v_2(a_N - a_{N-1}) = 0) which contradicts the even nature of (a_{n+1} - a_n). **Conclusion:** We have shown that for any odd prime (p > 2), the sequence need not contain a multiple of (p), and that the sequence must contain an even number.

Prove that points ( A, T, O ) are collinear.","output":"To prove that points ( A ), ( T ), and ( O ) are collinear, we proceed as follows: 1. **Identify Key Points and Angles:**    - Given that ( triangle ABC ) is acute.    - ( BE ) and ( CF ) are altitudes intersecting at the orthocenter ( H ).    - ( O ) is the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ).    - Point ( P ) is such that (angle APH = 90^{circ}) and (angle OPE = 90^{circ}).    - Point ( Q ) is such that (angle AQH = 90^{circ}) and (angle OQF = 90^{circ}). 2. **Show ( E, F, P, Q ) Configuration:**    - Notice that ( P ) lies on the circle with diameter ( AH ) because (angle APH = 90^{circ}).    - Similarly, ( Q ) lies on the circle with diameter ( AH ) because (angle AQH = 90^{circ}).    - ( P ) is also on the circle with diameter ( OE ) because (angle OPE = 90^{circ}).    - ( Q ) is also on the circle with diameter ( OF ) because (angle OQF = 90^{circ}). 3. **Define Radical Center:**    - The radical center ( T ) of three circles is the common point of intersection of their radical axes.    - The three circles in question are those with diameters ( OE ), ( OF ), and ( AH ). 4. **Determine the Radical Axes:**    - The radical axis of the circles with diameters ( OE ) and ( OF ) is the line containing points where the power of the point with respect to these circles is equal. This line is actually the line ( EF ), because ( EF ) is perpendicular to ( OH ) (as ( O ) and ( H ) are symmetric wrt ( EF )).    - The radical axis of the circles with diameters ( AH ) and ( OE ) is the line through their shared points ( P ) and any other point they share. 5. **Intersection at ( T ):**    - Point ( T ) lies on both radical axes mentioned previously. Hence, ( T ) lies on the radical axis of all three circles ((OE), (OF), (AH)). 6. **Conclusion on Collinearity:**    - Since point ( T ) must lie on the radical axis of circles ((OE)) and ((OF)), which is line ( EF ), and it must also intersect line ( AH ) (altitude from ( A )), ( T ) necessarily lies on both lines.    - Thus, point ( T ) must lie on the line passing through ( A ) and perpendicular from ( O ) to ( EF ).

We aim to find the largest possible m in terms of n. 2. **Upper bound for m**: If m geq (n+1)^2, then there would be at least n+1 perfect squares in the set {1, 2, 3, ldots, m}. Since we have only n subsets, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one subset would contain at least two perfect squares. The product of two perfect squares is a perfect square, which violates the condition. Therefore, m < (n+1)^2. 3. **Constructing the subsets**: We construct the subsets A_k = {k^2, k^2 + 1, ldots, k^2 + 2k} for k = 1, 2, ldots, n. This construction ensures that each subset A_k contains 2k + 1 elements, and the union of all A_k covers the set {1, 2, ldots, m} where m = n^2 + 2n. 4. **Verifying the construction**: We need to show that the product of any two different elements in the same subset A_k is not a perfect square. Consider two different elements k^2 + a and k^2 + b in A_k where 0 leq a < b leq 2k. 5. **Checking the product**: We calculate the product:    [    (k^2 + a)(k^2 + b) = k^4 + (a + b)k^2 + ab    ]    We need to show that this expression is not a perfect square. Suppose it is a perfect square, say (k^2 + a)(k^2 + b) = (k^2 + c)^2 for some integer c.

Let the endpoints of segments ( x ) and ( y ) from ( E ) and ( F ) be ( X ) and ( Y ), respectively. 2. The segment ( x ) is perpendicular to ( EF ) and line ( f ), so it is perpendicular to the plane of triangle ( EFY ). Thus, the volume ( V ) of the tetrahedron determined by the four points can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron. 3. Recall that the volume ( V ) of a tetrahedron with height ( h ) and base area ( A ) is given by:    [    V = frac{1}{3} cdot A cdot h    ] 4. Here, ( A ) is the area of triangle ( EFY ), and the height of the tetrahedron is the length ( x ), since ( X ) is perpendicularly upwards from the plane ( EFY ).        [    A = frac{1}{2} cdot EF cdot y    ] 5. Substituting the area ( A ) into the formula for the volume, we get:    [    V = frac{1}{3} cdot frac{1}{2} cdot EF cdot y cdot x    ] 6. Given that ( x cdot y = k^2 ):    [    V = frac{1}{6} cdot EF cdot x cdot y = frac{1}{6} cdot EF cdot k^2    ] 7. Since both ( EF ) and ( k ) are constants, the volume ( V ) of the tetrahedron is constant.    **Conclusion:**    The volume ( V ) of the tetrahedron is indeed constant as given by:    [    boxed{V = frac{1}{6} cdot EF cdot k^2}    ]  Part (b): 1. Since point ( E ) and ( F ) sees segment ( XY ) at right angles, points ( E ) and ( F ) lie on a sphere where ( XY ) is the diameter. This sphere is the circumcircle of the tetrahedron. 2. Using the Pythagorean theorem:    [    XY^2 = x^2 + EF^2 + y^2    ] 3. Since ( x cdot y = k^2 ), we reparametrize the expression:    [    XY^2 = x^2 + EF^2 + y^2 = (x - y)^2 + 2xy + EF^2    ] 4. Substituting ( x cdot y = k^2 ):    [    XY^2 = (x - y)^2 + 2k^2 + EF^2    ] 5. To minimize ( XY^2 ), the term ( (x - y)^2 ) should be minimized. This occurs when ( x - y = 0 ), i.e., ( x = y ). 6.

(2) The inequality (k-x)e^x-x-3<0 holds true for all x>0 if and only if k < x + frac{x+3}{e^x} also holds for all x>0. This can be rewritten as k < min left(x + frac{x+3}{e^x}right). Let h(x) = x + frac{x+3}{e^x} for x>0, So the derivative is h'(x) = 1 + frac{-x-2}{e^x} = frac{e^x - x - 2}{e^x}. Now let varphi(x) = e^x - x - 2. Then, varphi'(x) = e^x - 1 > 0 for x>0.

Since varphi(1) = e - 3 < 0 and varphileft(frac{3}{2}right) = e^{frac{3}{2}} - frac{7}{2} > 0, there must be an x_0 in left(1, frac{3}{2}right) such that varphi(x_0) = 0, meaning h(x) is decreasing on (1, x_0) and increasing on (x_0, +infty). Hence, the minimum of h(x) is h(x_0) = x_0 + frac{x_0 + 3}{e^{x_0}}. Given that varphi(x_0) = 0, we get e^{x_0} - x_0 - 2 = 0 or e^{x_0} = x_0 + 2.

Since ( a > 0 ), we can use the properties of convex functions. For a convex function, the sum of the function values is maximized when the arguments are as unequal as possible.

In our case, the sequence ( {k_1, k_2, ldots, k_r} ) must sum to ( k ). To maximize ( a^{k_1} + a^{k_2} + cdots + a^{k_r} ), we should choose ( k_1 = k - r + 1 ) and ( k_2 = k_3 = cdots = k_r = 1 ).

Here, ( nx + S = {nx + s : s in S} ). 2. **Hamel Basis:**    A Hamel basis (mathcal{H}) of (mathbb{R}/mathbb{Q}) is a basis of the vector space (mathbb{R}) over the field (mathbb{Q}). This means every real number can be uniquely expressed as a finite linear combination of elements of (mathcal{H}) with rational coefficients. 3. **Constructing the Set ( S ):**    Let ( S = bigoplus_{h in mathcal{H}} h mathbb{Z} ). This means ( S ) is the direct sum of the real numbers that are represented in the Hamel basis (mathcal{H}) with integer coefficients. Explicitly, each element ( s in S ) can be written as ( s = sum_{h in mathcal{H}} z_h h ) where ( z_h in mathbb{Z} ) and only finitely many ( z_h ) are non-zero. 4. **Verifying the Finiteness Condition:**    We need to show that for every real number ( x ), the set ( {nx + S : n in mathbb{N}} ) is finite. Consider any ( x in mathbb{R} ). Since (mathcal{H}) is a Hamel basis, ( x ) can be written as ( x = sum_{h in mathcal{H}} q_h h ) where ( q_h in mathbb{Q} ) and only finitely many ( q_h ) are non-zero. 5. **Analyzing ( nx + S ):**    For ( n in mathbb{N} ), consider ( nx + S ). Each element of ( nx + S ) is of the form ( nx + s ) where ( s in S ). Since ( s = sum_{h in mathcal{H}} z_h h ) with ( z_h in mathbb{Z} ), we have:    [    nx + s = n left( sum_{h in mathcal{H}} q_h h right) + sum_{h in mathcal{H}} z_h h = sum_{h in mathcal{H}} (n q_h + z_h) h    ]    Here, ( n q_h + z_h ) are rational numbers. 6. **Finiteness of ( {nx + S : n in mathbb{N}} ):**    Since ( q_h in mathbb{Q} ) and ( z_h in mathbb{Z} ), the expression ( n q_h + z_h ) can only take finitely many distinct values as ( n ) varies over (mathbb{N}). This is because for each ( h in mathcal{H} ), ( n q_h ) is a rational number and adding an integer ( z_h ) results in a finite set of possible values.

Let's denote the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C as a, b, and c respectively. 2. By applying the Law of Sines, we can express the given equation in terms of sides: a^{2}-b^{2}-c^{2}=bc. 3. Rearranging the equation gives us b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}=-bc. 4. Applying the Law of Cosines for angle A, we get cos A = frac{b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}}{2bc} = -frac{1}{2}. 5. Since 0 < A < pi, the only value of A that satisfies cos A = -frac{1}{2} is A = frac{2pi}{3}. Therefore, the value of A is boxed{frac{2pi}{3}}. **Part (2): Finding the maximum perimeter of triangle ABC** Given that BC = 3, we need to find the maximum perimeter of triangle ABC. 1.

By the Law of Sines, frac{3}{sinfrac{2pi}{3}} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} = 2sqrt{3}. 4. This gives us b = 2sqrt{3}sin (frac{pi}{6}-d) and c = 2sqrt{3}sin (frac{pi}{6}+d). 5. The perimeter of triangle ABC is then a+b+c = 3 + 2sqrt{3}[sin (frac{pi}{6}-d) + sin (frac{pi}{6}+d)] = 3 + 2sqrt{3}cos d. 6. The perimeter reaches its maximum when d = 0, i.e., B = C = frac{pi}{6}, giving a maximum perimeter of 3 + 2sqrt{3}. 7.

Step 2: Consider the divisibility condition We hypothesize that m-1 must divide 2010 for the equation to hold. This is because if we consider the simplest case where all x_k = 0 for k geq 1, then the sum becomes 2011, and we need m^{x_0} = 2011. However, this is not generally a power of m. We need to adjust the powers x_k such that the sum on the right-hand side still forms a power of m.  Step 3: Construct a solution when m-1 mid 2010 Suppose m-1 divides 2010. We can write 2010 = (m-1)q for some integer q. We aim to construct the powers x_k such that the sum forms a geometric series which results in a power of m.  We set x_0 = q+1 and choose x_k such that: - x_k = 0 for k = 1 to m, - x_k = 1 for k = m+1 to 2m-1, - x_k = 2 for k = 2m to 3m-2, - and so on, up to x_k = q for k = qm to (q+1)m - 1. This construction ensures that: [ m^{x_0} = m^{q+1} = 1 cdot m^{q+1} + (m-1) cdot m^q + (m-1) cdot m^{q-1} + cdots + (m-1) cdot m^1 + (m-1) cdot m^0. ] This is a geometric series summing to m^{q+1}, which matches m^{x_0}.  Step 4: Count the number of valid m Since m-1 must divide 2010, we count the divisors of 2010. Factoring 2010 gives: [ 2010 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 67. ] The number of divisors of 2010 is given by multiplying the incremented counts of each prime factor: [ (1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2^4 = 16. ]  Conclusion Thus, there are boxed{16} positive integers m for which the given equation has solutions in nonnegative integers x_0, x_1, dots, x_{2011}."},{"instruction":"Find the projection of begin{pmatrix} 2  3  4 end{pmatrix} onto the plane x + 2y  z = 0.","output":"Let P be the plane x + 2y - z = 0.

This function is even because it remains unchanged when x is replaced by -x, due to the absolute value. Furthermore, because -3^{|x|} is monotonically increasing on the interval (-infty,0) (as the exponent |x| increases negatively, the value of 3^{|x|} decreases, making -3^{|x|} increase), we should look for a function that is both even and increasing on the interval (-infty,0). Now, let's examine the options: - Option A: The function y=1-x^2 is a downward opening parabola, which is even because it is symmetric about the y-axis. On the interval (-infty,0), as x decreases, x^2 increases, which means that 1-x^2 increases; therefore, it is increasing on this interval. Thus, option A meets both requirements. - Option B: The function y=log_{2}|x| is even as well due to the absolute value. However, as x approaches 0 from the left, |x| decreases and thus log_{2}|x| decreases, making it a decreasing function on (-infty,0). So option B does not satisfy the criterion of monotonicity. - Option C: The function y=-frac{1}{x} is an odd function, which doesn't match the parity of the given function. It is also decreasing on (-∞,0) as x decreases, so option C does not satisfy either criterion. - Option D: The function y=x^3-1 is neither odd nor even. Furthermore, it is increasing on (-infty,0), but since it does not meet the parity requirement, it doesn't qualify.

By similarity, the corresponding side ratios of these triangles are equal: [ frac{CC'}{OC} = frac{AB}{OA} = frac{DD'}{OD} ] **Step 2: Expressing Reciprocal Values in Terms of Ratios** Using the similarity relationship, express the reciprocals: [ frac{1}{OA} = frac{2}{AB()} ] **Step 3: Transformation and Substitution** Express the required sum in terms of these ratios: [ frac{1}{OC} + frac{1}{OD} = left(frac{CC'}{OC}right) left(frac{AB}{CC'}right) + left(frac{DD'}{OD}right) left(frac{AB}{DD'}right) ] Simplifying the above expressions, we obtain: [ frac{1}{OC} + frac{1}{OD} = frac{AB}{OC} + frac{AB}{OD} = frac{2}{OA} ] This concludes that: [ frac{1}{a_{1}} + frac{1}{b_{1}} = frac{1}{a_{2}} + frac{1}{b_{2}} ] # Conclusion: By establishing the relationships between the segments and using similar triangles' properties, we have shown the necessary equality: [ boxed{frac{1}{a_{1}} + frac{1}{b_{1}} = frac{1}{a_{2}} + frac{1}{b_{2}}} ]"},{"instruction":"A calculator has a button that replaces the displayed entry with its square, another that replaces it with its reciprocal, and a third that replaces it with its square root.

Let the center of the moving circle be (C(x,y)) with a radius of (r). Since circle (E) is tangent to the line (y= -dfrac {1}{2}), we have (d=r), which implies (y+ dfrac {1}{2}=r). Since circle (C) is externally tangent to circle (E), we have (|CE|= dfrac {1}{2}+r), which implies (sqrt {x^{2}+(y-1)^{2}}= dfrac {1}{2}+r). By combining the equations and eliminating (r), we obtain (x^{2}=4y). Therefore, the trajectory (Gamma) of point (C) is a parabola with focus (E(0,1)) and directrix (y=-1). ((2)) It is known that the slope of line (AB) exists. Without loss of generality, let the equation of line (AB) be (y=kx+b).

Let (A(x_{1},y_{1})) and (B(x_{2},y_{2})), then (x_{1}+x_{2}=4k) and (x_{1}x_{2}=-4b). From the equation of the parabola, we have (y= dfrac {1}{4}x^{2}), thus (y'= dfrac {1}{2}x). Therefore, the tangent line to the parabola passing through (A(x_{1},y_{1})) is (y-y_{1}= dfrac {1}{2}x_{1}(x-x_{1})), and substituting (y_{1}= dfrac {1}{4}x_{1}^{2}) we get (y= dfrac {1}{2}x_{1}x- dfrac {1}{4}x_{1}^{2}). Since the tangent passes through (P(m,-4)), substituting and rearranging gives (x_{1}^{2}-2mx_{1}-16=0), similarly, we get (x_{2}^{2}-2mx_{2}-16=0). Therefore, (x_{1}) and (x_{2}) are the roots of the equation (x^{2}-2mx-16=0), thus (x_{1}+x_{2}=2m) and (x_{1}x_{2}=-16). From this, we get (x_{1}x_{2}=-4b=-16) and (x_{1}+x_{2}=4k=2m).

Since a full rotation is 360^circ, rolling a distance equal to the circumference of the coin (1 full revolution) would rotate it by 360^circ. However, important to understand the initial rotation angle or fractional turn based on the distance involved.    We note that after rolling from P to Q, the coin has rotated 270^circ clockwise.        - One way to visualize this is to place the initial orientation where mathrm{F} is upright.    - After rolling the distance PQ, the mathrm{F} on the face of the coin (initially upright) rotates 270^circ clockwise.

This position is as if the coin had almost completed a full turn but stopped 90^circ less than one complete turn.     3. **Second Rotation (From Q to R)**: Given that QR = PQ, the further rotation from Q to R would be identical due to the same distance rolled.    - Executing the same second rotation of 270^circ:      [      270^circ + 270^circ = 540^circ      ]    - We further simplify this combined rotation.      - A full circle is 360^circ, hence:        [        540^circ = 360^circ + 180^circ        ]      - This means the coin completes one full circle (which brings it back to the initial orientation) and continues to rotate by an additional 180^circ.      - The initial F upright ends in the inverted position because of the extra 180^circ. **Conclusion**: Therefore, when the coin reaches R, the orientation of the coin will have the mathrm{F} rotated to appear as if turned further 180^circ, which is equivalent to its inverted position.

We aim to prove that any number with an odd number of digits can be reduced by removing one digit to form a fair number. 3. **Basis Step:**    For the base case (m=1), consider a 3-digit number:    - Always possible to remove one digit such that the remaining two digits have the same parity. This step ensures the number becomes fair. 4. **Inductive Step:**    Assume that the statement holds true for an odd number of digits 2m-1 (where m geq 2).    Suppose we have a number with 2m+1 digits. We need to find a way to make it fair by removing one digit.        Divide the number into parts such that:    - Add two consecutive digits with the same parity.    - Alternatively, add one digit at the start, and one at the end, both having the same parity.    By doing this, even after modifications, the 2m-digit resultant number will still be fair. 5. **Conclusion:**    Because 2m-1 was assumed to be fair by the inductive hypothesis, by following the steps:    - Remove a digit to get a 2m-digit number, making it fair.    - Restore the digits temporarily removed; the 2m+2-digit number remains fair. Thus, for any given number with an odd number of digits, it is always possible to remove a digit such that the remaining number is fair. Hence, it ensures the parity condition of sevens on even and odd positions. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"f a>1 and b>2, then the statement a+b>3 is ( ) A.

We claim that the polynomial  [ f(x, y, z) = (x+y+z)(-x+y+z)(x-y+z)(x+y-z) ] satisfies this requirement. 1. **Transformation:**    We first rewrite ( f(x, y, z) ) to its expanded form:    [    f(x, y, z) = 2x^2 y^2 + 2x^2 z^2 + 2y^2 z^2 - x^4 - y^4 - z^4    ]    This polynomial does not change its value if ( x, y, z ) are replaced by their absolute values. It is symmetric and depends only on their magnitudes, so it is sufficient to consider non-negative ( x, y, z ). 2. **Positive Condition:**    We need to show that for non-negative ( x, y, z ), ( f(x, y, z) > 0 ) if and only if ( x, y, z ) can form the sides of a triangle.    - If ( x, y, z ) are the sides of a triangle:      We know that for a triangle with sides ( x, y, z ):      [      x > 0, ; y > 0, ; z > 0      ]      and the triangle inequalities:      [      x + y > z, ; x + z > y, ; y + z > x      ]      The polynomial ( f(x, y, z) ) has factors ( (x+y+z), (-x+y+z), (x-y+z), (x+y-z) ). Each of these factors will be positive if ( x, y, z ) satisfy the triangle inequalities, thus:      [      f(x, y, z) = (x+y+z)(-x+y+z)(x-y+z)(x+y-z) > 0      ]    - If ( f(x, y, z) > 0 ):      Conversely, if ( f(x, y, z) > 0 ), we need to show that ( x, y, z ) can form the sides of a triangle.

The fourth factor ( x+y-z ) could be the critical one. Since ( f(x, y, z) > 0 ), it ensures that:      [      x+y > z implies x+y-z > 0      ]      All four factors must be positive for ( f(x, y, z) > 0 ) to hold. Therefore, ( x, y, z ) must fulfill the triangle inequalities, and none of ( x, y, z ) can be zero. 3. **Heron's Formula Connection:**    It is also noted that in Heron's formula, the expression under the square root:    [    t = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = sqrt{frac{1}{16} f(a, b, c)}    ]    demonstrates that ( f ) is essentially the Heron's polynomial multiplied by a constant factor.

Calculate the volumes of the cubes:    - Volume of cube 甲 (type A):     [     V_A = a^3 = 1^3 = 1     ]    - Volume of cube 乙 (type B):     [     V_B = b^3 = 2^3 = 8     ]    - Volume of cube 丙 (type C):     [     V_C = c^3 = 3^3 = 27     ] 5. The problem requires us to form a larger cube using these smaller cubes, ensuring that the total volume of the larger cube is at least the sum of the volumes of the smallest possible combination that includes at least one of each type of cube.    - Sum of the smallest possible volumes:     [     V_{text{total}} = V_A + V_B + V_C = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36     ] 6. Determine the side length of the smallest cube that can fully contain these smaller cubes. Since the cube needs to have sides that can accommodate the largest cube with minimal additional space, add the side lengths:    [    L_{text{total side length}} = a + b = 1 + 2 = 3 quad text{(maximum side of cube 丙 included)}    ] 7. Check if 3 times 3 is enough to accommodate both side-lengths, considering blocks might need gaps:     - Corrected calculation for side-length accommodating all needs results in:     [     L = b + c = 2 + 3 = 5     ] 8. Calculate the volume of the smallest cube that fully contains this volume:     [     V_{text{large cube}} = L^3 = 5^3 = 125     ] 9. Arrange within the largest cube:    - Use one cube 丙, yielding a remaining volume:      [     125 - 27 = 98     ]    - Fit as many cubes 乙:     [     V_{text{remaining}} = 98 - 8 times 7 = 98 - 56 = 42     ] 10. Fit cubes 甲:     [     42 cubes 甲, due minimum volume left if each type used at least once.     ] 11.

All pieces are of the same color.","output":"To determine the number of ways to place two identical pieces on a chessboard such that they do not threaten each other, we need to consider the specific movements and attacking patterns of each piece. Let's go through the scenarios individually.  a) Two Rooks Rooks can move any number of squares vertically or horizontally. Therefore, two rooks do not threaten each other if and only if they are not on the same row or the same column. 1. A rook can be placed in any of the 64 squares. 2. To avoid threats, the second rook must be placed in one of the remaining 63 squares, excluding those in the same row or column as the first rook. 3. This leaves (7 times 7) (49) valid positions for the second rook. Thus, the total number of placements: [ text{Total} = 64 times 49 ] Since the rooks are identical, each arrangement is counted twice, so we divide by 2: [ text{Unique arrangements} = frac{64 times 49}{2} = 1568 ]  b) Two Kings Kings can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). 1. A king can be placed in any of the 64 squares. 2. The second king must avoid the 8 surrounding squares to avoid threatening the first king. This scenario is more complex and requires a detailed solution: [ text{Total arrangements} =  frac{4 times 60 + 24 times 58 + 36 times 55 + 24 times 55 + 4 times 50}{2} = 1806 ]  c) Two Bishops Bishops move diagonally any number of squares: 1. If the first bishop is placed on a dark square, the second must be on a light square, and vice versa. 2. There are 32 dark squares and 32 light squares. Including the patterns of attacking, the total number of placements can be calculated as: [ text{Total arrangements} = frac{28 times 5^2 + 20 times 54 + 12 times 52 + 4 times 50}{2} = 1736 ]  d) Two Knights Knights move in an 'L' shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or vice versa. 1. A knight can jump to up to 8 positions. 2. Careful counting must be done to avoid overlaps. This results in: [ text{Total arrangements} = frac{4 times 61 + 8 times 60 + 20 times 59 + 16 times 57 + 15 times 55}{2} = 1848 ]  e) Two Queens Queens can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The complexity is similar to the rooks’ movement but includes diagonal moves: [ text{Total arrangements} = frac{28 times 42 + 20 times 40 + 12 times 38 + 4 times 36}{2} = 1288 ] # Conclusion Thus, the number of unique non-threatening arrangements for each type of piece are: - (a) Two rooks: (boxed{1568}) - (b) Two kings: (boxed{1806}) - (c) Two bishops: (boxed{1736}) - (d) Two knights: (boxed{1848}) - (e) Two queens: (boxed{1288})"},{"instruction":"the nondecreasing sequence of odd integers (left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, dotsright)=(1,3,3,5,5,5,5,5, dots)), each positive odd number (k) appears (k) times.

For example: - (1) appears 1 time, - (3) appears 3 times, - (5) appears 5 times, and so on. We can group the terms of the sequence such that each group contains the mode and frequency of the sequence. These groups are: [ (1), (3,3,3), (5,5,5,5,5), ldots ] Note the lengths of these groups: - The 1st group has (1) element. - The 2nd group has (3) elements. - The 3rd group has (5) elements. - In general, the (k)-th group has (2k-1) elements. Next, we determine how the index (n) maps to these groups. We recognize: - The 1st group contains (1 = 1^2) element. - The first two groups together contain (1 + 3 = 4 = 2^2) elements. - The first three groups together contain (1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3^2) elements. Hence, the cumulative count of sequence elements up to the (k)-th group is (k^2). Therefore, for any (n) that lies between ((k-1)^2 < n leq k^2), the element (a_n) belongs to the (k)-th group (since the total number of elements up to the (k-1)-th group is ((k-1)^2)). Thus,  [  (k-1)^2 < n leq k^2 text{ is equivalent to } k-1 < sqrt{n} leq k  ] and [  k = leftlfloor sqrt{n} rightrfloor + 1  ] The value of (a_n) in the (k)-th group is (2k - 1).

What percent of the second batch of coffee is decaffeinated?","output":"Let's start by calculating the amount of decaffeinated coffee in the initial stock. The grocer has 400 pounds of coffee, and 20 percent of it is decaffeinated. So, the amount of decaffeinated coffee in the initial stock is: 20% of 400 pounds = 0.20 * 400 = 80 pounds Now, the grocer buys another 100 pounds of coffee. Let's call the percent of decaffeinated coffee in the second batch x. So, the amount of decaffeinated coffee in the second batch is: x% of 100 pounds = x/100 * 100 = x pounds After the purchase, the total weight of the coffee stock is 400 + 100 = 500 pounds. According to the information given, 26 percent of the total stock is decaffeinated. So, the total amount of decaffeinated coffee in the stock is: 26% of 500 pounds = 0.26 * 500 = 130 pounds We know that the total amount of decaffeinated coffee is the sum of the decaffeinated coffee from the initial stock and the second batch. So, we can write the equation: 80 pounds (from initial stock) + x pounds (from second batch) = 130 pounds (total decaffeinated) Now, we can solve for x: 80 + x = 130 x = 130 - 80 x = 50 So, the second batch contains 50 pounds of decaffeinated coffee. To find the percent of decaffeinated coffee in the second batch, we divide the amount of decaffeinated coffee by the total weight of the second batch and multiply by 100: (50 pounds / 100 pounds) * 100 = 50% Therefore, boxed{50}  percent of the second batch of coffee is decaffeinated."},{"instruction":"The equation x^2  mx + n = 0 has two positive roots is a condition for the curve of the equation mx^2 + ny^2 = 1 is an ellipse.

The coefficient of x, which is -m, must be negative to ensure that the roots are positive when plotted on a graph, thus m > 0. 3. The constant term n must also be positive to ensure that the roots are positive; hence, n > 0. For the curve mx^2 + ny^2 = 1 to be an ellipse, the coefficients m and n must be positive and not equal to each other. So we have: 1. Both m and n have to be positive, m > 0 and n > 0. 2. The coefficients m and n should not be equal, m neq n (However, this is not a necessary condition for an ellipse; an ellipse can have m = n if it is a circle). Now, comparing the conditions, it is not true that the conditions for the quadratic equation to have two positive roots can deduce the curve being an ellipse since the latter does not require m neq n. Conversely, the conditions for the curve being an ellipse do not guarantee the quadratic equation has two positive roots because they do not satisfy the discriminant condition.

From the information above, we see that there is an inconsistency between the production rates of gadgets and gizmos per worker per hour. However, let's assume a reasonable correction: If 100 workers produce 600 gadgets in three hours, each hour they produce ( frac{600}{3} = 200 ) gadgets, which means each worker produces ( frac{200}{100} = 2 ) gadgets per hour.

For two rolls, this probability is frac{2}{3} times frac{2}{3} = frac{4}{9}. To compare it directly with the fair die, we can express frac{4}{9} as frac{16}{36} since frac{4}{9} = frac{16}{36}. 3. **Determine the relative likelihood of choosing each die given two sixes were rolled:**    - Given that two sixes were rolled, it is 16 times more likely that Charles was using the biased die than the fair die.

Analyzing the structure, we observe there are 5 squares in the pattern, and the sums of the numbers placed along the sides of these squares are required to be equal.  3. Considering the placement of 24 numbers at different points such that each point is shared by multiple squares, we proceed by examining the adjacency and overlap. Each number will therefore contribute to the side sum of two squares. 4. Suppose the common sum for the sides of each square is denoted as ( A ). 5. The sum of the 24 consecutive natural numbers can be calculated as follows: [ sum_{k=0}^{23} (a+k) = sum_{k=0}^{23} a + sum_{k=0}^{23} k = 24a + sum_{k=0}^{23} k ] Using the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers: [ sum_{k=0}^{23} k = frac{23 cdot 24}{2} = 276 ] Thus, the sum of these numbers is: [ 24a + 276 ] 6. Now, since every number will be used twice (once in each adjacent square), we set up the equation: [ 2 times (24a + 276) = 48a + 552 ] 7. There are 5 squares, and so the sums of the sides must equal ( 5A ). Therefore: [ 48a + 552 = 5A ] 8.

Substituting ( a = 5b + 1 ) into our earlier equation: [ 48a + 552 = 48(5b + 1) + 552 = 240b + 48 + 552 = 240b + 600 ] So: [ 5A = 240b + 600 ] [ A = 48b + 120 ] 10.

Comparing with ( A = 48b + 120 ): [ 80b + 136 > 48b + 120 ] Clearly: [ 80b + 136 > 48b + 120 ] Thus, the minimal sum exceeds ( A ). # Conclusion: It is impossible to place the 24 consecutive natural numbers in such a way on the points of the squares such that the sum of the numbers on each side of all squares is equal.

For b_2, we calculate using the recursive relation: a_2 = frac{2 cdot 2}{1} cdot a_1 = 4 cdot 1 = 4, so b_2 = frac{a_2}{2} = frac{4}{2} = 2. For b_3, we also use the recursive relation: a_3 = frac{3 cdot 2}{2} cdot a_2 = 3 cdot 2 = 6, which leads to b_3 = frac{a_3}{3} = frac{6}{3} = 2. Thus, we get b_1=1, b_2=2, and b_3=4. (2) To determine if {b_n} is a geometric sequence, we need to check if each term is a constant multiple of the previous term, i.e., if the ratio frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} is constant. Since a_{n+1} = frac{2(n+1)}{n} cdot a_n, we have: frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = frac{frac{a_{n+1}}{n+1}}{frac{a_n}{n}} = frac{frac{2(n+1)}{n} cdot a_n}{n+1} cdot frac{n}{a_n} = 2. This shows that the ratio between successive terms is indeed constant and equals 2. Hence, {b_n} is a geometric sequence with the first term b_1=1 and common ratio 2. (3) Since {b_n} is a geometric sequence, its general formula is b_n = 2^{n-1} (since b_1=1 and the ratio is 2).

Therefore, taking the natural logarithm on both sides, we get ln left(frac{21}{20}right)^{2} gt ln frac{11}{10}. This simplifies to 2ln frac{21}{20} gt ln frac{11}{10}, which means a gt b.  **Step 2: Compare b and c** Consider the function f(x)=ln (1+x)-sqrt{1+2x}+1 for 0 < x < 1. We know that 1+x=sqrt{(1+x)^{2}}=sqrt{1+2x+x^{2}} gt sqrt{1+2x}, which implies that the derivative of f(x), {f'}(x)=frac{1}{1+x}-frac{1}{sqrt{1+2x}}, is less than 0.

This representation is called the Zeckendorf representation. 2. **Binary Representation**:    We can associate each set ( S ) with a binary string where the ( k )-th bit is 1 if ( F_k ) is included in the sum and 0 otherwise. For example, the set ( {F_4, F_3, F_1} ) corresponds to the binary string ( 1101 ). 3. **Counting Valid Representations**:    The problem requires us to count the number of valid binary strings (Zeckendorf representations) that sum to ( n ). Each valid binary string must not have consecutive 1s, as this would violate the non-consecutive condition of Zeckendorf's theorem. 4. **Recursive Formula**:    Let ( a_n ) be the number of valid sets ( S ) such that the sum of the Fibonacci numbers indexed by ( S ) equals ( n ). We need to find the largest ( n ) such that ( a_n = 2020 ). 5. **Generating Function Approach**:    The number of ways to write ( n ) as a sum of distinct, non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers can be found using a generating function approach. The generating function for the Fibonacci sequence is:    [    G(x) = sum_{k=0}^{infty} F_k x^k = frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}    ]    However, we need to count the number of ways to form ( n ) using distinct Fibonacci numbers, which is more complex. 6. **Binary String Length**:    The length of the binary string corresponding to the Zeckendorf representation of ( n ) is related to the Fibonacci numbers. The maximal length of such a string with ( 2020 ) valid representations is ( 2 times 2020 - 1 = 4039 ). 7. **Largest ( n )**:    The largest ( n ) such that ( a_n = 2020 ) corresponds to the sum of the first 2020 Fibonacci numbers.

We aim to find lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{S_{n}}{S_{n-1}}. 1. **Expressing the partial sum S_n:**    The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series left{a_{n}right} with initial term a_1 and common ratio p is:    [    sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_{1} p^{i} = a_{1} frac{p^{n} - 1}{p - 1}    ]    Similarly, for the series left{b_{n}right}:    [    sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b_{1} q^{i} = b_{1} frac{q^{n} - 1}{q - 1}    ]    Therefore, the partial sum S_n of the series left{c_{n}right} is:    [    S_{n} = a_{1} frac{p^{n} - 1}{p - 1} + b_{1} frac{q^{n} - 1}{q - 1}    ] 2. **Deriving the limit of the ratio frac{S_n}{S_{n-1}}:**    We need to compute:    [    frac{S_{n}}{S_{n-1}} = frac{a_{1} frac{p^{n} - 1}{p - 1} + b_{1} frac{q^{n} - 1}{q - 1}}{a_{1} frac{p^{n-1} - 1}{p - 1} + b_{1} frac{q^{n-1} - 1}{q - 1}}    ] 3. **Analyzing the expression under the limit as n to infty:**    - **Case 1: p > 1**      As n rightarrow infty, we know from exponential properties:      [      lim_{n rightarrow infty}left(frac{1}{p}right)^n = 0 quad text{and} quad lim_{n rightarrow infty}left(frac{q}{p}right)^n = 0 quad (text{since } 0 < frac{q}{p} < 1)      ]      Thus:      [      lim_{n rightarrow infty} frac{S_{n}}{S_{n-1}} = lim_{n rightarrow infty} frac{p^{n}left[a_{1}(q - 1)left(1 - frac{1}{p^{n}}right) + b_{1}(p - 1)left(frac{q^{n}}{p^{n}} - frac{1}{p^{n}}right)right]}{p^{n-1}left[a_{1}(q - 1)left(1 - frac{1}{p^{n-1}}right) + b_{1}(p - 1)left(frac{q^{n-1}}{p^{n-1}} - frac{1}{p^{n-1}}right)right]}      ]      Simplifying and removing negligible terms:      [      = p lim_{n rightarrow infty} frac{a_{1}(q-1) + frac{b_{1}(p-1)q^{n}}{p^{n}}}{a_{1}(q-1)} = p      ]    - **Case 2: p < 1**      Here, 0 < q < p < 1, thus:      [      lim_{n rightarrow infty} p^{n} = 0 quad text{and} quad lim_{n rightarrow infty} q^{n} = 0      ]      Therefore:      [      lim_{n rightarrow infty} frac{S_{n}}{S_{n-1}} = lim_{n rightarrow infty} frac{a_{1}(q-1)left(p^{n} - 1right) + b_{1}(p-1)left(q^{n} - 1right)}{a_{1}(q-1)left(p^{n-1} - 1right) + b_{1}(p-1)left(q^{n-1} - 1right)}      ]      Simplifying and removing negligible terms:      [      = frac{-a_{1}(q - 1) - b_{1}(p - 1)}{-a_{1}(q - 1) - b_{1}(p - 1)} = 1      ] # Conclusion: The value of lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{S_{n}}{S_{n-1}} depends on the value of p: - If p > 1, then lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{S_{n}}{S_{n-1}} = p. - If p < 1, then lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{S_{n}}{S_{n-1}} = 1.
