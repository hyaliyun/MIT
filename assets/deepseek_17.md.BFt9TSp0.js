What do I do?","output":"Over the years, I have not been able to continually progress in the gym. Here are some things that can speed up my grades and help me build and maintain lean and strong muscles (185 lbs 11% fat at age 6). photo:quora.com 1. Keep track of everything If you go to the gym to exercise without recording the number of repetitions you have completed, the weight you are using, and the time you rest, it will hamper your progress and stifle your gains. Each week, your goal should be to gain some weight or do multiple reps than last week. If you don't do this, you will never get stronger, you will not gain quality and you will not build the body you want. You should also keep track of the number of calories burned each day (at least for the first six months). If you don't know how many calories you want to burn, you can never adjust your diet to help you reach your goals. You don't have to do this forever. Long enough, you can start paying attention to macros and better understand how many calories are in the food you eat. Finally, managing and improving your sleep are the most overlooked elements of a good training program. If you follow a decent weight training program, you will get results. But you must give yourself enough time to recover. Make sure you get at least 7.5 hours of sleep each night (if you train hard, my sleep time is preferably 9 hours). Do at least 60 minutes of yoga a week. Spend some time in nature. 2. Focus on basic skills through training Super set. Drop set. Hypoxia training. Tighten them all. Keep it simple. The majority of your workout should be heavy resistance training (4-8 rep range), including a combination of squats, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press. You can do some ancillary exercises in the 8 to 12 rep range to stimulate hypertrophy and gain benefits, but you should switch most of your weightlifting exercises to heavy compound exercises and try to get heavier each week than the week. previous. Sprint for 20 to 30 minutes once a week (30 seconds when you walk for 60 to 90 seconds) and do some yoga exercises to regain strength.

What do you make of this statement?","output":"What this tells me is that Richard Grant White, whoever the hell he is, doesn‚Äôt have a clue what ‚Äúgrammar‚Äù is. What he probably means is that English lacks a lot of the complicated inflections common to many other languages and he might have got away with claiming that English has a relatively simple grammar but ‚Äúalmost grammar-less‚Äù is the kind of clanger of a statement that makes everyone wonder who let the village idiot in. English, like all languages, has grammar because no language can function without it. If you can tell the difference between the following sentences, it is proof that English grammar exists and is important: The dog ate the food The food ate the dog. Notice how changing the word order fundamentally changes the meaning? That‚Äôs because of grammar. ƒ∞n English, we know what the subject and the object of a sentence is based on where it comes in the sentence. Not all languages operate this way. For instance, in Turkish I can say: K√∂pek yemeƒüi yedi (literally ‚Äúthe dog the food ate‚Äù) Or Yemeƒüi k√∂pek yedi (‚Äúthe food the dog ate‚Äù) which both mean ‚ÄúThe dog ate the food ‚Äú (but with different emphases).

If there were no grammar, there would be no meaning in language."},{"instruction":"As an American, do you agree that statistics that show the US way down low at #37 for quality of healthcare is farleft propaganda that folks in Europe, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand love to repeat, when in reality the US is always #1?","output":"If, like everything else you believe; is because you were told to believe, then yes.

The very next moment, until we could feel or understand something, everyone got up and started running and all the people started screaming. There was only smoke in the whole room, there was too much smoke, everyone started pushing each other, the lights are off, nothing was visible, everyone seemed to get out first. Get out first. We were in the last, we had more difficulty in getting out, but as soon as we got out, when we came out, we breathed peace, then came to life. When they came out, it was found that the movie hall next door was running clean and sprayed some medicine in it, due to which its gas was coming up here and the smoke in the whole room was smoke and burning like It smelled bad. Everyone shouted to the staff there, what is the way. During this whole time, when all the people came out, the staff there did not know what happened there, when all the people came out, then they went in and looked and then came and told that there is no problem. The hall that is going to be cleaned there, and the gas of the same chemical came here.

I believe it is unlikely that Viacom will sell to Disney as this will require that they spin-off with CBS again.

However, Bhutan is a little different from our countries, and it is best to be familiar with it before visiting as some things might ruin our trip if you don't know about it beforehand. Anyways for an Indian who is in Bhutan or planning to travel, be considerate of the following things Gladly for an Indian passport is not the requirement but a Voter ID is mandatory. The fact is, anyone can avail of the Bhutan travel time only if they have an Indian Voter ID. If not, please get one right away.On the other hand, do not fall prey to the agents who offer you to make multiple debit and credit cards that you'd be able to use in Bhutan. Because they simply do not work, therefore, it is ideal to have cash rather than cards. Bhutan is a country of environment and peace. Therefore, you need to start exploring it as soon as you wake up, be it immediately after sunrise or at 7-9 am, because after evening, there is not much Bhutan that you can see.Not all the places are worth the visit for example; you might not want to skip Thimphu but some do. To have a better idea about this, I suggest you read these blogs. Neither smoke nor horn is not allowed there. Also, please do not litter, as the people and government there really care about their country's environment. Gladly, Hindi and English are well understood there.

We simply said because we are tourists and we are going back to India. They laughed (they seemed drunk), and told us that they know why we are leaving Kenya, it is because we do not like black people. They kept saying this again and again until I announced (loudly and sternly) that I am feeling very cold and I wish to go inside immediately. They let us go after that. Our taxi driver told us later that the officials were intoxicated and just wanted money from us.

They‚Äôre intended to be separately funded, and I don‚Äôt see any reason to change that. Any changes to Social Security and Medicare (which will have to happen at some point) can very easily be done so that only younger people are affected, as was done with raising the retirement age (65, then) back in the ‚Äò80s. Benefits needn‚Äôt be lost, rather just delayed. Or, there are ways to ‚Äòfix‚Äô this without impacting anyone. The fixes don‚Äôt have to be big, cumbersome things.

I had saved diligently for years, compounded interest earned from my retirement plan with AtomHoldings (Atomholdings.net) a company that allows extremely little startup capital for dividend returns, yes I started in my early days with 100. Today I earn as high as 7% yearly from my principal capital of around 300,000. That‚Äôs 21,000 which I learnt to compound annually over time enabling me earn even more. I had mentors who helped me invest wisely and made me have a clear vision of what I wanted my retirement to look like. I was going to travel the world, spend time with my family, and pursue my hobbies. However, despite all my careful planning, there was one area of my life that did not go as planned. I had always been in good health and had never really struggled with any major health issues. But as I entered my retirement years, I started to notice some changes in my body. I was experiencing joint pain, fatigue, and other symptoms that I couldn't quite explain. At first, I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just a normal part of getting older. But as the symptoms persisted, I knew I needed to see a doctor. After a series of tests, I received a diagnosis that I never expected: I had a chronic autoimmune disease. The news hit me hard. I had always prided myself on being healthy and active, and now I was facing a condition that threatened to limit my mobility and quality of life. I felt like my retirement plans were suddenly upended, and I didn't know how to proceed. Over the next few months, I worked with my doctor to develop a treatment plan and adjust my lifestyle to manage my symptoms. I had to make some tough choices, like giving up some of my more physically demanding hobbies and adjusting my travel plans to accommodate my health needs. But with time, I learned to adapt and find new ways to enjoy my retirement. While it wasn't easy, my health challenge taught me an important lesson: life doesn't always go as planned, and it's important to be flexible and adaptable. Despite the unexpected roadblock, I was still able to enjoy my retirement and pursue my passions, even if it looked a little different than I had originally envisioned. This Is My Only Quora Account.

No! When I was a kid: I wouldn't eat anything that seemed even remotely \\"gross\\". To this day I have never tried escargot (update: as of this edit I actually have tried escargot) nor frog legs, and I have barely tried oysters and rabbit.I did not like any form of fish or seafood. Today I will only eat fish in the form of sushi and I generally avoid other seafood.In fact, I was practically a vegetarian. I was scared of eating meat for fear that I would bite into a piece of bone or cartilage. I eat a lot of meat now, but I still avoid meat with bones.My elementary school cafeteria had a rule that you at least had to try everything on your platter before you could leave. I would sometimes end up staying there for an hour without eating so they would have to let me go because class was starting again. I might have been an extreme case, but clearly some French children are picky, like I was. I don't have any data that indicates whether or not French children are more or less picky than American children, but it seems French Kids Eat Everything is basically based on the anecdotal experience of one family moving to a small town in France so I wouldn't say it has any statistical validity whatsoever."},{"instruction":"T Madras mess has introduced separate entrance, utensils and basins for nonvegetarian students, some of whom are considering it as equivalent of 'untouchability'.

If I talk about myself and my state,I don't eat non veg.I will not like to eat even in the future.I think, it will be difficult for a vegetarian person to eat non veg. Because some people never had non veg food in their entire life. In my state, It is very important to have non veg and alcohol in the meals. Here,when food is served in weddings,separate entries and utensils are given for the peoples (non-vegetarian people and vegetarian people).. then we can't call it untouchability..If i'm talking about other countries, lot of Indians (who are vegetarian) never used to eat at a place where they serve beef and chicken kababs..Does they call it Untouchability? No.. so why in colleges...? If the students demanding different plates, it is stupid to impose ones views on them. Let the students decide.. I mean who attach non-veg food to certain caste and religion ....There are so many people across caste/religion eat non-veg to their liking. So, I want to request to stop creating issues.. In my opinion,The administration of IIT madras must have taken this decision very thoughtfully and keeping both in mind. Stay positive and Calm :)) Thanks for reading..!!

They can be a good option for investors who want to earn a guaranteed return on their investment.Money market funds: Money market funds are a type of mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities. They can be a good option for investors who want to earn a higher return than a savings account, but who still want their money to be relatively safe.Government bonds: Government bonds are a type of debt security issued by the government.

They can be a good way to grow your money over the long term, but they also carry more risk than other types of investments.Real estate: Real estate can be a good way to build wealth over the long term.

Or fly backward like in the movies. A friend of mine who is a police officer told me a story about a state trooper who was forced to engage in a fire-fight with a felon on a traffic stop. The trooper had a 10-round magazine and scored at least six hits. The bad guy continued to fire and move around. The trooper dropped his mag and put in 10 more rounds. Scored hits with each shot. He had to use his spare magazine and finally neutralized the attacker. The pathologist at the hospital doing the autopsy wondered why the trooper shot the man so many times, he had scored 26 hits out of 30. Second story. Sheriff Grady Judd of Polk County, Florida, is a no-nonsense kind of guy. A felon out on parole shot and killed one of his deputies in a traffic stop. He killed two more deputies who attempted to stop him while he was on the run. Sheriff Judd mobilized the SWAT team and they tracked him down in a wooded area.

They are trained as dentists and perform many of the same functions, but their emphasis is on how your teeth, gums, and mouth look. Cosmetic dentistry has grown considerably over the past few decades as more people want to improve their smile. A dentist who specializes in this field will offer services such as teeth whitening, veneers, and restoration procedures that are designed to create a more youthful appearance to your smile. To become a cosmetic dentist, specialized courses are needed and frequent training on the latest techniques. Such courses are provided year-round to ensure that the dentist knows the techniques and has access to the latest equipment. What are the Important Differences? A general dentist is best suited for those who want basic dental care for themselves and their family. This means if you have a spouse and children, a general dentist offers the services needed to clean teeth, fill cavities, and address the basic needs of everyone. In addition, they can also perform some procedures that are considered cosmetic in nature, such as adding bridges or veneers. However, their primary emphasis is on the health and wellbeing of your mouth, not so much the appearance as least when compared to a cosmetic dentist. A cosmetic dentist is best suited for those who are more concerned about the appearance of their teeth. While both types of dentists will use similar procedures to fill cavities, a cosmetic dentist will mostly use composite fillings designed to match the color of your teeth. This means that a cosmetic dentist may be more expensive to see compared to a general one for basic dental services."},{"instruction":"What is an online auction?","output":"May be this better - [LINKED_TEXT: Auction-On-Wheels] [URL: https://www.auctionstreaming.com/auction-on-wheels] - mobile workstation allows your auction to function outside of your location while all the details and synchronized with the main office.

Note that every time you make a fold, you double the number of sheets in the stack. So forget folding, we‚Äôll just talk about starting with a stack of just one sheet, and doubling the number of sheets in the stack at each step. Before we start, though, let‚Äôs look up how thick one sheet of paper is. A good figure for this turns out to be about 0.1 mm (and that‚Äôs pretty thin) But again, at every step we‚Äôre going to double the stack. Start with one sheet. Doubling the stack means two sheets, 0.2 mm thick. Double again; four sheets (2^2 = 4). 0.4 mm thick. Again; eight sheets (2^3 = 8). 0.8 mm. By the time we‚Äôve doubled the stack just eight times (2^8 = 256), we‚Äôre at a thickness of 2.56 centimeters, just over one inch. Another eight doublings (2^16 = 65,536), and the stack is now almost 260‚Ä≥ tall - well over 20 feet! - and all we‚Äôve done is to double the stack 16 times. 103 doublings is a number too big to easily write without scientific notation; 2^103 = about 1 x 10^31 sheets of paper. (Remember, 10 to the 31 power means a 1 followed by THIRTY-ONE zeros.) Since one sheet is 0.1 mm (or 0.0001 meters, or 0.0000001 kilometers), that number translates to 1 x 10^24 kilometers. A light-year is about 9.5 x 10^12 kilometers. So‚Ä¶. (1 x 10^24)/(9.5 x 10^12) = 1.05 x 10^11 light-years. That‚Äôs over 100 BILLION light years. So yes, this is comfortably larger than the size of the observable universe!"},{"instruction":"What's it like to have a 150 IQ? Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others?

Anything less is underachievement. TBH it is obviously more fair to be judged on level of effort than on results, but it can be pretty frustrating anyways. My recommendation is to channel it into something good. Use it to develop a good sense of humor.

Here are some steps you can take to address the situation: Talk to your partner: Have an open and honest conversation with your partner about their feelings towards your dog. Try to understand their concerns and listen to their perspective without becoming defensive or dismissive.Discuss the importance of your dog: Explain why your therapy dog is important to you and how they contribute to your emotional well-being. Discuss any concerns your partner may have about the dog, such as allergies or behavioral issues, and see if there are ways to address them.Consider compromise: If possible, try to find a compromise that works for both you and your partner. For example, you could limit the amount of time your dog spends with your partner or designate certain areas of your home as pet-free zones.Seek professional help: If the situation continues to be a source of conflict and strain on your relationship, consider seeking the help of a professional therapist or counselor who can help you navigate the situation and find a solution. Remember, your therapy dog is an important part of your life and emotional well-being, and it is important to find a way to honor that while also respecting your partner's feelings and concerns. With open communication, empathy, and a willingness to work together, you can find a solution that works for everyone.

Probably Congress may align with Pragathipara Samajwadi Secular Morcha. Both the main groups of SP+BSP and BJP are vulnerable to even a small change in voting pattern. Since Shivpal Yadav has broken his relations with SP, it is certain to affect SP. Also because SP and BSP are having alliance both may at the most contest 50% of seats. Disgruntled elements in the party will either contest as rebels or join other parties or go against the official candidate or abstain. Hence the crucial 2% to 3% votes will be lost affecting the victory of their candidates. Probably because of these reasons these parties are keeping their seat distribution in tight wraps. They have not left any clue whatsoever on this. BJP too has many worries as Anupriya‚Äôs Apna Dal and Seheldev‚Äôs parties are playing game seeking more seats.

Just letting all your thoughts and feelings out without worrying about being politically correct. No one else is gonna see it. -seeing a therapist. INFJs are usually good at being the therapist for everyone else, but it‚Äôs important they have one too. You need someone to give you practical advice. -exercising because it not only makes you feel physically better but it also helps strengthen your inferior extroverted sensing and makes you more comfortable in your body- hiking, weight training, biking, jogging, dancing, swimming, rock climbing, etc. It gets you out of your anxious thoughts. -crying it out. -hugging it out. -spending time in nature. -spending time alone to get in tune with yourself again. -but also spending time with friends and family so you feel connected. -going for drives and singing along to your favorite songs that you‚Äôre too embarrassed to show anyone else. -accepting yourself. Validating your own feelings. Don‚Äôt leave any feeling unchecked. It‚Äôs gonna get messy and you‚Äôre gonna be uncomfortable but you have to be 100% honest with yourself. You can‚Äôt hold back from yourself, you need to feel it all and work through it for as long as it takes. Working it out with another person is even better - a friend, mentor, therapist, etc. -practicing gratitude everyday. Even if you just write out 5 things before bed. We get so caught up in the bad things going on in our lives because we get so anxious. But practicing gratitude resets our mind positively and makes us focus on all the good we have. It just takes practice and consistency, but eventually you'll train your mind to think positively first. -pets. -a routine. I promise having a daily routine established will lessen stress. Even if it‚Äôs simple. Just pick 3 things you‚Äôll commit to everyday: showering, journaling, doing the dishes, etc. -finding something to look forward to. -taking a break from the news. I know you want to save the world right now, but you need to take care of yourself first. And then eventually you‚Äôll realize you can save the world by focusing on what and who are in your life right now. Take care of the people closest to you and see all the good that spreads into the world from that. -being creative: playing an instrument, writing, art, blogging, etc. -appreciating the simple things in life. -practicing grounding techniques - breathing, meditating, focusing on the physical world around you. Like exercising, it gets you out of your head and makes you feel real and appreciate all the beauty this world has to offer. -writing out your goals and getting excited about your future. -being patient with yourself. You don‚Äôt have to be perfect. In fact, once you accept that you‚Äôll never be perfect, life is more fun. -appreciating yourself for all that you‚Äôve accomplished and all that you will accomplish. -spending time in spirituality. If you believe in God, then praying and sharing your sorrows with Him. Forming a deeper relationship with Him. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. You don‚Äôt have to do all these daily, maybe just once a week or once a month for some of them. But healing is a lifelong journey, there‚Äôs no rush. Just take your time and do the best you can.

Again criticized by anti-SJWs for forced diversity (this is a real thing and a primary example is this crap) and SJWs for a poor representation of diverse characters (the names alone already detest people). But there are some common complaints or naive hope that should be cleared up about why this comic stumbles so hard with only a trailer debut‚Ä¶. First is that the comic flunked its debut because there are no queer creatives on the team. First, thats wrong. The artist, Luciano Vecchio is a openly queer artist from Argentina, and some of his art looks like fan-fiction you see off a Reddit post. Don‚Äôt even start with Wonder Boy. Get that out of my face. His art overall isn‚Äôt too bad. But his designs for New Warriors are. There is a reason he mostly does variants‚Ä¶. Sorry, but this does not look comic ready, even for Marvel. This looks like a sketch that didn‚Äôt get passed by editorial but sneaked into the trailer. Getting on top of the first complaint, people (especially those more liberal in comics) complained that Marvel should have hired a queer writer, because this writer has a ‚Äú better world view ‚Äú of that character. But that is not true in practice. Gabby Rivera wrote America Chavez back in 2013, and it was one of the worst comic runs in Marvel‚Äôs history. Same thing with Senna Grace and Ice-man, or Cecil Castellucci and the Female Furies. While in theory, it should make sense that a queer writer should be able to write queer superheroes better, this obviously is not the case. At the end of the day, these are superheroes and the writers should know how to write superheroes. There have been straight white males who wrote some of the best queer characters to ever exist in comics, such as Batwoman and Midnighter. Sometimes having outside perspectives on subjects is a better approach to that subject, and the theory that diverse writers = better diverse characters is flat out false. The most common naive comment for the trailer is that relating to current trends and events to help bring more kids in. While this has worked in the past, it also has been a critical mistake as well. Focusing so much on the ‚Äú now ‚Äú can subside the elements that makes superhero comics so attractive in that comics aren‚Äôt the real world. They are so on the nose about being trendy that its completely transparent to our current society, and loses that adventure and special value that we look for in comics like superheroes, which are mean‚Äôt to be a source of aspiration. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, alot of comics within the superhero genre have been able to blend current society with the superhero genre well, but they work in conjunction. Just off the trailer, it seems that there is a battle within this comic between being superheroes and being hip. Marvel excels more at being relatable to their audience then say DC, but they become increasingly hellbent on the matter that it makes them look cheesy."},{"instruction":"When is noon: 12:0012:01, 12:001:00, or the exact second of when the clock strikes 12:00?","output":"witin your practical use of time, 12:00 technically depends on wher you are an dthe time of year we kindof simplified an averaged thign otu for practical purpsoes so several people can use the same timezone and so clocks on‚Äôt ave to be adjusted daily"},{"instruction":"Which Bollywood movie has a very effective, well crafted, and brilliant climax scene?","output":"Vikramaditya Motwane has done brilliant job in crafting the climax of Udaan.

What they invented is a special case of a general wheel. They, as we today, used a philosophy of ‚Äûthe first success‚Äù. It means, that when rounded slide of a stone or wood with a central axle appeared to be useful to move things, it was the end of searching. But almost always the first solution is the worst case, it is used nonetheless by people eternally. At last, at the beginning of the XIX century polish philosopher Joseph Hoene Wronski invented a method of thinking that enforces a reason to search another solutions. This causes the reason to move between two (knowledge and being) aspects of thinking. As a result an inventor must not stop with building a wheel with a centric axle but should also consider a wheel being a road. This led him to invent a wheel with moving road. However such a wheel was not used in practice until 2014, when I made a bicycle with Wronski wheel."},{"instruction":"w do you calculate","output":"I know my friend use the application of calculator on his phone , there are many situations in which a calculator also gives me a helping hand to sort out the logic and calculation in a few seconds, so there are numerous applications available online that have numerous features to solve the calculations in seconds"},{"instruction":"What should I eat before lifting weights?","output":"Vegtables"},{"instruction":"Why is butter, rather than the healthier margarine, served in restaurants?","output":"Margarine was originally intended to be axle grease, not for human consumption."},{"instruction":"becoming a doctor financially worth it?","output":"Know all about The Life of a Pediatrician doctor & How to Became a Pediatrician doctor by Dr Indu Khosla Watch this video for steps to becoming a doctor paediatrician and steps to become a doctor and details of how to become a doctor.

Most likely, you have only four additional months of unemployment. That suggests other companies have not been willing to hire you, which if anything would amplify the company‚Äôs confidence that they made the right decision, in rejecting you previously. It is unimportant that you feel you are qualified. They took a look at your resume, and they felt you were not qualified. They apparently have high standards for whom they would put into that position, so they have probably rejected quite a few other resumes during the past four months, and undoubtedly before that. Just because it is taking them a long time to find someone who is up to their standards, does not mean they are going to lower the requirements to be qualified for their job. If you didn‚Äôt pass muster before, it won‚Äôt happen if you try again. Instead, I suspect you need to be looking at your approach job searching. Why have you gone another four months, without getting an acceptable job offer? Either you are applying for the wrong jobs, or you are going about your job search in some way inadequately. Of course, we have no information at all regarding why you have not yet been hired somewhere.

I'm definitely not an expert but these are just my thoughts right off the top of my head since I've been asking myself the same question in a casual way the last few years. edit: Reading J. Richard Jacobs answer i am reminded of how well chain works to add drag and ballast to the anchor, increasing the ability to lay out a long line that lays flat and horizontal rather than vertical, which is how they really do it, for various reasons (and as Jay pointed out the chain adds more ballast and drag through the water as the bow dips and rises, reducing the shock load. Cable would i would think have less resistance flowing through the water, so less good shock-absorber)."},{"instruction":"w do ballroom dance competitions work?","output":"Why don't more men do ballroom dancing? Don't they realize that there are a lot of beautiful women with no partners there? I think there are several reasons for this. (I‚Äôm only going to address this for U.S. men, in the U.S. culture.) Males who are interested in participating in sports and physical activities generally start to learn them at a very young age. For many men, they haven‚Äôt really learned anything new in terms of movement or physical activity since they were a pre-teen. True, they may have learned how to do things better, but not something completely new. For a man to learn ballroom dance, he has to go into a studio or meet a teacher and admit he does not know how to do this activity. That‚Äôs against all the traditional behaviors men are so often taught, at least in the U.S. It means risking looking unskilled and possibly even uncoordinated. Instead of being able to look competent and in control, a man starting to learn ballroom has to take a risk. Even more, he has to take that risk of looking unskilled or uncoordinated in front of a woman. Again, in the U.S., this is against everything we‚Äôre told we should do or be as a man in this culture.Most physical activities men learn are competitive. Most of the time we‚Äôre learning or participating in sports. Physical activity is a chance to be aggressive, to test our strength, to push ourselves to the limit. Dancing is about cooperation and connecting with someone. Other than sex, men aren‚Äôt really given the chance to see physical activity as a way to work with someone.Mark Twain said, ‚ÄúA classic is something that everybody wants to have read, but nobody wants to read.‚Äù When I started going to group classes for ballroom, I told my friends, both male and female, and asked them to come with me. Almost every time I asked someone to come with me, they said, ‚ÄúNo. Not this week. Ask me next week.‚Äù Some friends just said, ‚ÄúThank you, but I can‚Äôt.‚Äù (Maybe due to no free time or exhaustion or other reasons.) Some kept saying, ‚ÄúAsk me next week,‚Äù but every week they had an excuse. Then, about a year or so later, I had not only moved on to taking private lessons, but did my first showcase. I showed the video of my showcase to a lot of friends and often they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúI wish I could do that!‚Äù The difference between me doing it and them wishing they could was about 52 weeks where I said, ‚ÄúI want to go to ballroom class,‚Äù when, each week, they said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like going tonight.‚ÄùI think they did, sincerely, wish they could ballroom dance (both men and women friends), but I think the issue was that they didn‚Äôt want to take the time to learn to dance. I think there are more reasons, but I think this covers a lot of it. Maybe I‚Äôll edit and add more if I think of them."},{"instruction":"Why did Bill Gates say ‚ÄúIf you think you‚Äôre a really good programmer‚Ä¶ read Art of Computer Programming‚Ä¶ You should definitely send me a r√©sum√© if you can read the whole thing‚Äù?","output":"I studied the AoCP in graduate school in the ‚Äò80s, when I was at Stanford, and studying under Prof. Donald Knuth.

There is hardly any drama there. While Tamil Nadu has had major anti-Hindi protests, Kerala stands out as a Communist bastion and Andhra Pradesh went through a very messy divorce with Telangana, Karnataka hardly has that kind of masala news. Temples and mosques are not destroyed, trains are not burned, cities are not bombed and there is no major caste or religious violence. Nature also blesses them with fewest of natural disasters [touchwood]. All makes for very little Karnataka related story in the front page. On a related note, there is extremely little migration away from Karnataka - especially in the past number of centuries. This is perhaps because less agricultural disasters and much better governance. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Kerala experienced significant outbound migrations and so did Punjab, Bihar and Gujarat. because of the migrations, Tamils are every-where. Besides becoming a major language of Singapore, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, it offers extremely active communities across the world. These migrant communities assist educate the residents about Tamil tradition, build Tamil temples, run Tamil schools an such like. Besides having had good governance in accordance with other Indian says, Karnataka don't have many harbors both. Its usage of the shore is very rugged.

Before we talk about candid photography tips, let‚Äôs take a look at what candid photography is all about. What is a candid photo? Photo by Samara Ratnayake A photo that we capture without posing or directing, without knowing the subject, can be called a candid photo. To take a photo like this, remember that there are several things that need to be accomplished. Such as planning the scene, positioning, camera setup, and so on. The question is, ‚ÄúHow do you prepare to take a candid photo?‚Äù Let‚Äôs talk about them one by one. The first thing you need to consider is, 1) Choosing the right gear Photo by [LINKED_TEXT: Free stock photos - Kaboompics] [URL: http://kaboompics.com/] When you capture the photo, if you can capture it from a little distance, the output will be more realistic. If you can carry a lens with the ability to zoom in a little bit (70‚Äì200mm mid-telephoto zoom), it will make it easier for you to stay at a distance and take a photo. On the other hand, by using a prime lens, you can easily capture a photo in a frame, the size that catches our eye. The smaller the lens, the less likely it is for our camera to catch others‚Äô attention, so you can easily take photos. 35mm and 50mm are best suited for prime lenses. 2) It is very important to be a good observer Photo by Frederico Erthal You should always pay attention to your surroundings when taking candid photos. Because something interesting can happen at any moment around you. Things like that can change in a matter of seconds, so you need to be vigilant at all times. Then you will be able to create frames that most people will not see in the surroundings. We need to ask ourselves questions and evaluate what we hope to seize. Also, it is important to survey the scene and ask yourself the following; In what direction does light fall on the subject?From what angle should the candid be captured?What happens in the background?How much do elements in the foreground contribute to the photo? Studying light well can be very helpful in candid photos. It is important to have a good understanding of the direction in which light is coming and the change in light. Focus on the subject between the light and the camera, and try to get a silhouette portrait that fits the mood. Also, try to take photos from different angles. Then you will get interesting results. Always try to capture something from the above level, and something from the below level. When trying a different level than what is normally visible to your eyes, you will get something unexpected as a result. Photo by Samara Ratnayake Also, try to be conscious about the elements in the background of the scene you are going to capture. Sometimes they will support the output or will somewhat distract. Therefore considering the background and foreground elements is equally important for an interesting photograph. 3) Don‚Äôt forget to turn off the flash Photo by Kelly Lacy You should always try to capture photos without using an external or pop-up flash. Adding to this is, taking the camera to waist level and capturing photos. If there is a flip screen in the back of the camera, you can easily do it by keeping the camera at your waist level. Here you have to behave like, you look at the most recent photos on the camera. 4) Always go for a fast shutter speed Photo by Samara Ratnayake The world we live in is the busiest place we have ever known. Therefore anything interesting can happen at any time without any notice. As a photographer you have to get ready for anything that can happen around you, the solution for that is to get ready your gear with appropriate settings. I would recommend you to use shutter priority as much as possible and choose a higher shutter speed such as 1/400s. Then you will be able to capture a scene without shaking or leaving most of the elements in the picture blurry. Photo by Samara Ratnayake The meaning of candid photography is to specialize in the emotionality of a moment, the emotions people experience and translate that into a picture that connects with the viewer. In that regard, candid photography is probably one of the foremost capable kinds of photography to move the viewer to a specific instant in time. That is what candid photography is all about!

Aloe vera gel has many benefits for the skin, including its ability to soothe and hydrate, reduce inflammation, and improve skin elasticity.

Additionally, make sure to use pure and natural aloe vera gel and avoid products that contain added chemicals or fragrances. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to start with shorter application periods and gradually increase the time as your skin becomes accustomed to the aloe vera gel. Overall, using aloe vera gel on the face overnight can be a great addition to your skincare routine, but it's important to be cautious and listen to your skin's individual needs.

It was a powerful display of selflessness and love. Bill Russell in the 1960 NBA Finals - During Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Russell's teammate, Frank Ramsey, fouled out with the game tied. Russell, who was already having an incredible game, volunteered to guard the opposing team's best player, Jerry West, for the remainder of the game. He held West to just two points in the final quarter and led his team to victory. Johan Cruyff in the 1974 World Cup - In a group-stage match against Sweden, Cruyff was awarded a penalty kick. Instead of taking the shot himself, he passed the ball to his teammate, who scored the goal. It was a selfless act that helped his team win the match and advance to the next round.

He served in the Army Rangers and was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2004. Tillman's decision to put his country ahead of his personal goals was a powerful display of selflessness.

When it comes to baking, there are numerous tools and techniques to choose from. One question that often arises is whether it's possible to bake a cake in a glass bowl.We will explore this topic and provide you with insights into the feasibility of baking a cake in a glass bowl. We'll discuss the advantages and considerations involved, as well as provide step-by-step instructions to help you successfully bake a cake using this method. Can a Glass Bowl Be Used for Baking? Glass bowls can indeed be used for baking, including cakes. However, it's essential to understand the properties of glass and how they can impact the baking process. Glass is a poor conductor of heat, which means it takes longer to heat up and cool down compared to metal pans. Despite this, glass bowls are still a viable option for baking a cake. Advantages of Baking a Cake in a Glass Bowl Baking a cake in a glass bowl offers several advantages: Even Heat Distribution: Glass promotes even heat distribution, resulting in a cake that bakes more uniformly. Visibility: Glass bowls allow you to see the cake as it bakes, making it easier to monitor its progress and prevent overcooking. Versatility: Glass bowls can be used for mixing, baking, and serving, eliminating the need for multiple dishes. Aesthetics: Glass bowls provide an attractive presentation, making them ideal for occasions when you want to showcase your baked creations. Considerations When Baking with Glass Bowls While glass bowls have their benefits, it's crucial to consider a few factors before using them for baking: Temperature Limitations: Glass can shatter if exposed to sudden temperature changes. Avoid placing a cold glass bowl directly into a preheated oven or transferring it from the oven to a cold surface. Adjusted Baking Time: Due to glass's slower heat conductivity, cakes may take longer to bake in a glass bowl compared to metal pans. It's recommended to increase the baking time accordingly. Greasing the Bowl: To prevent the cake from sticking to the glass bowl, make sure to thoroughly grease it with butter or non-stick cooking spray. Step-by-Step Guide to Baking a Cake in a Glass Bowl Follow these steps to bake a cake in a glass bowl: Preheat your oven to the specified temperature mentioned in your cake recipe. Grease the glass bowl generously to ensure easy removal of the cake after baking. Prepare the cake batter according to your recipe. Pour the batter into the greased glass bowl, filling it only two-thirds full to allow room for the cake to rise. Place the glass bowl in the preheated oven and bake for the recommended time, plus an additional few minutes to account for the slower heat conductivity of glass. To check if the cake is done, insert a toothpick into the center. If it comes out clean or with a few crumbs clinging to it, the cake is ready. Remove the glass bowl from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes on a heat-resistant surface. Carefully invert the bowl onto a wire rack or serving plate to release the cake. Gently tap the bottom of the bowl if needed. Allow the cake to cool completely before frosting or decorating it as desired. Tips for Successful Glass Bowl Baking Here are some additional tips to ensure a successful baking experience with a glass bowl: Choose the Right Size: Select a glass bowl that accommodates the amount of batter specified in your recipe without overflowing. Avoid Sudden Temperature Changes: Always allow the glass bowl to cool slightly before placing it on a different surface or exposing it to cold temperatures. Use Oven Mitts or Pot Holders: Glass bowls retain heat and can become very hot during baking. Protect your hands by using oven mitts or pot holders when handling them. Adjust Baking Time: Monitor the cake closely as it bakes and be prepared to increase the baking time if necessary. Clean and Store Properly: After use, clean the glass bowl with warm soapy water and avoid using abrasive materials that may scratch the surface. Store it in a safe place to prevent accidental breakage. Baking a cake in a glass bowl is not only possible but also offers unique advantages. Glass bowls provide even heat distribution, visibility, versatility, and an appealing presentation. By considering the limitations and following the recommended steps, you can successfully bake a delicious cake in a glass bowl. So, grab your favorite glass bowl, follow the guidelines, and let your baking creativity shine!"},{"instruction":"Should I eat McDonald's or Burger King?","output":"This is like asking whether you should eat garbage or rubbish.

Therefore some extremely powerful beings such as Odin, Chton, The Onslaught, Sentient Cosmic Cubes, Popular Supereroes, Mephisto, etc will not make the cut. So lets begin with the one and only 'God' of the multiverse- 01) THE One Above All The God of the Marvel Multiverse and being very true to his name, he is the most powerful being in the entire Marvel Multiverse and possibly beyond. He is responsible for all the lives within the multiverse. He is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent.The-One-Above-All is often unofficially cited as Marvel's creator and most presumably Stan Lee or Jack Kirby. Two of his most notable appearances of TOAA are:- His appearance to the Fantastic Four after Thing's death when he took the form of Jack Kirby.His appearance to Peter Parker when he took the form of a homeless man and advised Peter to keep faith. TOAA has a potential identity or manifestation in [LINKED_TEXT: Fulcrum] [URL: https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Fulcrum_(Earth-616)][LINKED_TEXT: .] [URL: https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-fulcrum/4005-60755/] The Fulcrum has appeared very less times in comics and is rumoured to be Jack Kirby. He is also the bartender of 'The Vestibule'( a bar where Eternals go before going to afterlife).Fulcrum has also been described as omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. Moving off from the God, we have some Godlike beings with great powers. 2) Pre-Retcon (original) Beyonder When Beyonder first appeared in the Secret Wars #1 1984, he was the most powerful comicbook character ever drawn. In the original Secret Wars, he was shown to exist from the 'Beyond Realm'. Beyond Realm was outside the Marvel Multiverse and our multiverse was like a drop in ocean compared to Beyond Realm.He was like the embodiment of that realm and was thus, millions of times more powerful than the multiverse including Living Tribunal.He had reality altering abilities on greater than multiversal scale. His thought and reality were essentially one. Being curious about humanity and desire he kidnapped the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe and had them do battle on another planet called Battleworld. He created the battleword from fragments of other planets and infamously said, \\"I am from Beyond! Slay your enemies and all you desire shall be yours! Nothing you dream of is impossible for me to accomplish!\\" ‚Äò‚ÄôMillions of times more powerful than the multiverse''!! Right from the beginning of secret wars he displayed immense powers and achieved astounding feats. He erased the concept of Death from the universe by forcing Mistress Death to consume a significant portion of his powers in a cup. (Scan - [LINKED_TEXT: Imgur] [URL: https://m.imgur.com/mZnFG5U] )He destroyed a group of Celestials with utter ease. He mocked their powers and gave them 3 seconds to try to stop him.Even with a smaller fraction of his powers he was powerful enough to easily dwarf the cosmic assembly (including Living Tribunal and Eternity). (Scan - [LINKED_TEXT: Imgur] [URL: https://m.imgur.com/qmVLvyz]) Fighting the Celestials. He was retconned many times thus his power level reduced greatly. In his first retcon he was portrayed as the one half of a [LINKED_TEXT: Cosmic Cube] [URL: https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-cube/4055-40949/] (other being Molecule Man). Later he it was disclosed that he is a Mutant-Inhuman hybrid. 3) Pre Retcon Molecule Man Owen Reece 'The Molecule Man' was so incredibly powerful that he hold his own against the Beyonder himself (though, very shortly). Through concentration, he projects a psionic-manipulative energy, the precise nature of which is unknown, that alters the arrangement of molecules according to any visualized pattern. He can animate inanimate materials by causing constant mass movement of molecules: for example, he can make a brick building walk. He can rearrange molecules so radically, he can use his power to reconfigure all forms of matter and them into different substances and forms (such as, for example, turning air into glass), and can change matter into energy and back again. He can create force fields and energy blasts, and also open up wormholes through hyperspace and traverse them, thus travelling faster than light. [LINKED_TEXT: Owen Reece (Earth-616)] [URL: https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Owen_Reece_(Earth-616)] Owen Reece gained his powers from the atomic incident which opened a portal to another realm.This incident gave him great powers of matter manipulation at atomic-molecular scales.In early years he had put mental blocks on himself and was therefore unable to control organic molecules. He also used metal band to focus his powers.In Secret Wars 1, Dr Doom while in possession of Galactus' and Beyonder's powers removed his mental blocks and said that he was the most powerful being in universe save Doom.His abilities were not common matter/energy manipulation like Galactus. It was rather reality warping. During Secret Wars 2, with his new gained maturity and no mental restraints he was the only one capable of holding his own against Beyonder. Though, Beyonder was clearly more powerful as Reece himself accepted, Beyonder had to put some efforts against Reece. In this storyline he accomplished great feats. Some of which were- Producing blasts which in Beyonder's words could have shattered billions of dimensions.His clash with Beyonder affected nearly every being on every planet in every dimension.He disintegrated Captain America's proto-admantium shield, Thor's hammer, and Silver Surfer's cosmic surfboard.He repairs the multiversal destruction caused by Beyonder. ([LINKED_TEXT: Imgur] [URL: https://m.imgur.com/7eXTfqi]) In his case too, retcons brought down his power levels and he was no longer mightier than [LINKED_TEXT: Abstract Entities] [URL: https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Abstract_Entities]. However in the Secret Wars 2015, he again gained great powers after absorbing the powers of Beyonders (race). 4) Living Tribunal Living Tribunal is a being with infinite power and even greater responsibilities. As the representative of TOAA, he is the cosmic judge and presides over Cosmic Assembly. He is officially, the 2nd most powerful Marvel character after TOAA (both Molecule Man and Beyonder have been retconned). He is is nigh-omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent Unlike most, he exists across the Marvel Multiverse rather than having different versions in different universes.He has the duty to maintain the balance of cosmic and mystical energies across multiverse.His half covered face represents vengeance, his covered face represents necessity and his full face represents equity. All three voices must agree before his judgement.The Living Tribunal has control over entire multiversal reality and can bend or destroy it at will. He, however, doesn't have a free will and is bound to obey TOAA. In the Infinity Gauntlet storyline, he simply shut down the Infinity Gauntlet and judged that the powers of infinity gems can't be summoned together by someone wielding infinity gauntlet. This shows the extent of his powers as all cosmic beings of Earth 616 including Eternity and Infinity together can't defeat Thanos with the gauntlet. Whether his powers exceed that of '[LINKED_TEXT: Heart of the Universe] [URL: https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Universe]' is debatable as that storyline took place outside the main Marvel continuity. Since that event didn't affected other continuities, it may be possible that what Thanos absorbed along with Eternity and Infinity was an avtar/manifestation of Living Tribunal much like Darkseid's avtars. When the Living Tribunal was killed by the Beyonders, TOAA appointed Adam Warlock of Earth-19141 as the new Living Tribunal and removed the aspects/shortcomings which led to his predecessor's death. 5) Protege Protege was the ruler of Universal Church of Truth in Earth-691. The most important and powerful of his capabilities was that he could replicate powers inconceivable.He claimed to become the new One Above All.Scathan (a celestial) judged against him and then Living Tribunal absorbed this mischievous child into himself thus saving the reality.Eternity said about him that he could gain infinite omnipotence. Well, apart from these Mad Jim Jaspers, Cosmic Entities, some other dimensional beings(eg ‚ÄòBeyonders') have been depicted as insanely powerful and have their fair share of feats to prove the same."},{"instruction":"What are the dark sides of Jayalalitha?","output":"Her friendship with Sasikala.

So, grab a cup of coffee and let‚Äôs dive in. First things first, you need to ensure that the domain you want to transfer is eligible for transfer. Some domains have certain restrictions or lock-in periods that you need to be aware of. Once you‚Äôve confirmed eligibility, it‚Äôs time to proceed. Step one is to unlock your domain at your current registrar. Think of it as releasing the shackles that bind your domain to its current home. This will allow the transfer to take place. Next, you‚Äôll need to obtain an authorization code, also known as an EPP code or transfer key. It‚Äôs like a secret password that proves you have the right to transfer your domain. You can usually find this code in the settings or dashboard of your current registrar. Once you‚Äôve got your code, it‚Äôs time to choose a new home for your beloved domain. You can transfer it to a new registrar or keep it within the same company, depending on your needs. Just make sure to compare prices, customer support, and features to find the best fit. Now comes the exciting part! You initiate the transfer at your new registrar by providing them with your domain name and authorization code. Sit back, relax, and let the magic happen. The transfer process usually takes a few days, so be patient. During the transfer, you may receive a confirmation email from your current registrar asking for your approval. Don‚Äôt ignore this email, my friend. Respond promptly to avoid any hiccups in the process. Once the transfer is complete, you‚Äôll receive a notification from your new registrar, and voila! Your domain is officially in its new home. Don‚Äôt forget to update your DNS settings if necessary. Remember, my friend, the process may vary slightly depending on the registrars involved, so always double-check their specific instructions. If you encounter any issues, both your current and new registrar‚Äôs support teams are there to lend a helping hand. So go forth, my domain-savvy friend, and may the transfer of your domain be as smooth as butter.

Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"For me, I found out that my IQ is 150 very recently, this is because I have never really sat down and took an IQ test properly in the past. I guess if that number is correct and I am indeed that intelligent, I can tell you life is different when you have a high IQ. I believe that a result of me having a high IQ (if it really is high) is that I tend to think a lot more about things which others do not care for. My brain is always racing with thoughts and ideas. I tend to think a lot about medical, scientific and philosophical things and the influence which they have over our lives. I have found myself to not be thinking about everyday things in life such as work, school, and responsibilities. I tend to deviate from others in this criteria because subconsciously I guess, I consider something like a 10‚Äì15 dollar hour job as a task which is repetitive, yields little reward, and overall serves no real purpose in life in the grand scheme of things, and till this day it amazes me how some can obsess over such a job and have no interest in talking/thinking about anything else. I am a firm believer that If you want to be financially stable in life you will invest in a skill where the investment you make is smaller than the reward given by the investment. An example of me executing this belief is going into welding after high school rather than going straight to college. I have seen many young adults in their early to mid 20s drop out of college never finishing or using (if they did not drop out of college) the degrees they got. These people always seem to end up with a ridiculous amount of debt and no real benefit from the degree which they got. As a welder if I stick with a union for a few years I will be making more than a lot of people and will be able to have money to afford an education. Given this plan I will be mature enough mentally to understand the ups and downs of being an adult, and with this knowledge I will be able to make a more carefully calculated decision. I suppose the worst effect of having a higher IQ than average is having a lot of anxiety. I do not know about anyone else, because I am not inside their head, but I tend to think a lot about social interactions which I have with others. I am always wondering how I am perceived by the outside world and how my words and actions influence the actions of those around me who are responsible for facilitating an accomplishment/goal which I am trying to achieve. When it comes to intellectual tasks such as school I tend to pick up and master topics quickly if I dedicate myself to studying whatever material the school requires, the same goes for language (I learned to speak English at the age of 9 fluently in under 5 months). Overall, I just tend to find myself to obsess over fantasies/topics/ideas/scenarios/life events/hobbies/the future/technology more than others, I believe this is the case because when I try to tell people about current events regarding these things, they tend to express fake interest out of politeness, which becomes evident from the lack of quantity/quality feedback you get."},{"instruction":"Where can one find the best biryani in bangalore?","output":"Khazana, Johnson Market."},{"instruction":"By what right did Sweden enter NATO without Russia's consent?","output":"By the same right that I ate a peanut butter sandwich without Russia‚Äôs consent."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite RDBMS (commercial or open source) and why?

Ok, this gives more work time (i.e paid time) for developers or DBA, but I just hate it for my own case. In the early 80‚Äôs, I had been working on HP-image Hierarchical DBMS, with embedded Business Basic. This was a VERY good, powerful, easy and versatile development and production environment that many people ignored, but very expensive too, and kind of declining on the market.When I was looking for a replacement solution, I ‚Äúmet‚Äù Informix DBMS in 1986, and understood this was the solution I was looking for. Informix 4GL was a great programming language (and still is very competive in terms of developer productivity and maintenability), and the Informix engine was just amazing in terms of performance, stability and ease of Admin. In the mean time I had to do with other DBMS like Oracle and MS SqlServer, and sincerly, I never could have fun using them, which I do when I use Informix. No DBMS ever came close to Informix when we have to consider, alltogether, performance, robustness, scalability, extensibility and outperforming capacity for real hybrid datatypes(JSON/GeoSpatial,TimeSeries, Nodes and many more) in the same database instance(in fact in the same query text ), not to mention the beautiful Data Replication architecture that everyone has been dreaming about. Again I may be a lazy person, but what I saw in other DBMS to obtain the same functionality: Gosh! this is so complicated to set this up that I prefer spending this extra time doing things I like. No one will reward me for having done stupidly big efforts to barely achieve features that have been native in Informix for years or even decades!

It is important to approach this question with sensitivity, recognizing that each individual's experience and circumstances can differ. While it is challenging to pinpoint a single cause, several factors may contribute to the higher rates of depression experienced by some individuals in the current generation: Increased Awareness and Diagnosis: Improved awareness and understanding of mental health, along with reduced stigma, may lead to more people seeking help and receiving a diagnosis. This can contribute to higher reported rates of depression.Technological and Social Media Influence: The rise of technology and social media has brought both benefits and challenges. While technology has connected people globally, it has also altered the way we interact and communicate. Excessive use of social media, cyberbullying, fear of missing out (FOMO), and constant comparison to others can contribute to feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and depression.Academic and Career Pressures: The modern world often places significant academic and career expectations on young people. The pressure to succeed academically, find employment, and meet high standards can contribute to stress, burnout, and feelings of depression.Economic Challenges: Economic uncertainty and financial pressures can take a toll on mental health. Difficulties finding stable employment, high student loan debt, and financial insecurities can contribute to stress, anxiety, and depression.Lifestyle Changes: Changes in lifestyle patterns, such as sedentary behavior, poor sleep habits, inadequate nutrition, and lack of exercise, can impact mental health. These factors, when combined with a fast-paced and demanding lifestyle, can increase vulnerability to depression.Environmental Factors: Societal issues, including political unrest, environmental concerns, discrimination, and social inequalities, can contribute to a sense of hopelessness, stress, and depression among individuals. It's important to remember that not everyone in a particular generation will experience depression, and individuals' experiences can vary greatly. Additionally, each generation faces unique challenges and opportunities. Addressing mental health concerns requires a comprehensive approach that includes destigmatizing mental health, promoting early intervention, providing accessible mental health resources, and creating supportive environments. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or any mental health issue, it is crucial to seek professional help. A mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can provide a proper diagnosis, personalized treatment, and support."},{"instruction":"f I proved th","output":"Proving that Noah's flood did not cover the whole earth with water 4000 years ago requires understanding scientific evidence and archaeological findings.

Revenues rose from US5.4bn in 2001 to US19.3bn in 2006. It was easy for Jobs to focus on portable music devices but he could see that the growth in smartphones would eventually cannibalise the iPod.

But there are still many situations where other backend technologies, like Java, Ruby on Rails, and Python, are a better fit, depending on what the project requires. Ultimately, the choice of backend technology depends on a variety of factors, like the size and complexity of the application, the experience of the development team, and the priorities of the people involved.

There‚Äôs a reason Jon rode Rhaegal, whatever it ends up being. I know a new Dance of the Dragons, with Jon and Dany fighting it out like Aemond and Daemon or whatever, is a popular idea. But I‚Äôd guess we‚Äôre getting something like that already with those dragons and Viserion. I‚Äôm just not sure they‚Äôd do that twice, especially when there‚Äôs still Cersei to deal with. I wonder if the point of Jon riding Rhaegal isn‚Äôt so that he can ride Rhaegal to fight Dany on Drogon, but for Dany to lose Drogon, realize at a bad time that Rhaegal‚Äôs rider bond with Jon trumps her bond with Rhaegal as his mother, and for her to then end up dragon-less and have to continue pressing her claim through more conventional means like using whatever is left of the Unsullied and the Dothraki. She‚Äôd previously failed in Westeros with conventional means until she used her dragon, but if she has to go back to conventional means, then what? That would also solve the obvious problem of the North wanting to be independent; if Dany still has Drogon, all she has to do is set fire to enough shit until Sansa, if she‚Äôs still alive, drops her objection. But Dany losing her firepower levels the playing field somewhat, and it could cause a deeper animosity between Jon and Dany than even the two of them both fighting on dragons would ‚Äî she‚Äôd probably hold him responsible for the loss of all three dragons, and she really wouldn‚Äôt be wrong, either. She may even conclude that he knew all along who his parents were and tricked her into letting him ‚Äústeal‚Äù her dragon. Not to mention that Dany can‚Äôt wage war too aggressively against the North if Jon has the last remaining dragon (I think Jon would use a dragon defensively, and probably wouldn‚Äôt want to use him at all). It also strikes me as being in line with the story‚Äôs humor if the guy who doesn‚Äôt really want the throne, doesn‚Äôt really want that kind of weapon and doesn‚Äôt really want to be a Targaryen is the one who ends up with the biggest symbol of Targaryen legitimacy ‚Äî a dragon ‚Äî while the Targaryen who actually wants all those things ends up empty-handed. Finally, any crazy-ass theory that involves Dany doing something shocking to try to get new dragons only really works if she loses the dragon she has. If that crazy-ass theory isn‚Äôt actually that crazy, then ‚Ä¶ Dany has to lose Drogon first."},{"instruction":"Why does noisecancelling headphones cause headache?","output":"Noise-canceling headphones are generally designed to reduce external noise by generating sound waves that cancel out incoming noise. While they can provide benefits such as improved concentration and reduced stress in noisy environments, some individuals may experience headaches or discomfort when using noise-canceling headphones. The potential for headaches can be attributed to several factors: Pressure Sensation: Some noise-canceling headphones create a feeling of pressure around the ears due to their design or tight fit. This pressure can cause discomfort and, in some cases, lead to headaches.Ear Canal Sensitivity: People's sensitivity to having their ear canals blocked or sealed off can vary. If you're particularly sensitive to having your ears covered for extended periods, it could potentially result in headaches or discomfort.Sound Reproduction: Low-quality or poorly calibrated noise-canceling headphones may produce distorted sound or inadequate cancellation, which can strain your ears and potentially lead to headaches.

How does one decide its important or not?","output":"When times were really rough, I would get my daughter‚Äôs magic eight ball. I would ask it, ‚ÄúDo you think we‚Äôre going to make it?‚Äù I would shake the eight ball and wait for the answer to appear in the triangle. The answer came back, ‚ÄúProspect Good.‚Äù My fear was over for a day. The magic eight ball said we were going to be okay. Then, the next day I would shake the magic eight ball again. This time the answer came back, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt must be a mistake,‚Äù I said to myself. ‚ÄúToday, it‚Äôs the best two out of three.‚Äù So, I shook the magic eight ball again, and this time it came back, ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù I breathed a sigh of relief, but I still had one more shake to go. So I shook the magic eight ball really, really hard and this time it came back, ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù And that about sums up the life of an entrepreneur, doesn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs a big maybe. Unfortunately, no one can tell you, not even the magic eight ball, whether or not you‚Äôre going to succeed. But there are leading indicators. Here are my eight leading indicators of entrepreneurial success: A. You have a great idea. Warren Buffett has a great way of looking at businesses. He always says if put a great team in a bad market, the great team‚Äôs reputation will fail. You can be the entrepreneur on the planet, but you will fail if you have a bad idea. You want an idea where you are 10X to 100X better than the competition. Or you want an idea where you unique and different in a meaningful way to your customers. But that‚Äôs just the start. Then‚Ä¶ B. You‚Äôll need grit. If you‚Äôre not prepared for the ups and downs of that you‚Äôre about to encounter, then you‚Äôre not going to make it. You‚Äôre going to be tested in ways you never were before. And what gets you through the tough tests is grit (Read: [LINKED_TEXT: What's The One Trait All Successful Entrepreneurs Have?)] [URL: http://www.brettjfox.com/whats-the-one-trait-all-successful-entrepreneurs-have/]. Grit is the ability to keep getting up, time after time, after you‚Äôve been knocked down. And, unless you‚Äôre really lucky, you‚Äôre going to get knocked down a few times. Grit is great. And grit is essential. But you‚Äôll need one more thing too‚Ä¶ C. You have to be fanatical about your business. Fanaticism is a critical part of success. You really need to love what you‚Äôre doing if you‚Äôre going to make it through. Fanaticism is one part obsession and one part grit. And you‚Äôll need both if you‚Äôre going to succeed (Read: [LINKED_TEXT: Why You Need Fanatical Cofounders] [URL: http://www.brettjfox.com/why-you-need-fanatical-cofounders/]). It‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre fanatical about your business. But‚Ä¶ D. You‚Äôll need to be able to recruit truly great people. It‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll get there on your own. You‚Äôll need great people too. So you‚Äôre ability to sell people on your company and your vision are going to be crucial if you‚Äôre going to succeed. Then, to keep these great people‚Ä¶ E. You need to be generous. How do you intend to split up your equity. If it‚Äôs like the great business philosopher and musician George Harrison said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one for you, nineteen for me,‚Äù that‚Äôs not going to work. You‚Äôre going to need to be fair and generous with your equity splits (Read: [LINKED_TEXT: How Much Equity Do Your Employees Deserve?] [URL: http://www.brettjfox.com/how-much-equity-do-your-employees-deserve/]). You‚Äôll also want to be fair and generous with the credit. Give your team all the credit, and take all the blame. You‚Äôll build tremendous loyalty. Oh, don‚Äôt worry about getting the credit. You‚Äôll get that anyway because you‚Äôre the CEO. Then‚Ä¶ F. You are appropriately frugal. Sometimes success can come down to having enough money to make it through one more week. And the way you get there is by being frugal. Don‚Äôt waste money on things that don‚Äôt matter. But spend money on things that do matter like hiring great talent (read: [LINKED_TEXT: Are You Being Appropriately Frugal And Why It's So Important?] [URL: http://www.brettjfox.com/are-you-being-appropriately-frugal-and-why-its-so-important/]). And‚Ä¶ G. You need to be an effective communicator. How are you going to convince people to join your team? How are you going to convince customers to buy from you? And how are you going to convince people to give you money? The answer is you need to be able to communicate. Work hard on improving your communications skills. It will pay off. Finally‚Ä¶ H. You don‚Äôt whether you‚Äôre going to be successful, but there are signs you will be. And that‚Äôs as good as it gets because there is no 100% fool-proof methodology of predicting entrepreneurial success. Sometimes you can do everything right, and you‚Äôll still fail. That‚Äôs part of being an entrepreneur. So shake your magic eight ball, work hard on improving your skills and hopefully the answer becomes, ‚ÄúIt is decidedly so.‚Äù For more, read: [LINKED_TEXT: http://www.brettjfox.com/what-are-the-19-wishes-every-founder-needs-granted/] [URL: http://www.brettjfox.com/what-are-the-19-wishes-every-founder-needs-granted/]"},{"instruction":"got a ‚ÄúNo Bootable Device‚Äù message on my late 2008 Macbook and I‚Äôm installing MacOS Lion 7.10.

EWS hypocrisy: BJP made a joke out of it by saying Families whose annual income is less than 800,000 Rs per annum are eligible. India‚Äôs per capita income per annum is - 144,314 Rs So, in other words ; an upper caste family earning 50‚Äì60,000 Rs per month is still considered poor. Weird logic. What next ? Racism in USA is because of the affirmative actions in place in US ? Seems like the UCs feel that way! This is what caste based privilege looks like : Btw, she did tweet : White lives don‚Äôt matter.

This is known as spot reduction. The body loses fat all over due to a mix of genetics, general body composition, and lifestyle choices. But, there are a number of methods that can assist you in controlling your general body fat, which may also lead to a decrease in face fat. Here are a few pieces of advice: Keep a Balanced Diet: Consuming a healthy, balanced diet is essential for managing face fat as well as overall weight. Consume full, nutritious foods including fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and healthy fats as your main focus. Maintain Hydration: Getting adequate water is important for general health and can aid in face fat reduction. Water can help you manage water retention, which can lead to facial bloating, remove toxins from your body, and keep your skin hydrated and healthy. Try to consume at least 8 to 10 glasses of water each day. Including Cardiovascular Exercise: Cardiovascular exercise can help you burn calories and encourage general weight loss, which may lead to a reduction in face fat. Examples of cardiovascular exercise include running, cycling, and swimming. As advised by the American Heart Association, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week.

Your facial muscles can be defined and toned with the use of resistance exercises, giving your face a more sculpted appearance. Reduce Stress: Long-term stress might result in hormonal imbalances that impair your body's capacity to regulate your weight. High levels of stress can trigger emotional eating, which can result in weight gain overall and on the face in particular. To assist lower stress levels and boost your general well-being, try stress-reduction exercises like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing. Get Enough Sleep: Sleep is essential for good health and can affect how well your body controls weight. Unhealthy food cravings and hormonal imbalances can be exacerbated by lack of sleep, which can result in weight gain overall and in the face. To assist your efforts to maintain your weight, aim for 7-9 hours of good sleep each night. Avoid Consuming Too Much Alcohol and Salt: Both alcohol and meals high in sodium can cause bloating and water retention, which can change the way your face looks. To lessen facial bloating, cut back on your intake of alcohol and high-sodium foods such as processed foods, fast food, and salty snacks. Perform Facial Exercises: Although there is controversy over the efficacy of facial exercises in decreasing face fat, some people feel that they can help tone and strengthen the facial muscles, giving the face a more sculpted appearance. Cheek lifts, jawline exercises, and neck stretches are a few examples of facial workouts. It's crucial to remember that results can vary and that consistency is the key. Examine Professional Procedures: In some instances, people may decide to investigate expert methods to get rid of facial fat. They might include aesthetic procedures like facial liposuction, which involves surgically eliminating extra facial fat. Before deciding on any invasive procedures, it's crucial to conduct extensive research and speak with a licensed healthcare practitioner. Last, but not least, it's crucial to keep in mind that losing weight in any area of the body, including the face, requires patience and perseverance.

Because Will Smith is still around and between him and Tommy Lee Jones, and all the MIB reruns we see on TV, the two original actors still own the audience of that franchise. It boiled down to a case of Hemsworth and Thompson simply suffering by comparison. As far as it goes, Tessa Thompson wasn‚Äôt the problem, in my opinion. That girl is funny. She can really do comedy. I laughed a lot when she was onscreen, particularly early in the film. But Chris Hemsworth couldn‚Äôt really sell it for me. I just kept seeing Thor with a haircut and a suit. Which was a little bit surprising, to be honest, because I thought he was hysterical in the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot with Wiig and McCarthy. (By the way, that movie unfairly got the shaft. The female Ghostbusters was FUNNY. Really. Give it ten minutes on video one day, you‚Äôll be falling off the couch.) So, from what I saw, Chris Hemsworth was a bit miscast. If they were going to go with a sort of unknown (I know Thompson‚Äôs not completely unknown, but she‚Äôs been a support character for the most part) they should have gone the whole way.

Not any other actress. (Not even Beyonc√©. I swear.) Here‚Äôs the real deal: Before each public appearance, I spend 90 minutes in a makeup chair. Three to six people work on my hair and makeup, while a professional touches up my nails. My eyebrows are tweezed and threaded every week. There‚Äôs concealer on parts of my body that I could never have predicted would need concealing. I‚Äôm up at 6am every day and at the gym by 7:30. I exercise for 90 minutes and, some evenings, again before bed. It‚Äôs someone‚Äôs full-time job to decide what I can and cannot eat. There are more ingredients in my face packs than in my food. There‚Äôs a team dedicated to finding me flattering outfits. After all that, if I‚Äôm still not ‚Äúflawless‚Äù enough, there are generous servings of Photoshop. I‚Äôve said it before, and I will keep saying it: It takes an army, a lot of money, and an incredible amount of time to make a female celebrity look the way she does when you see her. It isn‚Äôt realistic, and it isn‚Äôt anything to aspire to. Aspire to confidence. Aspire to feeling pretty and carefree and happy, without needing to look any specific way. And the next time you see a 13-year-old girl gazing wistfully at a blemish-free, shiny-haired Bollywood actress on a magazine cover, bust the myth of flawlessness for her. Tell her how beautiful she is. Praise her smile or her laugh or her mind or her gait. Don't let her grow up believing that she's flawed, or that there's anything she's lacking for looking different from a woman on a billboard. Don‚Äôt let her hold herself to a standard that‚Äôs too high, even for the women on the billboards.‚Äù Source : [LINKED_TEXT: I Didn't Wake Up Like This] [URL: https://www.buzzfeed.com/sonamkapoor/i-didnt-wake-up-like-this?utm_term=.hoJgXGMaE#.hu3LPk5M3] Thanks for reading :)"},{"instruction":"As a crossdresser, do you like satin silk clothes?

Here are some common investment options to consider: Stock market: Investing in stocks allows you to buy shares of individual companies, providing potential for long-term growth and dividends. This can be done through individual stock purchases or diversified portfolios like index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).Bonds: Bonds are debt securities issued by governments, municipalities, or corporations. They provide fixed interest payments over a specific period and return the principal upon maturity. Bonds are generally considered less risky than stocks and can provide income and stability to a portfolio.Mutual funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. They are managed by professional fund managers and offer a convenient way to access a variety of investments.Real estate: Investing in real estate can involve purchasing rental properties, real estate investment trusts (REITs), or real estate crowdfunding platforms. Real estate investments can provide income through rent and potential appreciation over time.Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): ETFs are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges, tracking the performance of a specific index, sector, commodity, or asset class. ETFs offer diversification, flexibility, and lower expense ratios compared to some mutual funds.Retirement accounts: Contributing to retirement accounts like 401(k)s (in the United States) or Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) can provide tax advantages and long-term savings growth. These accounts often offer a range of investment options to choose from.Diversification: Spreading your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, can help reduce risk and increase the potential for returns. Diversification can be achieved through individual investments or through investment vehicles like mutual funds or ETFs.Education and research: It's important to educate yourself about various investment options, understand their risks and potential returns, and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances. Remember, investing involves risk, and it's essential to align your investment strategy with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

Meet Mr. Paalam Kalyanasundaram..a librarian by profession,an ‚Äúepitome of humanity‚Äù by deeds.. Kalyanasundaram has given a whole new definition to the word ‚Äòcharity‚Äô. How often do we take out money from our pocket to give to someone who is needy? Would you help if someone you didn‚Äôt know came to you and asked for financial aid? Maybe not, or at least you might think twice before giving away even a hundred rupees note. We sometimes go to an NGO and donate some money or stuff and feel content that we have done our share of good deeds. We feel good about ourselves and move on with our lives. But there are a few people, very few, who literally dedicate their lives to helping the needy. ‚ÄòPaalam‚Äô Kalyanasundaram is one such person. This 73-year old librarian has been donating all his earnings every month for 30 years to the poor. Born at Melakarivelamkulam in Tamil Nadu, Kalyanasundaram took up odd part-time jobs to earn his daily bread and butter while he donated all his savings and regular income to those in need. With each passing day, he became clearer about his intentions to dedicate his life to the poor. He slept on railway platforms and pavements to personally experience what the poor of the country go through. He did not keep a single rupee from his regular job and lived a very simple life. All he did with his monthly salary was donated it to children and other needy. We work because we want a comfortable lifestyle and dream of settling down with the luxuries of life. This man was different; he worked hard just so that he could earn more money to donate. He did not even get married as he wished to spend his entire income in helping the poor rather than his own family. After he retired as a librarian, he even donated his pension of Rs. 10 lakhs! & also the 30 crores received as prizes.. Kalyanasundaram lost his father when he was just one and his mother raised him all by herself, inspiring him to help the poor and underprivileged sections of the community. As he grew older, he inclined himself towards higher education and became more passionate about helping the tribal community. A will to serve humanity has been 73-year-old Kalyanasundaram‚Äôs guiding principle throughout his life. A gold medalist in library science, he also holds a masters degree in literature and history. During his 35-year-long career at Kumarkurupara Arts College at Srivaikuntam, he diligently and willingly donated his salary month after month towards charity and did odd jobs to meet his daily needs. Even after retirement, he worked as a waiter in a hotel in exchange for two meals a day and a meagre salary so that he could continue to donate to orphanages and to children‚Äôs educational funds. He was amply rewarded for his service to humanity. The Union government acclaimed him as the best librarian in India. The International Biographical Centre, Cambridge, has honoured him as one of the ‚Äònoblest of the world‚Äô and the United Nations adjudged him as one of the most outstanding people of the 20th century. He also received Man of the Millenium award and Life Time of Service Award from Rotary Club of India in 2011. ‚ÄúPeople think that I started doing charity when I was young by donating clothes and helping people study, and they attribute it to a public cause, but I insist it was for a private one. The place where I lived was a tiny village with no provision for roads, buses, schools, electricity, and there was not even a shop to buy a matchbox from. I had to walk 10km to school and back and walking all that way alone can be a pretty lonesome experience. Hence, I had this thought that if I could motivate most of the children to come with me to school, it would be great fun as well.‚Äù Kalyanasundaram says with a twinkle in his eye. ‚ÄúIn those days, children could not afford to pay school fees which were around Rs5. I offered to pay their school fees, got them books and clothes as well.‚Äù Kalyanasundaram says money does not impress him at all. ‚ÄúOne can get money in three possible ways. First, through earnings; secondly, through parents‚Äô earnings, and thirdly, through money donated by someone. But there‚Äôs nothing more fulfilling than being able to donate money for charity out of your own earnings.‚Äù Palam Kalyanasundaram lives a simple life all on his own in a small house in Saidapet, Chennai. He never married for the simple reason that he did not want to spend all that he earned on charity. Even today, he comes to office at Adyar regularly and does whatever he can for the uplift of the underprivileged people.

But ‚ÄòHindi‚Äô is special because sometimes it does both, it unites a section of people and triggers another section of people. I am a Kannadiga, my Mother tongue is Kannada and I respect every language including Hindi. Nowadays, I am witnessing an increase in the hatred towards Hindi and North Indian people on Twitter. I regularly see such hateful tweets from my fellow Kannadigas. I am unsure of the exact reasons behind these tweets, but they often state that North Indians are trying to impose Hindi and that it is killing regional languages There are various reasons that have led to these feelings, as sometimes Hindi is given more prominence than other regional languages. However, I will not delve into these reasons. I understand the animosity towards Hindi, but it's concerning that while hating the language, people have begun to dislike Hindi-speaking individuals, which is a bigger issue. Recently, I came across a video where a North Indian individual removed black stickers which were on the Hindi instructions in Bengaluru metro and recorded it. However, some Kannada organizations threatened him and forced him to apologize. This situation illustrates how Hindi can trigger certain sections of the population. It's unfortunate that the individual was threatened and had to apologize The British once divided and ruled us, but it's disheartening to see that now we are dividing ourselves along these lines ,Hope God gives Sadbuddhi to such people. In my case, I have good number of friends from North India, what I felt was that they‚Äôre really sweet, good and kind people. They respect my language, They respect my state, They love my culture and We Reciprocate. actually I met most of them in a virtual library called ‚ÄòStudy together‚Äô during my exams and we became really good friends and we all converse in Hindi, as they don‚Äôt know my language but I know Hindi. (there are other 2 south Indian people in our group) we created a Whatsapp group of our own after the exams and we played scribble, ludo, Dumb charades and many other games during our holidays and also we used to talk continuously for hours together on Google meet. But Not even once did they make us feel bad, inferior, or anything similar nor we made them feel bad because of their language. (In this instance, Hindi brought us together as a group) We Respect them and they respect us back. Ultimately, We all should Learn to CO-EXIST, that‚Äôs it.

It‚Äôs always bittersweet, because what we are celebrating is much like Easter - the incarnation of Holiness and beauty in mundane form, brought into being for the sake of self-obsessed sinners who do not understand or appreciate the reality of that glory. I‚Äôve long said Jesus is Gene Therapy - a vaccination of veritasium and vitality which many of us refuse in order to maintain our own delusional sense of control. Christmas is nothing if not ironic - Christ is the cure for the false human condition we call ‚Äòtrue‚Äô. He is the ‚Äòpoison‚Äô we need to drink so badly (as Nietzsche might say), a babe born to die whose actualisation of the Akedah rends and reveals the heart of God in the same way the Curtain is torn in the Temple. My favourite sculpture: mother and child as they might have been in the beginning. The only difference is time. With such themes in mind, our family is experiencing an oddly blessed Christmas - we all have CoViD! How can this be good? Well, we were prepared. My wife and I are vaccinated, we are healthy, and we are all over it after 3 days. More importantly, our giant 6-year-old had croup from it for two days and is now running around the house happily. We don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre going to do with him for the rest of the isolation period! Our house looks like this right now: In a way, this is an answer to prayer in the same way John the Baptist served as the returned form of Elijah - not what one might expect (in the same way Christ is not the model of the Messiah that many were waiting for) but a blessing nonetheless. Our sufferings are unmentionably small, we have been beautifully supported by our family and church, and we have time together that cannot possibly be interrupted by my work (because I am not allowed to work!). Through the via dolorosa God makes the crooked straight via His own example of suffering. Christ immunises us against our own lack of insight, Himself being the ironic ‚Äòenemy‚Äô we ought to love, whose own graciousness to those who harm Him ends the inflammatory cycle that drives mankind‚Äôs malignancy of autoimmune origin. The blame game in biochemical terms. Instead of healing, there is infinite attack caused by the acceptance of a false genetic message. ‚ÄúThe woman you put here gave it to me‚Ä¶‚Äù, as the original failing husband might protest. Hence, this Christmas we are literally reminded of the goodness of God in the form of failure. Vulnerability has made us gentle with each other, weakness has made us seek to serve (our little guy has literally said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm mummy‚Äôs servant while she‚Äôs sick!‚Äô), and isolation has made our connections more obvious. After all, we are Christians - the greatest fools in history (as Paul might say). We worship a suffering saviour, a dying God, and celebrate the infant birth of a human sacrifice in the same way we welcome a fever as a sign that we are not immunosuppressed. On the contrary, we are already made well by the Healing Fire, and the Sword that divides the pathological from the proper.

And let me be upfront and straight, saying Diwali or Deepavali is festival of all Indian‚Äôs or it is core to Indian culture is absolutely wrong. It is like saying Christmas is the festival for all religion. Diwali for all matter and purposes is a HINDU FESTIVAL. It‚Äôs origins are linked to Ramyana‚Äôs central character Rama, so unless, Muslim‚Äôs, Christian‚Äôs, Parsi's and Jews, subscribe to Ramayana and Ram, Diwali is strictly a Hindu custom and there is nothing pan-Indian, and nor does it span multiple religion, multiple value systems or multiple geographies as has been falsely claimed by the proponents of Hindu Rashtra. That said if Narendra Modi does not make spectacle of his religiosity and his beliefs, then whether he is a Prime Minister or a private citizen, it should not matter, he is perfectly within his rights do anything i.e..celebrate any festival within the confines of his privacy. But the problem is when he makes public display of his faith, he clearly wears his BIAS, and this becomes more pronounced when he refuses to partake in celebrating events organized by other faiths. As an elected representative and Prime Minister of a Democratic Nation the onus lies on him to represent everyone, and he obviously cannot or should not show bias. After all we all pay taxes and obey law of the land equally irrespective of our religion, don't we? Also this whole OPTICS of going and celebrating Religious Festivals with Armed Forces is completely unnecessary. Thus far, Indian Armed Forces have remained completely insular to Religious identities, but Modi‚Äôs selective celebration could well change all that. It has the potential to create rift, feeling of being secondary. We don‚Äôt want that feeling to persist amongst our jawan's who are battling against all odds. As a former cadet/student from one of the nations foremost military academy, I can vouch that feeling of being treated as secondary does not augur well for men in the uniform. We should not forget, the mutiny of 1857 was started precisely on these very grounds, RELIGIOUS BIAS, and not out of nationalistic fervor [LINKED_TEXT: Religion and retribution in the Indian rebellion of 1857] [URL: http://www.academia.edu/772317/Religion_and_retribution_in_the_Indian_rebellion_of_1857] First by using DGMO has his Government‚Äôs mouthpiece and now by unwittingly sowing rift amongst its cadres (on the basis of religion), Narendra Modi may inadvertently end up SCREWING that one institution, which has remained truly secular till date. I hope next time, before clamoring to create grand Optics Prime Minister Narendra Modi reads these excerpts that I have borrowed from a well-known retired Army officers Diary: ‚ÄúIt is well known that our troops mostly come from rural backgrounds and are religious by nature. Even India's troops from urban backgrounds and educated families have deep-rooted faith in their religions. As a result, religion forms an important part of a soldier's life. His faith inclines him to uphold his religious ideology, including his moral and ethical duties. Daily practice of his faith makes him a better human being. It helps in promoting self-discipline, reduces the stress factor of a soldier and overcomes the feeling of loneliness. Besides, religion is also considered as the single most important battle-winning factor. As with other modern armies, the Indian army has striven to meet the religious needs of all soldiers of all faiths in a harmonious [LINKED_TEXT: spirit Resources and Information.] [URL: http://spirit.in/] 2002, there were 980,000 active troops and 800,000 reservists in our army. It is observed that most of us tend to overlook the broader aspects of a religion and generally look at it from a narrow angle like a selfish man. We must not forget that as true Indians and responsible citizens we should treat all persons in the society alike irrespective of caste, creed or religion. Like a military commander or a true leader, we should lead from the front and take the masses along, or else, the country is bound to disintegrate. Therefore, we in the Armed Forces can ill afford to lose sight of this vital aspect and must always keep a close watch for any secessionist elements or divisive forces that may have crept in within the forces. Even though we in India pursue multiple religious faiths and at times fight with each other on petty issues, yet in times of national crisis or in the event of any foreign aggression, the people of our country have always displayed great solidarity and stood by the Armed Forces like a totally galvanized nation in the true spirit of national integration.‚Äù Lt.

It‚Äôs not just that she was the right casting for Captain Marvel, it‚Äôs that she was able to capture Captain Marvel at different points in development. Whether she is playing Vers, Carol, or Captain Marvel, she manages to keep just enough that you don‚Äôt doubt they are all the same person, she alters the mannerisms to fit her different identities. As Vers, she forces herself into stoicism, with her quips slipping out. As Carol, she doesn‚Äôt hold back, she is free and open, and Captain Marvel is what she becomes when she blends the two. We even see the change happen as she lands on Earth; the more she spends time on earth, the more human she becomes, letting bits of Carol slip slowly back in while still building to the moment of truth where she becomes Captain Marvel. It‚Äôs masterfully done, and I applaud Brie Larson wholeheartedly."},{"instruction":"What purpose did it serve by sending dying Voyager 1 and 2 to endless interstellar space with no destination and no power to relay signals?","output":"Others have anwsered this question more thouroughly than I can.

Thus the extended mission of voyager began. They also managed to get the infamous 'pale blue dot‚Äô photo, which to me is a pretty amazing thing Primarily, after their initial mission was complete, they've given us data about the heliosphere of the sun. Information we would have had to build and launch another probe (or probes) to collect if not for voyager one and two. As it stands, due to the unique alignment of the planets at the time of their launch, the 2 voyager probes were able to achieve a pretty increadably rate of travel for less fuel than it would have cost at any other time. So to sum it up, an opertunity came around to extend the voyager missions, and it's not like we were ever gonna get those probes back any way.

It is famously known for being unwinnable, as its purpose is to assess how individuals handle failure and respond to difficult situations. As an android and a highly advanced artificial intelligence, Data, from Star Trek: The Next Generation, possesses exceptional cognitive abilities, vast knowledge, and superior analytical skills. These traits would certainly give Data an advantage in facing the Kobayashi Maru simulation. However, passing the Kobayashi Maru does not mean finding a way to win the scenario outright. The test's purpose is to evaluate a cadet's ability to make difficult choices under extreme circumstances and to demonstrate their character and leadership qualities. The true measure of success in the Kobayashi Maru is not winning but rather how the cadet handles the no-win situation. Data's logical thinking and capacity for objective decision-making could potentially allow him to navigate the test more effectively than others. He could employ his analytical abilities to assess the situation, identify the best course of action given the constraints, and execute it with precision. Data's lack of emotions might also help him remain calm and focused in the face of overwhelming odds. However, it's worth noting that the Kobayashi Maru is designed to challenge individuals on an emotional and psychological level, testing their resilience and ability to cope with failure. Data, despite his superior intellect, lacks emotions and the associated experiences that come with them. This aspect of his nature might be seen as a potential disadvantage since the test aims to evaluate emotional responses and moral decision-making as well. In summary, while Data's exceptional abilities and logical thinking could enhance his performance in the Kobayashi Maru simulation, passing the test would still be a challenge. Success in the scenario goes beyond winning, and Data's lack of emotions might be viewed as a limitation when assessing his overall performance."},{"instruction":"Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?","output":"In Nam it sometimes happened, but in the muddle east with various clandestine organizations putting spiked rounds (ammo loaded with high explosives in place of gunpowder) in the enemy‚Äôs supplies, it was a risky process."},{"instruction":"Am I wrong in believing that both Democrats and Republicans have poisoned the well by using prejorative terms like communist, fascist, Russian bot, Chinese bot, etc.?","output":"It's not unusual for political parties to make derogatory statements about each other.

Me and some friends had located an old camp dump near Kadena Air Field. It was on the side of a ravine. We started digging back into the trash, finding old combat boots, M1 clips, broken K-bar knives, morphine styrettes and other interesting things. I was digging and found a rusty metal knot that had tree metal prongs sticking up from it. I carefully cleaned them and then kept digging. The knob was on the top of a rounded domed object about 8-9 inches in circumference. I all of a sudden realized it might be an old land mine. I told the other guys we should vacate the area and we did, but my curiosity got the best of me and I went back and continued to dig. I finally got the thing out of the ground and was relieved to find that it was only an old broken circular headlight turned upside down. The rusted knob was only the three electrical prongs for hooking it to the wiring harness. On another occasion while on a boy scout camping trip, I did find an old 60 mm mortar round sticking up from the ground, embedded in the hard clay. I tried to dig it up, but realized that it was a dud and could probably go off so left it where it was. On two separate occasions I found knives that in hindsight were probably used in a crime. One was in an old sand quarry east of Virginia Beach, Va. I was doing a geological investigation of the pit, and stepped into some quicksand along the border of the drainage ditch that was used to dewater the pit. I threw myself backward to avoid sinking and there in front of me lay a very nice and high dollar butcher knife. Apparently someone wanted to dispose of the thing by throwing it into the water filled ditch, but it landed on solid ground instead. Later I found a very nice folding Case knife lying under a car in the parking lot of a shopping center in Norfolk Va. The knife was open and had a few what looked like blood stains on it.

Forget the tourist attraction of the scarlet tunics and Bearskin hats: These dudes are serious soldiers - the British Army‚Äôs Foot Guards. Foot Guards comprises 5 infantry Regiments: Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards. The Household Division also includes the Household Cavalry: Blues and Royals and Life Guards. We‚Äôll leave them out for the time being, and concentrate on the Foot Guards. In case anyone thinks they‚Äôre there just for show, read this: They are armed with L85A3 assault rifles. Those weapons are ‚Äúloaded‚Äù - in other words, they carry a full magazine of 30 x 5.56mm rounds. A Guardsman has only to activate the cocking-handle, and he‚Äôs ready to fire. On Public Duties (Buckingham Palace Guard) their rifles are fitted with bayonets. This is another traditional piece of military hardware which is instantly - and legally - deployable if a Guardsman judges that there is a threat to the Sovereign‚Äôs person. And it has been so deployed in fairly recent times. When not on Public Duties rotation, Guardsmen are standard British infantry soldiers. In recent times, they deployed regularly to Afghanistan, where they conducted routine infantry taskings and earned their keep as frontline soldiers. They alternate Light, Mechanised and Infantry roles as required. Identifying Guards Regiments is easy.

I would suggest that, moving at low speeds, a 2x4 is not pointy. However, at only a hundred miles an hour or so, that 2x4 is pointy enough that it can do this to a tree. At that trajectory, the endgrain of the 2x4 is enough harder than the vertical grain of the palm tree that it shoots halfway through like an arrow hitting a branch. The purpose of a bullet is to fly straight enough to cause damage to the thing at which you aimed it. Flatter bullets hit harder and don‚Äôt go as far because they squish more when you hit the thing (believe it or not, as metals go, lead is very soft and squishy). Pointier bullets made of harder materials transfer less energy (keeping more for themselves), rip right through what they hit, and keep on going until they hit something harder and heavier than them that forces them to stop (the ground, a wall, another couple of people‚Ä¶). However, most bullets are still going well upwards of 500mph. At the speed they‚Äôre going, all of them are more than pointy enough to stay along a ballistic flight path without tumbling overmuch, especially when fired from a rifled barrel (since conservation of angular momentum is a thing).

EMOTIONAL AND SWEET, ‚ÄòDIL BECHARA‚Äô WILL SURELY MAKE YOU CRY Casting director turned director Mukesh Chhabra bases his film on the acclaimed novel The Fault in Our Stars by John Green, making you miss your beat so many times Don‚Äôt watch this film because it reminds you of Sushant Singh Rajput with grief. Don‚Äôt watch this one because this is his last film. But watch it because it‚Äôs a genuinely likeable film. If you have read the novel and have watched the Hollywood version of the story, high chances are that you‚Äôll compare. Naturally. Looking at the story solely, Dil Bechara in all its worth encapsulates the essence, beautifully. And that‚Äôs a very good reason of why this one should be watched. Ofcourse, it does come with fair share of flaws, some that can‚Äôt be ignored. This is a film however that will thoroughly make you sad, right from the first slide to the last shot. If the story was anything but this, probably probably probably it wouldn‚Äôt have made you this sad. Sushant Singh Rajput, Sanjana Sanghi, and director Mukesh Chhabra on sets PLOT Kizie Basu (Sanjana Sanghi) suffers from thyroid cancer. Dejected in life, she has nothing to cheer about. She happens to meet a jovial but annoying man Emmanual Rajkumar Junior aka Manny (Sushant Singh Rajput). Manny has had osteosarcoma, owing to which he has lost one of his legs and now is aided by an artificial/prosthetic leg. Kizie gets eventually happy in life, all thanks to Manny. But what happens when they have to encounter the rationalities of their existence? PERFORMANCES Sushant Singh Rajput has always been a terrific actor. Here also, he rules the frames he is in. And when he‚Äôs not there, you want him to appear. He is so so good that you just can‚Äôt take your eyes off him. The manner in which he speaks certain dialogues, are so unbelievably difficult. Small lines, those hidden expressions with eyes and lips, and some unexpected notions. But he makes them look so easy. Manny is a filmy person, a fan of Rajnikanth, mouthing dialogues from Hindi films. Sushant delivers these punches like a boss. He commands respect in the scenes. A lot of the film is watchable and becomes of a worthy nature because of his genius as an actor. Do notice the limp that he maintains all through, brilliantly, adding to the character mannerism, even in the title track. Sanjana Sanghi is also quite good, except for the hardcore emotional scenes. She has a breezy approach towards the narrative. She looks lovely to watch, she contributes well as the film is told through her perspective. If only she was better in emotional scenes (which anyway are lesser making the film a little damp), the flavour could be better. Sahil Vaid as JP is good, in the limited scope that he has. He has proved his worth in supporting roles in the past and here also he does well. Swastika Mukherjee is very good, although she is capable of much more. She delivers nicely whatever the role demands from her. Saswata Chatterjee is also impressive, bending things for good for the characters. He is hence likeable. Saif Ali Khan in his one scene appearance is very good. You look forward to seeing him on screen. And he truly wins you over by his eccentric behaviour.

Even if you get tons of traffic and you don't know what to do with it you will not make money. Traffic is a small part, but it's not everything. I honestly feel the number 1 reason people fail is they don't know what to do with the list that they have. This really is where all the money is at. If I had to start affiliate marketing all over again this is the first area I would focus on. I would find the best person who knows how do this and either use him or learn from him. Only after the sales funnel is complete would I move on to traffic. Traffic is all about taking action. Not taking action is another big reason people fail. Maybe they want everything to be perfect. Perfection is tied to your ego. It's all about speed, put out content as quickly as you can, be as helpful as you can to your target audience.

It is obviously sexist, but I cannot see racist undertones in it.","output":"There are no racist (or sexist) undertones in the poem ‚ÄúIf‚Äù. Rudyard Kipling was born in India, and grew up with a more diverse viewpoint than most. He was proud of Britain at the time when it was the world's superpower, but he expressed many unique views, and used satire and criticism. He wrote \\"You're a better man than I am Gunga Din\\". He wrote \\"There is neither east nor west, border nor breed nor birth, when two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends of the earth\\". Mowgli was the hero of the Jungle Book story. This at the time of British supremacy. Kipling commented that the reason for military conquest was \\"we had the Maxim gun and they did not\\". In \\"Fuzzy Wuzzy\\" he wrote: \\" We ‚Äôeld our bloomin‚Äô own, the papers say, But man for man the Fuzzy knocked us ‚Äôoller. Then ‚Äôere ‚Äôs to you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, an‚Äô the missis and the kid; Our orders was to break you, an‚Äô of course we went an‚Äô did. We sloshed you with Martinis, an‚Äô it was n‚Äôt ‚Äôardly fair; But for all the odds agin‚Äô you, Fuzzy-Wuz, you broke the square. \\" At a time when imperialists might talk about supremacy, he talked about reality, and wrote many poems from the viewpoint of the front-line soldiers, and admitted the defeats. His poem about \\"Thomas Atkins\\" describes the contempt between the aristocracy and the foot soldiers , except in times of war, when they went from \\"Tommies\\" to \\"heroes\\". In his poem, \\"The Last Charge of the Light Brigade\\", he takes the \\"heroes\\" of the Tennyson poem and describes how life treated the survivors twenty years later, starving on the streets. Kipling was definitely a supporter of his country, but he was not a \\"racist\\". He was using his skills to point out what was wrong, and find ways to fix the problems. I respect Kipling's opinions, and the way he expressed them. If you take a few surface words out of context you can justify any criticism you want, but if you read his works in depth, you get a different view of the man."},{"instruction":"Where can one find the best biryani in bangalore?","output":"Based on my personal experience I would suggest MAA KA DULAAR for the best homemade biryani in Bengaluru.

Mean of the Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a probability of success (denoted as \\"p\\"). Let's denote the number of trials as \\"n.\\" In each trial, the outcome can be either a success (with probability \\"p\\") or a failure (with probability \\"1 - p\\"). The mean of a single Bernoulli trial is \\"p,\\" because that's the expected number of successes in one trial. Now, since the binomial distribution involves conducting \\"n\\" independent Bernoulli trials, the total expected number of successes in \\"n\\" trials would be \\"n * p.\\" This is why the mean of the binomial distribution is \\"np.\\" Variance of the Binomial Distribution: The variance of the binomial distribution measures how much the individual values in the distribution vary from the mean. The derivation of the variance involves considering the variance of a single Bernoulli trial and then scaling it up to \\"n\\" trials. The variance of a single Bernoulli trial is \\"p(1 - p)\\" because the possible outcomes are either 0 (failure) or 1 (success), and the probabilities of these outcomes are \\"1 - p\\" and \\"p,\\" respectively. The formula for the variance of a Bernoulli trial is derived from the basic definition of variance. When you have \\"n\\" independent trials, the variance of the sum of these trials (which represents the variance of the binomial distribution) can be calculated as the sum of the variances of the individual trials. Since the trials are independent, their variances add up. Mathematically, this gives: Variance of Binomial Distribution = n * p(1 - p) Intuitively, the variance formula \\"n * p(1 - p)\\" makes sense because it accounts for the fact that the variance increases as \\"p\\" gets closer to 0.5 (i.e., when the distribution is more spread out between successes and failures). It also increases as the number of trials \\"n\\" increases, since more trials increase the potential for variability. In summary, the mean of the binomial distribution is \\"np\\" because it represents the expected number of successes in \\"n\\" trials, and the variance is \\"np(1 - p)\\" because it quantifies the spread of values around the mean in \\"n\\" trials, considering both the probability of success \\"p\\" and failure \\"1 - p.\\""},{"instruction":"Why is there no cashew butter when there is peanut butter?","output":"You are mistaken, as there IS cashew butter.

The largest camp includes investment firms and investors who add certain \\"safer\\" cryptocurrencies to their portfolios after expending a minimal level of due diligence. For them, the The choice to purchase and hold cryptocurrency is based on FOMO, or fear of missing out, and a recognition (and willing acceptance) that the risk/reward determination behind the investment is similar to buying lottery tickets. Somebody will win, the logic goes; it might as well be me. The other camps, the sizes of which are difficult to determine, have done sometimes extensive research and have concluded that cryptocurrencies are either: A Ponzi scheme dependent on a steady influx of greater fools a foolproof way to get rich if you only stick with it, or The future of financial exchanges will change when crypto eventually replaces fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, which is backed by a centrally controlled federal banking system. They think cryptocurrency will provide completely decentralised financial transactions that free investors from the currency manipulations of sovereign nations and wealthy oligarchs. They also believe crypto‚Äôs blockchain technology will revolutionise privacy and security in numerous uses, from medical records to voting records. Understanding the basics There are three ways to acquire cryptocurrency: After opening an online account, you can choose from a staggering number of cryptocurrencies to purchase through a broker. Your purchase and sale of the \\"coins\\" will look very similar to any other security, except that the market never closes and the price fluctuation is both highly volatile and completely untrustworthy. You can establish a \\"wallet\\" to hold crypto that you buy from someone else using one of many peer-to-peer online access points. This type of ownership carries much greater risks from price manipulation, scammers, and a total lack of privacy (more on that later), but provides the free capitalist environment promised by an unregulated and decentralised exchange. Finally, you can create new coins for yourself by \\"mining\\" crypto. Every unit of a cryptocurrency, the \\"coin,\\" is the product of a created \\"block\\" (and every coin consists of a million smaller digital units). The block is created when someone, a \\"miner,\\" applies a significant investment in a series of highly sophisticated and interconnected computers and servers (the hardware alone may cost more than 12,000) and in computing power (sources report as much as 86,000 kWh in electricity expended per coin, costing as much as 5,000 in some states) to solve a puzzle that is automatically presented following the successful solution of the puzzle before it. Any number of miners attack the puzzle at the same time, and the miner who solves it first adds a \\"block\\" to the \\"blockchain\\" that evidences the coins the winner received for the solution. Blockchain puzzles get solved about every 10 minutes, and the difficulty level and coins won for each new puzzle are dependent on the number of miners who attempted the previous one. The blockchain is a digital ledger that cannot be altered, with each new block appended to the ledger in the order of its creation. The blockchain is available to anyone with the desire to download it and a server with enough memory to hold the entire chain. The blockchain is tested for accuracy through a \\"proof of work\\" protocol that verifies the blockchain by comparing the ledgers recorded across these numerous storage servers. If someone attempted to alter the blockchain to obtain cryptocurrency fraudulently, the redundant ledgers would uncover the attempt and discard the alteration. It is this decentralized system for tracking ownership of cryptocurrency that is supposed to provide confidence in its value. No one can say just how many such blockchain ledgers are stored for each cryptocurrency, how often attempts are made to introduce a fraudulent ledger, or how such ledgers are sorted out if several different versions are created at once. Considering the cost and fragility of the hardware, the unavoidable occurrence of human error and negligence, and the already well-documented fraud and theft related to crypto, any confidence in this decentralised governance's accuracy and valuation may be foolhardy. The limitations of crypto But let‚Äôs talk about the market for crypto. In spite of stories about a few countries and retailers accepting cryptocurrency, which have been debunked or proven insignificant, crypto may now only be exchanged for actual fiat currency or other digital assets in the form of \\"non-fungible tokens,\\" or NFTs. We are a long way from establishing the market confidence in the value and stability of cryptocurrency necessary for it to be used for the purchase of goods and services, bypassing fiat money. And that‚Äôs the rub: There is no reason to believe that even the most heavily traded cryptocurrency will ever achieve the price stability necessary for sellers to accept it. Today, there is no market for the direct exchange of cryptocurrencies, with purchases instead relying first on the liquidation of the cryptocurrency into a fiat currency. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats crypto as a financial asset or property and will treat properly documented gains and losses in crypto liquidation just like other assets. You may note that the 2022 Form 1040 includes a question about whether you have ever purchased crypto, even if you haven‚Äôt sold any. Which leads us back to privacy. Transactions in crypto are completely transparent to anyone sophisticated enough to review the blockchain. This digital trail will certainly be used by governments to track exchanges. It is already undeniable that crypto is being used in money laundering, ransomware attacks, and other criminal activities to avoid federal banking oversight. Even if the blockchains are secure, other crypto repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, have been hacked, with reported losses in the millions of dollars. Today‚Äôs cryptocurrency price volatility is absolutely untethered from any expectation of its use as currency. The volatility that crypto owners experience now is the product of rumour and speculation. This is why some feel that cryptocurrency is a Ponzi scheme fueled by stories of sellers taking advantage of the huge price swings that occur when celebrity investors and billionaires engage in promotions or whenever a new record is set for a crypto purchase of digital art. In fact, the only way to make money on crypto is to sell out when others are heavily buying in, since the coins have no intrinsic value and aren‚Äôt tied to any production or services. The rise of NFTs Finally, about digital art. Today, we see many examples of blockchain technology being used to create non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. An NFT really is a token, a stand-in for any digital creation one may house there. It could be a photo in the form of a JPEG file, a video file, a text file (such as a contract, a deed to property, a single vote for a political candidate, or a poem), or any number of other supposedly unalterable digital creations. The value of the NFT is not in any apparent uniqueness, since it can be readily copied, but in its actual uniqueness, because it is forever tied to its place in the blockchain. However, an NFT only has the value one might exchange for it, either in other NFTs or in cryptocurrency coins. For example, if I buy a NFT digital artwork for one bitcoin today (Bitcoin is trading as I type this at 38,686 per coin), the seller could sell that coin immediately for dollars or could hold onto that coin in hopes it will trade higher later. For example, Bitcoin traded at about 67,000 per coin on November 7, 2021, but also traded at about 29,000 per coin on July 19, 2021. What will it trade for next month? The Wild West All this is not to say that cryptocurrency as an investment and a method of exchange will or should be eliminated. Blockchain technology is an incredible advancement in the security and utility of information exchanges. Certain appropriate uses are already emerging. And investing in more speculative alternative assets is certainly an appropriate part of a diversified portfolio. But we‚Äôre in the Wild West of cryptocurrency today, and, like the Western territories in American history in which intrepid homesteaders traced the paths of the explorers, one must consider the inherent risks faced by early adopters."},{"instruction":"Why does my cat smell so good, despite me never giving him a bath in his entire life?","output":"Cats keep themselves very clean.

Almost 50% or 12 crores of these children are going to privately managed schools. The significant rise in private schools in India highlights the poor state of public schools and the diminishing faith of Indian parents in public schools. In the last two decades, private schools have surpassed government schools in terms of enrolment numbers. Facility wise in India, private schools offer a wide range of facilities to their students. Private schools have a lesser number of students in each class compared to public schools. Hence the students in private schools get more attention from the teachers. The teacher's recruitment process of private schools is strict, and they ensure that the best minds work for them. It results in better results and academic performances of students in private schools in India. Moreover, private schools in India provide a wide range of facilities to students that helps in enhancing the overall development of the child.

The Associated Press and Reuters are the two oldest and they have been reputed to be objective. Though they have biases, they are largely neutral. The BBC and CNN might be biased but they are generally considered neutral. If you are interested in specific topics and you want to get a neutral perspective of that topic, you can subscribe to the specific topic and receive articles from the most reputed sources discussing that subject. There are many news sources in the US but most of them have an agenda. A good place to start is to check the reputation of the media outlet on the following websites: 1. Sourcewatch 2.

But let‚Äôs not include him as it would be a sin to compare him with the likes of Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma etc. Same goes for Lord Balaram. I will not include Lord Balaram in my answer as he was divine and an incarnation of Adishesha himself. Mahabharata had various warriors who were very powerful and strong and had some amazing feats to their name. Comparing the warriors or ranking the warriors has always been a matter of debate. Loads of answers get collapsed due to the disagreement of some blind fans. But still I would attempt to answer this question which already has 100 or more answers. All my points would be based on BORI CE but I will provide the footnotes from KMG as it‚Äôs easier to find and read. Let‚Äôs rank these warriors on the basis of their feats and records. (10). Ghatotkacha The mighty demon son of Bhima had innumerable feats to his name but his real prowess was shown on the 14th night.He created his own army of Rakshasas out of his illusions. Such was the valour of those rakshasas that they made the powerful Karna retreat and defeated them. Ghatotkacha roared like a lion and terrified by this, the elephants exuded urine. The men were extremely miserable. Once twilight has passed, the rakshasas become even more powerful on earth. In every direction, they brought down a shower of boulders. Iron wheels, catapults, lances, javelins, spears, shataghnis and battleaxes showered down incessantly. On seeing the fierce and terrible state in the field of battle, the kings, your sons and Karna were distressed and fled in different directions. He defeated Dronacharya various times.He overpowered Aswatthama in a fierce fight using his illusions.His Rakshasas were very powerful and were killed in a very fierce fight. Why is he not ranked a bit higher? He was defeated by Aswatthama various times. His rakshasas were killed by Aswatthama. He never overpowered Aswatthama except for instance.He could not get an upper hand over Karna until the very last moment. (9). Abhimanyu The powerful son of Arjuna is already known as the bravest warrior from Mahabharata due to his extraordinary feats on the 13th day of Kurukshetra War where he singlehandedly created havoc in the Chakravyuha made by Kuru Army.He defeated Duhshasana in archery battle and the latter fled away from the battlefield.He defeated Karna 5 times and overpowered him once on 13th day. He first defeated defeated Karna and his brother had to come for saving Karna. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #btrAw] He defeats Karna then for the second time with the use of normal arrows and Karna fled away from the battlefield.

He fled on swift horses and the array was shattered. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #dtIRi]Abhimanyu then killed six of Karna‚Äôs advisors in front of him after overpowering Karna in an archery duel. This incident occurred after the incident given below. Phalguna‚Äôs son once again pierced Karna in the ear with a barbed arrow. Angering him even more, he pierced him with fifty arrows. Radheya pierced the great warrior back in turn. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Covered with arrows all over his limbs, he looked extremely radiant. Extremely enraged, he caused Karna to be covered in blood. Covered with arrows and streaming blood, the brave Karna was also resplendent. Both of them were beautiful with arrows on their bodies, and blood flowed from their wounds. Those great-souled ones looked like flowering kimshukatrees. Subhadra‚Äôs son destroyed six of Karna‚Äôs advisers, who were brave and wonderful in the art of fighting, together with their horses, charioteers, standards and chariots.

Bhagadatta He was probably the most powerful fighter who fought on the back of an elephant.He had almost defeated Ghatotkacha on 1st day of war itself.He was an important warrior for the Kurus and was very instrumental during Bhishma‚Äôs reign as General of Army.His Valour on the 12th day was amazing.His elephant had almost killed Bhima that day.He defeated a Group attack which had Abhimanyu and Bhima in it.

There are tons of better warriors than him. (7). Satyaki He is undoubtedly the most underrated warrior of Mahabharata.He had started creating havoc from the first day itself where he along with Abhimanyu managed to make Drona and Bhishma retreat.He defeated Shakuni various times in the war.Satyaki had defeated Bhishma in the war.He defeated Karna on the 12th day when he attacked Karna along with Arjuna, Bhima and Dhristadyumna. Karna was present with his brother so it was not a group attack. Then Bhima, jumping down from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent sword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna. Mounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna with ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna also taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and also Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince then, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna with three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson also, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow pierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And cutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more pierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king Duryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the Satyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it. [LINKED_TEXT: [7]] [URL: #XOvhB]His valour on the 14th day was just next to Arjuna on that day. He defeated everyone who came in his way and successfully penetrated the 3 complex vyuhas formed by Dronacharya.He defeated Dronacharya on the way whom even Arjuna avoided that day. Even Sanjaya cross-verified this fact just after this paragraph. Apart from this, he defeated Kritavarman, Jalasandha and almost every warrior who came in his way.Satyaki defeated Karna. Karna became very sad after being defeated and climbed upon Duryodhana‚Äôs chariot. Satyaki defeated Dushasana and various other brothers of Duryodhana and spared their lives for the sake of protecting Bhima‚Äôs vow.Satyaki defeated Aswatthama, Kritavarman and hundreds of other maharathas. Satyaki had various powerful and amazing deeds but these are enough to describe him. Even though, he is so powerful. Why is he placed at 7th rank? Satyaki was defeated various no. of times by Karna even though he defeated him twice or thrice.Karna defeated Satyaki 8 times in the Kurukshetra war itself. Such was Karna‚Äôs prowess that Satyaki couldn‚Äôt defeat him even though he attacked Karna in a group.Satyaki had a fair amount of defeats in his life. He was defeated by Jayadratha on day 13 as Jayadratha‚Äôs boon only included the 4 Pandavas.Other than these, I can‚Äôt recollect his defeats. You may tell me in the comments. (6). Bhishma Bhishma‚Äôs exploits as a warrior are well known. He had some amazing feats in his life but the problem is that they were overshadowed by his fair amounts of defeats in his latter life.Bhishma had the power to stop the flow of River Ganga.Bhishma defeated thousands of kings who had arrived from all around the world with ease, during the Kashi Princess‚Äô Swayamvara.Bhishma defeated Parshurama in a battle which lasted for around 23 days. The fact that he was defeated was accepted by none other than Lord Parshurama Ji himself. He in fact accepted this 2 times.He once accepted it when Bhishma had readied his blazing Brahmastra. He accepted it once again in front of Amba. Bhishma was among the only few who managed to defeat the mighty warrior Arjuna. Arjuna was fighting mildly against Bhishma. Krishna became enraged at this. Bhishma defeated all the Pandava soldiers and the Pandavas including Arjuna on day 7th. He was aided by Shalya.[LINKED_TEXT: [8]] [URL: #fvpgQ] He was invincible. Why is he at 6th rank? He managed to defeat Arjuna when Arjuna was fighting mildly with him. Check out the screenshot I had provided.He was made to retreat by Satyaki.Bhishma in his old age was not as powerful as he was in his youth.He had himself accepted a no. of times that he was inferior to Arjuna. (5). Bhima The mighty son of Vayu was among the best mace fighters of his era. His archery skills are most of the time underrated.He killed 98 brothers of Duryodhana in archery fights, Duhshasana with a sword and Duryodhana with a mace.He killed powerful Rakshasas like Hidimba, Baka, Jatasura etc.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling battle.He killed Keechaka with his bare hands.He killed the powerful Yakshas who were guarding the beautiful flowers.He defeated Dronacharya and Bhishma various times in the Kurukshetra war.Such was his prowess that he defeated Karna 6 times on day 14th itself. I‚Äôll provide information about all his victories. Don‚Äôt worry. Most of the times, being chariotless is mentioned as being defeated. This was how it was calculated by Sanjaya.Here, Bhima made him chariotless and forced him to ascend someone else‚Äôs chariot. The word ‚Äòvanquished‚Äô is clearly mentioned there. Here, Bhima again defeated Karna. He made him chariotless. Karna was afllicted by Bhima‚Äôs arrows and had to go on another chariot. Dhrithrashtra himself terms this as ‚Äòretreat‚Äô. Here again, Bhima was overpowering Karna. Bhima deprived Karna of his bow and killed his horses. Duryodhana himself thought that his friend was confronting difficulties and was going to be ‚Äòdevoured‚Äô by Bhima. Bhima again deprived him of his chariot and again Sanjaya mentions it as a defeat Bhima again makes him chariotless and defeats him. He even brought down the standard of Karna Bhima again made him chariotless and Duryodhana has to send his brothers to save Karna. Bhima even defeated Duryodhana a no. of times in various archery encounters.Bhima killed 2‚Äì3 akshouni or even more army of the Kauravas.He was more fearful than anyone else for Dhrithrashtra and for Duryodhana. A warrior who defeated Karna should be above Karna. Why is he ranked so low? The reason is that he was defeated a number of times by Karna.I will mention only one of Bhima‚Äôs defeat by Karna as the answer is already getting too long. He spared Bhima‚Äôs life here. Other than this, Karna defeated Bhima 10 or more times on 16th and 17th day. Bhima was even defeated by Dronacharya, Aswatthama etc. (4). Dronacharya The powerful preceptor was very powerful and had some amazing feats to his name. He survived for 15 days and did a pretty decent job as a warrior.He was one of the best strategists who knew almost every war formation.He killed around 2 to 3 akshouhinis of warriors.His skills as a warrior can be estimated by the fact that he defeated group attacks which had Bhima, Satyaki, Yudhisthira etc. in it.Such was his prowess that he defeated Arjuna on day 14 and Arjuna had to avoid him and attack other warriors. It is clearly mentioned there that Drona was invincible.[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: #aHqRO] Even though he had so many feats, why is he not at third or second or first rank? Dronacharya had fair amounts of defeats in his life.He was defeated by Yudhisthira who was not such a powerful warrior on the 14th night. Dronacharya used a lot of celestial weapons on him but he couldn‚Äôt defeat him. Yudhisthira countered every weapon used by Drona. Drona had to abandon Yudhisthira. Dronacharya was defeated by Arjuna, Satyaki, Bhima etc. (3). Aswatthama The powerful Brahamana was among the most destructive warriors. His skills were almost untouched by any warrior except Karna, Dronacharya and Arjuna.His feats are enough to show his ultimate prowess as warrior. He fought mildly with the Pandavas till day 15 but showed his real strength after his father was killed.Aswatthama was only next to Karna on the 14th night. He was destroying all the rakshasas and almost defeated Ghatotkacha.He killed the demon son of Ghatotkacha, Anjanaparva. He killed an akshouni of nairritas who were a type of rakshasas. He overpowered and defeat Ghatotkacha various times.Here, Ghatotkacha was made chariotless and Dhristadyumna, Bhima arrived to assist him. This clearly indicates he was overpowering him. He made Ghatotkacha unconscious and almost kills him. He caused all the Pandava soldiers to run away. Such was his valour, that he killed an akshouhini of Ghatotkacha‚Äôs demons instantly. His Narayanastra on 15th day made all the Pandavas, soldiers and everyone surrender it. It can be named as a defeat for every Pandava including Arjuna etc. Even Aswatthama told that they were defeated. Such was the power of that weapon, that it slayed an akshouhini of soldiers.Aswatthama then became enraged and defeated Dhristadyumna and Satyaki. Aswatthama even defeated Bhima even though Bhima had attacked him in a group. Even, the Agneyastra weapon of Aswatthama killed an akshouhini of soldiers. It had to be countered by Arjuna‚Äôs Brahmastra. I have already given you information about Aswatthama‚Äôs destructive power. He killed 4 akshouhinis which are proved by me. Other than these, he might have killed 1 more. A total of 5‚Äì6 akshouhinis were destroyed by Aswatthama alone.His Valour on the last day was immense. He killed all the remaining soldiers of Pandavas. He killed the Upapandavas, Dhristadyumna and Shikhandi in fierce fights. Lord Shiva himself had entered his body. Such was his prowess that Shri Krishna had to take Arjuna, Satyaki and other 4 Pandavas away from the camp that night. He is not ranked above because Karna and Arjuna were better than him. (2). Karna The mighty son of Surya was very powerful and was the best in Kauravas. His feats are enough to describe his prowess as a warrior.His performance in the Rangabhoomi was better than Arjuna according to Yudhisthira.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling match in a short time.He defeated all the kings in the Swayamvara of Kalinga Princess. They included powerful kings like Rukmi, Jarasandha etc.He defeated Satyaki various no. of times in the Kurukshetra war.He defeated Bhima 9‚Äì10 times and even spared his life once.He defeated Nakula, Yudhisthira and Sahadeva and spared their lives.He defeated a lot of group attacks which were done on him. He was the best when it came to countering group attacks.He defeated every major Pandava warrior except Arjuna in the Kurukshetra war (directly).He indirectly defeated Arjuna when he had used his Bhargavastra. Arjuna accepted his incapablity to counter it. Why is he not ranked above Arjuna? You will get all the information regarding this ahead. (1). Arjuna The mighty son of Indra was the most powerful warrior of Mahabharata. His skills were unmatched. He had no one equal to him in archery except Krishna and Balarama. His feats bear testimony to his strength.He killed 30 million Nivatakavacha demons using his powerful celestial weapons.He killed 1 million Gandharvas using his agneyastra.He defeated all the major Kuru warriors in th Virata War singlehandedly which included Karna, Aswatthama, Bhishma, Dronacharya, Duryodhana etc.In the Kurukshetra war, he was just at his best.He defeated Dronacharya various number of times.He defeated Bhishma a lot of times.He killed important warriors of Kauravas including Shrutayu, Shrutayudha, Bhagadatta etc. He was among those who caused the greatest carnage and destruction.He killed 7 akshouhini army on day 14th itself. Such was his prowess that he was almost incvincible that day and was only defeated by Dronacharya.He also defeated an angry Aswatthama on day 15. This feat was very difficult to accomplish as Aswatthama had already defeated Bhima, Satyaki, Dhristadyumna etc. Apart from this he had various feats which bear testimony to his strength. Now why is Arjuna ranked above Karna? Read yourself. I will provide all proofs from authentic versions. If you have any complaint, tell me in comments. Please don‚Äôt downvote or mass report. I have mentioned everything as it was given in the texts. Encounters between Karna and Arjuna. Arjuna alone managed to defeat Karna 4 times in the Virata battle. Contrary to the popular belief, Lord Hanumana was not protecting the chariot of Arjuna as the use of divine weapons was limited or very less in that battle. That battle was more about killing the charioteers or making them retreat. Arjuna managed to do that 4 times. Arjuna first defeated Karna when both of them were alone. Karna retreated after getting humiliated . [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: #VTLPq] This repeated once again when Karna came back after sometime.[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: #aStXP] Later Karna attacked in groups only to be defeated twice by the strength of Arjuna‚Äôs celestial weapons. First time, he defeated them with an Aindrastra [LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: #HJolU] and the second time he defeated them with his sammohana weapon.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: #fFIPx]They never faced in a full fledged combat in the Kurukshetra war except the last battle. Other that these Karna was defeated by Arjuna twice on the 14th day where he was saved both the times by Aswatthama. 1st defeat of Karna of 14th day. Drona‚Äôs son, Aswatthama saved Karna here by severing Arjuna‚Äôs arrow. In that battle, the mighty-armed Phalguna struck Vaikartana Karna with one hundred arrows that penetrated all the inner organs. The powerful son of a suta had blood flowing from all his limbs. However, the brave one pierced Phalguna back with fifty arrows. On witnessing his dexterity in battle, Arjuna could not tolerate it. The brave Partha Dhananjaya severed his bow and quickly struck him between the breasts with nine arrows. It was a time when speed was of the essence. Wishing to kill him in the battle, Dhananjaya then quickly shot an arrow that was as radiant as the sun. But as that arrow descended forcefully, Drona‚Äôs son severed it with a sharp arrow that was in the shape of a half- moon. Severed, it fell down on the ground. [LINKED_TEXT: [14]] [URL: #ZXMDq]2nd defeat of Karna by Arjuna of 14th day is mentioned in the same link which I have provided as a footnote for the above one. In this one, Karna was made chariotless by Arjuna and Aswatthama saved him. O king! At this time, on witnessing Karna‚Äôs valour, he drew his bow back up to his ears and dispatched Karna‚Äôs four horses to the land of the dead with four supreme arrows. With another broad-headed arrow, he brought down his charioteer from the seat of the chariot. While your son looked on, he covered him with arrows. In that encounter, he was thus shrouded. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. Confounded by that net of arrows, he did not know what he should do. O great king! On seeing that he was without a chariot, Ashvatthama took him on his own chariot and continued to fight with Arjuna. [LINKED_TEXT: [15]] [URL: #XhtIJ]Other than this, Karna was also defeated by Arjuna when Kripacharya saved Karna and took him on his own chariot. Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like an elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded against Dhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing with great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with wings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of Pandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna, filled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook it. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great might and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow on the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped from that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then the mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once more covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness of hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his own shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each other, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's feats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle that took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became exceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha, beholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle. And he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode with a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut off from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and Pritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with four shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts, specially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of Kripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in all. [LINKED_TEXT: [16]] [URL: #jxxvD]Karna was killed by Arjuna on day 17th. The battle was not dominated by Karna , it has been removed as an interpolation by BORI CE. He managed to break the string of Gandiva just once and not 11 times. He just overpowered him on 1 Instance. Whereas, Arjuna overpowered Karna most of the time in that battle.[LINKED_TEXT: [17]] [URL: #FvvjG] I have tried to answer your question in the best way I could. My appeal to all those who read the answer is to accept the facts as it is and comment and tell me if I have given wrong information. Please don‚Äôt downvote and report to collapse this one. I have consumed 2 hours everyday from last 3‚Äì4 days for writing this answer. To answer your question in short, Arjuna was the most powerful warrior except Shri Krishna and Shri Balarama Ji. My answer is based on authentic versions of Mahabharata which are KMG and BORI CE. Footnotes are provided using KMG Mahabharata.

In terms of overall perks, it‚Äôs well known that Amazon doesn‚Äôt really shine in that department. I‚Äôve worked on several teams and it‚Äôs common for engineers here to jokingly complain about how frugal the company is and how we don‚Äôt get any free stuff. Nobody here really cares about any of that though (I guess otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt be here and they‚Äôd be at some other hip company where they can get free massages or something). The overall prestige of working at Google also seems to be higher than that of working at Amazon, though it‚Äôs probably well known to everyone on Quora since every fourteen year old kid and his mom seems to want to work at Google. If by ‚Äúsecond tier tech company‚Äù you‚Äôre talking about the actual tech, then that‚Äôs where I would disagree. While Google is probably innovating more than Amazon, I‚Äôm not really sure you can compare Amazon and Facebook. Facebook is a social media and advertising website, and from what I understand their scope is still somewhat limited compared to the larger tech companies. They have some cool usages of technology, like the clever application of facial recognition, but it seems that all of their products are centered around their social media network and targeted advertising. Amazon, on the other hand, has the entirety of AWS, Amazon Go (the new technology that allows people to shop in grocery stores by just walking in and grabbing what they want without having to get out their wallets and pay), Amazon Echo, robotics, etc. My impression is that R&D is more heavily emphasized at Amazon, and the company is contributing quite a bit of technological innovation. So basically, it‚Äôs definitely second tier to Google in terms of prestige and to pretty much everyone in terms of perks. But from a tech standpoint, it‚Äôs doing pretty well for itself and calling it second tier might be a bit of a stretch."},{"instruction":"What do gun fanatics have to say about the fact that there are over 130 studies proving that gun control works?

To start off, Mumbai Auto Walas: As Mumbaikars we are conditioned to face rejections everyday!Thanks to the Auto Walas. Their ‚ÄòNo fucks given‚Äô attitude amazes me and many. No matter where you are, where you want to go, there will be at least 3 Auto Walas who will refuse to ferry you.Even if that means going without a ride, they reject your plea without any regrets. The city and its Festivities: Mumbaikars know how to celebrate a festival-any festivals for that matter. The enthusiasm during the 10-day-long Ganesh Utsav is unparalleled. People are busy singing and dancing as they move forward for Ganesh Visarjan. Just before Ganpati festivities would get over, people would have already started gearing up from Navratri. The best part about the Navratri festival is the dandiya and garba dance that happens in the evening where people come together and dance their heart out, LITERALLY! The popular Bandra Worli Sea link: A lot of Tax-payer‚Äôs money has gone into the making of this civil engineering marvel, but the reality is that the Sea link is not as popular as it was predicted to be. Eight years after it was thrown open, the daily average traffic on the Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link ‚Äî or the Bandra Worli Sea Link ‚Äî is smaller than a third of the original estimate. Also, post construction of the Bandra Worli Sea link; the time taken has reduced to only 10 minutes! Nonetheless, I think it adds a lot of touristic value and it indeed is one of my favorite places in Mumbai. All that hype about Women‚Äôs Safety in the city: This is one peculiar thing that bothers me all the time. Just type ‚ÄúRapes in Mumbai‚Äù in Google Search and switch to the ‚ÄòNews‚Äô tab and you will see a long list of such crimes. Let me draw your attention to one of the most heinous rapes I have ever heard, which happened in Vile Parle East, Mumbai in Dec 2016: A 25-YEAR-old woman was sexually assaulted and murdered at her residence in Vile Parle East. The victim, a physiotherapist, was found strangulated with a pair of jeans in her room and the place had been set on fire. This news was nowhere seen on National Television for a very long time and very few people actually knew about this. To add to this, I have also witnessed events of eve teasing in the city. Considering all these incidents, we can say that Mumbai is not completely safe for women. Relatively safe, maybe.

I short, yes, there are dumb questions: they come from uneducated individuals who refuse to improve themselves."},{"instruction":"Why are expensive private middle and high schools worth it? I guess a 1:6 teacher to student ratio is pretty good, but are the teachers better at teaching or is it just something that the affluent can brag about?","output":"Whether or not it's worth it depends on the results, but generally speaking it increases the odds of a positive outcome for your child, at least along the standard socioeconomic measures. It's a broad spectrum, but on net I would say the teachers are about the same as public schools though this will vary by area. Some areas have great public schools that can rival any private school, some areas have public schools that will cause any parent with the means to do so to pick up and move somewhere else. Compensation for public school teachers varies a lot by state and that will impact how the private schools in the area stack up. But the main difference is the makeup of the student body. It costs money that most people don't have, so by default it means most of the children your child will be exposed to come from the upper-middle or upper class, or at least be directly related to someone who is. And the children that are from the middle and working classes are likely from a well run and extremely motivated household. There is a barrier to entry, and those that don't measure up once they're in get kicked out. So less trouble makers and a tighter band in terms of intellectual ability and effort. That doesn't mean every kid there is a genius, far from it, but it can help reduce a common public school problem where you have struggling students and advanced students in the same class and therefore no one really being served that well. From the parents perspective, at a private school you're dealing with a competitive business and you have the power of being a paying customer. With a public school, you're dealing with the government. Want something to change with your child's education? Have fun being ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù at the next school board meeting held at 7pm in the gym, because that's about all you can do. You ‚Äúget what you get‚Äù with a public school. Some consider that a feature, not a bug. Sending your child off to a private school for a more ‚Äúcurated experience‚Äù can potentially have a host of unforseen consequences, such as your child becoming entitled and/or not being mentally and emotionally prepared for life in ‚Äúthe real world.‚Äù But for those that want a higher level of control over who their child socializes with and how they are educated, private school can give you that."},{"instruction":"What do gun fanatics have to say about the fact that there are over 130 studies proving that gun control works? Do they just deny the facts?","output":"Those studies are seriously flawed. I've read some of them and basically they conclude that X city/state has stringent gun control laws and an average ‚Äúgun‚Äù crime, ergo gun control works.. what about the cities/states with stringent gun control laws yet have higher than average ‚Äúgun crime‚Äù?? What about the states that don't have gun control laws and yet have low crime rates?? If gun control worked, every city/state with strict gun control laws would have low crime and every state with loose gun control laws would have high crime. This isn't even close to being true. There was a study a few years ago by a left leaning source that stated gun control wasn't working and identified actions that needed to be taken that would address the causes of crime.. I forget the paper, but I believe it was about Baltimore.. this has been stifled by the left as it blew up the left‚Äôs narrative. I just went wow! Someone actually took the time to look into the causes of crime, the WHY'S and it pointed out programs and actions that can be taken to address them.. I've been saying since the early 90‚Äôs that root causes need to be identified. Actual problem solving. If root causes aren't identified, you will never identify actions that will actually have an affect on the problem."},{"instruction":"What should writers know?","output":"Let‚Äôs answer this with a checklist: Writing for a living requires discipline. It‚Äôs a job like any other profession only you must be self-motivated to succeed.Today writing is a business. In the past, you might have had the benefit of a huge organization behind you, a publishing house with unlimited resources. If you are starting your career today, you will need to be a jack-of-all-trades.Pace yourself. Set up a schedule. For example, I‚Äôm currently writing from Istanbul, Turkey. That means at nine am here, you‚Äôre asleep in America. So 96% of my sales, on the average, come from Amazon, that means the USA is sleeping, I can write and not think about social media until at least 2 pm.Did I say be disciplined? I‚Äôm not. Some days I am, most days, I‚Äôm not. Why? My excuse is Marketing. You must become an expert at marketing, and that means‚Äîlike it or not‚Äîyou need to become a social networking guru. I‚Äôm in 3 places on Facebook, I have Twitter, 2 accounts on Instagram, I have a blog and a News Letter service. Never mind keeping up to date on all the official book sites that offer author profiles and expect interaction from contributing authors like myself. I committed to an online marketing course that I pay for monthly, and have only done the work on 30% of the program. Not good enough.You must be flexible. Writing for a living is a dynamic business. Most Indie Authors will tell you that one day a particular marketing program is #1, the next day, it‚Äôs no longer working. Develop author friendships, find a mentor, read and listen to the advice of those who are already successful.Read Review Interact with other authors. Take the time to learn from others, study the work of best-selling authors. Read the tops 10 in your genre. Study their book covers, their blurbs, their marketing strategies, their author websites, and most important: their writing technique.Finally, constantly be learning and improving your craft. I recently re-edited my Code Raven Series. I gave them updated professional covers, a more cohesive look; and once more, I re-edited the writing in each book to be sure that I was presenting the very best work for my readers and fans. I‚Äôm sure I could keep on going. But if you master the above, you have a good basis for becoming a professional in your chosen field."},{"instruction":"What are the common mistakes students do while preparing for GATE?","output":"Here are some common mistakes done by GATE 2016 aspirants which must be avoided in GATE 2017. you can check this at [LINKED_TEXT: Why students failed to clear GATE 2016?

What do you think about this?","output":"I mean, she‚Äôs not wrong. At least the trans woman is probably in the bathroom for an innocuous reason. I can‚Äôt think of a good reason a man would be in the women‚Äôs bathroom. Trans man explaining why he thinks the bathroom bill is stupid. The reason there is opposition to trans women, and it‚Äôs never trans men just trans women, using the women‚Äôs bathroom is the fear that they‚Äôre secretly rapists or some such. But if you look at the statistics, it doesn‚Äôt pan out. Yes, a trans woman can be a rapist, just like anybody else. But nobody is going to go through all the hassle of HRT, surgery, and the mountain of legal paperwork required to transition, just to sneak into a bathroom. It‚Äôs silly. He did have sexual relations with that woman. In comparison, there is a long history of men in positions of power, using that position of power, to extort sex from women. This is why you can‚Äôt have sex with anyone in your chain of command in the military. And why there was a recently a push to make it illegal for people to have sex with their interns. A proposed law that I fully agree with. The truth is, if a trans woman assaults someone in a bathroom you get a media circus and the book is thrown at her. As should be. If a male executive assaults someone in a bathroom, HR will probably cover it up. Because our society normalizes this behavior. So I think that Representative Ocasio-Cortez is 100% right here."},{"instruction":"Waters or Gilmour, who fares better as a solo artist?","output":"I think Waters is better as a solo artist.

If it is treated like alcohol as a recreational drug, then BIG PHARMA get the same ability to create drugs from cannabis but we are free to use it recreationally - and still get the medical benefits.

They‚Äôre allergies and they are what they are and they deserve respect. That being said, some people have really uncommon ones, such as the kid I used to babysit who was really severely allergic to animal saliva (something about bacteria and lymph nodes, I barely got the gist of it but it didn‚Äôt matter just so long as the kid was kept safe). Food wise, the weirdest I‚Äôve had is the surprisingly common allergies to chocolate and cinnamon, and the one guest who was severely allergic to chicken."},{"instruction":"The Mahabhar","output":"I saw many of th answers but not all ot them are accurate, so I decided to answer the most accurate answer. 10. JAYADRATHA *SURPRISED ?* He was the one responsible for ambhimanyu's death, and lets not forget he had given boon by lord Shiva that he can't be killed by anyone except combination of arjuna and krishna. It was impossible to kill him because of the boon also given by his father Vriddhakshatra. 9. Abhimanyu He was Youngest warrior in mahabharata He was only 33 years old when he died compared to other warriors who were 100+ Full armed Abhimanyu was impossible to be killed He was son of chandra (moon) So karna, jayadratha, aswathhama,kripacharya broke his armor and was killed in chakravyu 8. Ghatotkacha He was Half human and half rakhsasha. Ghatotkacha was invincible because of his huge body and power So instead of using shakti astra on Arjuna given by lord Indra to karna, karna used this astra to kill him. When he fell down after being killed, he took entire army behind him by falling on them. 7. Duryodhana His whole body was of stone except his waist area everyone knows why He was one of the greatest mace warrior on earth He was strongest of all kauravas and he was still alive for 3 days after all bones being shattered by bheema. 6. Aswathhama It is believed that he is avtar of lord shiva He is immortal because of curse given by shri krishna that he will live for 5000 years on earth He also killed all uppa pandavas (not in war) He is also responsible for abhimanyu‚Äôs death Being son of drona and avtar of shiva and immortal he was impossible to defeat. 5. Bheema There can be tie between aswathama and bheem. Bheem was spiritual son of vayu god and half brother of lord hanuman He had most kills in the war and he also killed all 100 kauravas . He was incredibly strong, he also had power of 10,000 elephants given by serpent king vasuki 4. Arjuna Here comes one of the greatest archer to be ever born on earth. He was spritual son of lord indra and had bow named (gandiva) given by lord indra. His charioteer was the god sri krishna himself 8th avatar of god of universe sri vishnu But remember he was victorious only because of sri krishna or else pandavas would be defeated 3. Dronacharya As i said pandavas only won because of sri krishna Power of drona is much more than arjuna He was 3rd incarnation of lord brahma and teacher of pandava and kaurvas. Full armoured drona was impossible to be killed he had sword name (asi) given by lord brahma He also had knowledge of all three astras- brahmastra, pashupatastra , narayanastra He was killed by cheating or kauravas would have surely won. 2. Karna Here comes the greatest man who ever lived on earth Karna was spiritual son of surya (sun god) He was given armour (kavach n kundal) given by sun god which was attached to his skin at the time of birth his armour was taken by lord indra but then also he fought vigorously. Imagine with armour he would be impossible to be killed He was disciple of lord parshurama and had curse given by him that he will forget all his knowledge at the time of use. He was insulted by everyone because of being sutputra (later found that he was not sutputra but eldest of all pandavas) he lived his life only because of duryodhana his best freind. 1. Bheeshma Bheeshma was immortal because of boon given by his father shantanu of ‚Äòichha mrytu‚Äù (he can only die if he is willing to) Bheeshma was son of goddess ganga. The power of parshurama (7th incarnation of vishnu) and bishma was same. He was also disciple of parshurama It was so hard to defeat him that lord krishna who became charioteer of arjuna, have to himself take out the wheel of chariot to kill him (because he vowed before war that he will not use any weapon to kill anybody nor he will kill anyone) so he broke that vow. Arjuna and shikandi penetrated 130 arrows in his body still he was alive because of boon. he knew that he was at side of adharma (sin) so refused to fight and died after 58 days of war when parikshit (son of abhimanyu) was declared as new king."},{"instruction":"EU chiefs have failed to clinch a deal for a new 96% effective Novavax Covid19 vaccine.

This decision allowed them to focus on a newer and more promising product line without overextending themselves financially or losing too much customer trust. Additionally, this entrepreneur chose not to compete head-on with their former product line, instead opting for a hybrid strategy that combined elements from both products. This type of strategic thinking is often required in order to navigate through uncertain economic times and stay ahead of the competition. By taking calculated risks and being creative when it comes to marketing your company, you can ensure success in any industry."},{"instruction":"What is a firearm caliber that will kill someone instantly?","output":"How about the Schwerer Gustav railway gun.

At the time, the market was dominated by cell phone companies like Nokia and Motorola, who focused on hardware features like camera resolution and battery life. However, Apple took a different approach by focusing on the user experience and creating a device that seamlessly integrated hardware, software, and services. They also created a closed ecosystem with the App Store, which gave them control over the user experience and generated significant revenue. This strategy paid off, as the iPhone quickly became a cultural phenomenon and transformed the entire mobile phone industry. Apple's shrewd move to focus on user experience and create a closed ecosystem has had a lasting impact on the way we use technology today."},{"instruction":"Why does everyone hate Captain Marvel for squeezing that guy‚Äôs hand?

Wells\\"The Martian\\" by Andy Weir\\"Snow Crash\\" by Neal Stephenson\\"Foundation\\" series by Isaac Asimov\\"1984\\" by George Orwell\\"Brave New World\\" by Aldous Huxley\\"The Diamond Age\\" by Neal Stephenson"},{"instruction":"Which 10 things should we stay away from in life?","output":"Waste time with unworthy people and useless activities - your life and time are precious and you should always act that way regarding any segment of this existence. You decide in which direction your life will move and what kind of life are you going to live and the way you use your time will dictate just that. Don't live a life where you won't be able to change for the better. Life is good, no matter what, so make sure to be surrounded by people that are not going to make things difficult for you. Being selective and prioritizing is of great importance in this short life. Work on your self-respect.Go to college - Be wise when going to college. Most of the degrees are useless. You have to see what is going to be a good long-term investment. The industry is changing quickly and we are not able to catch up. Most people don't have use from going to college. Today's education is limiting you and programming you to become another slave in the system. Do yourself a favor and take advantage of the internet. College can set you up for a wasted life. You won't learn there how to deal with real-life problems. You won't become adaptable and prepared for what different life situations are going to put you in. Life has no mercy, it'll eat you alive.Lie to yourself - Be as honest as you possibly can with yourself, no matter how much it hurts. You won't regret it. Accountability and responsibility are obligatory if you want to have a stable life. It will build your character and it will save you.Sabotage yourself - You have enough people that are going to try to get in your way many times, so show some love to yourself and stop contributing to your own destruction. Learn to have more patience with yourself and understand that you'll never be perfect. Live your life and stop fooling around.Eat predominantly unhealthy - Your diet plays an important factor in different areas of your life. It isn't bad to treat yourself from time to time with some junk food, but that shouldn't become a habit of yours ‚Äôcause the consequences are huge. Recovering from a bad diet takes time, money, and nerves, and trust me you don't want that. You'll realize that a lot of so-called professionals don't know their job and you'll be forced to take the matter of your own health into your own hands. It's a heck of an up and down journey that can be very exhausting and annoying. If you want to function properly be sure to eat a whole foods diet.Be physically inactive - Not moving your body will also affect your health badly. Today's situation puts us in a difficult position where a sedentary lifestyle is being pushed more and more. For that reason, we have to incorporate physical activity a few times a week. This is another thing that can cost us more than we can be aware of. This is also another habit that should be a priority of ours, without compromising. This is a great long-term investment and you don't have to spend any money for it.Procrastinate and be lazy - The regret and pain of these two habits are one of the hardest things to deal with in life. These habits breed illness, weakness and degeneracy. They are hard to overcome and many of us battle them throughout life. Their impact and effects are underrated. They should be considered a huge threat to everyone's life.Listen to others more than yourself - This is another cardinal mistake made by most people. It's no wonder why we have so many lost individuals. So many misled and misguided people. Your heart and mind are better guides than what anyone else can tell you.Compare to others - It's another thing that drags down way too many people. There's no point in doing this for the simple reason that we are all different. It's a waste of attention, energy and time. The whole point of the story is to stay focused on ourselves because each one of us has a lot of work to do. If we realized that we should be our biggest focus we'll see changes we could never think of before. It's a tough process but worth the try.Trust people - Trusting people gets harder as time goes by.

Whether you choose a public school or a private school, most critical is finding a school that will provide your child a solid educational foundation for future academic, career and personal success. Ensure that the school emphasizes the well-qualified teachers and smaller class sizes that cater best to students' unique academic and personal strengths and weaknesses. Finally, realize that there are good public schools and good private schools. In the end what matters is choosing a school that best suits your child, as well as the entire family.

It's natural to wonder why it feels like our prayers are going unanswered, especially when we're going through difficult times. But before we start blaming God for not responding, let's take a closer look at what prayer is and how it works. First of all, it's important to understand that prayer is not a magic formula that guarantees we'll get whatever we ask for. Prayer is a conversation with God, an opportunity for us to connect with the divine and to express our hopes, fears, and needs. It's a chance for us to listen to the voice of God and to discern what path we should take in life. So why doesn't God always answer our prayers in the way we want? There are a few reasons for this. For one thing, sometimes the things we ask for are not in our best interest. We may think we know what we need, but God sees the bigger picture and may have a different plan for us. It's important to remember that God is not a vending machine that dispenses blessings on demand. Sometimes the things we ask for are not what we truly need, and God knows this. Another reason why our prayers may seem to go unanswered is that God operates on a different timetable than we do. We may be impatient and want things to happen right away, but God may have a different plan that involves waiting or going through difficult times. We may not see the reasons behind what's happening, but that doesn't mean that God is not at work in our lives. It's also worth remembering that prayer is not a one-way street. We need to be open to receiving the answers that God gives us, even if they're not what we want to hear. Sometimes the answer to our prayers is \\"no,\\" and we need to trust that God has a reason for that. It may be that there's something better in store for us, or that we need to learn something important before we can receive the blessings we're asking for. Finally, it's important to recognize that sometimes the answer to our prayers is \\"yes,\\" but we don't recognize it because it doesn't come in the form we were expecting. God may be answering our prayers in ways we don't understand or appreciate, and it's up to us to look for the signs and recognize the blessings that are already in our lives. In conclusion, the question of why God doesn't answer our prayers is a complex one with no easy answers. Prayer is not a transactional process, and we can't expect to get everything we want just because we ask for it. Sometimes the things we ask for are not in our best interest, sometimes God operates on a different timetable than we do, and sometimes the answer to our prayers is \\"no.\\" But we can trust that God is always at work in our lives, even when we can't see it, and that the blessings we're looking for may already be present in our lives in ways we don't recognize. So keep praying, keep listening, and keep trusting that God is with you, even in the midst of your struggles.

These prayers are powerful not only because they were inspired by the Holy Spirit, but because they come from the hearts of people who knew the power of God and trusted Him completely. In this article, we'll explore 20 of the most powerful prayers in the Bible. The Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13) - This prayer, also known as the Our Father, is perhaps the most famous prayer in the Bible.

Charisma is the intersection of interpersonal communication and intra-personal (made that word up maybe) developments. Its not just how you communicate, its how you think about yourself and conduct your every day. Its not just being likable; its about displaying the type of interactions that are best for the occasion. Sometimes that's being authoritative or more a visionary or some other piece of the puzzle. And the best part: its learnable. Some of the best techniques for developing the skill is visualization. The more you visualize yourself in a situation, the better you feel prepared and therefore perform. Several high-level athletes use visualization as a process to help them prepare before big games and several CEO's use it as a tool before important meetings and talks. More than that being Charismatic helps with your public speaking skills.

Yeah, hundreds of nutjobs and con artists have made a living out of predicting the End of Days in the nearby future. Which troubles me because I do think that we are living at the edge of history: now, in the early decades of the 21st century. Not because of geostrategic reasons, not because of the tiresome scramble for influence and resources between the superpowers. No: rather because, at this point in time, the obvious downside of the Industrial Revolution can‚Äôt simply be avoided anymore. Humanity took a massive gamble when we gave up our traditional mode of production, the one we had been developing since the Neolithic, and quickly, in a twinkling of an eye, hardly two centuries, created an utterly new civilization. World population has grown tenfold in this time. There is no way back, now. We have put all our eggs in the same basket. We have all grown detached from our own survival. We don‚Äôt know where does food come from, we don‚Äôt know how does water reach our taps. We all live like stall cattle. If this sophisticated, global system fails, we are screwed. Now, if we look at this brand new civilization of ours, the problem is that it hasn‚Äôt proven self-sustainable. Not yet. It‚Äôs still too recent. Preindustrial civilization had survived and expanded for thousands and thousands of years, and it had proven resilient and relatively benign for the environment. It reached estability, at some point: if human population grew too much to endanger the ecosystem, famine and plague would restore the balance. Not now, though. We humans are unhinged. Industrial civilization has been growing exponentially for this brief period of time, and has hurt the planet more in 200 years than agriculture and farming did in the previous six thousand. And up to the current time it was all for the better: people have never been as healthy, prosperous and happy as today. But at the same time, the warning signs which the Club of Rome [LINKED_TEXT: had already spotted in 1972] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth] have only worsened. Yes, billions of people have escaped poverty; yes, China and India are developed, now. But at the same time insects are quickly vanishing from Earth, we are finding pieces of plastic embedded in our own flesh, the oceans are boiling, and the most accurate models predict that, in thirty years, large swaths of the planet will have grown uninhabitable. I wish I could ignore this kind of models as ‚Äúscientists want notoriety to get more funding‚Äù‚Ä¶ But I can‚Äôt. I live in an area where summer is growing visibly longer and hotter every passing year, and where the endless drought is becoming more like desertification. And it is terrifying.

Were the is absolutely no doubt about guilt and I mean not even a tiny minute little but, then into a chamber and pump in nitrogen and pump out the O2 and let them fall asleep without their body's actually realising that anything is wrong.humane and final. But the must be absolutely no possibility of a inocent person getting into that situation. And here are a couple of other opinion's on social issues, child molesters get put into general prison population none of this nonce stuff. Wife beater's and husband beater's get a judicial beating before any other sentence, so if sentenced to 12 months a well directed beating replicating the offense. People who are cruel to animals, prison. Do away with time off for good behaviour and instigate time on for bad. Build more social housing and keep it at a reasonable cost to rent and if people are on long term unemployment benefits fine but they must do local charity work for 25 hours a week be that volunteering at the local bhf charity shop or joining the local lifeboat or mountain rescue team.

My favorite relative (I‚Äôm reluctant to call her an ancestor, as she‚Äôs a great-great aunt) was an ordinary person who lived, to my mind, an unusual life, and I found that surprising, especially as I‚Äôd not known of her at all until I began to work on genealogy. Inez was born in 1853. She was 21 when she married a sailor, a man who worked on freighters / schooners on the Great Lakes. This was her wedding portrait: Two years after they married, he drowned when the boat he was working on sank in a storm. They had been living with his parents in Clayton, NY, but Inez didn‚Äôt stay with them. (I sometimes wonder why.) Within the year after her husband‚Äôs death she went to work in a department store in Watertown and learned to be a milliner. In 1882 she married again. Her second husband, a widower with a small daughter, was a barber with a thriving trade. (Wonder if the two of them met over people‚Äôs heads?) Inez left her job to become a mother to her stepdaughter. They must have forged a strong bond, as in later years they remained very close. After her stepdaughter was grown, Inez went back to work as a ‚Äúsaleslady,‚Äù perhaps in the same department store she was working in before her marriage. Her second husband died in 1904, and Inez continued on her own, working and spending time with her stepdaughter and her stepdaughter‚Äôs family, as she had married by this time. In 1919 Inez married for the third time. Like her second husband, he was a widower, by profession a farmer. They were together for nearly twenty years; he died in 1937, and she followed two years later. Inez didn‚Äôt do anything remarkable, really, but for that time (mid-to-late 19th century) and place (northern Jefferson County, New York) she made a life for herself and survived what must have been devastating personal blows, especially with losing her husbands. She never had children of her own, but was close to her many nieces and nephews, and after she married her second husband, maintained a loving relationship with her stepdaughter for the rest of her life. In 1918, shortly before her third marriage, she visited her stepdaughter, who arranged to have Inez‚Äôs photograph taken with her stepgrandchildren: I think her affection for her family is clear on her face, but the traumas she suffered have not left a mark. She must‚Äôve been a woman of fortitude and courage, but of genuine caring and love as well. So while I can‚Äôt say I was surprised to find an ‚Äúordinary‚Äù person in my family tree, I was surprised to find this wonderful woman who rose above her sorrows and never seems to have become bitter or resentful. She is an inspiration to me. Thanx for the A2A, Gary. It‚Äôs been a while since I visited Inez‚Äôs story. :-)"},{"instruction":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","output":"there are a few options you can try: Reverse Phone Lookup Websites: Several online services offer reverse phone lookup functionality.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you begin: Learn Programming Fundamentals: Build a strong foundation in a programming language of your choice, such as C++, Java, or Python. Understand basic syntax, data types, control flow, and input/output operations.Study Data Structures and Algorithms: Familiarize yourself with common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and fundamental algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming). Understand their properties, time and space complexities, and implementation details.Solve Practice Problems: Solve a wide range of practice problems from platforms like Codeforces, AtCoder, Topcoder, and LeetCode. Start with easier problems and gradually progress to more challenging ones. Focus on understanding problem requirements, designing efficient algorithms, and writing clean code.Participate in Coding Contests: Engage in coding competitions like Codeforces, Topcoder, or Google Code Jam. These contests offer time-limited challenges, simulate real-time competition environments, and expose you to a variety of problem types and difficulty levels.Analyze Solutions: After solving problems, analyze and understand the solutions of others. Study editorial write-ups, online forums, and open-source code repositories to explore different approaches and learn from experienced programmers.Practice Time Management: Improve your problem-solving speed by practicing time management. Set time limits for solving problems and aim to optimize your solutions within those constraints.Join Online Communities: Engage with online coding communities and forums like Codeforces, Topcoder, or Reddit. Interact with fellow competitive programmers, ask questions, participate in discussions, and learn from their experiences.Learn Advanced Topics: Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore advanced topics such as graph algorithms, number theory, computational geometry, and advanced data structures like segment trees and Fenwick trees.Participate in Virtual Contests: Join virtual contests on platforms like Codeforces or AtCoder.

She was a loner in family life and physically ended up as a slave to the other lady member in the house who was de-facto the CM. If only Jaya would have settled down in a married life, this would not have happened. This period and the events at that time are perhaps the darkest period of Jaya as a politician. A word of salute where it is due to Jaya. Karunanidhi as CM between 1995 and 2000 plunged Tamilnadu in darkness with power cuts ranging even up to 10 hours a day and Jaya on returning as CM wiped this out and even in this 2019 summer, there is no power cuts except of course a few minor ones Jaya got the World Bank to sanction the loan for the Chennai drinking water supply from Veeranam lake which is some 180 km away and brought by a pipeline just before she lost the elections in 1995. Karuranidhi became CM and promptly scrapped the scheme because Jaya should not get the credit. He did not bother about the 4 million people of Chennai. Jaya returned as CM in 2000 and promptly approached the World Bank again but they said once canceled it is for ever. Jaya did this project with a vengeance from her own internal borrowings and finished in record speed in 18 months. Today with all the reservoirs of Chennai dried out the drinking water of Chennai is from two seawater desalination plants which give 50 % and Jaya‚Äôs Veeranam scheme which gives the balance 50 %. Already this 100 % is supplied once in two days. But for Jaya, it will be once in four days. In this respect Jaya deserves a memorial like the famous Aayi Memorial of Puducherry (formerly called Puducherry) . As the legend goes, the powerful monarch Krishnadevaraya, whose Vijayanagara empire extended over most of south India in the early 16th century, came across a stunning building while visiting Pondicherry. The structure was grand, well-lit, and had beautiful carvings. Overcome by the majesty of what he imagined to be a temple, the king fell on his knees and folded his hands in respect. Some onlookers tittered; one asked the bemused king why he was bowing down before the house of a court-dancer lady, a temple dancer. Humiliated, the king ordered for the house to be demolished. It was then that the lady Aayi begged for the king‚Äôs mercy, finally offering to tear it down herself and dig a pond in its place. The king relented, and Aayi kept her word‚Äîthe tank she built supplied fresh water to the town‚Äôs people. A memorial was then ordered to be built by the French Government itself for her name in the city center and it is called ‚ÄúAayi Mandapam‚Äù and is the official emblem of the Government of Puducherry as under In many ways there are similarities between Aayi and Jaya in this, with of course Aayi standing out because she demolished her entire estate and built a rainwater collection pond and gave water to people and Jaya within her limits challenged the World Bank itself and managed to secure the money from internal resources itself and did this water project for people. In the end, let us give due honour to the good things leaders have left behind and forgive their souls if we have been affected-like that of Gandhi and Nehru who have left behind this permanent headache of border issues despite Bose protesting it."},{"instruction":"What is issuing authority in a passport?

I am the 26 year old on the far right This was taken in 2013 Company‚Äôs annual dinner in 2014 At The NEST I/O Incubator in 2015, sitting on the left At Alliance Francaise Karachi in 2016, bumping into two of the best ladies of Pakistan‚Äôs digital landscape The five year time period has been life changing. The physical differences may not be that significant, but the learning experience has been very different. In 2012 I was in my final year of MBA. I was someone who was lost, had no idea what future holds for me and was grabbing at straws to stay afloat. Underweight, isolated and not really sure about myself. In 2013 I landed my first proper corporate job and also gained enough weight to look ‚Äònormal‚Äô (from 56 kg I went up to 67 kg). The learning was immense and where I was lost and confused few months ago, I was now preparing marketing strategies and implementing them for the company both locally and globally. There was no better picture to explain my feelings for 2014. It was a year of stress and internal struggles. I am by default a man of my own dreams, and getting tied down by corporate responsibilities and family needs had brought me under severe mental stress. 2015 proved to be a life changing year. I left my job, started literature blogging, joined a tech incubator and even took a chance to work on my own startup. I also met a really great writer and learned a lot about fiction writing. As a result I wrote my first novel and several short stories, something I only dreamed about and never had the courage to go through. 2016 ‚Ä¶ it is still going on and the journey of experimentation continues. Learned a lot about life and business, made contributions to the tech industry in whatever capacity I could and I am active in both technology as well as literary circles in the city of Karachi. And all of this despite being an introvert person. There is one thing that I learned in these five years and one thing that I ‚Äòconfirmed‚Äô. What I learned is that life is too short to ‚Äònot‚Äô take a risk. If I had not taken the risk of leaving the job and do some soul searching, I would not be the person I am today. What I confirmed is that you can be broken only if you allow yourself to break down. The last two years, since I took the risk, I have gone through: Bombardment of questions of what I am doing with my lifeVisa refusal to pursue Creative Writing in UKFailures of all typesLong nights at hospitals as father went through surgeries and intensive careThe startup did not launch due to new government regulationsWatching from the sidelines as friends climb the corporate ladder, getting married, having kids and some settling abroadLived, for long stretches, with virtually empty bank account And a lot more that impacted my life.

Here are some essential factors to consider for successful sports betting: Research and Knowledge: Gain a deep understanding of the sports you are betting on, including teams, players, past performance, and current form. Informed decisions lead to better betting choices.Bankroll Management: Set a budget for your betting activities and stick to it. Never bet more than you can afford to lose. Proper bankroll management helps minimize losses and ensures longevity in sports betting.Avoid Emotional Betting: Base your bets on facts and analysis rather than emotions or biases towards specific teams or players. Emotional betting can cloud judgment and lead to poor decisions.Shop for the Best Odds: Compare odds from various bookmakers to ensure you're getting the best possible value for your bets. Even small differences in odds can significantly impact your overall profitability.Specialize in Specific Sports: Focus on one or a few sports you have expertise in rather than spreading your bets across multiple sports. Specialization allows you to develop a deeper understanding of the game and potential outcomes.Bet on Value, Not Favorites: Look for bets with value, where the odds offered by the bookmaker are higher than your calculated probability of the outcome occurring.Keep Records and Analyze Results: Maintain a detailed record of your bets to analyze your performance over time. Identify patterns, strengths, and weaknesses to improve your betting strategy.Be Disciplined: Stick to your pre-determined betting plan and avoid impulsive or last-minute bets. Consistency and discipline are crucial for long-term success.Understand Betting Types: Familiarize yourself with different betting types, such as moneyline, point spread, over/under, and prop bets. Use the appropriate betting type based on your analysis.Stay Informed: Stay up-to-date with the latest news, injuries, and developments in the sports you are betting on. This information can provide valuable insights for your bets.Avoid Chasing Losses: Never chase losses by increasing bet sizes or making impulsive bets to recover previous losses. This often leads to further losses.Bet Responsibly: Sports betting should be viewed as a form of entertainment, and it's essential to bet responsibly. Set limits and avoid excessive gambling behavior. Remember that sports betting involves an element of luck, and no strategy guarantees constant wins. It's crucial to approach sports betting with a level-headed mindset and view it as a long-term endeavor rather than a get-rich-quick scheme.

And while recovery efforts were underway, the Russia-Ukraine conflict aggravated the crisis further. As these events are expected to have a lasting impact on the global economy, many experts believe there will be a recession in 2023. Mild recession in 2023 The S&P Global Market Intelligence 2023 U.S. macroeconomic baseline forecast is now indicating a recession in the first two quarters with a recovery in growthe th in the real gross domestic product (GDP) in the second half of the year. Now lets talk about india and indian economy. \\"Thankfully, there is no such prospect of recession in India, because although our growth may be negatively affected by the global conditions, we will still manage to grow at 6-7 per cent in 2023-24. The markets have been abuzz with fears of a recession in the world's largest economy. High inflation in the wake of the energy crisis due to the Russia-Ukraine war first sparked the concern. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's advice that consumers keep cash safe and avoid unnecessary spending has reconfirmed fears of the US economy slipping into recession. The markets have been abuzz with fears of a recession in the world's largest economy. High inflation in the wake of the energy crisis due to the Russia-Ukraine war first sparked the concern. Large-scale tech layoffs further accentuated the fear. Jeff Bezos' comments come even as Goldman Sachs has forecast that the US will narrowly avoid a recession. Policymakers in India appeared confident that growth prospects are bright. Even as the finance ministry has kicked off budget consultations with industry stakeholders, Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar has said there is no such prospect of recession in India, though India's growth may be negatively affected by the global conditions. \\"We will still manage to grow at 6-7 per cent in 2023-24,\\" he said. Recession in the US will have its imprint on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's next budget. India is not immune to global recession or slowdown which impacts trade, commodity prices, and capital flows. Previous recessions/slowdowns tell that auto and ancillaries, metals, textiles, etc. have been affected, but gems and jewelry, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals have been rather robust, according to Kotak's study. \\"Historically, discretionary consumption items have exhibited more volatility than staples,\\" Kotak said in the report. \\"Lower exports coupled with relatively strong domestic growth (hence, higher imports) could risk worsening the external balance. Exports have helped push GDP (gross domestic product) back to pre-pandemic levels. We maintain our FY2023-24 real GDP growth estimates at 6.8-6% with downside risks in the near term given the external sector headwinds,\\" Kotak said. India could benefit from a recession-led fall in commodity prices. An implied outcome of recession would be lower prices as demand reduces. \\"In a scenario of a global slowdown, it is expected that commodity prices will correct lower,\\" Kotak said. While disruptions to exports might lower manufacturing growth and impact consumption to some extent, given the low dependence on exports, India will be a relatively favored destination for foreign fund flows, especially when compared to export-oriented economies. The past year has been a rollercoaster ride for the IT industry, with stock prices shedding as a consequence of the impact of the recession on the US and eventually all over the globe. The Indian IT sector has been dominated by companies from the US and other nations. With a high rate of recession beaming over the world, these companies have started layoffs. Leading corporations like Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have laid off thousands of employees. While the numbers still grow, many Indian conglomerates like Tata and HCL have remained steady in their economic growth despite the hardships. However, the ups and downs happen to different companies for different reasons, and relating them to a mere nation would not be the only factor. The economic data can be considered merely as predictions, events like the pandemic have always been a surprise factor when it comes to changes in the economy. The economy might take forward steadily, but the hiring numbers are still set to see a downfall leading to multiple consequences. Key predictions for the IT industry in 2023 are: Firstly, 20% to 30% downfall in hiring new staff. This major change is already seen in many companies, and while the window is still open at a wider range it can be seen that this window will become smaller in the coming year. Apart from hiring, many employees have started to quit their jobs themselves. The reasons for this consequence are manifold. Since the companies originating from the West are directly under the wrath of recession, they are not offering compatible job perks and salaries. Also, now that start-ups are seen to be growing even during a global recession, they aim to hire bench recruits. Thus many people have switched to finding freelancing jobs in India. Campus placements are said to take a hard hit during this phase. Campus placements are yearly rituals of companies to hire more workforce for their ever-increasing requirements followed by resignations. However, during an economic crisis cost cutting reduces the chances of new recruitment. Many are pairing up with contract resource provider companies that can assist them in working with freelancer workers on a contract basis as bench resources. This acts as a beneficial technique and the goal is to reduce expenses. Recently, Mahindra, Wipro, and Infosys were in the news for revoking their appointment letter to many freshers. This was after a waiting period of approximately three to six months. The act was highly criticized and many authorities questioned this matter. While the market leaders did not provide a clear justification, more than 3000 freshers suffered. The above incident portrays the unreliability of the hiring market in the coming year, causing a shift in expectations and choices, especially among freshers. Keeping aside the fact the world economy is currently under a dark cloud, the only ray of sunshine on all these downfalls is that the requirement for talent and work stays constant in the IT industry. It is a sector driven by technology, which has developments and improvements every month. Software that would have been the lifeline of many operations last year must have now turned into an outdated tool. With new technological developments, the requirement for a workforce remains constant. The methods of hiring might change due to the need for cost-cutting, thus a shift from hiring permanent recruits to hiring freelancers can be seen. These days the job portals are filled with openings for Java Developers on Contract, React Developer on Contract, PHP Developer on Contract, and iOS Developer on Contract. These openings are evident proof of how many companies require advanced tech support and economic slowdown cannot change the basic needs for a company‚Äôs functioning. Tips to balance recession crises and your company‚Äôs operations: Reduce the cost involved in doing business for your company. Work on customer service improvement and employee experience improvement. The goal is to maximize business with your current clients. Leverage technology against the costs. The recession which the world faced back in 2010, was different from today. We now have tech and tools at our disposal that can replace many high costing tasks. Focus on customer and employee needs and deploy the best-fit tools and tech which would, in turn, become a one-time investment. The current period is not the best time to take risks. The goal is to create a healthy balance and eventually set realistic targets for your company. The predictions show the possibility of a growth rate, however, it is set to be at a very slow pace in the coming year. Thus pushing beyond possibilities will only put your company at risk, focusing more on stability rather than huge numbers should be the mantra of your company. Focus more on getting the job done rather than the ‚Äòwho does the job. Many companies are stuck with the idea of hiring the best freshers from top colleges. While the same would require competitive packages, your company might not be in the place to offer the same. This ends up making you limited in terms of resources. The key is to hire bench resources who would act as your backup whenever new targets need to be completed. India is not primarily a direct target of recession, but many ma rket leaders who are the target of this period operate in India. Thus directly or indirectly the Indian economy is set to be effective. However, the fact that we are not a direct party to this crisis creates a gateway for growth. Slow growth will seem huge after the cloud of recession fades. This is thus the time to act smart and reckless, focus on stability, and not high-achieving targets.

But, Humanity is in the process of mastering nanotech and should accomplish that within a century (-50yr/+100yr). So, if in 200 years we encountered aliens who were close to our own tech, then it would be a close match in power. However, suppose that alien race had a thousand years of advancement in their nanotech mastery and other technologies. So, we both have nanotech, but they would still be so much more advanced, we would likely not stand a chance. So, if we can colonize at least half the galaxy, then chances are we will not run into an older more powerful race originating from our galaxy. If we can colonize everything within a few galaxies, including andromeda galaxy, that would place us on a much more likely stand of not meeting a significantly more powerful race. Now, figure we will be colonizing at a rate of expansion rate between 50% to 90% the speed of light.

Whether the portrait is authentic or not is disputed, with Alexander Wheelock Thayer writing that it rests on \\"uncertain tradition\\" and it \\"lacks authoritative attestation\\". [1] Johann van Beethoven [2] [3] (c. 1739 or 1740 [4] [5] ‚Äì 18 December 1792) was a German musician, teacher, and singer who sang in the chapel of the Archbishop of Cologne , whose court was at Bonn . He is best known as the father of the celebrated composer Ludwig van Beethoven (1770‚Äì1827). Johann became an alcoholic later in his life and was at times an abusive father to Ludwig. At 18, Ludwig had to obtain an order to force Johann to support his family. Johann died soon after Ludwig moved to Vienna to study with Joseph Haydn . Johann van Beethoven was the son of Maria Josepha Poll (married 1733) and Lodewijk or Ludwig van Beethoven [6] [7] (1712‚Äì1773; not to be confused with Johann's famous son of the same name), who was probably born in or near the city of Mechelen , in the Habsburg Netherlands (now in Flanders , Belgium), and had served as a musician in several communities in and around Mechelen before establishing himself in Bonn in 1733, where he served as a musician at the court of Prince-Archbishop-Elector of Cologne Clemens August of Bavaria , rising to the post of Kapellmeister in 1761. Johann van Beethoven also showed musical talent, and joined the court, primarily as a singer, in 1764. In addition to singing (his range, while usually described as that of a tenor , may have extended into alto and even higher registers), he played the violin and zither , and played and taught keyboard instruments of the day, including the harpsichord and the clavichord . He met his future wife, Maria Magdalena Keverich (1746‚Äì1787), on a trip to Ehrenbreitstein . She was the daughter of the head chef to Johann IX Philipp von Walderdorff , Archbishop-Elector of Trier , whose court was there, and she had family connections in the court orchestra at Bonn. Keverich was already widowed at the age of nineteen. She and Johann were married on 12 November 1767 in the Catholic Church of St Remigius, Bonn . They had seven children, three of whom lived into adulthood: [8] Ludwig Maria van Beethoven (2 April 1769 ‚Äì 6 April 1769) Ludwig van Beethoven (16 December 1770 in Bonn, Kurk√∂ln ‚Äì 26 March 1827) Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven (8 April 1774 ‚Äì 15 November 1815) Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven (2 October 1776 ‚Äì 12 January 1848) Anna Maria Franziska van Beethoven (23 February 1779 ‚Äì 27 February 1779) Franz Georg van Beethoven (17 January 1781 ‚Äì 16 August 1783) Maria Margarete Josepha van Beethoven (5 May 1786 ‚Äì 26 November 1787) Johann realized Ludwig's talent and became his first teacher. Johann was also aware of Leopold Mozart's success traveling with a talented and young Wolfgang , and wished to duplicate their fame and fortune. Hehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_van_Beethoven] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_van_Beethoven]Beethoven‚Äôs musician father was an alcoholic. He was an abusive father according to a number of witnesses. \\"There were few days when [Ludwig] was not beaten in order to compel him to set himself at the piano,\\" related one childhood friend of Ludwig. A court councillor reported that Johann occasionally locked Ludwig in a cellar. Whenever Ludwig played poorly, Johann would exclaim that it was an embarrassment to the family. His father tried to make him into a child prodigy, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but did not succeed. Beethoven did, however, meet Mozart in 1787. By that time, the teenaged Beethoven had published a composition (Nine Variations on a March by Dressler [1783]) and had been appointed continuo player to the Bonn opera. So Beethoven was a prodigy but not in the same way as Mozart."},{"instruction":"Why did JFK have affairs?","output":"Why do men of wealth, power, and influence have affairs?

Since they were already there and they had fuel and battery power AND they weren't in too bad of shape, why not just leave the recievers on and see what info they collect? That became the interstellar mission of the Voyagers. While out there, they collect valuable data we otherwise would not have and help to determine the shape of the suns heleosphere and it's different layers and boundaries. They can detect the environment outside the solar system among many other interesting pieces of science we can only get from probes in the area. It would take new probes decades to reach the distances the Voyagers are at now and we are fortunate to have them. It's that or nothing until New Horizons gets out there.

Indeed, adolescents do invest a considerable measure of energy in the telephone. In any case, you need to comprehend that there are additionally such a significant number of activities. Telephones have made some amazing progress since the first Nokia blocks and the first iPhone turned out, and a considerable measure of youthful people groups' public activity occurs in that virtual space. Additionally, a great deal of exercises that used to occur in the physical world have been exchanged to our cell phones. You can shop on the web, read online books or stories, share photographs, content, videocall, and converse with your companions from everywhere throughout the world, compose stories and web journals, share your contemplations and thoughts, investigate and teach yourself on subjects you are keen on, talk about existence encounters, and be propelled by what other individuals share.

No, on the grounds that we're conversing with a person/young lady online doesn't mean we send them nudes.

He was eating a huge amount of food I was almost in tears trying to keep food in the house as about 23k to 33 k calories a day we‚Äôre being consumed of good food not junk food . That‚Äôs not easy to do when you consider the average is about 3 k to 3500 cal when your being athletic maybe even six k but 23 to 33 k is a lot . Plus he got his brother to do them also for six weeks to two months . I was i. Tears plus I am a scratch cook . A vat of meatballs would just disappear. Whole heads of lettuce and a bag of carrots flats of eggs in a day or two just devoured?? It took me about six weeks to find out about the steroids but I could not figure out how a refrigerator and freezer of food was disappearing in a day . They were on summer break and working full time . I remembered my mother visiting and I just broke down in tears because I was buying so much food .i could not understand it . A quart of ice cream became a snack . An entire box of bisquick biscuits were gone in two hours before I could walk to pick berries and walk back with them for the desert for the night and of course there nothing to freeze . In order to accommodate my complaints and curiosity my son decided to go to the Chinese buffet every day for lunch and apparently dinner too . I didn‚Äôt know for awhile but he was laughing when he tells the story of how eventually the owner was so upset with the amount of food he was eating there every day that he tried to ban my son from eating there and told him he could never come back . Lol the problem was that the sign did say all you can eat buffet and my son would stay there to eat like a human vacuum cleaner . Lol So my son kept going back until finally they came to some agreement that my son would pay double for the buffet . I am sure the Chinese buffet owners were still losing out . Luckily for us all they quit the rounds of steroids after a couple months . But I‚Äôll never forget my son laughing when he saw me I tears over having to buy so much food and trying to fit all in the fridge and me trying to afford a grocery bill six times the regular bill . Lol that‚Äôs when he told his brother laughing that he should go to the Chinese buffet to eat . Lol he said the owner had complained but ‚Äú he was so little and he had a sign outside that said all you could eat ‚Äú. I am sure there must be other young kids who have done the same thing to buffet owners . I was told at this Chinese buffet too at another time when I finally went there that this woman came in every Tuesday to eat . She would fill up her plate and insist on taking it home for an extra meal . She refused to ever come back as they had let her do this for almost a year straight until she was caught and reprimanded . She never came back as she thought it was her right to take home another meal . Her arugument being that she could eat one plateful of food before she became to full to eat me . A waitress who told me that also said that they saw people pocket food like fried shrimp and crab Rangoon . They put it in their pockets and pocketbooks . Which I find amusing as they were being watched and were caught doing it ."},{"instruction":"What color space is used for live streaming?","output":"The default is likely Rec.709 for the moment, because broadcast television uses that colour space, all TVs can display in that space, and computer monitors almost all support sRGB which is nearly the same as Rec.709.

You can add polynomials in [math]V[/math] and multiply by constants (scalars) to get other polynomials in [math]V[/math], and these operations satisfy the axioms for a vector space (associativity, distributivity, etc.) In fact, [math]V[/math] is a vector space of dimension 3. That means every basis for it has exactly three vectors. There are lots of different bases you can choose for [math]V[/math]. If you take as a basis [math]beta={1,x,x^2}[/math], then the coordinates of [math]p(x)=3+5x+6x^2[/math] with respect to [math]beta[/math] are [math](3,5,6)[/math] because [math]p(x)[/math] is 3 times the first basis vector plus 5 times the second basis vector plus 6 times the third basis vector. There are lots of other bases you might choose depending on what applications you have in mind. If you're interested in differentiation, you might take as basis [math]gamma={1,x,x^2/2}[/math] because the derivative of each basis vector is the previous, except the derivative of the first is 0. Then the coordinates of [math]p(x)=3+5x+6x^2[/math] with respect to [math]gamma[/math] are [math](3,5,12)[/math]. What's nice about this basis is that differentiation corresponds to shifting the coordinates left. The derivative of [math]p(x)[/math] has coordinates [math](5,12,0)[/math]. Yet another basis turns out to make the coordinates the values of the polynomial at [math]1, 2[/math], and [math]3[/math]. So the coordinates of [math]p(x)[/math] are [math](14,37,72)[/math]. I'll leave it to you to figure what the three basis vectors are that work to do that. So, [math]p(x)[/math] can be expressed as the vector in the question, but only if the basis is specified to be [math]beta={1,x,x^2}[/math]."},{"instruction":"w would you rate the following actresses in terms of beauty and elegance and not on their acting skills: Alia Bhatt, Yami Gautam, Shraddha Kapoor, Disha Patani, Kriti Sanon, Tapsee Pannu, Jacqueline Fernandes and Parineeti Chopra?","output":"Jacqueline Fernandez."},{"instruction":"What is something that you will never do?","output":"I don't get ki chappal ulti rakhne se Ghar me ladai hoti kaise hai I never get how will a fight break out if i keep my slippers flipped opposite to the surface Mujhe Samajh nahi aata kiTuesday, Thursday and Saturday koNails cut,Hair cut, baalo ko shampooNon veg consumption kyu nahi karna chaaiye jabki baaki days aap kar sate ho I mean Does it even make sense I never gets that ‚Äúmobile use karne se pet dard jaisi cheeze hoti kaisi hai‚ÄùCause Mere pet me nahi dil me dard hota hai cuz mobile usage ki wajah se Number Kam hote hai Cause My heart aches instead of My stomach when I score low due to mobile usage I never gets 10th ke Marks life ko affect kaise karte haiKya matlab ki humko bewakoof banaya gaya tha What do u mean that we were fooled Mujhe samajh nahi aata ki ‚Äú11:00 baje ki Train ke liye subah se 4:00 baje tapakne ki kya jarurat hai I don't get for a train scheduled at 11:00 AM why should we arrive at station at 4:00 AM I don't get ki Online study karne ke liye Asus ka 1.5 Lakh ka Laptop hi kyu Chaaiye To study online why do you need a ASUS laptop of worth 1.5 lakhs well You are getting it‚Ä¶aren't u I don't get ki Cool banne ke liye Twenty ko Chwenchy rupees bolna jaruri kyu hai To be cool why you spell Twenty as Chwenchy I don't get ki ‚ÄúAdvertisement me kapde gande karne per mummy ne baccho ko maara kyu nhi\\"Le our Mother's when we make our clothes dirty I don't get ki Female harrasment cases me kapde ki length kaise matter karti hai I don't get how the length of clothes cause females harassment cases I don't get ki ‚ÄúMale domestic cases ko koi seriously leta kyu nahi hai\\"Kya matlab Why no one takes male domestic cases seriously We are boys‚Ä¶we are used to it I don't get Bagal waale Aunty ko kya meri zindagi me itni panchayat hai‚Ä¶ I don't get why my neighbour aunty is so interested in my life I don't get ki Mera sabziwaala mujhe JEE crack karne per gyaan de kaise raha haiKya matlab woh NIT Sabziwaala hai Why my Vegetable vendor is giving me advices on how to crack JEE What do you mean by saying that he is graduated from NIT Mujhe samajh nahi aata ki Mohalle ki Antiya kya panchayat karti hai khade hoke‚Ä¶..Jo ghanti karne per khatam nhi hoti I don't get that about what things Aunties talks about that their convo doesn't ends even after hours I don't get Gol roti banane se shaadi ka kya Rishta I don't get that How gol rotis are related to marriage I don't get ki JEE/NEET ke toppers karke binge watch, 3 Ghante Cricket khelke or 4 ghante ki study se topper kaise ban jaate hai I don't get how Toppers of JEE/NEET does binge watching, plays cricket for 3 hours and Kya matlab They are fooling us.

Wherever I‚Äôve worked, I have never tolerated abusive behavior even if it meant I was being over protective to the point of risking a reprimand myself, from my manager. (Side note: that never happened, but there‚Äôs a rule in most retail that the hourly‚Äôs are never required to put up with abusive customers; managers are paid to put up with it.) To that end, I‚Äôve had the distinct pleasure of inserting myself between a customer and employee on a few occasions. I mean that quite literally. My rule was generally to push myself between the two. Usually, this was to make sure the customer didn‚Äôt hurt the employee. On a few occasions, it was clearly the employee‚Äôs fault (which usually results in a formal counseling). Most of the time, it was the customer just being rude or nasty. On a few occasions, it would outright criminal levels of abuse and those are the occasions that I awaited with Sith-like glee. See, those are FUN for me. I feed on their evil and can usually snap into a perfectly polite mode with just the right touch of condescension such that it left no verifiable evidence but would otherwise convey this message, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an insect of zero value. You lack even the potency of get anything more than a glance from me.‚Äù See, in all things, there are three reactions: the positive reaction that the customer wants, the negative one that they will try to evoke when they can‚Äôt get the first reaction, and no reaction at all. My general rule was, ‚ÄúSpeak obscenely slow like they‚Äôre mentally retarded, lower the volume of the voice just above a whisper but pitch it up like addressing a kindergartener and make sure to include insipid pleasantries that antagonize without antagonizing evidence.‚Äù Now, let me stop you there. This was the final action I‚Äôd take with an abusive customer, never the tactic from the beginning. My rule as a manager was to, unless otherwise dealing with a crook, give the customer anything to shut them up. But at the point of abuse, it‚Äôs no longer about that. I‚Äôm going to win and a ‚Äúwin‚Äù at that point, is to prove that (a) there was nothing short of a gun attack that was going to evoke a reaction out of me and (b) drive them to the point of an emotional breakdown. Most of the time they left frustrated. One glorious time, I had a woman arrested, ‚ÄúI bet you‚Äôre a fucking faggot. You racist asshole.‚Äù‚ÄúThat is correct ‚Ä¶. I mean the first part. The middle accusation just isn‚Äôt true. The last one, ahhhhhh that‚Äôs probably debatable. So, honestly, that was a very good assessment.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm not leaving here until ‚Ä¶. XYZ.‚Äù‚ÄúI fully understand and appreciate what you‚Äôre looking for. Given that I‚Äôve already had the police alerted to your presence and that you threatened to kill one of my employees, I agree it‚Äôs best that you wait here. It will ensure that the police have a far easier time of finding you and apprehending you. Would you like a soda while we wait?‚Äù Annnnnnnnnd the police arrived. My employe ‚ÄîMaria‚Äî pressed charges. It was fun. I mean, not for Maria. She was my favorite employee. (Oh ‚Ä¶ you think managers don‚Äôt have those? Cute.) She was my ‚Äúbloodhound‚Äù who could find a lost layaway package like nobody‚Äôs business and we could gossip in Spanish (which, honestly, I‚Äôm not lying ‚Äî I love good gossip; I‚Äôm a collector of fun human stories ‚Äî I want to know EVERYTHING about everybody). Plus, she got to make fun of my terrible Americano accent and I got to pretend that her Puerto Rican accent was insufferable. Maria was short and thick, which of course in our world meant that when people wanted to insult her, they reached for the low lying fruit. Maria was usually impervious to insults about her weight and ethnicity (as anybody with topically easy to reach insults tend to be: gays, lesbians, the overweight, the short, racial minorities, etc.), but that was a bad day for her and when I saw her crying at the layaway counter my instinctive, male ‚Äúsave the damsel in distress‚Äù mode kicked in and I had only two resources ‚Äî kill the offender where she stood or remain a non-felon and do everything ELSE I could to ruin her day. So, I did every fucking thing to ensure that the freaked out customer continued freaking out while remaining there until the police arrived and I was able to walk out to the police car as they pushed her into back seat of the squad car. Getting called a ‚Äúfaggot‚Äù and smiling about it was the icing on the cake. So, you see, about calling me a ‚Äúfaggot‚Äù, to a non-gay person, this seems like the lowest blow you can throw at me. To be sure, there are insults that really will bruise me, but those can only come from people I care about. Calling me a faggot? Oh my. Not only is it NOT insulting, but it‚Äôs just pure glee for me. I mean, I can‚Äôt even comprehend anything that will make me laugh out loud any quickly‚Ä¶er. And she did. I was like Palpatine in that moment. I‚Äôm not saying I and my LP manager smiled and waved to her as she was driven off by the police ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not NOT saying it neither."},{"instruction":"LPU good for taking admission in the CSE branch?","output":"Being an alumni, I would like to answer this question because many of my friends are studying in B.TECH CSE so i will give you correct information regarding LPU,LPU ranks among the best engineering colleges to pursue an engineering degree.LPU is considered better in terms of providing better placement and also providing affordable distance learning courses.

I like this quote from Will Gompertz‚Äôs (otherwise fairly tepid) review of the film for the BBC: Playing an insecure, self-doubting, slightly lost superhero is not an easy trick to pull off: vulnerability and invincibility don't generally go hand-in-hand. The fact that Larson convincingly portrays both, simultaneously, is testament to her talent. ‚ÄòCaptain Marvel‚Äô is a slightly strange superhero origin movie in that instead of being the story of an ordinary person becoming an extraordinary person it is the story of an extraordinary person who discovers that they are actually an ordinary person who then has to become a completely different extraordinary person. It‚Äôs a bit of a weird way of doing things and the film does get a little muddled at points, but as Vers/Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel Larson expertly navigates this tricky tightrope walk of a character journey with a convincing, nuanced, and decidedly unshowy performance. She fits the role like a glove. Much is often made about Marvel‚Äôs ‚Äúantagonist problem‚Äù and it‚Äôs true that they have one (though lately seem to have been addressing it, see: Black Panther and Inifnity War). But less often discussed is how consistently excellent their protagonists are. Often the heroes in superhero films are the blandest, least interesting characters and it‚Äôs up to the villains and sidekicks to keep us engaged and entertained. Not so with Marvel films, and part of the reason for this is their longstanding policy of casting high calibre, profoundly talented actors like Brie Larson in these parts. Carol Danvers is in a very safe pair of hands and I look forward to seeing what Larson does with her in Endgame and beyond."},{"instruction":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","output":"I personally eat only once or twice per day, and I rarely ever feel hungry between meals.

Also, I‚Äôm using Alive versions. Contents for the answer: Speed Scaling AP Scaling Why Tobirama counters Tsukuyomi Why Tobirama counters Amaterasu Why Tobirama counters Susanoo Speed: Tobirama was stated to be ‚Äòthe fastest shinobi‚Äô, in a generation which included Sage Hashirama & EMS Madara. Also, the one saying this is Madara himself, so basically a credible source. This is backed by his other feats, [LINKED_TEXT: such as reacting and placing explosives on Ten Tails Obito,] [URL: https://thewilloffire.quora.com/What-are-some-pretty-insane-but-overlooked-feats-in-Naruto-5] who was openly said to be superior to Hashirama ( by Hashirama himself ). Basically, we clearly see Tobirama‚Äôs superiority to Alive Madara and Prime Hashirama in speed. A blind Madara with no eyes was casually reacting and blocking all of WA EMS Sasuke‚Äôs strikes. WA EMS Sasuke is far superior to his Kabuto Fight version, since: He honed and perfected his Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.His hatred increased, which provides a power increase to the Uchiha.He had multiple fights, and fighting is said to be better than training. So basically, WA Sasuke >>>> KF Sasuke who was stated to be superior to Alive Itachi. To simplify the scaling: Tobirama > SM Hashirama ~ EMS Madara > Blind Madara >> WA EMS Sasuke > KF EMS Sasuke > Alive Itachi. As for AP, we know Tobirama can make a EMS Sasuke ( stronger than Itachi ) sweat in fear. That alone makes his AP enough to overpower Itachi. Now, why does Tobirama counter Itachi‚Äôs Tsukuyomi? Simple, he‚Äôs been fighting Uchiha for his life & countering the Sharingan. He‚Äôs also a adept sensor ninja, and was said to be and implied to be superior to Hashirama. Hashirama is a perfect Sage similar to Kabuto, who could fight with eyes closed with pure sensory abilities and counter Itachi‚Äôs ocular power. He could also use Shadow Clones, similar to Kakashi to counter Itachi‚Äôs Sharingan genjutsu. I‚Äôve timestamped it. Now, why does Tobirama counter Amaterasu? Well, just by dodging it given the 4th Raikage who scales below him in speed could do it. Or he could just teleport away from it. As for Susanoo, Tobirama could just outlast it. Itachi can‚Äôt make Susanoo last for long periods of time due to lack of stamina and the pain. Tobirama could just dodge Itachi‚Äôs attacks until the Susanoo wears off. Itachi is also adept at Fire Style, but Tobirama counters him via Water Style. And can negate his Sharingan precog via Hiraishin. Tobirama is just better than Itachi in most, if not all categories.

I tend to be private most times, and only share that which I am comfortable sharing, however, there were two times I may have had a moment and shared things with the wrong people. The first time was during a life changing moment and the person I confided in was more or less a big sounding board for me on how to process things and move forward. It was like writing down things in my mind by verbally talking about it and then trying to form a plan, and less of an emotional emesis. The person misread it, as though there was a bond formed between us and developed feelings. And when I could not reciprocate his feelings he began an 8 year long stalking pursuit. The only other time I confided something to the wrong person was when I spoke to another person whom at first I thought was neutral. A female. The person seemed nice and benign. And we would speak regularly. But in retrospect I did not know them well enough to share certain private details with, albeit, nothing too damaging. Sometimes, you just need to get something off your chest in the moment. Nonetheless, the person went and shared what I told them in private to people we knew. The weird thing is before I opened up to them, something inside of me kept telling me not to trust them. And even after it happened, instead of feeling better about it, there was this unsettling feeling like now I can‚Äôt undo what I just did. I guess that is what people call intuition.

They caught lightning in a bottle during the tech stock boom of the late ‚Äô90s. Overnight, they were millionaires. Six months after graduating from college, they quit their stable corporate jobs to trade stocks full time. They worked a few hours a day from home, while I was grinding away in my button-down shirts and pleated slacks. They pulled up to a party one night. One got out of a new Ford Mustang and the other, a Dodge Viper. ‚ÄúYou bought a Viper? What did you pay for this thing?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt take it with you, Ian.‚Äù Great, I‚Äôm getting life advice from a guy who was driving his dad‚Äôs car seven months ago. The story changed quickly. Markets crashed, and their paper gains evaporated. One had cashed out of enough to sit tight for a while. The other had let it ride. He was back looking for a job within a few months. One lives as frugally as possible, milking the small egg he generated 20 years ago. He doesn‚Äôt take any risk and spends his days thinking about how to make his bank account last for another 40 years. The other has bounced from job to job. Any chance for a 5% raise and he leaves a company for a small advance. He is always on the hunt for any scheme that can generate a quick profit. He gambles on long shots and looks for ways to scheme the system. They became paranoid and reckless. They never quite grasped how it happened and underestimated how difficult it would be to repeat. Like lottery winners, they were destined to give it all back. A 2009 Sports Illustrated investigation found that an estimated 60% of NBA basketball players go bankrupt within five years of leaving the sport. Having money at a young age can be dangerous. You might not appreciate how hard it is to accumulate that kind of wealth without a particular angle. Fast cash can be deceiving as you believe you can simply generate more. Aside from money, any fast success can have the same effect. Those who work hard and struggle for success appreciate what went into the result. They are more apt to learn precisely how that success was attained and can apply those lessons in future endeavors. Does that mean everyone will squander a windfall? Of course not, but the risk is much higher than someone who builds wealth over decades. What happened to that Dodge Viper? He crashed it into a telephone pole and was lucky to walk away with only minor injuries. Turning left at a stop light, he underestimated the power of the engine and lost control. That 645-horsepower engine had just a bit more torque than his previous used Toyota Camry. He didn‚Äôt have enough driving experience to handle that kind of power.

In fact, they can see color, but their colors might be different than what we see. For example, a dog might see shades of blue and yellow where we see shades of green and purple. That said, even if dogs could see the same colors as we do, they probably wouldn't care about the colors of their toys. Dogs are more interested in the textures and shapes of their toys rather than the colors. So manufacturers often make dog toys in bright colors simply because it makes them more visible to us humans.

Who do you think would be bigger?","output":"Fascinating question, Anthony. This requires one to ponder ‚Äúwhat if‚Ä¶?‚Äù We can only speculate, but as we've seen from the trajectory of Robert Plant's solo career he has gradually ‚Äúquieted down\\" over the years and embraced a wide variety of musical styles in his work apart from the hard rock and blues with which he made his name with Zeppelin. So even if Bonham was still with us, I believe that it's likely that Led Zeppelin may have at least taken a lengthy hiatus in order for the members to stretch out on their own. While reconvening every so often for a tour or album. I posit the same hypothesis for The Beatles. They may have kept the mothership intact, while each of them let off steam with their solo careers. The Beatles stopped in 1970, and have cemented their stature without a doubt as the greatest rock band of all time. If they were still all alive and together today, I believe they would still retain that crown. The Beatles would be the bigger of the two, with all due respect to Zeppelin. The music industry would be different in the fact that we would have 50+ more years of music from The Beatles, and 40+ more years from Led Zeppelin. Those songs and albums would've inspired countless more artists. As it is, the legacies of these two bands are unassailable. However, if there were even more music to add to their legacies, that would've been amazing. Of course, we'll never know if the quality of their work would've remained at the supremely high bar with which they set it. In the case of Zeppelin, although I am a huge fan of 1979‚Äôs In Through the Out Door, most fans consider that album to be inferior to what they've done before. This is a fascinating point to ponder. Thanks for the question, Anthony. We only have the reality of the culmination of these groups' careers to go by, but in the case of The Beatles I feel that they did everything they could do and simply had nothing more to give. From 1962 to 1969, those guys worked so very hard. Arguably more work writing and recording than any other band has done in such a short span of time."},{"instruction":"What are the arguments for and against whether a human fertilized egg at the moment of conception is a person or not?","output":"Well, the term ‚Äúperson‚Äù has a specific legal meaning, and a fertilized egg ain‚Äôt it.

Aloe vera gel is a natural humectant, which means it helps to hydrate and retain moisture in the skin, making it look plump and dewy. Aloe vera gel also has anti-inflammatory and soothing properties, which may help to reduce redness and irritation in the skin. However, it's important to note that some people may be allergic to aloe vera, and applying it to the face may cause an allergic reaction. Additionally, leaving a thick layer of aloe vera gel on the face for an extended period may attract dirt and bacteria, which could potentially cause breakouts or other skin issues. If you're considering using aloe vera gel as a facial treatment, it's best to do a patch test first to check for any allergic reactions. To do this, apply a small amount of aloe vera gel on the inner part of your arm and leave it on for at least 24 hours to see if you have any adverse reactions. If you decide to apply aloe vera gel to your face, it's best to use a pure, organic aloe vera gel that hasn't been mixed with other ingredients. To apply, simply spread a thin layer of aloe vera gel on your face and leave it on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing off with warm water. You can also leave it on overnight, but it's best to apply a thin layer and allow it to absorb into the skin before going to bed. If you have any concerns or experience any adverse reactions, it's best to consult a dermatologist."},{"instruction":"Do the British Isles experience hurricanes?","output":"Here in Scotland, as others have said, hurricane force winds are fairly common, maybe once every three or four years, but the buildings are mostly made of solid stone so they stay upright, even when their roofs and chimneys are ripped off. They hit the islands especially hard - there was one in I think 2005 when an entire family and their car were washed away and drowned as they tried to make it across a causeway to higher ground, fleeing their flooded house. If hurricanes in the Caribbean are going to become more common, people will need to take a leaf out of Scotland‚Äôs book and build to resist the wind. For example traditional Hebridean Black Houses are very low, with thick stone walls and rounded corners, and a low roof weighted down with stones, so that the wind just goes over the top or round the corner. The chimney is a modern touch and will come down in a really strong wind, but the rest will stay up. At Skara Brae in Orkney in the late Stone Age they found or dug a big hollow on a bank above the seashore, then built their houses down in the hollow and brought the earth in over the roofs to form one big smooth earth mound laced with little streets, so that the wind just passed over the top of the whole settlement, and the rain went down into the streets and then drained away down to the sea."},{"instruction":"Why is Gov.

Therefore, I cannot verify the accuracy of this claim. It is important to be critical of any news or information that is presented without credible sources or evidence. Misinformation and propaganda can be spread for various reasons, including to create fear, confusion, or mistrust. It is also worth noting that false claims and conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been rampant, and it is important to rely on credible sources of information, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), when seeking information about the pandemic and the vaccine."},{"instruction":"What are the principles of various types of engines?","output":"Well in terms of principles of operations within the internal combustion engine, there are two main types: Spark ignition and Compression ignition Spark ignition is commonly referred to as a gasoline engine, while compression is commonly referred to as a Diesel engine. Both rely on compressing an air and fuel mixture and igniting it, thus creating an expanding of hot gas in the cylinders, to thrust a piston, which is connected to the crankshaft, downward. The crankshaft is turned a fraction of a revolution with each cylinder‚Äôs power stroke (combustion), and with multiple cylinders firing in sequence, allows the crankshaft to be continuously turned. The main difference is that a gas engine injects the fuel into the intake manifold to mix with the air, and then when the intake valves open, this mixture is drawn into the cylinder. After the intake valve closes near that piston‚Äôs bottom of it‚Äôs stroke, it begins moving upward on the compression stroke. Near the top, a spark plug is fired to ignite the mixture, and as the gas expands, it thrusts that piston downward again on it‚Äôs power stroke. On a Diesel engine, the fuel is injected directly into the cylinder on the compression stroke, near the top. Due to a diesel needing to ignite the fuel without spark, it needs higher compression and cylinder pressures. So the air is already very high pressure and a high temperature right before the injector fires. As it fires, the fuel and air ignite due to the extreme pressure and temperature. Then the piston continues onto it‚Äôs power stroke, much the same the gas engine. Diesels are in principle more efficient, for various reasons. Both engines have advantages and disadvantages, but that is another topic. Hope this helps!"},{"instruction":"w can you determine where a mortar is being shot from?","output":"You need to use a counterfire radar.

I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!","output":"When the United States became a nation, there were reasons for having states be the voting unit rather than one person, one vote. Now, however, when California, for example, has such a large population, that it overwhelms the population of, for example, Alaska or Rhode Island. It really is not fair that the vote of a person from California is worth 15% of the vote of a person from Montana. This is the main reason why I believe that the electoral college should be eliminated and a direct election be instituted. But another reason can be seen in the 2000 election, when with the winner-take-all election, several hundred votes determined the counting of some 29 electoral votes. If the vote count had been proportional, perhaps Bush would have beaten Gore 15‚Äì14 and nobody would have complained‚Ä¶. but a few hundred votes determining the entire 29 electoral votes resulted in an absurdity. There were multiple recounts. The problem was not Floridians. The problem was not the Florida system.

This can vary depending on a variety of factors, including your dog or cat's breed, fur coat, and level of physical exertion. But in general, it's best to bring pets inside in cold weather, when temperatures drop. As for whether or not pets enjoy snow: It depends. If you have an animal that enjoys the outdoors and isn't afraid of cold weather ‚Äî like a dog with a thick coat or a horse used to the cold ‚Äî then yes! But most cats and small dogs don't do well in the snow. They have thinner fur coats and don't like being exposed to such low temperatures.

When multiple adjectives are used before a noun, there is strict grammar as to their order. In fact order in general is quite strictly defined. The areas where English is relatively simple are adjectives, which never change; plurals - most nouns have simple plurals made with ‚Äús‚Äù or ‚Äúes‚Äù; and gender, which is straightforward (with a few exceptions, such as calling ships female).

You may sincerely try doing what your batchmates are doing differently but if it does not work for you try something else. I will give the best example I can, which is my own. Just like every other aspirant I too had read about toppers studying for 8‚Äì9 hours daily and some more than 10 hours but even in lockdown when I did not had to attend school I could study for only 5 hours on an average and somedays even just 2 hours.

I used to feel that I should increase this and I even tried but it did not work. I used to study for long hours on a day and then take plenty of rest the next day. So during my entire preparation I stuck to my plan of studying 4‚Äì5 hours daily and then extending it whenever I could. Finally, it worked out for me. Some other advices: Keep some time at the end to revise your paper. Check if you have selected the correct option according to your calculations.Study daily. Even if you are very busy on some day just take out some time to study something, maybe just a page.Analyze your test papers.Make short notes of formulae and important concepts to make it easier for you to revise before every test."},{"instruction":"Why would someone pefer POSOCO over a Maharatna like IOCL?","output":"Compassion toward its employees.

A case for example, one of my senior has a medical emergency and our CMD personally called him for any kind of help.A big relief to never think about medical insurance. Our company provides full insurance cover of all dependents. All major hospitals empanelled. You would say it is not big. But do you really think that?

Even in some PSUs like big MAHARATNA such as B**L, medical facility is worst you can imagine (Sirs/Madams, my best friend is in this company).

It‚Äôs not a disaster. If anyone tells you it‚Äôs a disaster, they‚Äôre selling something. It could be improved. The roadblocks to improving it come mostly from the wealthy and the upper middle class, who rightly fear a quality, universal education where their children are educated amidst their fellow citizens. They are abetted by xenophobes and egoists who feat their child being ‚Äòcontaminated‚Äô by the ‚Äòworld‚Äô (meaning they want to gatekeep everything that goes into their children, including from their fellow students). The biggest improvement would be to move the funding of schools to the national level, and ban all private, parochial and homeschooling except for those who physically cannot attend public school without being a major disruption. States should be responsible for funding teachers an buildings, and local communities should run school boards to fit lessons to the population within national standard framework. Schools could be funded by need, with the core goal being a class size of 16‚Äì20 students per class, no more than one IEP per class (and if it has one it gets an aide)."},{"instruction":"Why is #ISRO trending on Twitter?","output":"Because we became what we are.

You see, none of us have been given freedom to make mistakes or display feelings or develop ourselves; in fact, our whole life has been planned by parents and sometimes even teachers! When living with these people all your life you naturally grow up to be mature people who never make mistakes or display feelings or surprise their parents with something different than they imagined you would be like! Our life has been planned by these people with utmost perfection; everything from what books you read to whom you meet first to how you walk and talk and posture yourself has been predetermined by them! That's why we were never given any opportunity for real relationship building between children and their parents; only forced ones with steady development overseen by parents who keep an eye on you at all times! Now that's what we become when we grow up: Perfect human beings who think they must always show perfect manners and be perfect in every way and never show embarrassment or disappointment or sadness or anger. This is why we become so miserable; such perfect beings do not exist in this world. That's why many of us move away from our hometowns in search of more freedom as soon as possible and never see our parents again after graduation; this kind of harmony doesn't exist anywhere else.

The reality is that we already use 100 percent of our brains The reality is that we already use 100 percent of our brains_DJ_/FLICKR THE NEW LUC Besson movie Lucy, starring Scarlett Johansson, opens tomorrow in theaters countrywide. It's based on use 100% of our brain immortal myth that we use only 10 percent of our brains. Johansson's character is implanted with drugs that allow her to access 100 percent of her brain capacity. She subsequently gains use 100% of our brain ability to learn Chinese in an instant, beat up bad guys, and throw cars with her mind (among other new talents). Morgan Freeman plays neuroscientist Professor Norman, who's built his career around use 100% of our brain 10 percent claim. \\"It is estimated most human beings use only 10 percent of use 100% of our brain brain's capacity,\\" he says, \\"Imagine if we could access 100 percent.\\" As it happens, I've written a book all about brain myths (Great Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain; due out this November). I thought I'd use what I learned to give you a 60-second explainer on use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth. Great Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain by Christian Jarrett was published in 2014. Buy on Amazon. Great Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain, by Christian Jarrett, was published in 2014. Buy on Amazon. Where does use 100% of our brain myth originate? No-one knows for sure. A popular theory has it that use 100% of our brain journalist Lowell Thomas helped spread use 100% of our brain myth in his preface to Dale Carnegie's block-buster self-help book How to Win Friends and Influence People. Thomas misquoted use 100% of our brain brilliant American psychologist William James as saying that use 100% of our brain average person specifically \\"develops only 10 percent of his latent mental ability.\\" In fact James had referred more vaguely to our \\"latent mental energy.\\" Others have claimed that Einstein attributed his intellectual giftedness to being able to use more than 10 percent of his brain, but this is itself a myth. Another possible source of use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth is neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's discovery in use 100% of our brain 1930s of \\"silent cortex\\" - brain areas that appeared to have no function when he stimulated them with electricity. We know today that these areas are functional. Is Lucy use 100% of our brain first movie to use use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth as a premise? No, use 100% of our brain 2011 movie Limitless, starring Bradley Cooper was based on use 100% of our brain same idea, except use 100% of our brain precise figure was placed at 20 percent. Cooper's character takes a pill that lets him access use 100% of our brain full 100 percent. Both use 100% of our brain 1991 film Defending Your Life (thanks to A Voice in The Wilderness for flagging this up in use 100% of our brain comments) and Flight of use 100% of our brain Navigator (1986) include claims that most of us use a fraction of our brains. The myth is also invoked in use 100% of our brain TV series Heroes, to explain why some people have special powers. Does anyone really believe this myth anymore? Apparently so. For example, in 2012, a survey of school teachers in Britain and The Netherlands found that 48 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively, endorsed use 100% of our brain myth. Last year, a US survey by use 100% of our brain Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research found that 65 percent of people believed in use 100% of our brain myth. Is there any truth to use 100% of our brain myth? Certainly there is no truth to use 100% of our brain idea that we only use 10 percent of our neural matter. Modern brain scans show activity coursing through use 100% of our brain entire organ, even when we're resting. Minor brain damage can have devastating effects - not what you'd expect if we had 90 percent spare capacity. Also, consider use 100% of our brain situation when neural tissue representing a limb is rendered redundant by use 100% of our brain loss of that limb. Very quickly, neighbouring areas recruit that tissue into new functions, for example to represent other body regions. This shows how readily use 100% of our brain brain utilises all available neural tissue. So why does use 100% of our brain myth persist? For many people, use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth sounds both feasible and appealing because they see it in terms of human potential. Many of us believe that we could achieve so much more - learning languages, musical instruments, sporting skills - if only we applied ourselves. It's easy to see how this morphs into use 100% of our brain shorthand idea that we use just 10 percent of our brain's capacity or potential. Does it matter that films like Lucy spread use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth? It certainly bothers a lot of neuroscientists. There are so many widely held misunderstandings about use 100% of our brain brain that scientists find it extremely unhelpful to have more nonsense spread to millions of movie goers. Other people I've spoken to are more optimistic and think that audiences will realize that use 100% of our brain claims are not meant to be taken seriously. I have to admit, I enjoyed Limitless despite use 100% of our brain daft premise. I haven't yet seen Lucy. I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether it's a good movie in spite of use 100% of our brain bad science, and if so, does that justify further propagation of use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth?

Interesting things begin to happen.\\" I know I haven't earned my Ph.D. yet, Professor, but I beg to differ. You see, we all access 100% of our brains every day. And we don't have to be telekinetic or memorize an entire deck of cards to do it. In use 100% of our brain film, which opens next Friday, Scarlett Johansson's character Lucy is forced to work as a drug smuggler in a Taiwanese mob. The drug they've implanted into her body leaks into her system, allowing her to \\"access 100%\\" of her brain. Among other things, Lucy can move objects with her mind, choose not to feel pain, and memorize copious amounts of information. In a way, use 100% of our brain idea that we only use 10% of our brains is rather inspiring. It may motivate us to try harder or tap into some mysterious, intact reservoir of creativity and potential. There are even products that promise to unlock that other 90%. As ludicrous as use 100% of our brain claim is, however, 2/3 of use 100% of our brain public and half of science teachers still believe use 100% of our brain myth to be true. The notion is so widespread that when University College London neuroscientist Sophie Scott attended a first aid course, her instructor assured use 100% of our brain class that head injuries weren't dangerous because \\"90% of use 100% of our brain brain [doesn't] do anything.\\" How did this misconception come about, anyway? We may be able to track its earliest roots back to psychologist William James, who wrote in his 1907 text The Energies of Men that \\"we are making use of only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources.\\" I tend to agree with this sentiment when I spend my evenings on use 100% of our brain couch watching reality television, but, of course, James didn't intend to lend credence to this \\"10% myth.\\" But someone else did, Lowell Thomas, in his foreword to Dale Carnegie's 1936 book How To Win Friends and Influence People, reinterpreted use 100% of our brain statement and, it seems, sprinkld in a few of his own ideas. \\"Professor William James of Harvard,\\" Thomas wrote, used to say that use 100% of our brain average person develops only 10 percent of his latent mental ability.\\" Here's use 100% of our brain thing: use 100% of our brain brain has rapidly tripled its original size across two million years of human evolution. Despite only accounting for 2% of our body weight, use 100% of our brain brain gobbles up a whopping 20% of our daily energy intake. Our brains are also remarkably efficient, having evolved gyri which have dramatically increased our cortical surface-area-to-total volume ratio relative to other species. The \\"we only use 10% of our brains\\" claim would mean that we're effectively evolving in use 100% of our brain opposite direction-and that we're doing this very quickly. Another obvious way we know that we're using more than 10% of our brain at once is through approaches like functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. fMRI and PET are imaging techniques that reveal areas of relatively high brain activity in real time. Imaging studies tell us that not only are many brain areas recruited when performing even use 100% of our brain simplest of tasks, like watching a movie, but that use 100% of our brain activity between these areas is extremely dynamic. Plus, use 100% of our brain \\"use it or lose it\\" adage seems to hold particularly true in brain health. A 2012 study by Schafer and colleagues at Harvard found that neural immune cells called microglia can remove idle, but otherwise healthy, synapses (connections) between brain cells. If we were only regularly using only 10% of our brains at any given time, we might all be prone to cerebral atrophy, resembling patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. The \\"10% myth\\" may have been perpetuated by something that _is_ true. Despite use 100% of our brain brain having nearly 100 billion neurons, this cell type is vastly outnumbered by another: glial cells. Glial (\\"glue\\") cells are responsible for maintaining homeostasis, providing structural support, insulating neurons with myelin, and removing pathogens and debris. The actual ratio of glial cells to neurons is disputed, although many texts claim that it may be roughly 10:1. In other words, neurons are only 10% of our entire brain. Think about yourself right now. Are you engaging your muscles to sit yourself upright? Using your hand to scroll your computer mouse (or thumb on your mobile device)? Perhaps you're eating something? Listening to music? Breathing? Rest assured, you're using more than 10% of your brain right now.

Animal studies have found that more than 20 percent of neurons studied serve no identifiable purpose. Some researchers have estimated that more than 60 percent of use 100% of our brain brain consists of \\"neural dark matter,\\" or neurons that have no apparent purpose and seem unresponsive to common stimuli. Animal life on earth goes back millions of years, yet most species only use three to five percent of their cerebral capacity. ‚ÄîProfessor Norman (Morgan Freeman) in use 100% of our brain 2014 film Lucy The film Lucy is famous‚Äîor maybe infamous‚Äîfor advancing use 100% of our brain idea that we humans use only a small fraction of our brain tissue. Through a variety of sci-fi inventions, use 100% of our brain film‚Äôs namesake main character, played by Scarlett Johansson, is able to radically increase her brain usage from what it claims is a typical value under 10 percent ultimately up to 100 percent. The ‚Äú10 percent of use 100% of our brain brain myth,‚Äù as it is called, has a long history. And Lucy Director Luc Besson freely proclaims that his film is a fantasy based on little if any science. Brecht Bug/Flickr Source: Brecht Bug/Flickr The film certainly makes its own case that expanding activity beyond natural levels, let alone experiencing a 100 percent brain, comes with serious downsides, including what it portrays as increasingly ruthless behavior on use 100% of our brain part of Johansson‚Äôs character. As we will see, there are good neuroscientific reasons to stick with our natural allotment of activity‚Äîand possibly to aim for less.

Buy on Amazon. Great Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain, by Christian Jarrett, was published in 2014. Buy on Amazon. Where does use 100% of our brain myth originate? No-one knows for sure. A popular theory has it that use 100% of our brain journalist Lowell Thomas helped spread use 100% of our brain myth in his preface to Dale Carnegie's block-buster self-help book How to Win Friends and Influence People. Thomas misquoted use 100% of our brain brilliant American psychologist William James as saying that use 100% of our brain average person specifically \\"develops only 10 percent of his latent mental ability.\\" In fact James had referred more vaguely to our \\"latent mental energy.\\" Others have claimed that Einstein attributed his intellectual giftedness to being able to use more than 10 percent of his brain, but this is itself a myth. Another possible source of use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth is neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's discovery in use 100% of our brain 1930s of \\"silent cortex\\" - brain areas that appeared to have no function when he stimulated them with electricity. We know today that these areas are functional. Is Lucy use 100% of our brain first movie to use use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth as a premise? No, use 100% of our brain 2011 movie Limitless, starring Bradley Cooper was based on use 100% of our brain same idea, except use 100% of our brain precise figure was placed at 20 percent. Cooper's character takes a pill that lets him access use 100% of our brain full 100 percent. Both use 100% of our brain 1991 film Defending Your Life (thanks to A Voice in The Wilderness for flagging this up in use 100% of our brain comments) and Flight of use 100% of our brain Navigator (1986) include claims that most of us use a fraction of our brains. The myth is also invoked in use 100% of our brain TV series Heroes, to explain why some people have special powers. Does anyone really believe this myth anymore? Apparently so. For example, in 2012, a survey of school teachers in Britain and The Netherlands found that 48 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively, endorsed use 100% of our brain myth. Last year, a US survey by use 100% of our brain Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research found that 65 percent of people believed in use 100% of our brain myth. Is there any truth to use 100% of our brain myth? Certainly there is no truth to use 100% of our brain idea that we only use 10 percent of our neural matter. Modern brain scans show activity coursing through use 100% of our brain entire organ, even when we're resting. Minor brain damage can have devastating effects - not what you'd expect if we had 90 percent spare capacity. Also, consider use 100% of our brain situation when neural tissue representing a limb is rendered redundant by use 100% of our brain loss of that limb. Very quickly, neighbouring areas recruit that tissue into new functions, for example to represent other body regions. This shows how readily use 100% of our brain brain utilises all available neural tissue. So why does use 100% of our brain myth persist? For many people, use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth sounds both feasible and appealing because they see it in terms of human potential. Many of us believe that we could achieve so much more - learning languages, musical instruments, sporting skills - if only we applied ourselves. It's easy to see how this morphs into use 100% of our brain shorthand idea that we use just 10 percent of our brain's capacity or potential. Does it matter that films like Lucy spread use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth? It certainly bothers a lot of neuroscientists. There are so many widely held misunderstandings about use 100% of our brain brain that scientists find it extremely unhelpful to have more nonsense spread to millions of movie goers. Other people I've spoken to are more optimistic and think that audiences will realize that use 100% of our brain claims are not meant to be taken seriously. I have to admit, I enjoyed Limitless despite use 100% of our brain daft premise. I haven't yet seen Lucy. I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether it's a good movie in spite of use 100% of our brain bad science, and if so, does that justify further propagation of use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth?

Despite only accounting for 2% of our body weight, use 100% of our brain brain gobbles up a whopping 20% of our daily energy intake.

The \\"we only use 10% of our brains\\" claim would mean that we're effectively evolving in use 100% of our brain opposite direction-and that we're doing this very quickly. Another obvious way we know that we're using more than 10% of our brain at once is through approaches like functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. fMRI and PET are imaging techniques that reveal areas of relatively high brain activity in real time. Imaging studies tell us that not only are many brain areas recruited when performing even use 100% of our brain simplest of tasks, like watching a movie, but that use 100% of our brain activity between these areas is extremely dynamic. Plus, use 100% of our brain \\"use it or lose it\\" adage seems to hold particularly true in brain health. A 2012 study by Schafer and colleagues at Harvard found that neural immune cells called microglia can remove idle, but otherwise healthy, synapses (connections) between brain cells. If we were only regularly using only 10% of our brains at any given time, we might all be prone to cerebral atrophy, resembling patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. The \\"10% myth\\" may have been perpetuated by something that _is_ true. Despite use 100% of our brain brain having nearly 100 billion neurons, this cell type is vastly outnumbered by another: glial cells. Glial (\\"glue\\") cells are responsible for maintaining homeostasis, providing structural support, insulating neurons with myelin, and removing pathogens and debris. The actual ratio of glial cells to neurons is disputed, although many texts claim that it may be roughly 10:1. In other words, neurons are only 10% of our entire brain.

She subsequently gains use 100% of our brain ability to learn Chinese in an instant, beat up bad guys, and throw cars with her mind (among other new talents). Morgan Freeman plays neuroscientist Professor Norman, who's built his career around use 100% of our brain 10 percent claim. \\"It is estimated most human beings use only 10 percent of use 100% of our brain brain's capacity,\\" he says, \\"Imagine if we could access 100 percent.\\" As it happens, I've written a book all about brain myths (Great Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain; due out this November). I thought I'd use what I learned to give you a 60-second explainer on use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth. Great Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain by Christian Jarrett was published in 2014. Buy on Amazon. Great Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain, by Christian Jarrett, was published in 2014. Buy on Amazon. Where does use 100% of our brain myth originate? No-one knows for sure. A popular theory has it that use 100% of our brain journalist Lowell Thomas helped spread use 100% of our brain myth in his preface to Dale Carnegie's block-buster self-help book How to Win Friends and Influence People. Thomas misquoted use 100% of our brain brilliant American psychologist William James as saying that use 100% of our brain average person specifically \\"develops only 10 percent of his latent mental ability.\\" In fact James had referred more vaguely to our \\"latent mental energy.\\" Others have claimed that Einstein attributed his intellectual giftedness to being able to use more than 10 percent of his brain, but this is itself a myth. Another possible source of use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth is neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's discovery in use 100% of our brain 1930s of \\"silent cortex\\" - brain areas that appeared to have no function when he stimulated them with electricity. We know today that these areas are functional. Is Lucy use 100% of our brain first movie to use use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth as a premise? No, use 100% of our brain 2011 movie Limitless, starring Bradley Cooper was based on use 100% of our brain same idea, except use 100% of our brain precise figure was placed at 20 percent. Cooper's character takes a pill that lets him access use 100% of our brain full 100 percent. Both use 100% of our brain 1991 film Defending Your Life (thanks to A Voice in The Wilderness for flagging this up in use 100% of our brain comments) and Flight of use 100% of our brain Navigator (1986) include claims that most of us use a fraction of our brains. The myth is also invoked in use 100% of our brain TV series Heroes, to explain why some people have special powers. Does anyone really believe this myth anymore? Apparently so. For example, in 2012, a survey of school teachers in Britain and The Netherlands found that 48 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively, endorsed use 100% of our brain myth. Last year, a US survey by use 100% of our brain Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research found that 65 percent of people believed in use 100% of our brain myth. Is there any truth to use 100% of our brain myth? Certainly there is no truth to use 100% of our brain idea that we only use 10 percent of our neural matter. Modern brain scans show activity coursing through use 100% of our brain entire organ, even when we're resting. Minor brain damage can have devastating effects - not what you'd expect if we had 90 percent spare capacity. Also, consider use 100% of our brain situation when neural tissue representing a limb is rendered redundant by use 100% of our brain loss of that limb. Very quickly, neighbouring areas recruit that tissue into new functions, for example to represent other body regions. This shows how readily use 100% of our brain brain utilises all available neural tissue. So why does use 100% of our brain myth persist? For many people, use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth sounds both feasible and appealing because they see it in terms of human potential. Many of us believe that we could achieve so much more - learning languages, musical instruments, sporting skills - if only we applied ourselves. It's easy to see how this morphs into use 100% of our brain shorthand idea that we use just 10 percent of our brain's capacity or potential. Does it matter that films like Lucy spread use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth? It certainly bothers a lot of neuroscientists. There are so many widely held misunderstandings about use 100% of our brain brain that scientists find it extremely unhelpful to have more nonsense spread to millions of movie goers. Other people I've spoken to are more optimistic and think that audiences will realize that use 100% of our brain claims are not meant to be taken seriously. I have to admit, I enjoyed Limitless despite use 100% of our brain daft premise. I haven't yet seen Lucy. I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether it's a good movie in spite of use 100% of our brain bad science, and if so, does that justify further propagation of use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth?

Interesting things begin to happen.\\" I know I haven't earned my Ph.D. yet, Professor, but I beg to differ. You see, we all access 100% of our brains every day. And we don't have to be telekinetic or memorize an entire deck of cards to do it. In use 100% of our brain film, which opens next Friday, Scarlett Johansson's character Lucy is forced to work as a drug smuggler in a Taiwanese mob. The drug they've implanted into her body leaks into her system, allowing her to \\"access 100%\\" of her brain. Among other things, Lucy can move objects with her mind, choose not to feel pain, and memorize copious amounts of information. In a way, use 100% of our brain idea that we only use 10% of our brains is rather inspiring. It may motivate us to try harder or tap into some mysterious, intact reservoir of creativity and potential. There are even products that promise to unlock that other 90%. As ludicrous as use 100% of our brain claim is, however, 2/3 of use 100% of our brain public and half of science teachers still believe use 100% of our brain myth to be true. The notion is so widespread that when University College London neuroscientist Sophie Scott attended a first aid course, her instructor assured use 100% of our brain class that head injuries weren't dangerous because \\"90% of use 100% of our brain brain [doesn't] do anything.\\" How did this misconception come about, anyway? We may be able to track its earliest roots back to psychologist William James, who wrote in his 1907 text The Energies of Men that \\"we are making use of only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources.\\" I tend to agree with this sentiment when I spend my evenings on use 100% of our brain couch watching reality television, but, of course, James didn't intend to lend credence to this \\"10% myth.\\" But someone else did, Lowell Thomas, in his foreword to Dale Carnegie's 1936 book How To Win Friends and Influence People, reinterpreted use 100% of our brain statement and, it seems, sprinkld in a few of his own ideas. \\"Professor William James of Harvard,\\" Thomas wrote, used to say that use 100% of our brain average person develops only 10 percent of his latent mental ability.\\" Here's use 100% of our brain thing: use 100% of our brain brain has rapidly tripled its original size across two million years of human evolution. Despite only accounting for 2% of our body weight, use 100% of our brain brain gobbles up a whopping 20% of our daily energy intake. Our brains are also remarkably efficient, having evolved gyri which have dramatically increased our cortical surface-area-to-total volume ratio relative to other species. The \\"we only use 10% of our brains\\" claim would mean that we're effectively evolving in use 100% of our brain opposite direction-and that we're doing this very quickly. Another obvious way we know that we're using more than 10% of our brain at once is through approaches like functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. fMRI and PET are imaging techniques that reveal areas of relatively high brain activity in real time. Imaging studies tell us that not only are many brain areas recruited when performing even use 100% of our brain simplest of tasks, like watching a movie, but that use 100% of our brain activity between these areas is extremely dynamic. Plus, use 100% of our brain \\"use it or lose it\\" adage seems to hold particularly true in brain health. A 2012 study by Schafer and colleagues at Harvard found that neural immune cells called microglia can remove idle, but otherwise healthy, synapses (connections) between brain cells. If we were only regularly using only 10% of our brains at any given time, we might all be prone to cerebral atrophy, resembling patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. The \\"10% myth\\" may have been perpetuated by something that _is_ true. Despite use 100% of our brain brain having nearly 100 billion neurons, this cell type is vastly outnumbered by another: glial cells. Glial (\\"glue\\") cells are responsible for maintaining homeostasis, providing structural support, insulating neurons with myelin, and removing pathogens and debris. The actual ratio of glial cells to neurons is disputed, although many texts claim that it may be roughly 10:1. In other words, neurons are only 10% of our entire brain. Think about yourself right now. Are you engaging your muscles to sit yourself upright? Using your hand to scroll your computer mouse (or thumb on your mobile device)? Perhaps you're eating something? Listening to music? Breathing? Rest assured, you're using more than 10% of your brain right now.

Should we had been just often utilizing just ten % of use 100% of our brain brains of ours at any moment, we may well almost all be susceptible to cerebral waste away, similar to individuals with neurodegenerative illnesses as Alzheimer's. The \\"10 % myth\\" might have been perpetuated by something which _is_ real. Regardless of use 100% of our brain human brain owning almost hundred billion neurons, this particular cellular style is immensely outnumbered by another: glial cells. Glial (\\"glue\\") cells are actually in charge of keeping homeostasis, supplying structural assistance, insulating neurons with myelin, as well as getting rid of waste and pathogens. The particular ratio of glial cells to neurons is actually disputed, though numerous texts say that it might be approximately 10:1. Quite simply, neurons are just ten % of use 100% of our brain whole mind of ours. Think of yourself today.

Animal research has discovered that greater than twenty % of neurons learned provide less identifiable objective. A number of scientists have believed that greater than sixty % of this human brain comprises of \\"neural dim matter,\\" or maybe neurons with absolutely no obvious objective and also appear unresponsive to popular stimulus. Animal living on planet extends back countless many years, but use 100% of our brain majority of species just use 3 to 5 % of use 100% of our brain cerebral capacity. - Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) during use 100% of our brain 2014 movie Lucy The make Lucy is actually well-known - or perhaps infamous - for moving forward use 100% of our brain concept that people people only use a tiny tiny proportion of use 100% of our brain mind cells of ours.

Great Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain by Christian Jarrett was posted within 2014. Buy on Amazon. Excellent Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain, by Christian Jarrett, was published inside 2014. Buy on Amazon. Anywhere does use 100% of our brain myth originate? No-one knows without a doubt. A popular principle has it that this journalist Lowell Thomas really helped spread use 100% of our brain misconception in use 100% of our brain preface of his to Dale Carnegie's block-buster self-help publication The right way to Win Friends & Influence People. Thomas misquoted use 100% of our brain brilliant American psychologist William James as stating use 100% of our brain regular pc user especially \\"develops simply ten % of his latent brain ability.\\" Actually James had referred much more vaguely to our \\"latent brain energy.\\" Others have reported that Einstein attributed his intellectual giftedness to remaining ready wear greater than 10 % of his brain, but this's itself a myth. Yet another probable cause of use 100% of our brain 10 % belief is actually neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's finding in use 100% of our brain 1930s of \\"silent cortex\\" - mind places which appeared to experience no function when he stimulated them with energy. We all know nowadays which these areas are functional. Is actually Lucy use 100% of our brain first video to make use of use 100% of our brain ten % misconception as being a concept? No, use 100% of our brain 2011 movie Limitless, starring Bradley Cooper was based upon exactly use 100% of our brain same concept, only use 100% of our brain accurate figure was put usually at twenty %. Cooper's character takes a pill which allows him access use 100% of our brain full hundred %. The 1991 movie Defending Your Life (thanks to A Voice inside use 100% of our brain Wilderness for flagging this specific up inside use 100% of our brain comments Flight and) of use 100% of our brain Navigator (1986) include assertions which use 100% of our brain majority of people utilize a fraction of our brains. The belief also is invoked inside use 100% of our brain tv sequence Heroes, to explain use 100% of our brain reason why several individuals have specific powers. Does anybody really believe this myth anymore? Evidently that. For example, throughout 2012, a survey of school coaches within Britain and also use 100% of our brain Netherlands found that forty eight a cent and 46 a dollar, respectively, endorsed use 100% of our brain myth. 12 months that is Last , a US survey next to use 100% of our brain Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research discovered that 65 % of individuals believed within use 100% of our brain misconception. Is there any sort of fact to use 100% of our brain misconception? Obviously there's zero fact to use 100% of our brain concept that any of us just use 10 percent of our neural matter. Contemporary brain scanned documents indicate pastime coursing through use 100% of our brain whole organ, even when we're resting. Small mind injury can have destructive effects - not what you'd anticipate if we'd 90 % spare electrical capacity. Also, think about use 100% of our brain situation when neural cells representing a limb is made unwanted because of use 100% of our brain loss of that limb. Quickly, neighbouring places recruit that tissues straight into fresh options, for instance to stand for other body places. This shows precisely how readily your brain utilises almost all obtainable neural tissues. Thus use 100% of our brain reason why does use 100% of our brain myth persist? For many individuals, use 100% of our brain 10 percent belief sounds both feasible and appealing as they notice it in terminology of human possibility. A lot of us imagine that we will realize a lot more - mastering languages, musical instruments, sporting competencies - if only we applied ourselves. It is not hard to track exactly how this morphs into use 100% of our brain shorthand concept that we throw away simply 10 percent of our brain's capacity or chance. Can it make a difference which flicks like Lucy dispersed use 100% of our brain ten % belief? It definitely bothers a lot of neuroscientists. There are numerous extensively kept confusions pertaining to your brain which researchers believe it is very unhelpful to have additional nonsense spread to millions of movie goers. Some people I've spoken to tend to be more hopeful as well as think that viewers will realize that use 100% of our brain claims are certainly not meant for being taken earnestly.

Fascinating issues come to happen.\\" I know I haven't made my Ph.D. but, Professor, however, I beg to differ. The thing is, all of us gain access to hundred % of use 100% of our brain brains of ours every day. And we don't need to be telekinetic or even remember an entire deck of cards to undertake it. Inside use 100% of our brain film, what opens following day Friday, Scarlett Johansson's character Lucy is actually compelled to get use 100% of our brain job done as being a drug smuggler within a Taiwanese mob. The drug they've implanted into her body leaks into use 100% of our brain computer system of her, enabling her to \\"access 100%\\" of use 100% of our brain mind of her. One among other items, Lucy can proceed stuff with use 100% of our brain thoughts of her, choose to not really feel ache, and commit to memory large levels of info. Within how, use 100% of our brain notion that many of us just use ten % of our brains is pretty inspiring. It may well motivate us to try out harder or maybe faucet into a few mysterious, in one piece container of chance plus imagination. There are even products that swear to unlock that most other 90 %. As ludicrous when use 100% of our brain claim is actually, nonetheless, 2/3 of use 100% of our brain general public and fifty percent of science coaches still believe use 100% of our brain myth to be real. The idea is very widespread that when University College London neuroscientist Sophie Scott went to a very first tool system, her trainer assured use 100% of our brain category that mind wounds were not unsafe because \\"90 % of this brain itself [doesn't] do anything.\\" How did use 100% of our brain misconception taken place, anyhow? We may be able to be able to keep track of its earliest roots back to psychologist William James, who wrote within his 1907 written text The Energies of Men that \\"we are utilizing only a small section of our likely mental and also physical resources.\\" I usually concur with this particular sentiment when I devote my evenings on use 100% of our brain couch seeing truth television, however,, obviously, James did not mean to give credence to this \\"10 % myth.\\" But somebody else did, Lowell Thomas, in use 100% of our brain foreword of his to Dale Carnegie's 1936 book The best way to Win Friends & Influence People, reinterpreted use 100% of our brain expression in addition to being, it appears, sprinkld within a few of his ideas. \\"Professor William James of Harvard,\\" Thomas authored, utilized to suggest that a regular pc user evolves just ten percent of his latent mental ability.\\" Here's use 100% of our brain thing: use 100% of our brain brain has swiftly tripled use 100% of our brain initial dimensions of its throughout 2 zillion years of human being evolution. Regardless of just accounting for two % of use 100% of our brain body weight of ours, your brain gobbles upwards a whopping twenty % of our daily energy ingestion . The brains of ours are also amazingly effective, possessing grown gyri which happen to have dramatically increased our cortical surface-area-to-total volume ratio distant relative to other species. The \\"we only use ten % of our brains\\" claim would signify that we're properly evolving within use 100% of our brain opposite direction-and that we are performing green living quite rapidly. Yet another clear way we are aware that we are utilizing greater than 10 % of our brain at use 100% of our brain same time is via methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as positron emission tomography. fMRI as well as PET are imaging techniques that show areas of reasonably high mental activities inside time which is actual. Imaging research tell us that not merely a variety of brain areas recruited when performing even use 100% of our brain easiest of projects, like watching a movie, but that a pastime involving these aspects is very compelling. In addition, use 100% of our brain \\"use it or maybe drop it\\" saying appears to hold particularly real present in mental health and fitness. A 2012 research by Schafer & Colleagues at Harvard found out that neural immune cells identified as microglia is able to remove idle, but otherwise balanced, synapses (connections) in between brain cells. Should we were just routinely using just 10 % of our brains at one time, we may well almost all be vulnerable to cerebral atrophy, similar to clients with neurodegenerative disorders as Alzheimer's. The \\"10 % myth\\" could possibly have been perpetuated by something which _is_ legitimate. Inspite of use 100% of our brain brain itself having almost hundred billion neurons, this particular cell type is greatly outnumbered by another: glial cells.

And we don't have to be telekinetic or maybe remember a complete deck of cards to do it. In use 100% of our brain movie, which opens next day Friday, Scarlett Johansson's character Lucy is actually compelled to do use 100% of our brain job as being a drug smuggler within a Taiwanese mob. The drug they've implanted straight into her body leaking to her pc, allowing her to \\"access 100%\\" of use 100% of our brain brain of her. Along with other items, Lucy can go items with her thought process, decide to never truly feel ache, as well as remember copious quantities of information. Within how, use 100% of our brain idea that many of us just use 10 % of our brains is pretty motivating. It might inspire us to try harder or perhaps faucet into some mystical, intact container of chance and also creativity. There are also goods that promise to unlock this many other 90 %. As ludicrous when use 100% of our brain claim is actually, however, 2/3 of everyone along with fifty percent of science teachers continue to trust use 100% of our brain misconception to be true. The notion is really extensive that when Faculty College London neuroscientist Sophie Scott came to a very first aid course, her teacher assured use 100% of our brain group which mind injuries were not risky simply because \\"90 % of this human brain [doesn't] do anything.\\" How did use 100% of our brain myth happened, anyway? We may be in a position to be able to observe its earliest origins again to psychologist William James, which published in his 1907 written text The Energies of Men which \\"we are actually employing just a tiny portion of our feasible psychological and bodily resources.\\" I often concur with this sentiment as I spend use 100% of our brain evenings of mine on use 100% of our brain couch seeing truth television, But, of course, James didn't intend to give credence to our \\"10 % myth.\\" But somebody else did, Lowell Thomas, in use 100% of our brain foreword of his to Dale Carnegie's 1936 guide The best way to Win Friends & Influence People, reinterpreted use 100% of our brain expression and also, it appears to be, sprinkld in a number of of his own ideas. \\"Professor William James of Harvard,\\" Thomas wrote, used to convey that a average pc user grows only 10 % of his latent brain ability.\\" Here's use 100% of our brain thing: your brain has swiftly tripled its original size throughout two million years of human evolution. Regardless of only accounting for 2 % of use 100% of our brain weight of ours, use 100% of our brain brain gobbles upwards a whopping twenty % of use 100% of our brain daily power intake of ours. Our brains are also remarkably economical, having grown gyri which happen to have dramatically increased our cortical surface-area-to-total volume ratio distant relative to various other species. The \\"we only use 10 % of use 100% of our brain brains\\" claim of ours would lead to that we are efficiently evolving within use 100% of our brain opposite direction-and that we're accomplishing this quite quickly. Yet another clear way we know we are utilizing more than 10 % of our brain at use 100% of our brain same time is through approaches including functional magnetic resonance imaging and also positron emission tomography. fMRI as well as PET are actually imaging strategies which reveal areas of relatively tall brain activities in time which is serious. Imaging scientific studies tell us that not only a variety of mental parts recruited when executing even use 100% of our brain most basic of activities, love watching a movie, but that this pastime among these elements is very dynamic. In addition, use 100% of our brain \\"use it or shed it\\" adage seems to carry specifically accurate found mind overall health. A 2012 study by Colleagues and Schafer at giving Harvard discovered that neural immune cells called microglia is able to remove idle, but otherwise healthy, synapses (connections) in between mind cells. Should we were only regularly working with only 10 % of our brains at any time, we may well all be vulnerable to cerebral atrophy, similar to patients with neurodegenerative conditions as Alzheimer's. The \\"10 % myth\\" may have been perpetuated by something which _is_ true. Despite use 100% of our brain brain having almost 100 billion neurons, this cellular style is immensely outnumbered by another: glial cells. Glial (\\"glue\\") cells are responsible for maintaining homeostasis, supplying structural assistance, insulating neurons with myelin, as well as getting rid of pathogens and debris. The particular ratio of glial cells to neurons is disputed, though numerous texts claim that it may be roughly 10:1. Quite simply, neurons are merely ten % of our entire brain.

I thought I would utilize what I discovered to provide you with a 60 second explainer on use 100% of our brain 10 percent belief. Excellent Myths belonging to use 100% of our brain Brain by Christian Jarrett was posted inside 2014. Invest in on Amazon. Outstanding Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain, by Christian Jarrett, was posted in 2014. Invest in on Amazon. Where does use 100% of our brain myth originate? No-one has learned no doubt. A favorite theory has it that use 100% of our brain journalist Lowell Thomas helped to dispersed use 100% of our brain misconception in his preface to Dale Carnegie's block buster self help book The best way to Win Friends and Influence People. Thomas misquoted use 100% of our brain great American psychologist William James as saying that use 100% of our brain average computer user specifically \\"develops only 10 percent of his latent psychological ability.\\" Actually James had referred more vaguely to our \\"latent brain energy.\\" Others have claimed that Einstein attributed his intellectual giftedness to staying in a position wear greater than 10 percent of use 100% of our brain brain of his, but this's itself a misconcepcion. Another probable origin of use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth is neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's discovery within use 100% of our brain 1930s of \\"silent cortex\\" - mental spots that appeared to have virtually no performance when he stimulated them with electrical energy. We know nowadays which these areas are functional. Is actually Lucy use 100% of our brain very first video to use use 100% of our brain ten percent misbelief as being a premise? No, use 100% of our brain 2011 movie Limitless, starring Bradley Cooper was based on use 100% of our brain same strategy, apart from use 100% of our brain highly accurate figure was positioned usually at 20 %. Cooper's character takes a tablet which enables him print on use 100% of our brain complete 100 percent. The 1991 movie Defending Your Life (thanks to A Voice within use 100% of our brain Wilderness for flagging this up in use 100% of our brain comments Flight and) belonging to use 100% of our brain Navigator (1986) may include claims which most individuals use a portion of our brains. The misconception is invoked in use 100% of our brain tv sequence Heroes, to explain as to why several people have unique capabilities. Does any person truly trust this belief anymore? Evidently quite. For example, during 2012, a survey of schooling teachers within Britain and use 100% of our brain Netherlands discovered that forty eight per cent and forty six a dollar, respectively, endorsed use 100% of our brain misconception. 12 months which is Previous, a US survey next to use 100% of our brain Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research found that sixty five % of individuals thought within use 100% of our brain misconception. Can there be any fact to use 100% of our brain myth? Obviously there's absolutely no truth to use 100% of our brain notion that many of us just use ten percent of use 100% of our brain neural matter of ours. Modern mental resulting scans show hobby coursing thru use 100% of our brain whole organ, even when we are resting. Small mental damage is able to have disastrous side effects - not what you'd anticipate whether we had ninety % emergency electrical capacity. In addition, consider use 100% of our brain scenario when neural cells representing a limb is actually rendered unneeded by way of use 100% of our brain decrease of this limb. Very quickly, neighbouring areas recruit that tissues into innovative features, for instance to stand for other body areas. This reveals how readily your brain utilises all obtainable neural tissue. So why does use 100% of our brain myth persist? For many individuals, use 100% of our brain 10 % myth appears simultaneously appealing and feasible because they notice it on phrases of human being possibility. A lot of us imagine that we might accomplish so much more - learning languages, musical instruments, sporting abilities - but only if we put on ourselves. It is easy to find out how this morphs directly into use 100% of our brain shorthand notion that people use merely 10 percent of our brain's capacity or possibility. Does it matter which films as Lucy distributed use 100% of our brain 10 % belief? It actually irritates a good deal of neuroscientists. There are plenty of commonly contained confusions pertaining to your brain that scientists think it is really unhelpful to have a lot of nonsense spread to millions of movie goers. Many people I've spoken to tend to be more optimistic and also believe use 100% of our brain viewers will know that use 100% of our brain claims are certainly not designed to become used seriously.

For example, in 2012, a survey of school coaches found in Britain as well as use 100% of our brain Netherlands found out that 48 per dollar and forty six per cent, respectively, endorsed use 100% of our brain myth. year which is Previous, a US survey by use 100% of our brain Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research found that 65 percent of people thought in use 100% of our brain misconception. Can there be any kind of fact to use 100% of our brain myth? Surely there is number truth to use 100% of our brain notion that we just use 10 % of our neural matter. Modern day mind resulting scans show activity coursing thru use 100% of our brain entire organ, flat when we are sleeping. Minor mental impairment is able to have destructive effects - not what you would assume if we had 90 percent extra capacity. In addition, consider use 100% of our brain circumstance when neural tissue that represent a limb is actually rendered unwanted because of use 100% of our brain loss in this limb. Quickly, neighbouring areas recruit that here cells directly into new options, for instance to stand for various other body places. This shows how readily use 100% of our brain brain utilises almost all available neural tissue. So use 100% of our brain reason does use 100% of our brain myth persist? For many individuals, use 100% of our brain 10 % misconception sounds equally feasible and appealing because they see it on phrases of man potential. A lot of us believe that we might accomplish a great deal - mastering languages, musical instruments, wearing capabilities - if perhaps we put on ourselves. It is not hard to track just how this morphs into use 100% of our brain shorthand idea that we utilize merely 10 percent of our brain's capacity or chance. Can it matter which films as Lucy dispersed use 100% of our brain ten percent myth? It actually irritates a lot of neuroscientists. There are so many extensively held misunderstandings about use 100% of our brain brain that scientists believe it is really unhelpful to have additional nonsense spread to millions of film goers. Others I've spoken to tend to be more positive and believe that audiences will understand that use 100% of our brain claims aren't intended to be taken significantly.

And we don't have to be telekinetic or even memorize a whole deck of cards to do it. Within use 100% of our brain movie, which opens following day Friday, Scarlett Johansson's character Lucy is made to get use 100% of our brain job done as a drug smuggler in a Taiwanese mob. The drug they've implanted directly into her body leaks within use 100% of our brain computer of her, permitting her to \\"access 100%\\" of her brain.

Within a way, use 100% of our brain concept that we only use ten % of use 100% of our brain brains of ours is quite motivating. It may encourage us to try out more difficult or tap into some mysterious, unchanged reservoir of chance plus imagination. There are also products which guarantee to unlock that many other 90 %. As ludicrous when use 100% of our brain claim is actually, however, 2/3 of everyone and half of science coaches continue to trust use 100% of our brain misconception to become true. The belief is so extensive that when Faculty College London neuroscientist Sophie Scott went to a very first aid course, her trainer assured use 100% of our brain class which head injuries were not risky mainly because \\"90 % of use 100% of our brain brain itself [doesn't] do anything.\\" How did this myth come about, anyway? We could be ready to be able to keep track of its earliest origins back to psychologist William James, which wrote within his 1907 text The Energies of Men which \\"we are actually utilizing just a tiny section of our possible mental and bodily resources.\\" I have a tendency to agree with this sentiment when I spend my nights on use 100% of our brain couch seeing truth television, although, naturally, James didn't intend to lend credence to our \\"10 % myth.\\" But someone else did, Lowell Thomas, in his foreword to Dale Carnegie's 1936 book The best way to Win Friends & Influence People, reinterpreted use 100% of our brain expression in addition to being, it seems, sprinkld in a few of his ideas. \\"Professor William James of Harvard,\\" Thomas wrote, utilized to say that a typical computer user develops simply 10 % of his latent psychological ability.\\" Here is use 100% of our brain thing: use 100% of our brain brain has rapidly tripled its initial sizing throughout two zillion several years of human evolution. Despite only accounting for two % of use 100% of our brain weight of ours, use 100% of our brain brain gobbles upwards a whopping 20 % of our daily electricity ingestion . Our brains are also amazingly economical, possessing grown gyri that contain drastically increased our cortical surface-area-to-total volume ratio relative to various other species. The \\"we just use ten % of use 100% of our brain brains\\" claim of ours would mean that we're properly evolving inside use 100% of our brain opposite direction-and that we are performing it rather quickly. Another obvious manner we are aware that we are utilizing greater than ten % of use 100% of our brain brain of ours at once is via approaches like functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as positron emission tomography. fMRI and also PET are imaging strategies which indicate aspects of relatively tall mind activities within actual time. Imaging scientific studies explain to us that not simply are lots of brain parts recruited when performing even use 100% of our brain easiest of tasks, love seeing a film, but that a hobby involving use 100% of our brain areas is very powerful. Plus, use 100% of our brain \\"use it or maybe shed it\\" adage appears to carry particularly accurate present in brain health. A 2012 review by Colleagues & Schafer at giving Harvard found out that neural immune cells known as microglia can remove idle, but normally wholesome, synapses (connections) among mental cells. Should we were only routinely working with only 10 % of use 100% of our brain brains of ours at any given time, we may well just about all be susceptible to cerebral waste away, similar to patients with neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's. The \\"10 % myth\\" may have been perpetuated by something which _is_ legitimate. Regardless of use 100% of our brain human brain using roughly 100 billion neurons, this specific cell type is vastly outnumbered by another: glial cells. Glial (\\"glue\\") cells are responsible for keeping homeostasis, supplying structural structure and support, insulating neurons with myelin, and getting rid of debris and pathogens. The actual ratio of glial cells to neurons is actually disputed, although a lot of texts state that it might possibly be approximately 10:1. Put simply, neurons are just 10 % of our entire mind. Think about yourself now. Are you engaging use 100% of our brain muscles of yours to sit down yourself upright?

Animal numerous studies discovered that greater than twenty % of neurons learned serve few identifiable reason. Certain investigators have believed that greater than sixty percent of this brain has \\"neural dim matter,\\" or perhaps neurons that contain no evident purpose and also appear unresponsive to popular stimuli. Animal living on environment goes back millions of many years, yet most species just use three to five % of use 100% of our brain cerebral capacity. - Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) during use 100% of our brain 2014 movie Lucy The make Lucy is well-known - or possibly infamous - for advancing use 100% of our brain concept that individuals humans use only a tiny portion of use 100% of our brain mental tissue of ours. Through a wide variety of sci-fi inventions, use 100% of our brain film's namesake principal character, played by Scarlett Johansson, is actually fortunate to radically raise use 100% of our brain brain use of her via just what it says is an ordinary value less than ten percent ultimately up to 100 percent. The \\"10 percent of use 100% of our brain brain myth,\\" as it is identified as, has a great deal of history. Plus Lucy Director Luc Besson readily proclaims which his digital movie is actually an illusion influenced by little assuming almost any science. Brecht Bug/Flickr Source: Brecht Bug/Flickr The film definitely would make use 100% of our brain own circumstances of its that developing activity outside organic amounts, let alone encountering a hundred percent brain, includes really serious minuses, including just what it portrays as more and more ruthless actions on use 100% of our brain component of Johansson's character. As we will see, at this time there are excellent neuroscientific factors to stick with use 100% of our brain pure allotment of ours of activity - and possibly to shoot for less. But a lot of serious internet writers have used use 100% of our brain film as being a foil to be able to debunk use 100% of our brain ten percent misconception.

Excellent Myths on use 100% of our brain Brain, by Christian Jarrett, was posted inside 2014. Purchase on Amazon. Wherever does use 100% of our brain misconception originate? No-one has learned no doubt. A favorite theory has it that use 100% of our brain journalist Lowell Thomas really helped dispersed use 100% of our brain misconception in use 100% of our brain preface of his to Dale Carnegie's block buster self-help publication The best way to Win Friends & Influence People. Thomas misquoted use 100% of our brain awesome American psychologist William James as stating use 100% of our brain typical person specifically \\"develops simply ten % of his latent brain ability.\\" In fact James had referred much more vaguely to our \\"latent mental energy.\\" Others have alleged that Einstein attributed his intellectual giftedness to staying able to use greater than 10 percent of his brain, but this's itself a misconcepcion. Another probable cause of use 100% of our brain 10 % misconception is neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's discovery in use 100% of our brain 1930s of \\"silent cortex\\" - mind places that came out to experience absolutely no performance as he stimulated them with energy. We all know nowadays which use 100% of our brain areas are useful. Is actually Lucy use 100% of our brain first movie to use use 100% of our brain ten % misbelief as a concept? No, use 100% of our brain 2011 film Limitless, starring Bradley Cooper was based on use 100% of our brain same strategy, except use 100% of our brain accurate figure was placed usually at 20 %. Cooper's character can take a tablet which allows him use use 100% of our brain complete hundred percent.

The belief is invoked in use 100% of our brain television series Heroes, to explain use 100% of our brain reason why some individuals have special capabilities. Does everyone truly believe use 100% of our brain misconception anymore? Apparently very. For instance, in 2012, a survey of schooling mentors found in Britain as well as use 100% of our brain Netherlands found that forty eight a dollar as well as forty six a dollar, respectively, endorsed use 100% of our brain myth. 12 months which is Last, a US survey near use 100% of our brain Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research found out that sixty five % of men and women thought within use 100% of our brain myth. Can there be any truth to use 100% of our brain myth? Obviously there is no fact to use 100% of our brain notion that we only use 10 percent of use 100% of our brain neural matter of ours. Modern day mental scans indicate activity coursing thru use 100% of our brain whole organ, even when we're catching your zzz's. Insignificant mind damage can have disastrous side effects - not what you would assume if we'd ninety % extra capacity. Furthermore, think about use 100% of our brain situation when neural tissue that represent a limb is actually made unneeded by use 100% of our brain loss of this limb. Very fast, neighbouring areas recruit that in this article cells straight into innovative options, for example to represent additional body regions.

For many individuals, use 100% of our brain 10 % myth sounds equally appealing and feasible because they see it in phrases of human being chance. Many of us believe that we might realize so much more - learning languages, musical instruments, sporting skills - but only if we applied ourselves.

Would it matter that movies as Lucy distributed use 100% of our brain 10 percent lie? It certainly affects a great deal of neuroscientists. There are plenty of commonly kept confusions about use 100% of our brain brain which experts find it very unhelpful to get additional nonsense spread to millions of movie goers. Other people I have spoken to tend to be more hopeful as well as believe use 100% of our brain audiences will know that use 100% of our brain claims are certainly not meant to be used seriously.

The reality is that often we currently work with 100 percent of our brains The truth is that any of us already use hundred percent of our brains_DJ_/FLICKR The newest LUC Besson film Lucy, starring Scarlett Johansson, opens later on in theaters countrywide. It is based upon use 100% of our brain immortal misbelief that we only use 10 % of our brains. Johansson's character is actually implanted with medications which allow her to get into 100 % of use 100% of our brain mental power of her. She consequently gains use 100% of our brain capability to master Chinese within a quick, overcome upwards males which are harmful, as well as toss cars with her mind (among additional new talents). Morgan Freeman plays neuroscientist Professor Norman, who's made his profession in use 100% of our brain ten percent claim. \\"It is estimated very human beings just use 10 percent of use 100% of our brain brain's capacity,\\" he states, \\"Imagine whenever we could access 100 percent.\\" As it occurs, I've written a book all about mental myths (Great Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain; due completely this November). I assumed I'd utilize what I learned to provide you with a 60-second explainer on use 100% of our brain 10 % myth. Great Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain by Christian Jarrett was posted in 2014. Buy on Amazon. Great Myths on use 100% of our brain Brain, by Christian Jarrett, was published in 2014. Purchase on Amazon. Anywhere does use 100% of our brain myth originate? No-one is aware no doubt. A common principle has it that use 100% of our brain journalist Lowell Thomas really helped spread use 100% of our brain misconception in his preface to Dale Carnegie's block-buster self help publication The best way to Win Friends and Influence People. Thomas misquoted use 100% of our brain brilliant American psychologist William James as expressing use 100% of our brain regular pc user especially \\"develops simply ten % of his latent mental ability.\\" In fact James had referred more vaguely to our \\"latent psychological energy.\\" Others have reported that Einstein attributed his intellectual giftedness to staying able to use more than 10 percent of use 100% of our brain brain of his, but this's itself a misconcepcion. One more possible cause of use 100% of our brain ten percent misconception is actually neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's discovery in use 100% of our brain 1930s of \\"silent cortex\\" - brain areas that showed up to have absolutely no function when he stimulated them with energy. We all know nowadays which these elements are useful. Happens to be Lucy use 100% of our brain initial video to use use 100% of our brain 10 % misbelief as an idea? No, use 100% of our brain 2011 movie Limitless, starring Bradley Cooper was based upon exactly use 100% of our brain same idea, only use 100% of our brain highly accurate figure was positioned at twenty %. Cooper's character takes a medicine that lets him use use 100% of our brain whole 100 percent. The 1991 movie Defending The Life of yours (thanks to A Voice in use 100% of our brain Wilderness for flagging this particular up inside use 100% of our brain comments ) and Flight of use 100% of our brain Navigator (1986) consist of promises that many individuals work with a portion of our brains. The belief is also invoked in use 100% of our brain television series Heroes, to explain why certain people have specific capabilities. Does anybody truly trust this belief any longer? It seems that so. For example, in 2012, a survey of schooling mentors found in Britain and use 100% of our brain Netherlands discovered that 48 a cent and forty six a dollar, respectively, endorsed use 100% of our brain myth. year which is Last, a US survey by use 100% of our brain Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research found that 65 percent of people considered inside use 100% of our brain misconception. Is there any sort of fact to use 100% of our brain myth? Obviously there is zero fact to use 100% of our brain notion that we only use ten percent of our neural matter. Modern day brain scans indicate activity coursing through use 100% of our brain whole body organ, even when we're catching your zzz's. Insignificant mental impairment can have destructive effects - not what you'd expect whether we'd 90 % spare electrical capacity. Also, think about use 100% of our brain circumstance when neural tissues representing a limb is actually made redundant because of use 100% of our brain decrease of this limb. Very fast, neighbouring places recruit that tissue straight into innovative features, for instance to stand for various other body areas. This reveals how readily your brain utilises almost all accessible neural tissues. Thus use 100% of our brain reason why does use 100% of our brain misconception persist? For a lot of people, use 100% of our brain 10 percent belief sounds both appealing and feasible since they notice it inside terms of human potential. Many of us believe that we might accomplish a great deal - learning languages, musical instruments, wearing capabilities - if only we put on ourselves. It's not hard to track how this morphs directly into use 100% of our brain shorthand idea that individuals throw away simply ten percent of our brain's potential or capacity. Would it really make a difference that movies like Lucy distributed use 100% of our brain ten % misconception? It actually affects a great deal of neuroscientists. There are so many extensively kept misunderstandings with regards to your brain which researchers believe it is extremely unhelpful to have additional nonsense spread to millions of film goers. Others I have spoken to tend to be more optimistic and assume use 100% of our brain audiences will know that use 100% of our brain statements aren't intended for being taken seriously. I have to acknowledge, I enjoyed Limitless regardless of use 100% of our brain daft concept. I haven't but observed Lucy. I'd love to listen to your ideas on regardless of whether it is a very good movie in spite of bad science, and if thus, does that justify further propagation of use 100% of our brain ten % myth?

Interesting things come to happen.\\" I am aware I have not made my Ph.D. but, Professor, though I beg to differ. The thing is, most of us access 100 % of our brains every single day. So we do not have to be telekinetic or even remember an entire deck of cards to achieve it. In use 100% of our brain movie, what opens next day Friday, Scarlett Johansson's character Lucy is actually forced to get use 100% of our brain job done as being a drug smuggler within a Taiwanese mob. The drug they've implanted into her body leaks to use 100% of our brain computer system of her, allowing her to \\"access 100%\\" of use 100% of our brain brain of her. Along with other items, Lucy can proceed items with use 100% of our brain thoughts of her, opt to never truly feel ache, and commit to memory large quantities of information. In how, use 100% of our brain concept that any of us just use ten % of use 100% of our brain brains of ours is quite uplifting. It may well motivate us to try out harder or spigot into some mystical, in one piece reservoir of potential and creativity. There are even products which guarantee to unlock this various other 90 %. As ludicrous as use 100% of our brain claim is actually, nonetheless, 2/3 of use 100% of our brain general public as well as half of science teachers continue to believe use 100% of our brain misconception to become legitimate. The notion is so prevalent that when Faculty College London neuroscientist Sophie Scott attended a first tool program, her trainer assured use 100% of our brain category which head injuries weren't dangerous because \\"90 % of use 100% of our brain brain [doesn't] do anything.\\" How did use 100% of our brain misconception taken place, regardless? We may be in a position to be able to observe its earliest roots again to psychologist William James, which published as part of his 1907 written text The Energies of Men which \\"we are actually using only a tiny section of our likely psychological and also bodily resources.\\" I tend to agree with this sentiment as I devote use 100% of our brain evenings of mine on use 100% of our brain couch seeing truth tv, But, of course, James did not mean to give credence to this \\"10 % myth.\\" But another person did, Lowell Thomas, in use 100% of our brain foreword of his to Dale Carnegie's 1936 guide The right way to Win Friends and Influence People, reinterpreted use 100% of our brain declaration in addition to being, it appears to be, sprinkld while in a number of of his ideas. \\"Professor William James of Harvard,\\" Thomas authored, used to suggest that a average computer user grows simply 10 % of his latent mental ability.\\" Here is use 100% of our brain thing: use 100% of our brain brain has swiftly tripled its initial sizing throughout two huge number of years of human evolution. In spite of only accounting for two % of our weight, use 100% of our brain brain gobbles upwards a whopping twenty % of use 100% of our brain daily energy ingestion of ours. Our brains are usually extremely effective, having developed gyri that contain dramatically enhanced our cortical surface-area-to-total volume ratio distant relative to various other species. The \\"we only use 10 % of use 100% of our brain brains\\" claim of ours would signify we're effectively evolving within use 100% of our brain opposite direction and that we're performing it rather rapidly. Another obvious way we are aware that we are cutting down greater than 10 % of use 100% of our brain brain of ours at use 100% of our brain same time is through approaches like useful magnetic resonance imaging as well as positron emission tomography. fMRI as well as PET are actually imaging techniques which show facets of relatively tall brain activities in actual time. Imaging research tell us that not simply are lots of brain parts recruited when performing also use 100% of our brain most basic of tasks, like seeing a film, but that this activity between these areas is extremely powerful. Plus, use 100% of our brain \\"use it or shed it\\" saying seems to store especially real in brain health. A 2012 research by Schafer as well as Colleagues at giving Harvard found that neural immune cells identified as microglia is able to remove idle, but normally balanced, synapses (connections) among mental cells. If we had been merely regularly working with just ten % of our brains at one time, we might almost all be vulnerable to cerebral waste away, similar to patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. The \\"10 % myth\\" might have been perpetuated by something that _is_ legitimate. Despite use 100% of our brain brain having nearly 100 billion neurons, this particular cell type is vastly outnumbered by another: glial cells. Glial (\\"glue\\") cells are given use 100% of our brain task of preserving homeostasis, supplying structural structure and support, insulating neurons with myelin, and taking away pathogens and debris. The particular ratio of glial cells to neurons is disputed, however, numerous texts claim that it might possibly be roughly 10:1. In other words, neurons are just ten % of our whole brain. Think of yourself now. Are you engaging your muscles to sit down yourself upright? Using your hand to go your computer computer mouse (or maybe thumb on your mobile device)? Maybe you're consuming an item? Taking note of music? Breathing? Feel comfortable, you're utilizing more than ten % of use 100% of our brain mind of yours today.

Published February nineteen, 2021|Reviewed by Devon Frye Share on FacebookShare Share on TwitterTweet Share via EmailEmail Key Points: A favorite claim that people employ simply ten percent of their brains is much coming from precise - but that doesn't mean we throw away hundred % of these, either. Animal research has determined that greater than twenty % of neurons studied serve no identifiable reason. Some investigators have believed that more than sixty percent of use 100% of our brain human brain has \\"neural dimly lit matter,\\" or neurons that have virtually no obvious purpose and appear unresponsive to typical stimuli. Animal life on planet extends back millions of many years, but use 100% of our brain majority of species only use three to five % of their cerebral capacity. - Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) with use 100% of our brain 2014 film Lucy The make Lucy is actually renowned - or possibly infamous - for moving on use 100% of our brain notion that individuals people use only a small portion of our mind tissues. By means of a variety of sci fi inventions, use 100% of our brain film's namesake main character, played by Scarlett Johansson, is actually able to radically boost her mind usage right from just what it says is actually use 100% of our brain average worth under ten percent eventually up to 100 %. The \\"10 % of use 100% of our brain human brain myth,\\" as it is known as, has a great deal of historical past. And Lucy Director Luc Besson freely proclaims which use 100% of our brain digital movie of his is a fantasy based upon very little assuming every science. Brecht Bug/Flickr Source: Brecht Bug/Flickr The film certainly makes use 100% of our brain own case of its which growing pastime beyond all-natural amounts, aside from encountering a 100 percent brain, includes truly serious drawbacks, this includes what it portrays as progressively more ruthless behavior on use 100% of our brain component of Johansson's character. As we will see, at this time there are great neuroscientific factors to stick with our natural allotment of exercise - and possibly to shoot for less. Yet a lot of serious freelance writers have implemented use 100% of our brain make as being a foil in order to debunk use 100% of our brain ten percent lie. They explain that, absolutely no, in fact, we discard practically all of use 100% of our brain human brain, so we do this continuously. An eminent neurologist coming from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine was quoted in Scientific American as stating Apple Source: Apple Now, it is probably true that, over time, we use more than just 10 percent of use 100% of our brain neurons in our heads. However, use 100% of our brain total is probably well short of 100 percent. The ‚Äúprobablies‚Äù here have to do with use 100% of our brain fact that it is very difficult to make high-resolution measurements of activity in lots of neurons in an awake animal.

Animal numerous studies discovered that over 20 percent of neurons learned serve few identifiable purpose. A number of researchers have believed that more than 60 percent of use 100% of our brain brain has \\"neural dark matter,\\" or neurons which have no evident goal and seem to be unresponsive to common stimuli. Animal living on planet goes back countless many years, yet most species only use three to five percent of their cerebral capacity. - Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) during use 100% of our brain 2014 film Lucy The make Lucy is actually famous - or maybe infamous - for moving forward use 100% of our brain notion that individuals people only use a small tiny proportion of use 100% of our brain mental tissues of ours. As a result of an assortment of sci-fi inventions, use 100% of our brain film's namesake principal character, played by Scarlett Johansson, is able to radically raise her mind consumption right from just what it says is actually an ordinary quality less than 10 percent ultimately as much as hundred %. The \\"10 % of use 100% of our brain brain myth,\\" as it's known as, has much history. And Lucy Director Luc Besson unreservedly proclaims which his film is actually an illusion based upon little in case any science. Brecht Bug/Flickr Source: Brecht Bug/Flickr The film definitely tends to make use 100% of our brain own case of its that developing pastime past natural levels, not to mention suffering from a 100 % brain, comes with serious downsides, this includes what it portrays as progressively more ruthless demeanor on use 100% of our brain element of Johansson's character.

But numerous serious internet writers have applied use 100% of our brain produce as being a foil in order to debunk use 100% of our brain ten % lie.

I believed I'd use what I discovered to provide you with a 60 second explainer on use 100% of our brain ten % misconception. Excellent Myths of use 100% of our brain Brain by Christian Jarrett was published within 2014. Buy on Amazon. Excellent Myths on use 100% of our brain Brain, by Christian Jarrett, was posted inside 2014. Purchase on Amazon. Wherever does use 100% of our brain myth originate? No-one knows no doubt. A popular theory has it that this journalist Lowell Thomas helped to dispersed use 100% of our brain misconception in use 100% of our brain preface of his to Dale Carnegie's block buster self-help guide The right way to Win Friends and Influence People. Thomas misquoted use 100% of our brain awesome American psychologist William James as expressing that use 100% of our brain typical computer user specifically \\"develops just ten % of his latent mental ability.\\" In fact James had referred more vaguely to our \\"latent brain energy.\\" Others have reported that Einstein attributed his intellectual giftedness to remaining able to use more than 10 % of use 100% of our brain brain of his, but this is itself a misbelief. Another probable origin of use 100% of our brain 10 % misconception is actually neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's finding within use 100% of our brain 1930s of \\"silent cortex\\" - brain areas which showed up to have absolutely no performance when he stimulated them with electrical energy. We all know today which use 100% of our brain aspects are useful. Is Lucy use 100% of our brain initial video to take advantage of use 100% of our brain ten percent myth as being a concept? No, use 100% of our brain 2011 movie Limitless, starring Bradley Cooper was based upon use 100% of our brain same strategy, but use 100% of our brain highly accurate figure was put at twenty percent. Cooper's character requires a tablet which lets him use use 100% of our brain complete hundred percent. The 1991 movie Defending Your Life (thanks to A Voice within use 100% of our brain Wilderness for flagging this up in use 100% of our brain comments Flight and) on use 100% of our brain Navigator (1986) consist of claims that many individuals employ a portion of use 100% of our brain brains of ours. The misconception is also invoked in use 100% of our brain television collection Heroes, to explain as to why a few buyers have special abilities. Does anybody truly trust use 100% of our brain myth anymore? Evidently quite. For example, throughout 2012, a survey of schooling teachers found in Britain as well as use 100% of our brain Netherlands discovered that 48 a dollar and 46 a dollar, respectively, endorsed use 100% of our brain misconception. 12 months that is Previous , a US survey by use 100% of our brain Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research found out that sixty five % of people believed inside use 100% of our brain misconception. Can there be any truth of use 100% of our brain matter to use 100% of our brain misconception? Obviously there is zero truth to use 100% of our brain notion that we just use 10 percent of our neural matter. Modern brain scans show hobby coursing through use 100% of our brain entire organ, flat when we are resting. Minor mind damage is able to have disastrous side effects - not what you'd anticipate if we'd ninety % spare capability. Furthermore, consider use 100% of our brain circumstance when neural cells representing a limb is rendered redundant by use 100% of our brain loss in this limb. Very quickly, neighbouring spots recruit that tissue directly into new functions, for example to stand for other body places. This reveals how readily use 100% of our brain brain utilises almost all obtainable neural tissues. Thus use 100% of our brain reason does use 100% of our brain myth persist? For many people, use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth appears both appealing and feasible because they notice it in phrases of man possibility. Most of us believe that we will realize a lot more - mastering languages, musical instruments, sporting capabilities - but only if we put on ourselves. It's easy to see how this morphs into use 100% of our brain shorthand idea that people throw away simply 10 % of our brain's capability or possibility. Does it really make a difference which flicks like Lucy distributed use 100% of our brain 10 percent belief? It certainly affects a lot of neuroscientists. There are plenty of extensively kept confusions about use 100% of our brain brain which researchers find it extremely unhelpful to get more nonsense spread to numerous movie goers. Others I have spoken to are more hopeful and believe use 100% of our brain viewers will know that use 100% of our brain statements are certainly not designed to be considered significantly. I've to admit, I appreciated Limitless inspite of use 100% of our brain daft premise. I haven't yet observed Lucy. I would prefer to hear your ideas on whether it's a good a digital movie of spite of use 100% of our brain bad science, and when thus, does that justify further propagation on use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth?

And we do not need to be telekinetic or maybe memorize a whole deck of cards to undertake it. Inside use 100% of our brain movie, that opens next day Friday, Scarlett Johansson's character Lucy is actually compelled to work as a drug smuggler in a Taiwanese mob. The drug they've implanted straight into her body leaking to her pc, allowing her to \\"access 100%\\" of her brain. One among other things, Lucy can proceed stuff with use 100% of our brain thoughts of her, decide to never truly feel ache, as well as memorize large quantities of information. In a way, use 100% of our brain notion that many of us just use ten % of use 100% of our brain brains of ours is quite motivating. It may well encourage us to use more difficult or spigot straight into several mystical, in one piece tank of ingenuity as well as potential . There are also products which promise to unlock this other 90 %. As ludicrous as use 100% of our brain claim is actually, however, 2/3 of everyone along with half of science teachers continue to trust use 100% of our brain myth to become legitimate. The notion is very widespread that when Faculty College London neuroscientist Sophie Scott attended a very first aid course, her trainer assured use 100% of our brain group which head injuries were not unsafe because \\"90 % of this brain [doesn't] do anything.\\" How did this false impression happened, regardless? We could be ready In order to observe its earliest beginnings back again to psychologist William James, which wrote as part of his 1907 written text The Energies of Men that \\"we are employing only a small section of our likely emotional and actual physical resources.\\" I often agree with this sentiment as I spend use 100% of our brain evenings of mine on use 100% of our brain couch observing reality television, however,, obviously, James didn't plan to lend credence to this \\"10 % myth.\\" But somebody else did, Lowell Thomas, in use 100% of our brain foreword of his to Dale Carnegie's 1936 book The right way to Win Friends & Influence People, reinterpreted use 100% of our brain statement and also, it appears, sprinkld while in a number of of his ideas. \\"Professor William James of Harvard,\\" Thomas published, used to suggest that use 100% of our brain typical person grows only 10 percent of his latent brain ability.\\" Here is use 100% of our brain thing: your brain has quickly tripled use 100% of our brain original sizing of its across two huge number of years of man evolution. Despite just accounting for two % of our body weight, your brain gobbles upwards a whopping twenty % of use 100% of our brain day electricity intake of ours. Our brains are also extremely efficient, having grown gyri which have dramatically enhanced our cortical surface-area-to-total volume ratio distant relative to other species. The \\"we only use ten % of our brains\\" claim would lead to we are effectively evolving inside use 100% of our brain contrary direction and that we are doing this quite quickly. Another apparent manner we know we're using more than ten % of use 100% of our brain brain of ours simultaneously is by approaches including useful magnetic resonance imaging and also positron emission tomography. fMRI and PET are imaging techniques which indicate areas of relatively tall mind activity in time that is real. Imaging scientific studies inform us that not only are lots of mental parts recruited when doing also use 100% of our brain simplest of projects, adore seeing an a digital movie, but that this hobby between use 100% of our brain areas is very dynamic. Additionally, use 100% of our brain \\"use it or maybe lose it\\" saying seems to carry specifically accurate present in mental health and fitness. A 2012 study by Schafer & Colleagues at Harvard found that neural immune cells called microglia can remove idle, but usually healthy, synapses (connections) among mind cells. If we were just frequently using only ten % of our brains at any given time, we may well just about all be prone to cerebral wither up, similar to individuals with neurodegenerative ailments like Alzheimer's. The \\"10 % myth\\" could possibly have been perpetuated by something that _is_ legitimate. Inspite of use 100% of our brain brain itself owning roughly hundred billion neurons, this specific cell type is vastly outnumbered by another: glial cells. Glial (\\"glue\\") cells are actually given use 100% of our brain task of keeping homeostasis, supplying structural support, insulating neurons with myelin, and getting rid of pathogens and waste. The actual ratio of glial cells to neurons is disputed, even thought numerous texts say that it might possibly be approximately 10:1.

The notion is really widespread that when University College London neuroscientist Sophie Scott went to a very first tool course, her instructor assured use 100% of our brain group which head injuries were not risky mainly because \\"90 % of this brain [doesn't] do anything.\\" How did use 100% of our brain misconception happened, regardless? We may be ready To keep track of its earliest roots back again to psychologist William James, who had written as part of his 1907 textual content The Energies of Men that \\"we are using merely a small part of our feasible mental and physical resources.\\" I have a tendency to concur with this particular sentiment when I invest my evenings on use 100% of our brain couch watching truth tv, Though, of course, James did not mean to give credence to our \\"10 % myth.\\" But somebody else did, Lowell Thomas, in use 100% of our brain foreword of his to Dale Carnegie's 1936 publication The right way to Win Friends and Influence People, reinterpreted use 100% of our brain declaration and, it appears to be, sprinkld inside a number of of his own ideas. \\"Professor William James of Harvard,\\" Thomas authored, utilized to convey that use 100% of our brain regular computer user evolves just 10 percent of his latent brain ability.\\" Here is use 100% of our brain thing: use 100% of our brain brain has quickly tripled use 100% of our brain original sizing of its throughout two million many years of human evolution. In spite of just accounting for 2 % of our weight, your brain gobbles upwards a whopping twenty % of use 100% of our brain day power ingestion of ours. Our brains are usually amazingly efficient, possessing evolved gyri that contain dramatically enhanced our cortical surface-area-to-total volume ratio distant relative to various other species. The \\"we only use 10 % of our brains\\" claim would mean that we are efficiently evolving within use 100% of our brain exact opposite direction and that we're performing green living very rapidly. Yet another clear manner we are aware we are utilizing more than 10 % of use 100% of our brain brain of ours simultaneously is through methods such as useful magnetic resonance imaging as well as positron emission tomography. fMRI and PET are imaging strategies that reveal areas of reasonably high brain actions within time that is real. Imaging studies inform us that not only are many mind parts recruited when executing actually use 100% of our brain easiest of activities, love watching an a digital movie, but that this pastime involving use 100% of our brain aspects is incredibly powerful. Additionally, use 100% of our brain \\"use it or maybe lose it\\" adage appears to hold particularly true found brain overall health. A 2012 research by Schafer as well as Colleagues at giving Harvard discovered that neural immune cells called microglia is able to get rid of idle, but otherwise healthy, synapses (connections) between mind cells. If we had been just frequently utilizing just 10 % of our brains at one time, we might all be susceptible to cerebral atrophy, similar to individuals with neurodegenerative conditions as Alzheimer's. The \\"10 % myth\\" may have been perpetuated by something which _is_ true. Inspite of use 100% of our brain brain using nearly hundred billion neurons, this particular cellular style is greatly outnumbered by another: glial cells. Glial (\\"glue\\") cells are given use 100% of our brain task of maintaining homeostasis, supplying structural support, insulating neurons with myelin, as well as getting rid of pathogens and rubble. The particular ratio of glial cells to neurons is actually disputed, nonetheless, a lot of texts say that it may be roughly 10:1.

Animal studies have found that over twenty percent of neurons studied provide few identifiable reason. A number of scientists have estimated that more than 60 percent of this brain consists of \\"neural dimly lit matter,\\" or perhaps neurons that contain virtually no evident purpose and also appear unresponsive to popular stimulus. Animal life on world goes back scores of years, yet most species just use three to five percent of use 100% of our brain cerebral capacity. - Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) with use 100% of our brain 2014 movie Lucy The produce Lucy is actually renowned - or possibly infamous - for moving on use 100% of our brain concept that we humans only use a tiny tiny proportion of our mental tissue. By means of a wide variety of sci fi inventions, use 100% of our brain film's namesake principal character, played by Scarlett Johansson, is actually able to radically raise use 100% of our brain brain usage of her from what it claims is a typical quality under 10 percent ultimately as much as hundred percent. The \\"10 percent of use 100% of our brain brain myth,\\" as it is identified as, has much history. Plus Lucy Director Luc Besson readily proclaims that his film is a fantasy based on little assuming almost any science. Brecht Bug/Flickr Source: Brecht Bug/Flickr The movie certainly tends to make its own circumstances that developing hobby beyond organic levels, not to mention experiencing a hundred % mind, features truly serious drawbacks, including just what it portrays as progressively more ruthless habit on use 100% of our brain element of Johansson's character. As we are going to see, there are excellent neuroscientific factors to follow our pure allotment of activity - and perhaps to shoot for a low price. But a lot of professional internet writers have used use 100% of our brain film as a foil to be able to debunk use 100% of our brain ten % lie.

Excellent Myths on use 100% of our brain Brain by Christian Jarrett was posted in 2014. Buy on Amazon. Great Myths belonging to use 100% of our brain Brain, by Christian Jarrett, was posted inside 2014. Invest in on Amazon. Wherever does use 100% of our brain myth originate? No-one is aware without a doubt. A favorite theory has it that use 100% of our brain journalist Lowell Thomas helped dispersed use 100% of our brain misconception in his preface to Dale Carnegie's block-buster self-help publication How to Win Friends & Influence People. Thomas misquoted use 100% of our brain great American psychologist William James as stating use 100% of our brain regular computer user specifically \\"develops only ten % of his latent mental ability.\\" In fact James had referred much more vaguely to our \\"latent psychological energy.\\" Others have alleged that Einstein attributed his intellectual giftedness to being in a position wear greater than ten percent of his brain, but this is itself a misbelief. Another likely cause of use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth is actually neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's finding within use 100% of our brain 1930s of \\"silent cortex\\" - mind places which came out to experience no function as he stimulated them with electricity. We know today which these areas are functional. Is actually Lucy use 100% of our brain very first movie to take advantage of use 100% of our brain 10 percent myth as a concept? No, use 100% of our brain 2011 movie Limitless, starring Bradley Cooper was based on use 100% of our brain same idea, besides use 100% of our brain precise figure was positioned during twenty %. Cooper's character requires a medicine that lets him access use 100% of our brain complete hundred %. Both use 100% of our brain 1991 film Defending Your Life (thanks to A Voice within use 100% of our brain Wilderness for flagging this specific set up throughout use 100% of our brain comments ) and Flight of use 100% of our brain Navigator (1986) include claims which most people employ a tiny proportion of our brains. The myth is invoked within this tv collection Heroes, to explain as to why certain buyers have special capabilities. Does anybody truly believe use 100% of our brain myth anymore? Apparently as. For instance, during 2012, a survey of school teachers in Britain as well as use 100% of our brain Netherlands found that forty eight a dollar and also forty six per cent, respectively, endorsed use 100% of our brain myth. 12 months which is Last, a US survey near use 100% of our brain Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research found that sixty five percent of people thought within use 100% of our brain myth. Is there any truth to use 100% of our brain misconception? Certainly there's no fact to use 100% of our brain notion that any of us only use ten percent of our neural matter. Modern day brain scans show activity coursing thru use 100% of our brain whole organ, flat when we are catching your zzz's. Minor mind impairment can have disastrous effects - not what you'd expect whether we had 90 percent extra electrical capacity. Also, consider use 100% of our brain circumstance when neural cells that represent a limb is rendered redundant by way of use 100% of our brain loss of this limb. Very quickly, neighbouring areas recruit that here tissues straight into innovative features, for example to stand for various other body places. This demonstrates exactly how easily your brain utilises all accessible neural tissues. Thus why does use 100% of our brain myth persist? For a lot of people, use 100% of our brain ten % belief seems both appealing and feasible as they notice it in terms of man possibility. Many of us believe that we could realize a great deal - learning languages, musical instruments, wearing expertise - but only if we put on ourselves. It is not hard to see just how this morphs straight into use 100% of our brain shorthand idea that people utilize merely ten percent of our brain's potential or capacity. Can it make a difference which flicks as Lucy dispersed use 100% of our brain ten percent belief? It actually affects a good deal of neuroscientists. There are many widely held confusions about use 100% of our brain brain that scientists believe it is extremely unhelpful to have additional nonsense spread to scores of film goers. Many people I've spoken to are usually more optimistic and believe that viewers will realize that use 100% of our brain statements are not meant to be used seriously. I have to acknowledge, I enjoyed Limitless despite use 100% of our brain daft idea. I have not yet observed Lucy. I would love to pick up your thoughts on no matter whether it is a very good a digital movie in spite of terrible science, of course, if and so, does that justify additional propagation on use 100% of our brain ten % myth?

Exciting things begin to happen.\\" I know I haven't generated my Ph.D. yet, Professor, though I beg to differ. You see, we all access hundred % of our brains each day. So we do not need to be telekinetic or maybe memorize a whole deck of cards to undertake it. In use 100% of our brain movie, that opens following day Friday, Scarlett Johansson's character Lucy is made to get use 100% of our brain job done as being a drug smuggler in a Taiwanese mob. The drug they have implanted straight into use 100% of our brain body leaks of her to use 100% of our brain system of her, allowing her to \\"access 100%\\" of her mind. Among other things, Lucy can proceed objects with her thought process, decide not to feel soreness, and commit to memory large amounts of info. Within how, use 100% of our brain notion that we just use ten % of our brains is quite motivating. It may well encourage us to try out trickier or tap straight into a few mysterious, unchanged tank of chance plus ingenuity. There are also products which swear to unlock that various other 90 %. As ludicrous as use 100% of our brain claim is, nonetheless, 2/3 of everyone along with one half of science mentors continue to believe use 100% of our brain misconception to be real. The notion is very prevalent that when University College London neuroscientist Sophie Scott attended a very first aid program, her instructor assured use 100% of our brain group which head injuries were not unsafe because \\"90 % of use 100% of our brain brain itself [doesn't] do anything.\\" How did this false impression come about, anyway? We could be ready In order to track its earliest roots back to psychologist William James, who had written in his 1907 textual content The Energies of Men that \\"we are actually utilizing only a small part of our feasible emotional and physical resources.\\" I have a tendency to agree with this particular sentiment as I spend my evenings on use 100% of our brain couch observing reality television, Though, obviously, James did not plan to give credence to our \\"10 % myth.\\" But someone else did, Lowell Thomas, in his foreword to Dale Carnegie's 1936 book How to Win Friends & Influence People, reinterpreted use 100% of our brain expression and also, it seems, sprinkld in a few of his ideas. \\"Professor William James of Harvard,\\" Thomas published, used to suggest that a average computer user develops simply ten percent of his latent psychological ability.\\" Here is use 100% of our brain thing: your brain has swiftly tripled use 100% of our brain initial size of its throughout two zillion many years of man evolution. Regardless of just accounting for 2 % of our body weight, use 100% of our brain brain gobbles up a whopping 20 % of our daily power ingestion . Our brains are additionally extremely efficient, having grown gyri that contain significantly enhanced our cortical surface-area-to-total volume ratio family member to various other species. The \\"we just use ten % of use 100% of our brain brains\\" claim of ours would mean we are efficiently evolving inside use 100% of our brain contrary direction-and that we're doing it rather rapidly. One more obvious means we are aware we're utilizing more than ten % of our brain simultaneously is through methods like functional magnetic resonance imaging and also positron emission tomography. fMRI and also PET are imaging methods which reveal areas of relatively tall mind activities in time which is serious. Imaging studies explain to us that not merely are lots of mental areas recruited when performing actually use 100% of our brain easiest of projects, like seeing an a digital movie, but that use 100% of our brain activity between use 100% of our brain areas is very powerful. Plus, use 100% of our brain \\"use it or perhaps drop it\\" adage appears to carry specifically real present in mental health and fitness. A 2012 research by Schafer and Colleagues at giving Harvard discovered that neural immune cells known as microglia is able to get rid of idle, but otherwise healthy, synapses (connections) between mental cells. Should we were just frequently working with just 10 % of our brains at one time, we might just about all be susceptible to cerebral wither up, resembling individuals with neurodegenerative illnesses as Alzheimer's. The \\"10 % myth\\" might have been perpetuated by a thing that _is_ true. Despite use 100% of our brain brain using nearly hundred billion neurons, this particular cellular type is greatly outnumbered by another: glial cells. Glial (\\"glue\\") cells are responsible for keeping homeostasis, providing structural assistance, insulating neurons with myelin, as well as removing pathogens and waste. The actual ratio of glial cells to neurons is disputed, nonetheless, numerous texts state that it may be around 10:1. In other words, neurons are merely ten % of use 100% of our brain entire mind of ours. Give some thought to yourself today. Could you be getting your muscle mass to sit down yourself upright? Using your hand to go your computer mouse (or thumb on use 100% of our brain movable device) of yours? Perhaps you're consuming something? Taking note of music? Breathing? Feel comfortable, you're using greater than ten % of use 100% of our brain brain of yours today. You might have played God inside an a digital movie, Morgan Freeman, but clearly you need a primer on how your most amazing creation-use 100% of our brain brain functions! -- Originally published with use 100% of our brain Conversation UK.

Put up February 19, 2021|Reviewed by Devon Frye Share on FacebookShare Share on TwitterTweet Share by EmailEmail Key Points: A common claim that humans employ merely 10 % of their brains is significantly from accurate - but that does not signify we utilize 100 % of them, too. Animal research has found that over twenty % of neurons learned provide no identifiable purpose. Certain researchers have estimated that more than 60 % of use 100% of our brain brain has \\"neural dimly lit matter,\\" or neurons which have no evident goal and also appear unresponsive to typical stimuli. Animal life on earth extends back millions of years, but many species just use three to five percent of use 100% of our brain cerebral capacity. - Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) during use 100% of our brain 2014 movie Lucy The make Lucy is actually well-known - or perhaps infamous - for moving forward use 100% of our brain concept that individuals individuals just use a tiny portion of use 100% of our brain brain tissue of ours. Through an assortment of sci-fi inventions, use 100% of our brain film's namesake main character, played by Scarlett Johansson, is actually in a position to radically boost use 100% of our brain mind use of her right from just what it says is actually use 100% of our brain average value below ten % ultimately about 100 %. The \\"10 percent of use 100% of our brain human brain myth,\\" as it is called, has a long heritage. And Lucy Director Luc Besson freely proclaims which use 100% of our brain digital movie of his is actually a pipe dream based on very little in case every science. Brecht Bug/Flickr Source: Brecht Bug/Flickr The film definitely would make a case which expanding hobby past all-natural quantities, let alone encountering a 100 percent mind, includes serious downsides, this includes what it portrays as progressively more ruthless demeanor on use 100% of our brain element of Johansson's character. As we will see, there are good neuroscientific reasons to stay with our pure allotment of exercise - and possibly to strive for a low price. Yet lots of serious freelance writers have used use 100% of our brain make as being a foil to be able to debunk use 100% of our brain ten % lie. They explain this, absolutely no, actually, we discard practically each of use 100% of our brain brain, and we do so on a regular basis. An eminent neurologist from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine was quoted during Scientific American as stating article continues after advertisement Until recently, only a handful, a few dozen, or, more rarely, a few hundred or thousand neurons, could be measured at once with precision. However, neuroscientists are making significant progress. In 2020, a large team led by Saskia de Vries of use 100% of our brain Allen Institute for Brain Science published a blockbuster paper that made precise estimates of large-scale neural activity patterns in use 100% of our brain mouse brain. They measured activity across numerous areas of use 100% of our brain cerebral cortex involved in vision and were able to record detailed activity in an astounding 60,000 neurons. As they recorded, use 100% of our brain animals were able to run freely on a rotating disc. Animals were shown a variety of natural images and movies, giving a strong semblance of normal, active life for a mouse. It‚Äôs worth giving a little more detail about use 100% of our brain methods of this study because they help illuminate a misleading argument in support of use 100% of our brain 100 percent myth. You might think that, in a brain of hundreds of millions or billions of neurons, 60,000 is still not a huge sample. In use 100% of our brain mouse, it constitutes less than 0.1 percent of use 100% of our brain brain‚Äîand mice are obviously a lot smaller and less sophisticated than us. Why not use brain imaging instead? This gives us use 100% of our brain attractive color images of whole brains ‚Äúlighting up‚Äù‚Äîand it can be done in humans. The issue is that brain imaging techniques like fMRI lack use 100% of our brain necessary precision. They summarize activity over large numbers of neurons, and over comparatively long stretches of time. In a typical fMRI experiment, each data point describing ‚Äúactivity‚Äù corresponds to use 100% of our brain neural responses in a cube around 1 millimeter on a side. Each of use 100% of our brain thousands of cubes that compose use 100% of our brain brain contains hundreds of thousands or millions of neurons. The firing of these neurons is blurred together within each cube, and often further blurred by combining cubes comprising an anatomical brain region such as use 100% of our brain amygdala. Spiking is also summed up over use 100% of our brain course of a second or so. This may seem like a short period but neurons operate much faster: on use 100% of our brain millisecond scale. This means that they could fire hundreds of times in an almost endless variety of patterns, and all of this detail is invisible to use 100% of our brain brain scanner. article continues after advertisement Zhang et al./PLoS One 0108807 Source: Zhang et al./PLoS One 0108807 Yet imaging data are often taken as evidence for use 100% of our brain 100 percent myth: ‚ÄúLook!‚Äù it is argued, ‚Äúalmost every little cube is active, and use 100% of our brain whole brain is ‚Äòlighting up!‚Äô‚Äù Here again, we have a flawed argument. The reality is that use 100% of our brain change in activity of a given voxel‚Äîwhen it ‚Äúlights up‚Äù‚Äîis quite small: it corresponds to a change in imaging signal of just a few percent at most. ‚ÄúLighting up‚Äù can be caused by a relative handful of neurons inside a given voxel being highly active. This situation could, at a given moment, leave many if not most neurons quiescent and therefore result in much less than 100 percent activity. Nor can you tell if there are some neurons that never fire. At use 100% of our brain much finer-grained resolution achieved by use 100% of our brain de Vries team, who used advanced invasive imaging techniques that require surgically exposing brain tissue, we can see what‚Äôs really going on. They found that almost a quarter‚Äî23 percent‚Äîof neurons in use 100% of our brain visual brain didn‚Äôt respond to any visual stimuli. Stimuli included a diverse assortment of natural scenes from around use 100% of our brain world as well as natural movies, including clips from use 100% of our brain 1958 Orson Welles classic Touch of Evil. They also tried a wide variety of artificial images of alternating blobs and stripes. It was all to no avail for use 100% of our brain 23 percent‚Äîthese neurons would spike every once in a while, but not in any systematic way. They didn‚Äôt care about motion, brightness, contrast, or seemingly anything else. If 23 percent of our own visual neurons don't have an identifiable purpose, can we really say we \\"use\\" them? It‚Äôs possible these quiet neurons would have responded to some special picture or movie that they weren‚Äôt shown. And despite being nominally ‚Äúvisual‚Äù neurons, some might respond to other types of stimuli such as a strong mouse-relevant odor or a loud sound. But as best as we can tell, almost a quarter of use 100% of our brain neurons in this critical brain system are doing little if anything we can discern. This pattern is by no means limited to use 100% of our brain visual brain. A smaller but still impressive study recorded neurons in a part of use 100% of our brain cortex responsible for hearing in rats. It found that only about 10 percent of neurons responded to sound stimuli. Again, use 100% of our brain other neurons might respond to some odd sound that wasn‚Äôt presented, or to light falling on use 100% of our brain eyes, touch on use 100% of our brain skin, or something else. But use 100% of our brain magnitude of unresponsive neurons suggests that some substantial fraction of neurons is mostly quiet. Neuroscientists have known about this problem for a long time but until recently, it was standard practice to not scrutinize or, in many cases, mention \\"unresponsive\\" neurons in recording studies. article continues after advertisement Others have made very high estimates of use 100% of our brain number of quiet or silent neurons. Neurobiologist Saak Ovsepian used previous reports to estimate that use 100% of our brain fraction of what has come to be called ‚Äúneural dark matter‚Äù could be as high as 60 to 90 percent. The high end of this estimate aligns nicely with use 100% of our brain 10 percent notion explored in Lucy. Why would use 100% of our brain brain have so many useless neurons? Isn‚Äôt this wasteful? Evolutionary biologists have devised an explanation for use 100% of our brain phenomenon of neural dark matter on Darwinian grounds. The idea is that, over use 100% of our brain course of generations, neurons that never respond are no longer subject to selective forces that would otherwise penalize owners of excess neurons. Following this logic, dark neurons can‚Äôt be disposed of. Dark neurons might be called upon if use 100% of our brain brain is damaged. They could also come in handy over use 100% of our brain course of evolution as species enter new habitats or face new challenges. It‚Äôs worth emphasizing that even a very high estimate of use 100% of our brain amount of dark matter doesn‚Äôt suppose that quiet neurons are bunched together, representing large chunks of terra incognita in your head. Instead, they are interspersed with ‚Äúbright‚Äù or loud neurons throughout use 100% of our brain cerebral cortex and in other parts of use 100% of our brain brain. Regardless of how they are distributed, there is certainly more than a smidge of dark matter in our brains. I think that, given use 100% of our brain metabolic cost of building and running a brain‚Äîespecially one of our size‚Äîour brains couldn‚Äôt exist with more than half of their neurons never being active. After all, use 100% of our brain de Vries study showed that 77 percent of use 100% of our brain visual neurons they measured were doing something that seems useful. However, these neurons weren't responding all use 100% of our brain time, or even nearly all use 100% of our brain time. Their responses were instead sparse. In Part 2 of this post, I will consider use 100% of our brain idea of sparseness and what it means for use 100% of our brain question of how much of our brain we use. I'll also show how this question is illuminated by conceiving our brains as operating in similar ways as use 100% of our brain internet. article continues after advertisement Copyright ¬© 2021 Daniel Graham.

Cop an adrenalin hit from seeing what use 100% of our brain human mind is potentially capable of by catching it in cinemas September 28. Everything we know is a lie, people. I hate to break it to ya, but most of us have been believing (and I dare say perpetuating) a false claim for decades now. As someone who prides themselves on possessing a somewhat useless library of factual tidbits to call upon in social situations, this discovery was a massive kick in use 100% of our brain balls. Like, this has left me more woke than I‚Äôd be if someone told me Anne Hathaway‚Äòs boots weren‚Äôt, in fact, goddamn Chanel. What, pray tell, could leave us all so shook? Oh, y‚Äôknow, just use 100% of our brain mind-blowing revelation that use 100% of our brain whole ‚Äúwe only use 10% of our brains‚Äù claim is entirely incorrect. Yep, add that to your dinner party conversation topics list and smoke it. Given that it‚Äôs now clear we use more than a measly 10%, you‚Äôre probably wondering exactly how much we do legit use. Scientific America‚Äòs article ‚ÄòDo People Only Use 10% Of Their Brains‚Äò sheds a lil‚Äô light on use 100% of our brain topic: Evidence would show over a day you use 100 percent of use 100% of our brain brain, says John Henley, a neurologist at use 100% of our brain Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Even in sleep, areas such as use 100% of our brain frontal cortex, which controls things like higher level thinking and self-awareness, or use 100% of our brain somatosensory areas, which help people sense their surroundings, are active, Henley explains. ‚Ä¶.[I]t turns out though, that we use virtually every part of use 100% of our brain brain, and that [most of] use 100% of our brain brain is active almost all use 100% of our brain time. Be it during meditation, sleepy time, or mindlessly watching horrifically trashy reality TV, our brain‚Äôs always active ‚Äì and most of use 100% of our brain time it‚Äôs using every bit of juice it‚Äôs got. So why is use 100% of our brain revelation that we use most of our brain 24/7 such a hard pill to swallow? Well, for a lot of you (myself included), we‚Äôve kinda been living our lives thinking, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm actually an offensively intelligent superhuman ‚Äì use 100% of our brain only reason I ain‚Äôt slaying left, right and centre at literally anything I put my mind to is because 90% of my noggin is dormant.‚Äù This untapped potential has swiftly just been pulled from underneath us, which really bloody sucks. Marc Ettlinger, a Research Neuroscientist at use 100% of our brain Department of Veterans Affairs in use 100% of our brain US elaborates on all use 100% of our brain feels you may/may not be experiencing RN: There is a sense people have that they aren‚Äôt reaching their full potential. Whether it is laziness or constantly facing limitations in what we can ‚Äòdo‚Äô versus what we can ‚Äòimagine‚Äô, we cling to this belief that there is some secret way to unleash use 100% of our brain untapped capacity of our mind. Pretty much everyone I know ‚Äì from workaholic professors to rich entrepreneurs ‚Äì feels like they don‚Äôt perform to their peak capacity. That should tell you that use 100% of our brain notion of underusing our (brain) potential is primarily a matter of perception and not reality. That being said, not all hope is entirely lost. The Scientific American article mentioned earlier concludes by saying, ‚ÄúUltimately, it‚Äôs not that we use 10 percent of our brains, merely that we only understand about 10 percent of how it functions.‚Äù Just because we haven‚Äôt unlocked some magical way to completely up use 100% of our brain ante of how our brain is hardwired doesn‚Äôt mean we won‚Äôt stumble across something in use 100% of our brain future. Perhaps someone will make some hectic drug (as is commonly depicted in popular culture), or perhaps we‚Äôll stumble across an even creepier method of unlocking superhuman abilities. One such example of this is Sony‚Äòs upcoming release Flatliners (starring Ellen Page and Diego Luna) is about five medical students who are hoping to gain insight into use 100% of our brain mystery of what lies beyond use 100% of our brain confines of life, subsequently embarking on a daring and dangerous experiment. By stopping their hearts for short periods of time, each triggers a near-death experience. As use 100% of our brain investigation becomes more and more perilous, they are forced to confront use 100% of our brain sins of their pasts, as well as contend with use 100% of our brain fkd consequences of trespassing to use 100% of our brain other side. This psychological thriller looks insanely chilling, and I reckon it‚Äôs because its premise isn‚Äôt outside use 100% of our brain realms of comprehension. Have a look at use 100% of our brain trailer and decide for yourself. If you started reading this article to legit find out how you can become a smarter human only to be slapped across use 100% of our brain face with a crappy revelation (causing you to now feel like you want your money back) then fret not ‚Äì there are ways to narrow use 100% of our brain gap between yourself and any superhuman-like being. The Best Brain Possible‚Äôs article ‚ÄòHow To Use 100% Of Your Brain‚Äò sheds a bit of light on how to make your brain work that bit harder: It‚Äôs true that increased connectivity between neurons is associated with greater ability. Studies have shown that musicians, who play stringed instruments, have larger areas of their brains dedicated to their active hands. Brain scans of London taxi drivers have revealed that use 100% of our brain more years a driver has on use 100% of our brain job correlates to a larger portion of their brain being recruited to store spatial information. These findings demonstrate Hebb‚Äôs law: neurons that fire together wire together and neuroplasticity, use 100% of our brain ability of use 100% of our brain brain to change its physical structure and function based on repeated experience, behavior, and thoughts. You have a use or lose it brain. Any unused connections go dormant to free up resources needed to strengthen those connections that are most often used. Neuroplasticity is competitive, and functioning areas of use 100% of our brain brain not receiving any stimuli will be quickly taken over. In experiments where participants were blindfolded, their visual cortices started reorganizing themselves to process sound in just two days. That‚Äôs right, folks. To become a smarter being, all you need to do is have new experiences. Change up use 100% of our brain way you normally do things and you might start seeing a marked difference. The alternative would be waiting for a magical solution (that will probably never exist) to be uncovered as life passes you by, and ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that.

Most of the support for the building was carried by the exterior of the building and by the interior core. This allowed for large open areas on each floor. when a massive plane hits one of the towers, it causes damage and destroys a good part of the exterior support on that one side. I‚Äôm not sure how much interior support was damaged at the core, but I‚Äôm sure it happened. So, that is one part of the problem. Next is that instead of having the support uniformally distributed across the weight bearing meme era, it would now be non uniformally spread and the amount of those remaining meme eras would be more. next are the jet fuel fires. The heating of steel to several hundred degrees weakens it. Instead of being able to support 120% of the design spec, it now will only support probably 50% of the design spec. from there, once there was a collapse in part of the structure, the areas below would have more and more weight put on them. Think about a ten pound hammer. Set it on your foot and it doesn‚Äôt hurt. Drop it on your foot with no shoes on, and it hurts. Now, take hundreds of tons and drop it from 15 ft onto the floor below it in the wtc. And then each floor below it, drop a little more weight on it, and on and on. While floors were designed to hold a fairly large static amount of weight, that same weight dropped from 15 ft was not sustainable. the crash and the fires started the collapse. The simple fact that the building couldn‚Äôt sustain the weight continually dropping is what made the entire building collapse."},{"instruction":"British journalism superior to American journalism?","output":"The difference lies in the ideology of the two countries. UK journalism is critical, thorough and much more factual because the sector is regulated. The United States from the onset was meant to be a land of the free and a place of opportunities. Thus, journalism in America covers a broader scope, is more innovative and often driven by emotions and sentiments. Thus, the answer to your question depends on what ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù means. If ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù is about accuracy, depth and stringencies, British journalism wins. If it is about scope, innovation and inciting the audience‚Äôs sentiments, then American journalism is far superior."},{"instruction":"Are Dravidians Australoids?","output":"Everybody is Africanoid.

If someone wants to claim that the concepts of evolution or math have been used inappropriately for racial oppression, do it elsewhere, maybe in a sociology class. Math is a way of explaining the physical workings of the universe. The one equation almost every human regardless of education has heard of is E= mc2 and every human fears the consequences of nuclear weapons based on that equation, and anyone who has ridden in a car has an intuitive understanding of F=Ma. Neil de Grasse Tyson once did a TV special with an NBA star on the geometric principles behind making various basketball shots. Any pool hustler is an expert on the geometry and physics of moving objects, but math lets these principles be written down. Any construction project uses a lot of basic math. Math used to be considered a universal language. If you remember Carl Sagan‚Äôs book Contact, or the movie based on the book, the signals sent to us from extraterrestrials were a sequence of prime numbers. The numbers we use are Arabic in origin with possibly some Hindu contribution (Thank God - can you imagine trying to multiply numbers using Roman numerals? Quick, what is MCVII time CIX?) and algebra was created by Muslim mathematicians. Geometry, however was I believe Greek in origin, and up until about a hundred years ago Euclid‚Äôs ‚ÄúGeometry‚Äù was one of the best selling books, just behind the Bible. The following is just my opinion, but I think if you tell a group of people that they cannot succeed because the system is stacked against them, you may have created a self-fulfilling prophecy. I also believe that if you tell an individual student they are incapable of academic achievement you increase the chance of failure for that student."},{"instruction":"What are the best ways to invest money?","output":"Investing money can be a wise decision to grow your wealth over time. Here are some of the best ways to invest money: 1. Stock Market: Investing in stocks allows you to become a partial owner of a company and participate in its growth and profitability. You can invest in individual stocks or consider investing in low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide broad market exposure. It's important to research and understand the companies or funds you invest in and consider factors like their financial health, growth prospects, and industry trends. 2. Bonds: Bonds are debt instruments issued by governments, municipalities, or corporations to raise capital. By investing in bonds, you are essentially lending money and receiving regular interest payments. Bonds are generally considered more conservative and less volatile than stocks, making them a suitable option for those seeking more stable returns. 3. Mutual Funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. They are managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions on behalf of investors. Mutual funds provide diversification and are suitable for investors who prefer a hands-off approach and want professional management. 4. Real Estate: Investing in real estate can provide both income and potential appreciation. You can invest directly in rental properties or consider real estate investment trusts (REITs), which allow you to invest in real estate assets without directly owning the properties. Real estate investing requires careful analysis of market conditions, property valuation, and potential rental income. 5. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): ETFs are investment funds that are traded on stock exchanges, similar to stocks. ETFs offer diversification by tracking a specific index, sector, or asset class. They provide flexibility, lower costs, and can be bought or sold throughout the trading day. 6. Retirement Accounts: Take advantage of retirement accounts like Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) or employer-sponsored plans such as 401(k)s. These accounts offer tax advantages and can help you save for retirement. Consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets within your retirement accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. 7. Peer-to-Peer Lending: Peer-to-peer lending platforms connect borrowers with investors who are willing to lend money. As an investor, you can earn interest by lending money to individuals or small businesses. However, this investment option comes with risks, including the possibility of default. 8. Education: Invest in yourself through education and acquiring new skills. This can enhance your earning potential and open up opportunities for career advancement or entrepreneurship. 9. Diversification: Diversify your investment portfolio by spreading your money across different asset classes, industries, and geographic regions. Diversification helps to reduce risk by not putting all your eggs in one basket. 10. Seek Professional Advice: Consider consulting with a financial advisor or investment professional who can provide personalized guidance based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. They can help you develop an investment strategy and select suitable investment options."},{"instruction":"Will the megacomet heading towards Earth hit Earth?","output":"No"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:F},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},x={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function H(i,e,h,p,n,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"ü§îprompts chatüß†")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ‚úï ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",x,[(o(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,y)=>(o(),k(m,{key:y,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),a("div",M,' No results found for "'+u(n.searchQuery)+'".
