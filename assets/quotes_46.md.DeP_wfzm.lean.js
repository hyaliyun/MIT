As (x rightarrow 3), both the numerator (ln (x^2 - 5x + 7)) and the denominator (x - 3) approach zero. Hence, we have an indeterminate form of the type (frac{0}{0}). 3. First, we simplify the expression (x^2 - 5x + 7):    [    x^2 - 5x + 7 = 1 + (x^2 - 5x + 6)    ] 4. Notice that:    [    x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3)    ] 5.

A simple graph with 2 points (one edge) satisfies the conditions.      - **Inductive step**:       Suppose the statement holds for ( B leq z ).

Using induction, form a graph for ( b_1 - 1, b_2 - 1, ldots, b_{n-2} - 1 ) with ( h ) points. Add ( k - h ) isolated points, and finally, another point connected to all ( k ) points, completing the graph construction. 4. **Step 4: Associating points with doubles and matches**    Associate each point ( P_i ) of the graph with a set of doubles: ( A_i B_i, B_i C_i, ) and ( C_i A_i ).         - Two points connected by an edge imply the respective doubles play against each other.     - A point with ( m ) edges indicates each double at that point plays ( 3 ) games per edge, and each player belonging to any double at that point plays ( 6m ) matches in total.  Finally, verifying that each graph point meets the conditions: - For a given point with ( m ) edges, any player plays ( 6m ) matches, which meets the requirement ( a_i = 6b_i ).

Rewriting the given inequality in terms of a, b, and c, we can express K as:    [    K = frac{abc}{4R}    ] 6. Substituting K = pr:    [    pr = frac{abc}{4R}    ] 7. Rearranging for abc gives:    [    abc = 4Rpr    ] 8. Substitute (abc = 4Rpr) into the inequality we need to prove, p(1-2Rr) geq 1, we get:    [    p(1 - 2Rr) geq 1    ]     9. Using the relations between the sides a, b, and c and given the area relation, it forms:    [    a + b + c - abc leq 2    ] 10. We now proceed by expressing the left-hand side a + b + c - abc and simplifying it:     [     a + b + c - abc = a + b + c(1 - ab)     ]     [     leq a + b + 1 - ab = 1 + a + b(1 - a)     ]     [     leq 1 + a + 1 - a = 2     ] 11. Therefore, we have shown that:     [     a + b + c - abc leq 2     ] 12. Since a, b, c leq 1, thus 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 leq 2. This verifies the inequality. # Conclusion: [ boxed{p(1 - 2Rr) geq 1} ]"},{"instruction":"A block of wood has the shape of a right circular cylinder with radius r = 8 cm and height h = 10 cm, and it is fully painted red.

Prove that each of the strips can be translated parallel to itself so that all of them together cover the circle.","output":"To prove the given problem, we need to provide a detailed approach demonstrating that every strip can be translated parallel to cover a circle with a radius of 1. 1. **Assumption on Strip Width**:    Let’s assume that the total width of the strips is no less than (2.5 pi). 2. **Orientation of Strips**:    The strips are ordered according to the increasing angle of inclination relative to the positive semi-axis (O x). Any strips with the same inclination angle are combined into a single strip.    Thus, we can organize the strips so that:    [    d_1, d_2, ldots, d_m    ]    represent the respective widths of the strips, sorted by their angles(theta_n). 3. **Wide Enough Calculation**:    To determine a minimal number of strips required to cover the circle’s circumference of interest, consider:    [    sum_{i < 90^circ} text{width}(i) geq frac{5pi}{4}    ] 4. **Circular Sector Generation**:    Create an arc (A_1 N) with a length of (frac{5 pi}{4}), intercepting the first quadrant of a circle of radius (2.5) centered at the origin (O).    Let’s denote the width sum until the (m)-th strip as:    [    d_1 + d_2 + ldots + d_{m-1} < frac{5 pi}{4}, quad d_1 + d_2 + ldots + d_m geq frac{5 pi}{4}    ] 5. **Formation of Points**:    Distribute points along the arc (A_1 N) such that:    [    A_1, A_2, ldots, A_m    ]    Here, the arc's length between adjacent points (A_n A_{n+1} = d_n). 6. **Strip Placements**:    Translate each (n)-th strip so that its lower edge passes through (A_n). Let this edge intersect the (x)-axis at (B_n).    It is evident that the strip contains point (A_{n+1}), thus covering the curvilinear trapezium bounded by ((B_n, A_n, A_{n+1}, C_n)). 7. **Inductive Proof**:    Using inductive hypothesis, assume the first (n-1) strips cover a curvilinear triangle:    [    A_1 A_n C_{n-1}    ]    Adding the (n)-th strip, we get:    [    B_n A_n A_{n+1} C_n    ]    This results in covering another curvilinear triangle:    [    A_1 A_{n+1} C_n    ] 8. **Final Step (m)-th Strip**:    Finally, including the (m)-th strip, we cover the sector (O A_1 N).

Subsequently, the radius of the inscribed circle in this sector is calculated as:    [    2.5(sqrt{2} - 1) > 1    ] Thus, it has been proven that with the given cumulative width of strips, the circle of radius (1) is covered.

We need to show that we can arrange all the ambassadors around a round table such that no one is seated next to one of their enemies. 1. **Initial Assumption**:     - Assume we have arranged the (2n) ambassadors in such a manner that the number of neighboring pairs of enemies is minimized.    2. **Existence of Neighboring Enemies**:     - Suppose, contrary to what we want to prove, that there are still at least two neighboring ambassadors who are enemies. Let's denote them by (a) and (b).  3. **Possible Rearrangement**:     - Consider rotating (reversing) a segment of the table between positions. Specifically, we can reverse the segment from (a) to (b). For a segment (a, b, c, d), it would be reversed to (a, d, c, b). 4. **Effects of Reversing**:     - By reversing the segment, we attempt to reduce the number of enemy pairs.      - There are (2n - 3) possible segments that can be reversed which do not involve rotating the entire table (since that would not change the seating arrangement).     - For example, if (a) was the enemy of (b), we could move to another grouping such as (a, d, c, b). 5. **Analysis of Rearrangement Implications**:     - If any segment reversal does not improve the situation (reduce the number of enemy pairs), it would be due to one of two reasons:         a. (a) might still be an enemy with its new neighbor.         b. The new neighbor of (b) might be an enemy of (b). 6. **Count of Non-improving Reversals**:     - There are at most (2n - 4) segment reversals that do not reduce the number of enemy pairs since each original enemy placement causes a problem only for the immediate neighboring pairs. 7. **Contradiction**:     - Considering we assumed the number of enemy neighbors to be minimal, and some reversal should theoretically reduce it, a contradiction arises. This implies there would have been no possibility to keep enemy neighbors in the first place, affirming our assumption must be false. 8. **Conclusion**:     - Hence, it confirms that we can indeed arrange the (2n) ambassadors around a table with no two enemies seated next to each other.

For f(x) to be monotonically increasing on (1,2), its derivative f'(x) must be greater than or equal to 0 on this interval. Thus, we have: [ae^x - frac{1}{x} geq 0] 3.

Since e^x > 0 for all x and (xe^x)^2 > 0 for all x, the sign of g'(x) depends on the numerator -e^x(x+1). As x+1 > 0 for x in (1,2), g'(x) < 0, indicating that g(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval (1,2). 7. To find the minimum value of a, we evaluate g(x) at the lower bound of the interval, since g(x) is decreasing: [g(1) = frac{1}{1cdot e^1} = frac{1}{e} = e^{-1}] 8.

In this case, we want to find the probability that all three numbers are different when at least one die shows a 3. First, let's find the total number of outcomes when at least one die shows a 3. Since each die has 6 faces, there are 6times6times6=216 possible outcomes in total. However, we need to subtract the cases where no 3 appears. There are 5times5times5=125 outcomes when none of the dice show a 3. Therefore, there are 216-125=91 outcomes where at least one die shows a 3. Next, let's find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of outcomes where all three numbers are different and at least one die shows a 3.

As the parabola opens upwards (since the coefficient of x^2 is positive), the inequality is satisfied between the roots.   Therefore, the solution set for 2x^2 - x - 15 < 0 is the interval (boxed{(-frac{5}{2}, 3)}). (2) Given frac{2}{x} > -3,   we rewrite it to isolate the inequality: frac{2}{x} + 3 > 0.

Taking the derivative of f(t) with respect to t: f'(t) = 1 - frac{2}{t^2} We notice that on the interval (0, frac{1}{4}], the derivative f'(t) is negative because t^2 < 1 which implies -frac{2}{t^2} is more negative than 1. Hence, f(t) is decreasing on (0, frac{1}{4}] and its minimum value is obtained when t is at the upper bound of this interval. Therefore, the minimum value of f(t) occurs when t = frac{1}{4}: fleft(frac{1}{4}right) = frac{1}{4} + frac{2}{frac{1}{4}} = frac{1}{4} + 8 = frac{33}{4} However, we made an error when deducing the minimum value; it should be: fleft(frac{1}{4}right) = frac{1}{4} + frac{8}{1} = frac{1}{4} + 8 = frac{33}{4} The minimum value of z is not frac{33}{4} because we have an incorrect term in our function.

Consider n points in a plane, where n geq 5. We first divide these n points into two disjoint sets, M_1 and M_2, such that M_1 contains leftlceil frac{n+1}{2} rightrceil points and M_2 contains leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor points. 2. Draw all possible line segments connecting each point in M_1 to each point in M_2, and add one more line segment between any two points within M_1.

This results in triangles triangle ABC and triangle ADE, each sharing exactly one common vertex A. Thus, the induction base case n = 5 holds. 6. Assume for n-1 that the result holds. Now, consider n geq 6. There are n points, and the total number of connecting line segments is     [    leftlceil frac{n^2}{4} rightrceil + 2.    ]    Thus, one of these points, say A, must be connected to at least     [    leftlceil frac{2 leftlceil frac{n^2}{4} rightrceil + 4}{n} rightrceil.    ]        For even n = 2k geq 6:     [    leftlceil frac{2k^2 + 4}{2k} rightrceil = k = leftlceil frac{n}{2} rightrceil.    ]        For odd n = 2k + 1 geq 7:    [    leftlceil frac{2k (k+1) + 4}{2k+1} rightrceil = k+1 text{ (if } n = 7) text{ or } k text{ (if } n geq 9).    ] 7.

In a regular tetrahedron, any two edges will either share a common vertex or be opposite edges, and all face in the same plane since the tetrahedron has only one possible plane shape - its outer shell. 2. **Total Number of Edges in a Tetrahedron**: A tetrahedron has 6 edges. 3. **Choosing the Unordered Pairs of Edges**:    - Each edge can form a pair with 5 other edges because there are 6 edges in total.    - Thus, the number of ways to choose 2 edges out of 6 is given by the combination formula binom{6}{2} which calculates to:      [      binom{6}{2} = frac{6 times 5}{2 times 1} = 15      ] 4. **Conclusion**:    Since each selected pair of edges always belongs to the same plane, and each pair is distinct, the number of unordered pairs of edges that determine the same plane is the total number of ways to pair any two edges from the tetrahedron.

This is because the third quadrant is where both x and y are negative, and a positive slope would imply that as x becomes negative (moving into the second and third quadrants), y would also become negative, potentially passing through the third quadrant. A negative slope ensures that as x becomes negative, y remains positive or becomes less negative, avoiding the third quadrant. 2. **Identifying Suitable Values of k**: Given the options for k are -2, -1, 1, and -3, we identify which of these satisfy the condition k < 0. The values that meet this condition are -2, -1, and -3. 3. **Calculating the Probability**: The probability that the graph of the function does not pass through the third quadrant is the ratio of the number of suitable k values to the total number of k options provided.

If the article is sold at a profit of 140%, the selling price (SP) would be: SP = CP + Profit SP = 100 + 140% of 100 SP = 100 + 140 SP = 240 Now, if the article is sold at 1/3 of that selling price, the new selling price (SP_new) would be: SP_new = 1/3 * SP SP_new = 1/3 * 240 SP_new = 80 Since the cost price was 100 and the new selling price is 80, there is a loss.

In this group, we assume the relationship of \\"knowing someone\\" is mutual. This means if individual A knows individual B, then B also knows A. 2.

Suppose there are n familiar pairs in the group. 4. When counting the number of people that each individual knows, each familiar pair is counted exactly twice (once for each member of the pair).

The total number of people known by all individuals combined is this even number (2n). 6. If we denote ( d_i ) to be the number of people that individual (i) knows, then the sum over all individuals of these numbers ( d_i ) is the even number (2n): [ sum_{i=1}^{m} d_i = 2n ]    where ( m ) is the total number of individuals in the group. 7. The claim is that the number of individuals who know an odd number of other individuals must be even. Suppose ( k ) is the number of individuals who know an odd number of others. 8. To support this claim, observe that the sum (sum_{i=1}^{m} d_i ) is even. This can only happen if the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even. Thus, the number of individuals with an odd ( d_i ) must itself be even because the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd, which would contradict the known fact that ( sum_{i=1}^{m} d_i = 2n ) is even. 9.

First, let's find the center (h, k) of the given circle by rewriting the equation in the form (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2. By completing the square, we get: (x^2+2x+1) + (y^2-4y+4) = r^2 - 1 - 4 + 1, (x+1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = r^2 - 4. The center of the circle is thus (h, k) = (-1, 2).  Now, since the line passes through the center, substituting x = -1 and y = 2 into the equation of the line gives us: 2a(-1) - b(2) + 2 = 0, -2a - 2b + 2 = 0, -2a - 2b = -2, a + b = 1. Since a, b in mathbb{R}^+, this relation must hold true. Now, we can find the minimum value of the desired expression using the above relation.

By the AM-GM inequality, frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{a} geq 2sqrt{frac{a}{b} cdot frac{b}{a}} = 2sqrt{1} = 2. Thus, frac{1}{a} + frac{2}{b} geq 1 + 2 + 2 = 3 + 2sqrt{2}.  Equality holds when frac{a}{b} = frac{b}{a}, or equivalently, when a^2 = b^2, which implies a = b. Substituting back into the equation a + b = 1, we find a = b = frac{1}{2}.

What is the measure of angle B?","output":"Given a triangle ABC with side lengths a = 4 and b = 5, and the equation cos(B + C) + frac{3}{5} = 0, we need to find the measure of angle B. First, we should note that in any triangle ABC, the sum of the angles is 180^circ, which means A + B + C = 180^circ. We also know that cos(B + C) = cos(180^circ - A), because B + C = 180^circ - A. The given equation cos(B + C) + frac{3}{5} = 0 can then be rewritten as cos(180^circ - A) = -frac{3}{5}. Since cos(180^circ - A) = -cos(A), we have -cos(A) = -frac{3}{5}, which simplifies to cos(A) = frac{3}{5}. Using the Law of Cosines for triangle ABC, we get [ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos(C) ] However, we do not know the value of c or cos(C), and they are not necessary for finding angle B. Instead, focusing on A will be more helpful. Considering cos(A) = frac{3}{5} and knowing that in a triangle no angle can exceed 180^circ, the possible values for A are such that 0^circ < A < 180^circ. Since cosine is positive in the first quadrant and negative in the second, and we have a positive cosine value frac{3}{5}, angle A must be in the first quadrant. Therefore, 0^circ < A < 90^circ. The actual value of A is obtained from cos^{-1}(frac{3}{5}). Once we have the measure of angle A, we can find the measure of angle B by subtracting A from 180^circ (B = 180^circ - A - C). We do not need to find the specific value of angle C because the equation cos(B + C) = -frac{3}{5} contains both B and C and it only provides us with the relationship between the two angles. Thus, to find the measure of angle B, we simply use the fact that B = 180^circ - A, because A + B + C = 180^circ and B + C = 180^circ - A. [ B = 180^circ - cos^{-1}(frac{3}{5}) ] Finally, calculating the inverse cosine of frac{3}{5} and subtracting from 180^circ will give us the measure of angle B, which is what we're looking for. Remember that the angle measure we calculate must be in range for B as a valid angle in a triangle, which it will be since A was found to be acute. Thus, the measure of angle B is boxed{180^circ - cos^{-1}(frac{3}{5})}."},{"instruction":"Arjun and Beth play a game where they can remove one or two adjacent bricks from one tower among several towers of bricks in a horizontal line.

The answer is therefore: [ boxed{text{The sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of }frac{1}{2}}. ] (2) Now, for t > 0, let's analyze the size of a_{n+1} compared to a_{n}. We rewrite a_{n+1} as: a_{n+1} = frac {2(t^{n+1}-1)(a_{n} + 1)}{a_{n} + 2t^{n} - 1}. Dividing both sides of the equation by (t^{n+1}-1), we have: frac {a_{n+1} + 1}{t^{n+1} - 1} = frac{2(a_{n} + 1)}{a_{n} + 2t^{n} - 1} = frac{2 cdot frac {a_{n} + 1}{t^{n} - 1}}{frac {a_{n} + 1}{t^{n} - 1} + 2}. Setting b_n = frac{a_{n} + 1}{t^{n} - 1} yields: b_{n+1} = frac{2b_n}{b_n + 2}.

Therefore, the difference between terms can be written as: a_{n+1} - a_n = frac{2(t^{n+1} - 1)}{n+1} - frac{2(t^{n} - 1)}{n} = frac{2(t-1)}{n(n+1)} [n(1+t+ldots+t^n) - (n+1)(1+t+ldots+t^{n-1})]. Further rearranging terms, we get: a_{n+1} - a_n = frac{2(t-1)^2}{n(n+1)} [(1+t+ldots+t^{n-1}) + t(1+t+ldots+t^{n-2}) + ldots + t^{n-1}]. Since t > 0 and t neq 1, we have a_{n+1} - a_n > 0.

(3) To determine the existence of a positive integer t such that f(a_{n+1}) < f(a_n) holds for all n, we first compute the difference between the function values for consecutive terms: f(a_{n+1}) - f(a_n) = frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n+1}^2+4} - frac{a_{n}}{a_{n}^2+4} = frac{(a_{n+1} -a_{n})(a_{n+1}a_{n}-4)}{(a_{n+1}^2+4)(a_{n}^2+4)} < 0, since a_{n+1} > a_n. Therefore, we need a_{n+1}a_{n} - 4 > 0 and from the fact that the sequence {a_n} is increasing, we examine the condition between a_1 and a_2: a_1a_2 - 4 > 0. Substitute a_1 = 2t - 3 and a_2 using our previous finding to get the inequality: left((2t - 3)(t^2 - 2) - 4right) > 0. Define a function f(t) = (2t - 3)(t^2 - 2) - 4. Its derivative is f'(t) = 6t^2 - 6t - 8. Since f'(t) > 0 for t > 2, the function f is increasing for t > 2. As f(2) = -2 < 0 and f(3) = 17 > 0, we find that the smallest positive integer t satisfying the given condition exists, and the smallest such value is 3.

The correct interpretation should be that a can be any value except those that would result in B having elements that are in A, specifically a neq -1 and a neq 1 for this case to hold.    - When B={-1}, substituting x=-1 into ax=1 gives a(-1)=1, which simplifies to a=-1.    - When B={1}, substituting x=1 into ax=1 gives a(1)=1, which simplifies to a=1. 5. **Conclusion**: The set of possible values for a is derived from the conditions where B is either {-1} or {1}.

Thus, to minimize w, we set m to its maximum allowable value, which is 200.

Substituting z into the second equation (xy + |z| = 119), considering x = y, yields unrealistic solutions for x^2 + |23 - 2x| = 119. Thus, assume x > y. 2. **Case Analysis Based on the Sign of z**:    - **Case 1: z geq 0**:      - Equations convert to xy - |x+y| = 96. Assume x+y geq 0 (since x geq y and x, y geq 0), thus |x + y| = x + y and xy - (x+y) = 96. Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT) gives (x-1)(y-1) = 97. The factors of 97 are (97,1), leading to (x, y) = (98, 2) and (2, 98).      - Checking: z = 23 - |98+2| = 23 - 100 = -77, but z geq 0 was assumed, invalidating this solution under current assumptions.    - **Case 2: z < 0**:      - Convert the equation to xy + |x+y| = 142. Assume x+y geq 0, so xy + x + y = 142. Factoring, (x+1)(y+1) = 143. The factors of 143 are (143,1), (11,13), giving (x, y) = (142,0), (10,12) and (12,10). These are symmetric variations similar to the original, yielding no contradiction on reintroducing z = 23 - |x+y|.      - Corresponding z values are -119 for (142,0), and 1 for (10,12) and (12,10).     3. **Conclusion**:    - Valid (x, y, z) combinations are (10,12,1) and (12,10,1), and by symmetry (10,12,-1) and (12,10,-1).

First, let's recall a crucial property of a tree in graph theory: **Definition**: A **tree** is a connected graph with no cycles. Importantly, there exists exactly one path between any two vertices in a tree. We need to show that this property implies that the structure formed by the schools and their connections is harmonious. 1. **Tree Property**:     - In a tree, any two vertices are connected by a unique path. This unique path is also the shortest path between the two vertices.  2. **Choose Three Distinct Vertices**:     - Select three distinct vertices, denoted as ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ). 3. **Define Paths**:     - Let the vertices on the unique path from ( y ) to ( x ) be given by ( y = x_0, x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n = x ).     - Let the vertices on the unique path from ( y ) to ( z ) be given by ( y = z_0, z_1, z_2, ldots, z_m = z ). 4. **Identify the Common Subpath**:     - Choose the maximum integer ( k ) such that ( x_k = z_k ). This ( x_k ) indicates the longest initial segment of the path that is common to both routes ( y rightarrow x ) and ( y rightarrow z ). 5. **Uniqueness of Paths Beyond ( k )**:     - For all ( i > k ) and ( j > k ), it must hold that ( x_i neq z_j ). If ( x_i = z_j ) for some ( i neq j ), it would contradict the definition of ( k ). If ( x_i = z_j ) for some ( i = j ), it would imply a cycle, contradicting the tree property. 6. **Construct the Path between ( x ) and ( z )**:     - The path from ( x ) to ( z ) can be formed by the sequence:       [       x_{n}, x_{n-1}, ldots, x_{k} = z_{k}, z_{k+1}, ldots, z_{m}       ]     - Here, ( x_k = z_k ) serves as the common vertex on the paths from ( y ) to both ( x ) and ( z ). 7. **Intersection of Paths**:     - The paths between any three selected vertices intersect exactly at one vertex ( x_k = z_k ). This implies that the structure is tree-like and no cycles exist in it. If it had cycles, multiple routes between vertices would appear, violating the initial condition of exactly one path. Therefore, based on the properties of a tree and the construction of paths, it's established that the country structured this way must be harmonious.

This can either be 1 defective and 2 genuine products or 2 defective and 1 genuine product. Now, we consider the relationships between these events: 1. **Mutually Exclusive Events**:    - **Events A and C**: Since A involves no defective products and C involves at least one defective product, they cannot happen simultaneously. Hence, they are mutually exclusive.    - **Events B and C**: Since B involves all products being defective and C involves not all products being defective, they cannot happen at the same time.

Each weight differs from its adjacent weight by exactly 1 gram. We are asked to prove that these weights can be divided into two groups with equal total weights. 2. **Total Even Weight Condition:**    The total weight of all 2009 weights is given to be an even number. Noted is that since each giryoka is altered by a difference of 1 gram, their positions on odd and even indices must be considered. 3. **Grouping Odd and Even Positioned Weights:**    Observe the weights at odd and even positions. Let weights on odd positions be a_1, a_3, a_5, dots, a_{2009}. Let weights on even positions be a_2, a_4, a_6, dots, a_{2008}. Suppose the first weight a_1 = 2a where a is some integer. 4. **Parity Observation:**    Since each weight differs by 1 gram from its neighbor, weights on odd positions will have one parity (e.g., all even or all odd), and weights on even positions will have the opposite parity. 5. **Distributing Weights into Two Groups:**    Every pair of adjacent weights will have one even and one odd weight due to the difference being 1 gram. Consider pairs (a_1, a_2), (a_3, a_4), dots, (a_{2007}, a_{2008}). Thus, in total, we have 1004 of such pairs. 6. **Detailed Weight Distribution:**    Let's focus on distribution:    - Pair one of the weights (a_i, a_{i+1}) on the left-weight side and the other on the right-weight side.    - Do this iteratively such that the excess weight is distributed.    Let's compute the balance through the alternating arrangement:    - Place a_1 on one side (say left), and choose 502 pairs to place their odd weights on the left and even weights on the right, and the remaining 502 pairs with even weights on the left and odd weights on the right. 7. **Summing the Weights:**    - Sum all weights on each side and ensure they balance out.    Formally, the net difference of shifting weights across can be calculated as this:    [    sum_{text{odd-weight pairs}} - sum_{text{even-weight pairs}} = 2a + 502 - a - (502 + a) = 0.    ]    Thus each grouping sums to the same total weight of the system of weights. # Conclusion: Having placed an appropriate number of pairs on each side of the scale, the distribution allows achieving equal total weights on both sides, thereby proving it is possible to divide the weights into two groups with equal total weights. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The third and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 18 and 24, respectively.

From the problem, we know that the mutual correlation function can be expressed as:    [    R_{x dot{x}}(t_1, t_2) = k_x(tau)    ]    where ( tau = t_2 - t_1 ), and ( k_x(tau) ) is a function of ( tau ). 2. According to the problem, we need to show that the correlation function changes sign when the order of the arguments ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ) is switched. This will involve finding ( R_{x dot{x}}(t_2, t_1) ). 3. If we switch the arguments ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ), the mutual correlation function becomes ( R_{x dot{x}}(t_2, t_1) ). Recall that ( dot{X}(t) ) denotes the derivative of ( X(t) ). When the order of the arguments is switched, the position of ( dot{X} ) in the correlation function changes accordingly. 4. Consider the variable ( tau ) again. Now, due to the argument switch:    [    tau = t_1 - t_2    ] 5. Therefore, the differentiation of ( k_x(tau) ) with respect to ( t_1 ) (holding ( t_2 ) constant) yields:     [    frac{partial tau}{partial t_1} = -1    ] 6. Hence, the correlation function with switched arguments becomes:    [    R_{x dot{x}}(t_2, t_1) = frac{partial k_x(tau)}{partial t_1} = frac{dk_x(tau)}{dtau} cdot frac{partial tau}{partial t_1} = frac{dk_x(tau)}{dtau} cdot (-1) = -k_x'(tau)    ] 7. By comparing the expressions ( R_{x dot{x}}(t_1, t_2) ) and ( R_{x dot{x}}(t_2, t_1) ), we conclude that:    [    R_{x dot{x}}(t_1, t_2) = -R_{x dot{x}}(t_2, t_1)    ] Thus, the mutual correlation function ( R_{x dot{x}}(t_1, t_2) ) indeed changes sign when the arguments ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ) are swapped.

Therefore, we can write the equation as: X + 1000 + (0.30 * 5714.29) = 5714.29 Now, let's calculate the cash he had with him: Cash with him = 0.30 * 5714.29 = 1714.287 Now, we can substitute this value into the equation: X + 1000 + 1714.287 = 5714.29 Now, let's solve for X: X = 5714.29 - 1000 - 1714.287 X = 5714.29 - 2714.287 X = 3000.003 Since we're dealing with currency, we can round this to the nearest cent: X ≈ 3000.00 So, Kanul spent approximately boxed{3000.00}  on raw materials."},{"instruction":"To prepare a cake batter, Maria mixes 100 mL of water for every 400 mL of flour.

Since we know that the costs of the two halls will be the same when 60 guests attend, we can set up the following equation: Cost at Caesar's = Cost at Venus Hall For Caesar's, the cost is the rental fee ( C ) plus 30 dollars for each meal for 60 guests, so the total cost is ( C + 30 times 60 ). For Venus Hall, the cost is the rental fee of 500 dollars plus 35 dollars for each meal for 60 guests, so the total cost is ( 500 + 35 times 60 ).

Thus, the equation can be expressed as: [ B(C + 1) text{ is a square number.} ] We will consider two cases based on whether ( B ) is a square number or not.  Case 1: ( B ) is a square number If ( B ) is a square number, then ( C = frac{A}{B} ) will also be a square number, since the quotient of two square numbers is also a square number. Let: [ B = b^2 quad text{and} quad C = c^2 ] Thus: [ A = B cdot C = b^2 c^2 ] And: [ A + B = b^2 (c^2 + 1) ] Since ( A + B ) is considered a square number, ( c^2 + 1 ) must also be a square number. However, the difference between two consecutive square numbers is always an odd number greater than 1, implying: [ left( k + 1 right)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1 quad text{for some integer } k ] For ( k = c ), we have: [ C + 1 = c^2 + 1 = k^2 ] Hence ( c^2 + 1 ) cannot itself be a square number. Therefore, this assumption leads to a contradiction.  Case 2: ( B ) is not a square number If ( B ) is not a square number, there exists at least one prime ( p ) that appears to an odd power in the prime factorization of ( B ). Since both ( A ) and ( A + B ) must be divisible by ( p ), and as square numbers, ( A ) and ( A + B ) must represent even powers of ( p ): [ A = p^{2m} quad text{and} quad A + B = p^{2n} ] Here, ( m ) and ( n ) are integers ensuring ( B = A / C ) continues to include ( p ) in its prime factors. However, as ( C cdot B ) and ( C cdot (C + 1) ) must retain this ( p ) presence which must remain distributed unevenly across ( B ) and ( C ). Consequently: [ (C + 1) quad text{having an odd prime factor contradicts} ] Therefore, the assumptions imply a contradiction as ( C(C + 1) ) being a square when multiplied yields the non-posited situation exceeds theorizing without these contradictions.

Speed in m/s = (Speed in km/hr × 1000) / 3600 Speed in m/s = (27 km/hr × 1000) / 3600 Speed in m/s = 27000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 7.5 m/s Now, we can calculate the length of the train using the time it takes to cross the post: Length of the train = Speed × Time Length of the train = 7.5 m/s × 20 seconds Length of the train = 150 meters Therefore, the length of the train is boxed{150}  meters."},{"instruction":"an acoustics class, there are 120 male students and 100 female students.

However, since y = log_{2}u is an increasing function (logarithmic functions increase as their argument increases), the composite function f(x) = log_{2}|x-1| behaves differently on different intervals. Specifically, on the interval (-infty, 1), f(x) is decreasing because u is decreasing. Thus, option A is incorrect because f(x) does not consistently increase across its entire domain. **Option B: Is fleft(4right)+fleft(7right) < fleft(11right)?** We compute each part separately: begin{align*} f(4) + f(7) &= log_{2}|4-1| + log_{2}|7-1|  &= log_{2}3 + log_{2}6  &= log_{2}(3 times 6)  &= log_{2}18. end{align*} For fleft(11right), we have: begin{align*} f(11) &= log_{2}|11-1|  &= log_{2}10. end{align*} Since log_{2}18 > log_{2}10, it's clear that fleft(4right)+fleft(7right) > fleft(11right). Therefore, option B is incorrect. **Option C: Is fleft(xright) symmetric about x=1?** The function f(x) = log_{2}|x-1| is derived from shifting the graph of f(x) = log_{2}|x| one unit to the right. This shift does not alter the symmetry of the function but instead moves the axis of symmetry from x=0 to x=1. Therefore, f(x) is symmetric about x=1, making option C correct. **Option D: Does fleft(xright) have 1 zero?** To find the zeros of f(x), we solve log_{2}|x-1| = 0: begin{align*} log_{2}|x-1| &= 0  |x-1| &= 2^0  |x-1| &= 1. end{align*} This gives us two solutions: x-1 = 1 or x-1 = -1, leading to x = 2 or x = 0.

Since both (alpha) and (beta) contain the second circle, their intersection must be a circle, specifically the second circle. 3. **Tangent Analysis:**    Realize that the common point of tangency between the first and the second circles, as well as between the second and the third circles, must lie on the line of intersection of (alpha) and (beta), which we've established is the second circle. 4. **Contradiction via Common Point Analysis:**    Next, note that the common tangent point between the sphere (alpha) and the third circle must also lie on the line of intersection of (alpha) and (beta). If this were the case, all three circles should intersect at a single common point, which contradicts the problem statement that the tangency points are distinct. 5. **Conclusion via Contradiction:**    The contradiction arises from the assumption that (alpha) and (beta) are different.

This means the sum of the roots (x_1 + x_2) and the product of the roots (x_1 cdot x_2) can be directly related to the coefficients of the equation according to Vieta's formulas:  - Sum of roots (x_1 + x_2) = 5a - Product of roots (x_1 cdot x_2) = b Plugging the roots x=1 and x=4 into Vieta's formulas, we have: [ begin{align*} 1 + 4 &= 5a  4 cdot 1 &= b end{align*} ] Solving these equations, we find: [ begin{align*} 5 &= 5a & implies a &= 1  4 &= b & implies b &= 4 end{align*} ] Thus, the values of the real numbers a and b are boxed{a=1} and boxed{b=4}, respectively. # Part (II) - Finding the Minimum Value of t Given t = frac{a}{x} + frac{b}{y}, and from part (I), a = 1 and b = 4, we substitute these values into the expression for t to get: [t = frac{1}{x} + frac{4}{y}] Given that x > 0, y > 0, and x + y = 2, we can express t as: [t = frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{x} + frac{4}{y} right) (x + y) = frac{1}{2} left( 5 + frac{4x}{y} + frac{y}{x} right)] Using the AM-GM inequality for the terms frac{4x}{y} and frac{y}{x}, we have: [frac{1}{2} left( 5 + frac{4x}{y} + frac{y}{x} right) geq frac{1}{2} left( 5 + 2sqrt{left(frac{4x}{y}right) left(frac{y}{x}right)} right) = frac{9}{2}] The equality holds when frac{4x}{y} = frac{y}{x}, leading us to find x = frac{2}{3} and y = frac{4}{3}.

If the ages of the captain and the wicketkeeper are excluded, the average age of the remaining players is 3 years less than the average age of the whole team. What is the average age of the team?","output":"Let's denote the average age of the team as A, which is given as 30 years. The captain is 5 years older than the average age, so the captain's age is A + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 years. The total age of the team can be calculated by multiplying the average age by the number of members, which is 20. So the total age of the team is 20 * A = 20 * 30 = 600 years. When the captain and the wicketkeeper are excluded, there are 18 members left. The average age of these remaining players is A - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 years. The total age of these 18 players is 18 * (A - 3) = 18 * 27. Now, the total age of the team (600 years) is equal to the total age of the 18 players plus the ages of the captain and the wicketkeeper. Let's denote the age of the wicketkeeper as W. So we have: 600 = 18 * 27 + 35 + W 600 = 486 + 35 + W 600 = 521 + W W = 600 - 521 W = 79 The wicketkeeper is 79 years old. Now, let's check if the average age of the team is still 30 when we include the captain and the wicketkeeper. The total age of the team including the captain and the wicketkeeper is: Total age = 18 * 27 + 35 + 79 Total age = 486 + 35 + 79 Total age = 600 The number of members in the team is 20, so the average age of the team is: Average age = Total age / Number of members Average age = 600 / 20 Average age = 30 The average age of the team remains boxed{30}  years old, which is consistent with the given information."},{"instruction":"The derivative of the function f(x), denoted as f′(x), is always greater than 0 on mathbb{R}.

Then the total area of the triangular faces is ( 6 times frac{S}{3} = 2S ). The given total surface area is ( 3S = 720 ), so ( S = 240 ) square units. - **Properties of a regular hexagon**: The area ( S ) of a regular hexagon can be calculated as ( frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}a^2 ), where ( a ) is the length of a side.

For a cube with side length ( a ), the space diagonal ( d ) is given by:     [     d = a sqrt{3}     ]          Substituting ( a = 2 ), the space diagonal is:     [     d = 2 sqrt{3}     ] 2. **Find the radius of the sphere**:     Since the cube is inscribed in the sphere, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the cube.

The distance to the far face of the smaller cube from the center equals ( 1 + x ).     The distance from the center of the far face of the smaller cube to one of its vertices (which lies on the sphere) is half of the face diagonal of the smaller cube.

The sum of these three remainders is (0 + 1 + 2 = 3 equiv 0 mod 3). 5. **Conclusion:**    - In either case, we can always find three integers among the five whose sum is divisible by 3.

The total cost is Rs. 1872. What is the width of the room?","output":"First, let's convert the width of the carpet from centimeters to meters to match the unit of the room's length. Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, the width of the carpet in meters is: 75 cm = 75 / 100 m = 0.75 m Now, let's denote the width of the room as W meters. The area of the carpet needed to cover the room is the product of the room's length and width: Area = Length × Width = 13 m × W m The cost of carpeting per square meter is Rs. 12, so the total cost for carpeting the room is the area multiplied by the cost per square meter: Total Cost = Area × Cost per square meter Rs. 1872 = (13 m × W m) × Rs. 12/m² Now, let's solve for W: Rs. 1872 = 13W × Rs. 12 Rs. 1872 = Rs. 156W Divide both sides by Rs. 156 to find W: W = Rs. 1872 / Rs. 156 W = 12 m So, the width of the room is boxed{12}  meters."},{"instruction":"What is the value of the expression frac{1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 7 cdot 8 cdot 9}{1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10}? textbf{(A) }6480qquadtextbf{(B) }6608qquadtextbf{(C) }6720qquadtextbf{(D) }6840qquadtextbf{(E) }6960","output":"1. **Calculate the numerator**: The numerator of the given expression is the product of the first 9 positive integers:    [    1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 7 cdot 8 cdot 9 = 9!    ]    Using the factorial of 9, we find:    [    9! = 362880    ] 2. **Calculate the denominator**: The denominator is the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

Suppose each fruit type has exactly 7 boxes:      Let the number of boxes for apples be ( A = 7 ),      Let the number of boxes for pears be ( P = 7 ),      Let the number of boxes for plums be ( S = 7 ). 3. Under this assumption, the total number of boxes accounted for by 7 boxes each type is given by:    [    A + P + S = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21    ] 4. Since the total number of boxes is 22, there is 1 additional box beyond the 21 boxes already considered. This extra box must belong to one of the three types of fruits. Hence, it could be an additional box for apples, pears, or plums. 5. Therefore, we add this 1 additional box to the number of boxes of one type of fruit. This gives three possible scenarios:    - If the 22nd box is an apple box: ( A = 8 )    - If the 22nd box is a pear box: ( P = 8 )    - If the 22nd box is a plum box: ( S = 8 )    In each scenario, at least one type of fruit has 8 boxes. 6. Thus, irrespective of which fruit the additional box is for, there will always be at least 8 boxes with the same type of fruit.

Therefore, the number of messages Lucia sent on the second day is: [ text{Lucia's messages on the second day} = frac{1}{3} times 120 = 40 ] Alina doubled the messages she sent on the first day, so the number of messages she sent on the second day is: [ text{Alina's messages on the second day} = 100 times 2 = 200 ] The total number of messages sent on the second day by both Alina and Lucia is: [ text{Total for the second day} = 40 + 200 = 240 ] Since they sent the same number of messages on the third day as the first day, the total number of messages sent over the three days is the sum of the total messages sent on the first day, the second day, and again the total for the first day (since the third day is the same as the first): [ text{Total for three days} = 220 + 240 + 220 = 680 ] Therefore, the total number of messages they sent in those three days is boxed{680}."},{"instruction":"a football tournament, there were 15 teams, each playing against every other team exactly once.

Generally, H is distinct except for this situation.     **Step 4:** Use the perpendicular bisector properties:     - If OCHM is a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles should be supplementary.          **Step 5:** Angle analysis for cyclic nature:     - angle OCH can be analyzed through the properties of orthocenters and circumcenter relationships.     **Step 6:** Formulate the recognition of angles:     - Suppose, O and H being orthogonal implies checking angle OMH = 90^circ or equivalent evaluations.     **Step 7:** Derive the orthogonality condition:     - Given the configurations and properties inherited,       - overline{OM} relates with overline{OH} by perpendicularity from circle properties intersecting orthogonal lines at specific chordal relations. 6. **Conclusion:** From the properties outlined and leveraging known geometric relations, the condition,    [    OM perp OH    ]    holds true under the interior circle arc midpoint theorems and cyclic quadrilateral relevance. \`\`\` boxed{O M perp O H} \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"f the internal angles A, B, and C of triangle ABC satisfy 6sin A = 4sin B = 3sin C, then find the value of cos B.","output":"First, we notice that for the internal angles of a triangle, the following relationship holds:  A + B + C = pi quad text{(180 degrees, in radians)}  Given the proportional relationship between the sines of the angles:  6sin A = 4sin B = 3sin C  Let's set this common value to k where k>0, since the sine of an angle in a triangle is always positive.  sin A = frac{k}{6}, quad sin B = frac{k}{4}, quad sin C = frac{k}{3} We can now express sin A, sin B, and sin C in terms of the common value k. Knowing that the sine of an angle is less than or equal to 1, we check the highest sine, which is sin C =frac{k}{3}, and infer that:  1 geq sin C = frac{k}{3} implies k leq 3  Now, let's apply the law of sines in the following way:  frac{sin A}{sin B} + frac{sin B}{sin C} + frac{sin C}{sin A} = frac{sin^2B + sin^2C + sin^2A}{sin A sin B sin C} = frac{frac{k^2}{6^2} + frac{k^2}{4^2} + frac{k^2}{3^2}}{frac{k}{6} cdot frac{k}{4} cdot frac{k}{3}} = frac{36+9+4}{6} = frac{49}{6}  Using the sine rule on the triangle gives us:  frac{A}{sin A} = frac{B}{sin B} = frac{C}{sin C}  For sin B,  sin B = frac{k}{4}  We also know that sin^2 B + cos^2 B = 1. So,  sin^2 B = left(frac{k}{4}right)^2   cos^2 B = 1 - left(frac{k}{4}right)^2  We will consider the case where B is an acute angle (as B could also be obtuse, but we do not consider it here, following the convention of a typical problem where the largest angle is selected as C). So, cos B will be positive and we get:  cos B = sqrt{1 - left(frac{k}{4}right)^2} To find the value of k, we need to use the sum of angles in a triangle, A + B + C = pi. To do that, we can either express A and C through B using the sine relation or use the fact that the sine of an angle in a triangle cannot exceed 1 and, therefore, neither can k. Since the highest value from the sine ratio is assigned to C (sin C = frac{k}{3}), it follows that k must be less than or equal to 3. Now we have:  cos B = sqrt{1 - left(frac{3}{4}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{9}{16}} = sqrt{frac{16}{16} - frac{9}{16}} = sqrt{frac{7}{16}} = frac{sqrt{7}}{4} Therefore, we have  boxed{cos B = frac{sqrt{7}}{4}}"},{"instruction":"Given two circles with radii of 4 and 7 respectively, and the distance between their centers is 3, the positional relationship between these two circles is (    ) A: Contained within each other B: Tangent internally C: Intersecting D: Tangent externally","output":"**Analysis**: This question directly provides the radii of the two circles and the distance between their centers.

Speed in kmph can be converted to m/s by multiplying by (1000 m / 1 km) and dividing by (3600 s / 1 hour): Speed of current in m/s = 2.5 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) Speed of current in m/s = 2500 m / 3600 s Speed of current in m/s = 0.694444 m/s (approximately) Now, let's calculate the speed of the man rowing downstream.

Show that there are infinitely many positive integers  n  such that  gcd (x_n, n+c)=1 . *Proposed by Milan Haiman and Carl Schildkraut*","output":"1. **Define the problem and the sequence:**    Let ( P(x) ) be a polynomial with integer coefficients such that ( P(0) = 1 ). Define the sequence ( {x_n} ) recursively by ( x_0 = 0 ) and ( x_{i+1} = P(x_i) ) for all integers ( i geq 0 ). We need to show that there are infinitely many positive integers ( n ) such that ( gcd(x_n, n+c) = 1 ) for a given integer ( c > 1 ). 2. **Introduce the property ( mathcal{P}(P, c) ):**    We say that ( mathcal{P}(P, c) ) holds if there are infinitely many integers ( n geq c ) such that ( gcd(x_{n-c}, n) = 1 ). 3. **Simplify the problem:**    We need to show that ( mathcal{P}(P, c) ) holds for ( P(0) = 1 ) and ( c geq 1 ). 4. **Consider the case when ( n ) is a prime number:**    If ( n = p ) is a prime number, then ( gcd(x_{p-c}, p) = 1 ) if and only if ( p nmid x_{p-c} ). We need to find primes ( p ) such that ( p nmid P(m) ) for all ( m in mathbb{Z} ). 5. **Use advanced theory for irreducible polynomials:**    For irreducible polynomials ( P ), there are infinitely many primes ( p ) such that ( p nmid P(m) ) for all ( m in mathbb{Z} ). This uses Galois theory and the Chebotarev density theorem. 6. **Consider polynomials with roots modulo all primes:**    Some polynomials have roots modulo all primes or all but finitely many primes. For example, linear polynomials or polynomials like ( (x^2 + 1)(2x^2 + 1)(-2x^2 + 1) ). 7. **Use two values of ( n ) associated with ( p ):**    To handle cases where ( p mid x_n ) for some ( n ), we consider two values of ( n ) associated with ( p ). This helps in deducing strong restrictions on ( p ). 8. **Lemma 1:**    - There is a unique number ( m = m(P, p) geq 0 ) such that ( p mid x_n ) if and only if ( m mid n ).    - If ( p mid x_m ) and ( p mid x_n ), then ( p mid x_l ) whenever ( l ) is a multiple of ( gcd(m, n) ). 9. **Lemma 2:**    - If ( x_n neq 0 ) and ( p^2 mid x_n ), then ( v_p(x_{pn}) leq v_p(x_n) + 1 ). 10. **Theorem 3:**     - ( mathcal{P}(P, c) ) holds except in the following cases:       1. ( x_1 = 0 ).       2. ( x_1 ) is even, ( x_2 = 0 ), and ( c ) is odd.       3. ( P(x) = x + a ) with ( a in mathbb{Z} ) and ( c = 0 ). 11. **Proof of Theorem 3:**     - If ( x_n = 0 ) for some ( n > 0 ), the sequence ( {x_n} ) is periodic with some minimal period ( m > 0 ). In cases (1) and (2), ( mathcal{P}(P, c) ) does not hold.     - If ( m = 2 ) and ( x_1 ) is odd or ( c ) is even, there will be infinitely many odd ( n ) such that ( n + c ) is coprime with ( x_1 = x_n ), so ( mathcal{P}(P, c) ) holds.     - If ( m ge 3 ), there is ( j in {1, 2, ldots, m-1} ) such that ( gcd(m, c+j) = 1 ). Then ( n = c + j + lm ) is always coprime with ( m ) for all ( l in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0} ) and we can choose ( l ) so that ( gcd(x_j, n) = 1 ).     - If ( x_n neq 0 ) for all ( n > 0 ), there are only finitely many primes dividing ( c ) or ( x_{|c-1|} neq 0 ). If ( p ) is a prime that is not one of these exceptions, then ( gcd(x_{n-c}, n) = 1 ) for at least one ( n in {p, p^2} ).     - If ( c = 1 ), assume for all but finitely many primes ( p ), ( p mid x_{p-1} ). Let ( q ) be such a prime with ( q nmid x_1x_2 ). Then ( m = m(P, q) ge 3 ) and divides ( q-1 ). Let ( p ) be another prime such that ( p nmid x_{q-1} ) and ( p notequiv 1 mod m ). We claim that ( gcd(x_{pq-1}, pq) = 1 ).     - If ( c = 0 ), assume ( mathcal{P}(P, 0) ) does not hold. This implies ( p mid x_p ) for all but finitely many primes ( p ). Let ( a = x_1 = P(0) neq 0 ) and define ( g(x) = a^{-1}P(ax) in mathbb{Z}[x] ). Define ( {y_n} ) as the iteration sequence for ( g ); then ( x_n = ay_n ) for all ( n ge 0 ). For almost all primes ( p ), ( x_{p^e} ) is ( pm a ) times a power of ( p ) for all ( e ge 1 ). The sequence ( {x_n} ) must be unbounded. If ( d ge 2 ), ( {x_n} ) grows too fast to be compatible with this. So the only possibilities are ( P(x) = x + a, a, -x + a ).

Thus, the maximum value is at x = 2m:    f(2m) = frac{ln(2m)}{2m} - 1 2. **When m geqslant e:**    The function f(x) is decreasing on left[m,2mright]. Thus, the maximum value is at x = m:    f(m) = frac{ln m}{m} - 1 3. **When frac{e}{2} < m < e:**    The function f(x) is increasing on left(m,eright) and decreasing on left(e,2mright). Therefore, the maximum value occurs at x = e:    f(e) = frac{ln e}{e} - 1 = frac{1}{e} - 1 In conclusion, the maximum value of f(x) on the interval left[m,2mright] is determined by the value of m as follows: - For 0 < m leqslant frac{e}{2}, the maximum value is f(2m) = frac{ln(2m)}{2m} - 1. - For frac{e}{2} < m < e, the maximum value is f(e) = frac{1}{e} - 1. - For m geqslant e, the maximum value is f(m) = frac{ln m}{m} - 1. Encapsulating the final answers: - Increasing Interval: boxed{left(0,eright)} - Decreasing Interval: boxed{left(e,+infty right)} - Maximum Value on left[m,2mright]:   - For 0 < m leqslant frac{e}{2}: boxed{frac{ln(2m)}{2m} - 1}   - For frac{e}{2} < m < e: boxed{frac{1}{e} - 1}   - For m geqslant e: boxed{frac{ln m}{m} - 1}"},{"instruction":"The last time Bob cut his hair, he cut it to 6 inches. Since then, his hair went through three different stages of growth with varying rates and multiple hair cuts in each stage: Stage 1: Hair grows at a rate of 0.5 inches per month for two years, during which he cuts it twice, each time removing 3 inches. Stage 2: Hair grows at a rate of 0.7 inches per month for one year and 6 months, during which he cuts it once, removing 5 inches. Stage 3: Finally, hair grows at a rate of 0.6 inches per month for 'x' years, until it reaches a final length of 36 inches, during which he cuts it once, removing 4 inches. Calculate the total time (in years and months) it took Bob to grow his hair to 36 inches, taking into account the hair growth rates, cuts, and length removed during each stage.","output":"Let's calculate the hair growth and cuts for each stage. **Stage 1:** - Growth: 0.5 inches per month for 2 years (24 months) - Hair growth before cuts: 0.5 inches/month * 24 months = 12 inches - Cuts: 3 inches + 3 inches = 6 inches - Net growth in Stage 1: 12 inches - 6 inches = 6 inches Starting length was 6 inches, so at the end of Stage 1, the hair length is: 6 inches (initial) + 6 inches (net growth) = 12 inches **Stage 2:** - Growth: 0.7 inches per month for 1 year and 6 months (18 months) - Hair growth before cuts: 0.7 inches/month * 18 months = 12.6 inches - Cuts: 5 inches - Net growth in Stage 2: 12.6 inches - 5 inches = 7.6 inches At the end of Stage 2, the hair length is: 12 inches (end of Stage 1) + 7.6 inches (net growth) = 19.6 inches **Stage 3:** - We know the final length is 36 inches, and the hair length at the end of Stage 2 is 19.6 inches. - Before the cut in Stage 3, the hair needs to grow: 36 inches (final) + 4 inches (cut) - 19.6 inches (end of Stage 2) = 20.4 inches Now, let's find out how long it takes to grow 20.4 inches at a rate of 0.6 inches per month: 20.4 inches / 0.6 inches/month = 34 months Since Stage 3 is 'x' years until the hair reaches 36 inches, we convert 34 months to years: 34 months = 2 years and 10 months So, 'x' = 2 years and 10 months **Total time:** - Stage 1: 2 years - Stage 2: 1 year and 6 months - Stage 3: 2 years and 10 months Adding these together: 2 years + 1 year and 6 months + 2 years and 10 months = 5 years and 16 months Since 16 months is 1 year and 4 months, we add this to the total: 5 years + 1 year = 6 years 16 months - 12 months = 4 months **Total time it took Bob to grow his hair to 36 inches is boxed{6}  years and 4 months.**"},{"instruction":"f the function q is defined by the formula q = 5e / (4x(z^2)), and e is quadrupled, x is doubled, and z is tripled, by what factor will q be multiplied?","output":"Let's analyze the changes step by step: 1.

According to market analysis, if the selling price is set at 50 yuan per item, 500 items can be sold in a month. It is known that for every increase of 2 yuan in the selling price, the monthly sales volume decreases by 20 items. What should be the selling price per item so that the monthly sales profit can reach 8000 yuan?","output":"To solve this problem, we start by defining variables and setting up equations based on the given information. Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Define the selling price variable**: Let the selling price of the mascot toy be x yuan per item. 2. **Calculate profit per item**: The profit for selling one item is the selling price minus the cost price, which is (x - 40) yuan. 3. **Establish the relationship between selling price and sales volume**: According to the problem, for every 2 yuan increase in the selling price, the sales volume decreases by 20 items. When the selling price is 50 yuan, 500 items are sold. Therefore, the sales volume can be expressed as a function of x: 500 - 20 times frac{x - 50}{2} = 500 - 10(x - 50) = 1000 - 10x items. 4. **Set up the equation for monthly sales profit**: The monthly sales profit is the product of the profit per item and the number of items sold. To achieve a monthly sales profit of 8000 yuan, we set up the equation: (x - 40)(1000 - 10x) = 8000. 5. **Simplify the equation**: Expanding and simplifying the equation gives us:    [    x^2 - 140x + 4800 = 8000    ]    Subtracting 8000 from both sides to set the equation to zero:    [    x^2 - 140x + 4800 - 8000 = 0    ]    Simplifying further:    [    x^2 - 140x - 3200 = 0    ] 6. **Solve the quadratic equation**: The equation x^2 - 140x - 3200 = 0 can be solved using the quadratic formula, factorization, or any other method suitable for quadratic equations.

Since there are three genuine items (let's denote them as 1, 2, 3) and one defective item (denoted as 0), the sample space is Omega ={left(0,1right),left(0,2right),left(0,3right),left(1,2right),left(1,3right),left(2,3right)}. This includes all combinations of selecting two items from the four available. 2. **Define the Event (A):** The event of interest, A, is selecting exactly one defective item. This corresponds to the combinations where one item is the defective one (denoted as 0), and the other is a genuine item. Therefore, A={left(0,1right),left(0,2right),left(0,3right)}. 3. **Calculate the Probability (P(A)):** The probability of an event is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes in the sample space. In this case, the number of favorable outcomes (selecting exactly one defective item) is the size of set A, which is 3, and the total number of outcomes in the sample space is the size of Omega, which is 6. Therefore, the probability is calculated as follows: [P(A) = frac{m}{n} = frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2}] Hence, the probability of selecting exactly one defective item when two items are selected is boxed{frac{1}{2}}.

After the ball, each person told their parents how many times they danced. What is the maximum number of different numbers the children could have mentioned?","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step and provide a detailed explanation.  Problem Restatement: - There are 29 boys and 15 girls at a ball. - Each dancing pair (boy and girl) dances at most once. - After the ball, each child reports the number of times they danced. - We need to determine the maximum number of different numbers overall that could be reported by the children.  Steps to Solution: 1. **Maximum and Minimum Values of Dance Counts:**    - The maximum number of dances a single member can have participated in is 29, considering the case of a girl dancing with all boys.    - The minimum is 0, considering the case of a girl or boy who did not dance with anyone. 2. **Mounting the Range of Possible Numbers:**    - The range of possible dance counts thus extends from 0 up to 29.    - This gives us potentially 30 different numbers (0 through 29). 3. **Exploring if All 30 Distinguished Values Are Possible:**    - Suppose we aim to span all values from 0 to 29 as reportable numbers of dances.    - If a girl dances with all boys (29 dances), she reports 29.    - If another girl doesn't dance at all, she reports 0.    Examining the middle values:    - If 30 different numbers were possible to be reported by the children, this would include every number from 0 to 29.    - Numbers from 16 to 29 are prime numbers and higher, meaning they would be reported only by girls because we have precisely 15 girls.    - If we try to distribute all numbers, including 0 to boys and girls, there must be one girl (or boy) reporting 0 dances.    - If a girl reports 0 dances, the remaining 14 girls must report numbers between 16 and 29, excluding one number - which becomes impossible. Therefore, it's impossible for all 30 different numbers to be reported. 4. **Justifying and Proving the Maximum of 29 Different Numbers:**    - To successfully report 29 different numbers, each child must be able to cover a unique dance number (without exceeding constraints):    - Let's label girls from ( G_1 ) to ( G_{15} ) and boys from ( B_1 ) to ( B_{29} ).    - Assign dance partners ensuring no pair double dances and aiming for distinct counts:     [     text{Boy } B_i text{ dances with girl } G_j text{ if and only if } i geq j      ]    - This engenders the pattern where boys have distinct dance numbers from 0 to (however many they paired), and girls occur distinctly between interconnects. 5. **Implementation via a Table to Visualize Distribution:**     Consider labeling:     begin{array}{c|ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc}     & B_1 & B_2 & B_3 & ldots & B_{29}      hline     G_1 & bullet & bullet & bullet & ldots & bullet     G_2 &  & bullet & bullet & ldots & bullet     vdots &  &  & vdots &  & vdots     G_{15} &  &  &  & ldots & bullet     end{array}         - Each parent above shows distinct individual dance counts arriving from this method of connecting ( B_i ge i ).

Substituting this into the recurrence relation gives:    [ r^{n+1} = 6r^n - r^{n-1} ]    Dividing through by ( r^{n-1} ) (for ( r neq 0 )) we get the characteristic equation:    [ r^2 = 6r - 1 ]    [ r^2 - 6r + 1 = 0 ]    Solving this quadratic equation gives the characteristic roots:    [ r = frac{6 pm sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = 3 pm 2sqrt{2} ] 2. **General Solution of the Recurrence Relation:**    The general solution of the recurrence relation is:    [ x_n = A (3 + 2sqrt{2})^n + B(3 - 2sqrt{2})^n ]    We use the initial conditions to determine ( A ) and ( B ). 3. **Using Initial Conditions to Find Constants:**    For ( n = 0 ):    [ x_0 = A (3 + 2sqrt{2})^0 + B(3 - 2sqrt{2})^0 = A + B = 1 ]    For ( n = 1 ):    [ x_1 = A (3 + 2sqrt{2}) + B (3 - 2sqrt{2}) = 3A + 3B + 2sqrt{2}(A - B) = 3 ]    Since the term with ( sqrt{2} ) must disappear, ( A = B ).

Simplify the multiplication:            y^2 = (7 + 2x pm 6sqrt{2x-2})(3 - 2x mp sqrt{2x-2}).         6. **Simplify and combine terms appropriately**:    The multiplication ( (7 + 2x pm 6sqrt{2x-2})(3 - 2x mp sqrt{2x-2}) ) results in:            y^2 = - (x^2 - 12x + 9) pm 2(2x - 2) sqrt{2x-2}.            To eliminate the square root, we square both sides to get:            left[ y^2 + (x^2 - 12x + 9) right]^2 = 4(2x-2)^3.     7. **Combine and simplify the resulting expressions** after expanding and simplifying both sides to yield the conclusion:        y^4 + 2 y^2(x^2 - 12x + 9) + x^4 + 8x^3 + 18x^2 - 27 = 0.

Let's define the problem by noting a key rule:     - Boys will lie to girls and tell the truth to other boys.     - Girls will lie to boys and tell the truth to other girls. 2. Next, we look at the statement propagation given by the children:     - The first child says to his right neighbor: \\"Most of us are boys.\\"     - The second child says to his neighbor to the right: \\"Most of us are girls.\\"     - This pattern continues alternately. 3. To solve the riddle, consider that if they are alternating statements, at some switches from true to false or false to true. This alternation and the statements alternating relate to their groups. 4. Accounting for this, we notice that these groups must alternate boys and girls, and the total number of claims “most are boys” versus “most are girls” must then correspond to this alternating pattern. Since the statements alternate, we can infer that the groups must also make the number of true and false statements even. 5. Since there were seven claims that \\"most are boys,\\" this means boys who said it must be true. Therefore, we know there are six false statements (due to girls wrongly claiming \\"most are girls\\"), and vice-versa for the six girls making false claims. 6. Since the statement \\"most are boys\\" happens 7 times true, it means half the group plus one must be boys. Translating this pattern into exact count dictates how many in pairs versus solos the groups exist. 7. Once identifying the cycles, noticing the pairs switching means each group fundamentally has:     - form of boys = truth-statement pairs correctly aligned     - alternates truth, false to aggregate 8. Verification with actual counts:      - 13 total children:          - 6 girls, impersonates maxim matching lies         - 7 boys, who more truth gives accurate claim major constituency as said. 9.

Shade (2 times 2) squares on this array as depicted in Figure 23.15.    If we shade the grid such that each (2 times 2) square is entirely shaded, we will have shaded 100 such (2 times 2) squares in the (29 times 29) grid. This is because:    [    leftlfloor frac{29}{2} rightrfloor = 14 quad text{(since each (2 times 2) block spans 2 columns and rows completely)}    ]    Therefore, a (29 times 29) grid can be divided into (14 times 14 = 196) (2 times 2) sections, and since any partially overlapping block counts completely towards one of these sections, we round up to (15 times 15 = 225). 3. **Counting Shaded Blocks**:    When 99 squares of (2 times 2) are cut out from the (29 times 29) grid, each cutout square affects exactly one of the shaded (2 times 2) squares. Since 99 such squares were cut, this means 99 shaded squares are used up. 4. **Remaining Shaded Square**:    Since the (29 times 29) grid initially includes 100 shaded (2 times 2) squares and removing 99 cells would still leave one shaded (2 times 2) square intact.

Then for any x > 0, we would have f(x) = f((x-x_0) + x_0) = f(x-x_0)f(x_0) = 0. This clearly contradicts the given information that f(x) > 1 for x > 0. Hence, there's no such x_0 for which f(x_0) = 0, and it implies that f(x) neq 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. Therefore, for any x in mathbb{R}, we have boxed{f(x) > 0}. (3) To tackle the inequality f(7+2x) > 9, we first need to consider x_1, x_2 in mathbb{R} with x_1 < x_2. We can write the difference f(x_2) - f(x_1) as: f(x_2) - f(x_1) = f((x_2 - x_1) + x_1) - f(x_1) = f(x_1)(f(x_2 - x_1) - 1) Since x_2 - x_1 > 0, and given that f(x) > 1 for x > 0, it follows that f(x_2 - x_1) - 1 > 0. From part (2), we know that f(x_1) > 0 for any x_1 in mathbb{R}. Thus, f(x_2) - f(x_1) > 0, which means f(x_1) < f(x_2). This indicates that the function f(x) is strictly increasing on mathbb{R}. Since we are given f(2) = 3, we can deduce that f(4) = f(2)f(2) = 9. Now, according to the inequality f(7 + 2x) > 9, we have f(7 + 2x) > f(4). This implies that 7 + 2x > 4, which leads us to solve for x and we get x > -frac{3}{2}. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is boxed{x > -frac{3}{2}}."},{"instruction":"Solve for x: 5x + 6x = 360  10(x  4).","output":"1.

When we replace each pair ((a, b)) of numbers with their sum (a + b) and their difference (a - b), we need to understand the effect on the squares of these numbers.  3. Consider a pair ( (a, b) ). The sum of the squares of the original pair is:    [    a^2 + b^2    ]    After the replacement, we get two new numbers (a + b) and (a - b).

Notice that the sum of the squares of any 1000 consecutive integers has a specific behavior modulo 8:    - If we denote the initial sequence of 1000 integers starting from some integer (n), then the sum of these integers squared modulo 8 is always congruent to 4 modulo 8. This is because:      - Squares of integers modulo 8 can be 0, 1, or 4.      - Summing these patterns over 1000 consecutive numbers follows specific patterns that result in a remainder of 4. 5. After the first transformation, because the sum of the squares doubles, the new sum of squares modulo 8 becomes:    [    2 times 4 = 8 equiv 0 pmod{8}    ] 6. Since the sum of the squares on the board will be zero modulo 8 after the first operation, every subsequent set of replacements (pairing and replacing numbers with their sum and difference) will maintain the property that the sum of the squares of the numbers is congruent to zero modulo 8. 7. For there to be 1000 consecutive integers again, their sum of the squares modulo 8 would need to be congruent to 4, not 0.

The proof involves the following steps: 1. **Understanding the Relation**:        Ptolemy's Theorem is a direct result of the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. Recall that a cyclic quadrilateral is a quadrilateral that can be inscribed in a circle. Let's consider the cyclic quadrilateral with vertices A, B, C, D such that the sides opposite each other are a=AB, b=BC, c=CD, d=DA and with diagonals m=AC, n=BD. 2. **Applying Ptolemy's Theorem**:    Ptolemy's Theorem states that for any cyclic quadrilateral:    [    AC cdot BD = AB cdot CD + BC cdot DA    ]    Using the notation provided in the problem:    [    mn = ac + bd    ] 3. **Verification Based on Angles**:    A key property of cyclic quadrilaterals is that the opposite angles sum up to 180^circ. Hence:    [    hat{A} + hat{C} = 180^circ quad text{and} quad hat{B} + hat{D} = 180^circ    ]        This property is crucial as it ensures the quadrilateral can indeed be inscribed in a circle, making the application of Ptolemy's Theorem valid. 4. **Conclusion**:    Since we established that quadrilateral is cyclic based on the sum of opposite angles being 180^circ and applied Ptolemy's Theorem, we conclude:    [    mn = ac + bd    ] [ boxed{mn = ac + bd} ]"},{"instruction":"Given points M(x_{1},0) and N(x_{2}, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}A) are on the graph of the function f(x)=Asin (omega x+varphi) (A > 0,omega > 0), and the minimum value of |x_{1}x_{2}| is frac{pi}{3}, then omega=　　() A: frac{3}{4} B: frac{1}{3} C: 2 D: 1","output":"From the given conditions: M(x_{1},0) and N(x_{2}, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}A) are on the graph of the function f(x)=Asin (omega x+varphi) (A > 0,omega > 0),   we have Asin (omega x_{1}+varphi)=0,   which gives us: omega x_{1}+varphi=kpildots①   From frac{sqrt{2}}{2}A=Asin (omega x_{2}+varphi),   we get: omega x_{2}+varphi= frac{pi}{4}+2kpildots②   Therefore, from ①-② we obtain: omega(|x_{1}-x_{2}|)= frac{pi}{4}-kpi (kinmathbb{Z})   Since the minimum value of |x_{1}-x_{2}| is frac{pi}{3},   when k=0,   we have frac{omegapi}{3}= frac{pi}{4} (omega > 0)   Solving this gives: omega= frac{3}{4}.

This line ( O_BO_C ) passes through the point where the line through ( A ) intersects the nine-point circle of ( triangle ABC ). 5. Now, consider the properties of the nine-point circle. The nine-point circle (or Euler circle) of a triangle passes through the midpoints of the sides, the feet of the altitudes, and the midpoints of the segments joining the orthocenter to the vertices.

We need to prove that for all k > 3, the number aA, where A is the number obtained when you remove the last digit of N, is divisible by 6.     2. First, observe that the last digit a of 2^k follows a periodic sequence with a period of 4. Specifically, the last digits of powers of 2 cycle through 2, 4, 8, and 6:        [    begin{aligned}    2^1 &= 2 quad (text{last digit } 2),     2^2 &= 4 quad (text{last digit } 4),     2^3 &= 8 quad (text{last digit } 8),     2^4 &= 16 quad (text{last digit } 6),     2^5 &= 32 quad (text{last digit } 2),     &vdots     2^k &equiv {2, 4, 8, 6}  (mod  10)    end{aligned}    ] 3.

For a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. 5. Since a can only be even digits (2, 4, 8, or 6), aA is divisible by 2 because a itself is even. 6. Now we need to show that aA is also divisible by 3. Observe that the sequence of last digits of powers of 2 modulo 3 alternates as follows:        [    begin{aligned}    2^1 equiv 2  (mod  3),     2^2 equiv 1  (mod  3),     2^3 equiv 2  (mod  3),     2^4 equiv 1  (mod  3),     2^5 equiv 2  (mod  3),     &vdots     2^k &equiv {2, 1, 2, 1}  (mod  3).    end{aligned}    ] 7. Thus, for k geq 4, if N = 2^k:    - If the last digit a = 2 or a = 8, then N equiv 2  (mod  3).    - If the last digit a = 4, then N equiv 1  (mod  3).    - If the last digit a = 6, then N equiv 2  (mod  3). 8.

Setting f'(x) = 0 gives us the critical points: 3x(x+frac{2a}{3}) = 0 implies x = 0 text{ and } x = -frac{2a}{3}. 2. **Analyzing Monotonicity:** - For x in (-infty, -frac{2a}{3}), we have f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically increasing. - For x in (-frac{2a}{3}, 0), we have f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically decreasing. - For x in (0, +infty), we have f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically increasing again. Thus, x = -frac{2a}{3} is a local maximum and x = 0 is a local minimum, confirming there are two critical points. 3. **Number of Zeros:** Given f(0) = 1 and f(-frac{2a}{3}) > 0, and as x rightarrow -infty, f(x) rightarrow -infty, it's clear f(x) crosses the x-axis exactly once. Hence, f(x) has exactly one zero. 4. **Center of Symmetry:** To find the center of symmetry, we compute the second derivative: f''(x) = 6x + 2a. Setting f''(x) = 0 gives x = -frac{a}{3}, indicating the point (-frac{a}{3}, f(-frac{a}{3})) is the center of symmetry. 5. **Tangent Line y = x:** Assuming y = x can be a tangent to f(x), we set the derivative equal to 1 (the slope of y = x): 3x_{0}^{2} + 2ax_{0} = 1 implies ax_{0} = frac{1 - 3x_{0}^{2}}{2}. The equation for the tangent line at P(x_{0}, y_{0}) is: y - (x_{0}^{3} + ax_{0}^{2} + 1) = x - x_{0}. Substituting (0,0) into the equation gives: x_{0}^{3} + ax_{0}^{2} - x_{0} + 1 = 0. Substituting ax_{0} = frac{1 - 3x_{0}^{2}}{2} into the equation simplifies to: x_{0}^{3} + x_{0} - 2 = 0. Solving this gives x_{0} = 1, which implies a = -1 and y_{0} = 1.

Similarly, for the xz-plane, the sphere intersects at (0, 5, -6), indicating changes along the x-axis also of the radius's magnitude. 3. Calculate the radius of the sphere: - From the sphere center to the point of intersection with the xy-plane forms a right triangle with hypotenuse as the sphere's radius, sides along the z-axis (length 6, the difference between -6 and 0). Likewise, the x-axis difference is 3 (between 3 and 0). - The radius R of the sphere can be calculated as R = sqrt{3^2 + 6^2} = sqrt{9 + 36} = sqrt{45} = 3sqrt{5}. 4. Determine the radius r from the intersection with the xz-plane: - A point on this circle (0, 5, -6) along with (3, 5, -6) forms another right triangle with hypotenuse R = 3sqrt{5} and one side along x-axis of 3. Therefore, r = sqrt{R^2 - 3^2} = sqrt{45 - 9} = sqrt{36} = 6.

If Ram's weight is increased by 10% and the total weight of Ram and Shyam becomes 82.8 kg, with an increase of 15%, the weight of Shyam has to be increased by 21%. What is the ratio of Ram's weight to Shyam's weight?","output":"Let the original weights of Ram and Shyam be R and S respectively. The ratio of their weights is R:S. According to the problem, if Ram's weight is increased by 10%, his new weight becomes R + 0.10R = 1.10R. Similarly, if Shyam's weight is increased by 21%, his new weight becomes S + 0.21S = 1.21S. The total weight of Ram and Shyam after the increase becomes 1.10R + 1.21S, which is given as 82.8 kg. So, we have the equation: 1.10R + 1.21S = 82.8 ...(1) We also know that the total weight of Ram and Shyam after a 15% increase becomes 82.8 kg. This means that the combined original weight of Ram and Shyam, increased by 15%, equals 82.8 kg. So, we have the equation: 1.15(R + S) = 82.8 ...(2) Now, let's solve these two equations to find the ratio R:S. From equation (2), we can find the original combined weight of Ram and Shyam: R + S = 82.8 / 1.15 R + S = 72 kg ...(3) Now, let's substitute the value of S from equation (3) into equation (1): 1.10R + 1.21(72 - R) = 82.8 Expanding the equation, we get: 1.10R + 87.12 - 1.21R = 82.8 Combining like terms, we get: -0.11R = 82.8 - 87.12 -0.11R = -4.32 Dividing both sides by -0.11, we get: R = -4.32 / -0.11 R = 39.27 kg (approximately) Now, we can find S using equation (3): S = 72 - R S = 72 - 39.27 S = 32.73 kg (approximately) Finally, the ratio of Ram's weight to Shyam's weight is: R:S = 39.27:32.73 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the smaller number (32.73): R:S = 39.27/32.73 : 32.73/32.73 R:S ≈ 1.20 : 1 Therefore, the ratio of Ram's weight to Shyam's weight is approximately boxed{1.20:1} ."},{"instruction":"A 20^{circ}C temperature, completely inelastic lead ball falls freely from a height of 100 mathrm{~m} onto a solid surface.

Finding the temperature of the ball immediately after the fall:** 1. The potential energy lost by the falling ball converts to heat energy absorbed by the ball. Therefore, we need to equate the potential energy to the heat energy. The potential energy lost is: [ m g s ] 2. The heat energy gained can be expressed in terms of the temperature increase, Delta t = t_1 - t, as: [ (t_1 - t) m E C ] 3. Setting these two energies equal, we have: [ m g s = (t_1 - t) m E C ] 4. Canceling ( m ) from both sides: [ g s = (t_1 - t) E C ] 5. Solving for ( t_1 ): [ t_1 - t = frac{g s}{E C} ] 6. Plugging in the given values: [ t_1 - 20 = frac{9.80 cdot 100}{425 cdot 0.0315} ] 7. Performing the calculation: [ t_1 - 20 = frac{980}{13.3875} ] [ t_1 - 20 approx 73.2 ] [ t_1 approx 93.2^{circ} ] Thus, the temperature of the ball immediately after the fall is: [ boxed{93.2^{circ}} ] **2. Finding the initial velocity (v_0) such that the ball reaches the melting point:** 1. To melt the ball, the heat gain should be sufficient to raise its temperature from 20^circ to 335^circ. The total mechanical energy considered here is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy given by the initial velocity ( v_0 ). Thus: [ m g s + frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 = (T - t) m E C ] 2. Canceling ( m ) from both sides: [ g s + frac{1}{2} v_0^2 = (T - t) E C ] 3. Solving for ( v_0^2 ): [ frac{1}{2} v_0^2 = (T - t) E C - g s ] [ v_0^2 = 2 left( (T - t) E C - g s right) ] 4.

We need to prove that (a_n ge 2^n) for all (n ge 0). 1. **Base Case:** - For (n = 0), (a_0 ge 1 = 2^0). - For (n = 1), since (a_1 > a_0 ge 1), we have (a_1 ge 2 = 2^1). - For (n = 2), we need to show (a_2 ge 4). Since (gcd(a_1, a_2) > a_0) and (a_1 ge 2), the smallest possible value for (a_2) that satisfies (gcd(a_1, a_2) > 1) is 4.

We need to show (a_{k+1} ge 2^{k+1}). - Consider (a_{k-1} = b), (a_k = dbeta), and (a_{k+1} = a), where (gcd(alpha, beta) = 1).

Since (a > dbeta), we have (a ge 2dbeta ge 2 cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}). - **Case 3:** (beta le 7) and (beta ge 4alpha). Then (a > dbeta ge 4dalpha ge 4 cdot 2^{k-1} = 2^{k+1}). - **Case 4:** (beta le 7) and (2alpha < beta < 4alpha).

Thus, (frac{3d}{2} mid a) and (a > 3d), so (a ge frac{9d}{2} > 4d = 4dalpha ge 4 cdot 2^{k-1} = 2^{k+1}). - **Subcase 4.2:** (alpha = 2) and (beta = 5). Then (gcd(a, 5d) > 2d), so (gcd(a, 5d) in {5d, 5d/2}). Thus, (frac{5d}{2} mid a) and (a > 5d), so (a ge 10d = 2 cdot (dbeta) ge 2 cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}). - **Subcase 4.3:** (alpha = 2) and (beta = 7).

Thus, [ S = frac{1}{2} times sqrt{2} times sqrt{2} = 1. ] 3. **Initial Projection Area:** - When the tetrahedron is aligned such that one of these faces lies in the projection plane, the projection area is simply the area of the face.

This line ( l ) will serve as the median. 3. **Dissect the triangle:** - The triangle is divided into two smaller triangles along line ( l ). 4. **Rearrange the parts:** - Place these two smaller triangles together such that their longer sides are aligned, forming a rectangle. By following these steps, we convert any triangle into a rectangle, proving that any triangle can be reassembled into a rectangle if dissected properly. Part (b) The goal here is to demonstrate that any rectangle can be divided into parts, which can be reassembled into a square. 1. **Starting with any rectangle:** - Consider rectangle ( ABCD ) with ( AB ) and ( CD ) as parallel sides, and ( AD ) and ( BC ) as the other pair of parallel sides. 2. **Resemble a parallelogram:** - A rectangle itself is a special type of parallelogram, which simplifies the initial stage. 3. **Ensure equality of a square:** - The next step is to prove the \`area equality\`. For any parallelogram with sides equal to a base ( b ) and height ( h ), we construct a parallelogram that maintains these proportions. 4. **Split the parallelogram:** - If the height falls on the base, we can then cut along the height to divide the parallelogram into two right triangles. - These two triangles align to form a rectangle with the same area as the original parallelogram. 5. **Transform this rectangle into a square:** - Adjust the dimensions to form a square by rearranging and making sure lengths match. From earlier confirmation, any rectangle can be split and adjusted into a square arrangement. By following these steps in detail, the assertion that any parallelogram (hence the rectangle) can be re-measured into a square is substantiated. Part (c) For this part, we aim to establish the truth about any polygon being dissectable into parts that can reassemble into a square. 1. **Starting with any polygon:** - Divide the given polygon into smaller triangles. This can be easily done for a convex polygon by drawing all diagonals from one vertex. - If not convex, we need to form additional smaller convex polygons by extending sides where necessary. 2. **Each triangle to a square:** - Utilize the confirmed findings in parts (a) and (b). Each triangle is already proven to be capable of forming a rectangle, and any rectangle can become a square through dissecting methods. 3. **Combine resulting squares:** - Consider how smaller resulting squares can be joined to form a larger one. - Sequentially join two squares, dissect and rearrange into one bigger square, reducing the quantities progressively following the similar method illustrated. Through sequential operations, any polygon can be dissected into square-compatible parts, ultimately forming a single large square when recombined.

For the product to not be divisible by 2, all eight numbers rolled must be odd. The probability of rolling an odd number on one die is frac{1}{2}.

Solving (a^2 - c^2 = 1): [ (a-c)(a+c) = 1 ] The only integer solutions for (a) and (c) that satisfy (1 leq a leq 9) and (0 leq c le_9) are (a = 6) and (c = 5) (or vice versa), giving (a^2 - c^2 = 36 - 25 = 11). 5. **Final calculation**: Substituting back, we find: [ |x-y| = 6sqrt{1111 times 1} = 6 times sqrt{1111} = 199.83 ] Thus, the absolute difference (|x - y|) is (199.83). boxed{The final answer is (boxed{D}).}"},{"instruction":"During a year when Thanksgiving is on Thursday, November 23, on what day of the week does December 23 occur?","output":"To determine on what day of the week December 23 occurs, we can start from the known day, which is Thanksgiving on Thursday, November 23.

The common factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The greatest common factor is 12. Now, we find the GCD of the result (12) and the third quantity (368): - The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. - The factors of 368 are a bit more complex to calculate manually, but we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Using the Euclidean algorithm: GCD(12, 368): - 368 = 12 * 30 + 8 - 12 = 8 * 1 + 4 - 8 = 4 * 2 + 0 When we reach a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 4. So, the GCD of 60, 144, and 368 is 4 liters. Now, we can calculate the number of cans needed for each drink: - Maaza: 60 liters / 4 liters per can = 15 cans - Pepsi: 144 liters / 4 liters per can = 36 cans - Sprite: 368 liters / 4 liters per can = 92 cans Adding them up, the total number of cans required is: 15 + 36 + 92 = 143 cans Therefore, the least number of cans required is boxed{143} ."},{"instruction":"Ten balls, numbered from 2 to 11, are placed in a hat.

Given that the altitudes also form an arithmetic progression, denote them as (h, h+h',) and (h+2h'). However, a more straightforward approach involves using the general property of altitude in a triangle. 3. **Understand the relationship between the sides and the altitudes**: Recall that the area (K) of the triangle can be expressed in two ways using the sides and altitudes. Let the sides be denoted as (a_1, a_2,) and (a_3), and the corresponding altitudes as (h_1, h_2,) and (h_3).

Both cases n = 2 and n = 3 are trivial and valid. Therefore, the base cases hold. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: Suppose the statement is true for a convex k-gon where k leq n. Specifically: - If k is even, then the number of good diagonals is at most k - 2. - If k is odd, then the number of good diagonals is at most k - 3. 3. **Induction Step**: Consider a convex (n+1)-gon P = A_1 A_2 ldots A_{n+1}. - **Case 1**: If no two good diagonals intersect, then each good diagonal divides the polygon into smaller polygons without introducing additional intersections. Hence, in the worst case, the number of good diagonals will be n - 3 based on the known result from a problem (referenced as problem 35139). - **Case 2**: If two good diagonals do intersect, denote these intersecting diagonals as A_i A_k and A_j A_l with i < j < k < l. 4. **Analyzing Intersecting Diagonals**: - Each of A_i A_k and A_j A_l will not intersect any other diagonals.

If d is a side, it cannot be a good diagonal since it does not intersect another diagonal. - According to the induction hypothesis: - In each smaller polygon, the number of good diagonals does not exceed the number of vertices in that polygon reduced by 2. 6. **Summation of Smaller Polygons**: - When n is even, the summation of the maximum number of good diagonals in the smaller polygons is: [ 2 + (j-i-1) + (k-j-1) + (l-k-1) + (n+1-l+i-1) = n-2 ] - When n is odd, at least one smaller polygon has an odd number of vertices and thus, will have its maximal number of good diagonals affected by -1, resulting in: [ n-3 ] 7. **Completeness of Correct Counting**: - For even n: the construction example shows that the complete polygon can reach exactly n - 2 good diagonals. - For odd n: the construction example confirms that at most n - 3 good diagonals can be achieved when extended to an equivalent near situation. # Conclusion: - The maximum number of good diagonals in a convex n-gon is: [ boxed{n-2 text{ if } n text{ is even, and } n-3 text{ if } n text{ is odd.}} ]"},{"instruction":"As shown in Figure 1.8.15, let A A^{prime}, B B^{prime}, C C^{prime} intersect at point O, and let BC and B^{prime}C^{prime}, CA and C^{prime}A^{prime}, AB and A^{prime}B^{prime} intersect at X, Y, Z respectively.

Each color appears in at least three different combinations. Prove that it is possible to select three types of fabrics such that each color appears on at least one fabric. 1. **Notation and Assumptions**: Let there be six colors labeled as (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Fabrics are denoted by pairs of these numbers, representing the colors used in them. We start by selecting a fabric, say from the pair (56). Given the condition that every color is paired with at least three different other colors, let us investigate if three required fabrics can be found which altogether cover all six colors. 2. **Initial Configuration**: Let's analyze the given fabrics: - If the pairs ((12, 34)) and ((13, 24)) can be produced, then we already have our desired set of three fabrics (i.e., (56, 12, 34) or (56, 13, 24)) satisfying the condition that each color appears in at least one fabric. - If this is not the case, then assume neither (12) nor (13) fabrics are produced. 3. **Adjust Assumptions via Relabeling**: Assume (12) and (13) are not produced. This does not limit the generality of our proof since by relabeling we can always achieve the same situation for different pairs. 4. **Analyzing Pair Combinations**: Since each color appears in at least three pairs: - The color 1 must appear in pair (14) or any other fabric different from (12) and (13) (since those are not produced). - Similarly, the color 2 must appear in (25) because (12) and (23) are not produced (otherwise, (14, 25, 56) would be our solution). 5. **Confirmation through Elimination**: - If (12) and (23) are not produced, by the condition of producing three pairs with every color, we have (25) produced. - If (36) is produced when (13) and (23) are unproduced, by the analogous reasoning, we can set the final fabric choice as (14, 25, 36). Thus, through analysis and logical exclusions, it becomes apparent that irrespective of initial pair configuration assumptions, we can always find three pairs of fabrics such that each of the six colors appears at least once in the set. **Conclusion**: Thus, we have shown that it is always possible to select three different fabrics such that each color appears on at least one of them.

The least common denominator for 2 and 3 is 6.

We convert 7/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 6: 7/3 = 14/6 Now we add them: 23/6 + 14/6 = (23 + 14) / 6 = 37/6 So the result of adding 7/3 to the number is boxed{37/6} ."},{"instruction":"Given real numbers x and y satisfying x^2+4y^22xy=4, the maximum value of x+2y is.","output":"Let x+2y=t, then x=t-2y.

Specifically, each move decreases (S) by at least one because: - Before the move, there are three pairs of distinct colors among the three sections. - After the move, all three sections are of the same color, reducing the number of distinct color pairs by three. 5. **Boundedness of (S):** The maximum value of (S) is finite. Since there are (2n) sections and each section can form pairs with at most two other sections (consecutive or one section apart), the maximum number of such pairs is (4n). 6. **Conclusion from Decreasing (S):** Since (S) is finite and decreases by at least one with each move, (S) will eventually reach zero after a finite number of moves. When (S = 0), it means there are no pairs of sections with distinct colors, implying all sections are of the same color. 7. **Contradiction:** If all sections are of the same color, no further moves are possible because there are no three consecutive sections of distinct colors. This contradicts the assumption that the process can be repeated infinitely. 8. **Final Conclusion:** Therefore, it is not possible to repaint the fence infinitely many times for any (n).

That is, there are no prime numbers among the given integers. Let a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n be given integers such that 1 < a_i < (2n-1)^2. 2. **Prime Divisors**: For each a_i, let p_i be the smallest prime divisor of a_i. Since we assume a_i are not prime, a_i has at least one prime divisor different from p_i. Hence, p_i^2 leq a_i < (2n-1)^2. 3. **Unique Prime Divisors**: The prime numbers p_i are all distinct. If p_i = p_j for i neq j, then p_i would divide both a_i and a_j which contradicts our assumption that a_i and a_j are coprime (pairwise relatively prime). 4. **Analysis of Prime Numbers**: Thus, we have n distinct primes p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n, each less than 2n-1. We need to show this is impossible. 5. **Counting Primes**: Within the range 1 and 2n-1, the primes must be accounted for. There are n-1 odd numbers (since the numbers can be listed as 3, 5, 7, ldots, 2n-3), all these numbers are candidates for being prime numbers, considering all primes above 2 are odd. 6. **Contradiction**: Since there are only n-1 possible odd prime candidates in the specified range, it is impossible to have n distinct primes, creating a contradiction. 7. **Conclusion**: This contradiction implies our initial assumption is false. Therefore, among the specified numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ), there must be at least one prime number.

If k is greater than 1 (k > 1), then according to the given condition, the numbers preceding k must be in descending order when moving from left to right. Specifically, the order should contain the numbers k-1, k-2, ldots, 1. 3. **Constraint analysis for k > 1:** For example, if k=4 and it is situated at the first position, then to its left in the sequence, we would have the numbers 3, 2, 1 in the given order: 1 ,text{should be to the left of}, 2, ,text{which is to the left of}, 3, ,text{which is to the left of}, 4. This ensures that our sequence positions the numbers in a non-decreasing manner up to k, inclusively. 4. **Constraint analysis for k < N:** Similarly, if k < N, the numbers succeeding k need to be in increasing order, specifically k+1, k+2, ldots, N. This arises because for each number n between k and N, n must be to the left of n+1 in the permutation: k ,text{should be to the left of}, k+1, ,text{which is to the left of}, k+2 ldots, ,text{which is to the left of}, N. 5. **Unique ordering provided by the constraints:** Any valid permutation should unique, by relaying the numbers 1 through k-1 in descending order left to k, and numbers k+1 through N in ascending order to the right of k. 6. **Number of possible permutations:** Let's consider the placement of numbers 1, 2, ldots, N-1 in the N-1 positions after the first. The number of ways we can choose the positions for the remaining N-1 elements (excluding k,). 7. **Set construction analysis:** These placements can be thought of as constructing a subset of the set {1, 2, ..., N-1}.

The first derivative is calculated as follows: f'(x)=frac{d}{dx}(ln x)-frac{d}{dx}left(frac{a(x+1)}{x-1}right) = frac{1}{x} + frac{2a}{(x-1)^{2}}. **Statement A: When a > 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (1,+infty).** Given a > 0, the derivative simplifies to f'(x) = frac{1}{x} + frac{2a}{(x-1)^{2}} > 0, for all x > 0 and x neq 1. This demonstrates that f(x) is indeed monotonically increasing on (1, +infty). However, the statement was slightly misinterpreted in the original solution; the correct interpretation should be focused on the interval (1, +infty) rather than (0,1) and (1, +infty). Thus, the conclusion about (0,1) is not needed for this statement. **Statement B: If the tangent line of the graph of f(x) at x=2 is perpendicular to the line x+2y-5=0, then the real number a=frac{3}{4}.** The slope of the line x+2y-5=0 is -frac{1}{2}. Since the tangent line at x=2 is perpendicular to this line, its slope must be the negative reciprocal, which gives us f'(2) = frac{1}{2} + frac{2a}{(2-1)^{2}} = 2. Solving for a, frac{1}{2} + 2a = 2 implies 2a = frac{3}{2} implies a = frac{3}{4}.

Setting f'(x) = 0 gives us the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0, which results in two roots: x_1 = frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2}, quad x_2 = frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2}. This indicates that f(x) does indeed have extreme values, contradicting the statement. Thus, Statement C is incorrect. **Statement D: When a > 0, f(x) has exactly two zeros x_{1} and x_{2}, and x_{1}x_{2}=1.** The analysis provided shows that f(x) has exactly one zero in (0,1) and one zero in (1, +infty) when a > 0.

Assume that there exists a number ( b ) in ( p )-arithmetic such that ( b^2 = a ). 2. Then we have the identities: [ x^2 = a ] [ b^2 = a ] 3. Subtracting both sides of the second equation from the first, we get: [ x^2 - b^2 = 0 ] 4. This can be factored as follows: [ (x - b)(x + b) = 0 ] 5. According to the property of ( p )-arithmetic, if the product of two numbers equals zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. This is guaranteed by zero-product property. Therefore, either: [ x - b = 0 ] or [ x + b = 0 ] 6. Solving these, we get: [ x = b ] or [ x = -b ] 7. Now let's prove that if ( a neq 0 ), the two solutions ( x = b ) and ( x = -b ) are distinct. 8.

If the ( p )-arithmetic under consideration is not ( 2 )-arithmetic ( ( p neq 2 )), then the property of division in ( p )-arithmetic ensures that ( b = 0 ). 10.

If ( p = 2 ), then the conclusion might be different and needs special consideration.

Since the speed of the train remains the same, we can use the same speed to find out the total distance covered while crossing the platform: Total Distance = Speed * Time Total Distance = 15 m/s * 146.67 s = 2200.05 m This total distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the platform: Total Distance = Length of Train + Length of Platform 2200.05 m = 1200 m + L Now, we can solve for L: L = 2200.05 m - 1200 m L = 1000.05 m So, the length of the platform is approximately boxed{1000.05} meters."},{"instruction":"Cary starts working at Game Stop for 10/hour.

Given (n geq 11), (m) would have to be at least 1.

Example: 1. Place 20. 2. Place a number to ensure 20 is blue. Since 20 is even, place 10 to the left of 20. 3.

This aligns well with the criteria for a comprehensive survey, where the aim is to collect data from every member of the group being studied. Thus, Option B is a suitable choice for a comprehensive survey. - **Option C**: Understanding the daily exercise time of primary and secondary school students nationwide. This scenario involves a large and diverse population spread across a wide geographical area. Conducting a comprehensive survey in this case would be impractical and resource-intensive. A sampling survey, where a representative sample of the population is studied, would be more appropriate. Hence, Option C does not meet the criteria for a comprehensive survey. - **Option D**: Understanding whether the pigment content of a certain food in the market meets national standards. This scenario involves analyzing a specific characteristic (pigment content) of a product that could vary across different batches and brands. It's more efficient to conduct a sampling survey to test a selection of products rather than every single item available in the market. Therefore, Option D is not the best choice for a comprehensive survey. Based on the analysis, the most suitable option for a comprehensive survey, where the aim is to collect data from every member of the group being studied, is: - **Investigating the visual conditions of a class of students**.

There are half as many peaches as bananas. There are 28 pieces of fruit in the fruit basket. What is the difference between the number of oranges and apples in the basket?","output":"Let's denote the number of apples as A, the number of bananas as B, and the number of peaches as P. According to the problem, we have the following relationships: 1. B = 3A (there are 3 times as many bananas as apples) 2. P = 1/2 B (there are half as many peaches as bananas) 3. The total number of fruits is 28, which includes 6 oranges, so the equation for the total number of fruits is: A + B + P + 6 = 28 Now, let's substitute B and P in terms of A into the total fruit equation: A + 3A + (1/2)(3A) + 6 = 28 Combine like terms: A + 3A + 1.5A + 6 = 28 5.5A + 6 = 28 Subtract 6 from both sides: 5.5A = 22 Divide both sides by 5.5 to solve for A: A = 22 / 5.5 A = 4 So, there are 4 apples in the basket.

The rate at which p works is W/P per day, and the rate at which q works is W/Q per day. Given that p and q together can complete the work in 40 days, we can write the following equation based on their combined rate: (W/P) + (W/Q) = W/40 Now, we know that p worked alone for the first 8 days and then p and q worked together for the remaining 12 days (since the total work lasted 20 days). The amount of work p did alone in the first 8 days is: 8 * (W/P) The amount of work p and q did together in the remaining 12 days is: 12 * (W/P + W/Q) Since the total work is completed in 20 days, we can write: 8 * (W/P) + 12 * (W/P + W/Q) = W Now we can solve for Q (the number of days it takes for q to complete the work alone) using the information we have. First, let's simplify the equation: 8W/P + 12W/P + 12W/Q = W (8/P + 12/P)W + (12/Q)W = W (20/P)W + (12/Q)W = W Since W is the total work, we can divide both sides of the equation by W: 20/P + 12/Q = 1 We know from the first equation that 1/P + 1/Q = 1/40, so we can substitute 1/P from this equation into the second equation: 20(1/40 - 1/Q) + 12/Q = 1 20/Q - 20/40 + 12/Q = 1 (20 + 12)/Q - 1/2 = 1 32/Q - 1/2 = 1 32/Q = 1 + 1/2 32/Q = 3/2 Q = 32/(3/2) Q = 32 * 2/3 Q = 64/3 Q = 21.33 days So, it would take q approximately boxed{21.33} days to complete the work alone."},{"instruction":"The operation * is defined by a*b=a+b+ab , where a and b are real numbers.

Using this property, we can generalize the operation for multiple terms. For three terms ( a, b, ) and ( c ): [ a * (b * c) = a * ((b + 1)(c + 1) - 1) = a + ((b + 1)(c + 1) - 1) + a((b + 1)(c + 1) - 1). ] Simplifying this: [ a * (b * c) = a + (b + 1)(c + 1) - 1 + a((b + 1)(c + 1) - 1) = (a + 1)((b + 1)(c + 1)) - 1. ] 4.

The axis of symmetry is the line x=2. Since the parabola opens upwards and the vertex represents the lowest point on the graph within its domain, the minimum value of y occurs at x=2, which is y=-2.

The final population, after the bombardment and the departure of 15% of the survivors, is given by: P - (x/100) * P - (15/100) * (P - (x/100) * P) = 3553 We are given that the initial population P was 4400.

Test for N = 1253 with values: - If we can set x + y = 1253, y + z = 1253, z + u = 1253, u + v = 1253, then each pair should sum to nearly half of 2505 (i.e., around 1252.5), which aligns with the integer limit 1253 if we wisely choose y, z, and u mediating small integer values. - For example, let y = z = u = 1. Then x + y = 1253 Rightarrow x = 1252; y + z = 1 + 1 = 2; z + u = 2; u + v = 1253 Rightarrow v = 1252. Concluding we get x = 1252, y = z = u = 1, v = 1252. This sums up as 1252 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1252 = 2507. Since we aimed for 2505 and ended slightly over, we can adjust one value slightly to fit the exact sum to suggest feasibility. By intuitive tweaks, if x = 1253, y = z = u = 1, v = 1253, we get a sum of exactly 1253 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1253 = 2509, again a bit over.

Consider the following shooting pattern (where '*' represents a shot): | | | | * | | | | * | | | | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | | | | * | | | | * | | | | | | * | | | | * | | | | * | | * | | | | * | | | | * | | | | | | * | | | | * | | | | | | * | | | | * | | | | | | * | | | | * | | | | * | | * | | | | * | | | | * | | | | | | * | | | | * | | | | | | * | | | | * | | | | 3. **Verify the Shot Placement:** - There are 24 shots, placed in such a way that the cells are spaced sufficiently to cover all potential ship placements. - Each placement ensures that a horizontal or vertical ship of 4 cells would be hit by at least one of these shots: - If the ship is placed horizontally or vertically, due to the regular spacing, at least one of the ship's cells will fall on one of the 24 marked positions. 4. **Conclusion:** By using the strategy outlined above, Vasya can always guarantee that the 1 times 4 ship will be hit with 24 shots.

Since M is closer to the x-axis by 2, this is not possible for y < 0. Therefore, no points satisfy the condition when y < 0. 2. When y geq 0, then |y| = y, and the equation now becomes: sqrt{x^2 + (y-2)^2} = y + 2. Squaring both sides yields: x^2 + (y-2)^2 = y^2 + 4y + 4. After simplifying, we get: x^2 = 8y. Thus, the trajectory of point M when y geq 0 is given by the equation x^2 = 8y. Now combining the findings from both cases, we conclude that the equation for y < 0 does not contribute to the trajectory, so the overall trajectory of the moving point M is given by the equation: boxed{x^2 = 8y quad text{for} quad y geq 0}."},{"instruction":"Joshua bought different types and quantities of fruits: 25 oranges, 40 apples, and 50 bananas.

Oranges: Since Joshua bought less than 30 oranges, there is no discount. The cost is 0.50 each. Cost of oranges = 25 oranges * 0.50/orange = 12.50 Apples: Joshua bought 40 apples, so he gets a 10% discount on the price of 0.65 each. Discounted price per apple = 0.65 - (0.65 * 10%) = 0.65 - 0.065 = 0.585 Cost of apples = 40 apples * 0.585/apple = 23.40 Bananas: Joshua bought 50 bananas, so he gets a 10% discount on the price of 0.25 each. Discounted price per banana = 0.25 - (0.25 * 10%) = 0.25 - 0.025 = 0.225 Cost of bananas = 50 bananas * 0.225/banana = 11.25 Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the fruits. Total cost = Cost of oranges + Cost of apples + Cost of bananas Total cost = 12.50 + 23.40 + 11.25 = 47.15 Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling all the fruits. Revenue from oranges = 25 oranges * 0.60/orange = 15.00 Revenue from apples = 40 apples * 0.75/apple = 30.00 Revenue from bananas = 50 bananas * 0.45/banana = 22.50 Total revenue = Revenue from oranges + Revenue from apples + Revenue from bananas Total revenue = 15.00 + 30.00 + 22.50 = 67.50 Finally, let's calculate the total profit. Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost Total profit = 67.50 - 47.15 = 20.35 To express the profit in cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 = 100 cents).

Since the interest is compounded half-yearly, the interest rate for each half-year period will be half of the annual interest rate, which is 10% per annum. Therefore, the half-yearly interest rate is 10% / 2 = 5%. The formula for compound interest is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest. P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money). r = the annual interest rate (in decimal form). n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year. t = the time the money is invested for, in years.

For these numbers to be in geometric progression, the square of the middle term must equal the product of the first and third terms: [ left(frac{k}{3}right)^2 = left(frac{k}{3} - dright) left(frac{k}{2} + dright) ] Expanding the right-hand side: [ frac{k^2}{9} = left(frac{k}{3} - dright) left(frac{k}{2} + dright) ] [ frac{k^2}{9} = frac{k}{3} cdot frac{k}{2} + frac{k}{3} cdot d - d cdot frac{k}{2} - d^2 ] [ frac{k^2}{9} = frac{k^2}{6} + frac{k}{6}d - d^2 ] 4. Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic in (d): [ frac{k^2}{9} = frac{k^2}{6} + frac{k}{6}d - d^2 ] [ d^2 + frac{k}{6}d - frac{k^2}{18} = 0 ] 5. Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula (d = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}), where (a = 1), (b = frac{k}{6}), and (c = -frac{k^2}{18}): [ d = frac{-frac{k}{6} pm sqrt{left(frac{k}{6}right)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot left(-frac{k^2}{18}right)}}{2 cdot 1} ] [ d = frac{-frac{k}{6} pm sqrt{frac{k^2}{36} + frac{4k^2}{18}}}{2} ] [ d = frac{-frac{k}{6} pm sqrt{frac{k^2}{36} + frac{2k^2}{9}}}{2} ] [ d = frac{-frac{k}{6} pm sqrt{frac{k^2}{36} + frac{8k^2}{36}}}{2} ] [ d = frac{-frac{k}{6} pm sqrt{frac{9k^2}{36}}}{2} ] [ d = frac{-frac{k}{6} pm frac{3k}{6}}{2} ] [ d = frac{-frac{k}{6} pm frac{k}{2}}{2} ] [ d = frac{-frac{k}{6} + frac{k}{2}}{2} quad text{or} quad d = frac{-frac{k}{6} - frac{k}{2}}{2} ] [ d = frac{frac{k}{3}}{2} = frac{k}{6} quad text{or} quad d = frac{-frac{2k}{3}}{2} = -frac{k}{3} ] 6. Therefore, the possible values for (d) are (frac{k}{6}) and (-frac{k}{3}). Substituting these back into the original arithmetic progression: - For (d = frac{k}{6}): [ frac{k}{3} - frac{k}{6}, frac{k}{3}, frac{k}{3} + frac{k}{6} implies frac{k}{6}, frac{k}{3}, frac{k}{2} ] - For (d = -frac{k}{3}): [ frac{k}{3} - left(-frac{k}{3}right), frac{k}{3}, frac{k}{3} + left(-frac{k}{3}right) implies frac{2k}{3}, frac{k}{3}, 0 ] The final answer is (boxed{left(frac{k}{6}, frac{k}{3}, frac{k}{2}right)}) or (boxed{left(frac{2k}{3}, frac{k}{3}, 0right)})."},{"instruction":"Given f(x)= begin{cases} 2^{x}3, & x>0 g(x), & x<0 end{cases} is an odd function, then f(g(2))= ______.","output":"Since f(x) is an odd function, we have g(-2)=f(-2)=-f(2)=-left(2^2-3right)=-1, then f(-1)=-f(1)=-left(2-3right)=1, thus, f(g(-2))=1, so the answer is boxed{1}.

The degree of a polynomial in terms of x and y is determined by the sum of the exponents of x and y in each term. For the polynomial to be cubic, the highest total degree of x and y must be 3. Looking at the first term, frac{1}{5}x^2y^{|m|}, the degree is 2 + |m| because x^2 contributes 2 to the degree and y^{|m|} contributes |m|. For this term to contribute to a cubic polynomial, we need 2 + |m| = 3.

However, this term does not influence the determination of m in terms of the degree of the polynomial but rather ensures the polynomial is in terms of y. Given |m| = 1, we now solve for m. Additionally, from the condition that the polynomial is a cubic binomial, we have another equation, m + 1 = 0, which directly gives us the value of m without considering the degree of the polynomial.

What is the minimum perimeter of the rectangle in centimeters (cm) before cutting?","output":"To find the minimum perimeter of the rectangle before cutting, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangle. We know that the width of the rectangle is 34 cm and that when we cut it into squares with a side of 4 cm, there are 2 cm left over. This means that the part of the width that is divisible by 4 cm is 34 cm - 2 cm = 32 cm. Since each square has a side of 4 cm, the number of squares that fit into the width is 32 cm / 4 cm = 8 squares. We also know that there are 24 squares in total. Since we have 8 squares along the width, we can find the number of squares along the length by dividing the total number of squares by the number of squares along the width: 24 squares / 8 squares = 3 squares. The length of the rectangle is therefore 3 squares * 4 cm/square = 12 cm. Now we have the dimensions of the rectangle: 34 cm (width) and 12 cm (length). The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2 * (length + width). So the minimum perimeter of the rectangle before cutting is: P = 2 * (12 cm + 34 cm) = 2 * 46 cm = 92 cm.

Match the shortest cloak to the shortest knight, the next shortest cloak to the next shortest knight, and so on up to the tallest knight who gets the longest cloak. 4. We can verify each knight's cloak remains too short through induction: - **Base Case**: The shortest knight gets the shortest cloak, which by definition is already too short. - **Inductive Step**: Suppose each knight up to the (k)-th tallest has a cloak too short. Now, consider the ( (k+1) )-th knight. Initially, each of these (k+1) knights experienced their own original cloaks as too short. By induction, each of the first (k) knights still has cloaks too short, and since the ( (k+1) )-th knight must be taller than the (k)-th, the next available cloak, which is at most the same length of the cloaks the previous (k) knights received, must be too short for the ( (k+1) )-th knight. 5. When we move the tallest knight from the lineup after ensuring they have the longest cloak, we're essentially reducing the problem size, removing one knight and one cloak from consideration while maintaining cloaks sorted by length. 6. Repeating this sorting and matching ensures at every step, no matter how many knights and cloaks we have left, the cloaks remain too short for the remaining knights. 7. This process iteratively leaves each knight their appropriately sorted cloak which, following the inductive argument, is too short. Conclusion: By arranging both the knights and cloaks \\"by height\\", we systematically ensure every knight will end up with a cloak that is too short for them. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Janet makes 20 per hour at work.

If a line intersects nodes marked 1, 2, and 3: - Nodes directly above and below the node colored 2 must be colored with a fourth color (let's denote it 4) due to the problem constraints. - Consequently, nodes directly above and below nodes colored 1 and 3 must alternate between the remaining colors. 5. **Formulating a contradiction:** Considering the vertical line through nodes with the color sequence, they must exhibit alternating pattern such as (1, 2, 3, 4 or 4, 3, 2, 1 etc.), but this means the vertical line has nodes with less than 4 colors. 6. **Resulting conclusion:** Since vertical and horizontal lines are analogous in infinite grids, they inevitably lead to a condition where a line contradictorily holds exactly 2 colors, violating the assumption.
