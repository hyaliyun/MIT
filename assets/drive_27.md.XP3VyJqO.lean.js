Simplify to solve for ( m ):          m cdot n = n(2n + 1 + frac{n + 1}{2}) = n left(2n + 1 + frac{n + 1}{2}right) = n left(2n + 1 + frac{n}{2} + frac{1}{2}right) = n left(2n + 1 + frac{n}{2} + frac{1}{2}right)      8. Since the total is:          m = 2n + 1 + frac{n + 1}{2} = frac{5n + 3}{2}          For ( m ) to be an integer, ( frac{5n + 3}{2} ) must be an integer.

We start with the given equation: [ x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 2x^2 y^2 + 2y^2 z^2 + 2z^2 x^2 + 24 ] 2. This equation can be factored as follows: [ (x + y + z)(x + y - z)(-x + y + z)(x - y + z) = -2^3 times 3 ] 3. Let's examine this factorization. The right-hand side of the equation is ( -8 times 3 = -24 ). 4. We observe that ( -24 = -2^3 times 3 ). Since 2 is a prime factor, at least one of ((x + y + z)), ((x + y - z)), ((-x + y + z)), ((x - y + z)) must be divisible by 2.  5. Furthermore, there are four factors on the left-hand side of the equation. The sum of any two of these factors would be even because the sum of odd numbers is even, and the sum of even numbers is also even. 6. However, if all these terms are integers and their sums are even, it forces each of the expressions ((x + y + z)), ((x + y - z)), ((-x + y + z)), ((x - y + z)) to be even themselves. This means each factor must be divisible by 2. 7. But if each factor on the left side of our original equation is divisible by 2, then ( (x + y + z)(x + y - z)(-x + y + z)(x - y + z) ) should be divisible by ( 2^4 = 16 ). 8. The right-hand side ( -24 = -2^3 times 3 ) is not divisible by 16, which means our assumption that ( x, y, z ) must be integers is inconsistent with the divisibility conditions imposed by ( -24 ).  9. Therefore, the equation ( x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 2x^2 y^2 + 2y^2 z^2 + 2z^2 x^2 + 24 ) has no integer solutions. # Conclusion: [ boxed{ text{No integer solutions} } ]"},{"instruction":"Consider all points with integer coordinates in the carthesian plane.

Step 1: Determine ( f(0) ) First, let's consider the condition for ( x = 0 ) and ( y = 0 ) in the first equation: [ f(0 cdot f(0)) cdot f(0) = f(0 + 0) = f(0) ] This simplifies to: [ f(0) cdot f(0) = f(0) implies f(0)^2 = f(0) ] The solutions to this equation are ( f(0) = 0 ) or ( f(0) = 1 ). However, from the third condition ( f(x) neq 0 ) for ( 0 leq x < 2 ), we know ( f(0) neq 0 ). Thus: [ f(0) = 1 ]  Step 2: Determine ( f(x) ) for ( x geq 2 ) Next, consider the first condition with ( y = 2 ): [ f(x cdot f(2)) cdot f(2) = f(x + 2) ] Since ( f(2) = 0 ) from the second condition, we have: [ f(x cdot 0) cdot 0 = f(x + 2) implies 0 = f(x + 2) ] This tells us that for any ( x geq 2 ): [ f(x) = 0 ]  Step 3: Determine ( f(x) ) for ( 0 < x < 2 ) Suppose ( 0 < x < 2 ). Then ( 0 < 2 - x < 2 ) must also hold.

Let's define the workshops as A, B, and C. There are the following possible distributions of workers: 1. (3, 3, 1) 2. (3, 2, 2) 3. (3, 2, 1) 4. (3, 1, 1) 5. (2, 2, 2) 6. (2, 2, 1) 7. (2, 1, 1) 8. (1, 1, 1) However, notice that distributions 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are actually impossible or unnecessary to consider due to our constraint of \\"no more than 3 in each workshop\\" and the fact that we need to allocate all 7 workers. Hence, the only feasible distributions we need to consider are: 1. (3, 3, 1) 2. (3, 2, 2) 5. (2, 2, 2) Now, let's calculate the number of allocations for each distribution: 1. For distribution (3, 3, 1): We have 7 choices for the one worker in the third workshop, and then binom{6}{3} ways to select three workers for the first workshop from the remaining six, after which the other three workers will go to the second workshop. The total number of ways will be: [ 7 times binom{6}{3} times 1 ] As there are 3 workshops, for the one with only one worker, there are 3 different choices (it could be A, B, or C). Hence, this number should be multiplied by 3. 2. For distribution (3, 2, 2): We have binom{7}{3} to select the first three workers for one workshop, then binom{4}{2} to select two workers for the second workshop from the remaining four workers, which leaves 2 workers for the third workshop. The total number of ways will be: [ binom{7}{3} times binom{4}{2} times 1 ] As before, because there are 3 ways to choose which workshop will have the three workers, we multiply this by 3. 3. For distribution (2, 2, 2): Since this distribution is allocating 2 workers to each workshop, one worker is not allocated. There are 7 ways to choose the worker not allocated. Given that the three pairs of two workers are indistinguishable among the three workshops, no further multiplication is necessary for different ordering of the workshops in this case. Combining these, the total number of possible allocations is: [ 3 times 7 times binom{6}{3} times 1 + 3 times binom{7}{3} times binom{4}{2} times 1 + 7 times 1 ] Now, we calculate each term: 1.

The total cost consists of the fixed cost and the variable cost (the cost to mold each handle). Let's denote the cost to mold each handle as C. Total Cost = Fixed Cost + (Number of Handles × Cost per Handle) Total Cost = 7640 + (1910 × C) Since the company breaks even, Total Revenue = Total Cost: 1910 × 4.60 = 7640 + (1910 × C) Now, we can solve for C: 8786 = 7640 + 1910C 8786 - 7640 = 1910C 1146 = 1910C C = 1146 / 1910 C = 0.60 Therefore, it costs boxed{0.60}  to mold each handle."},{"instruction":"Lisa has 12 friends and wants to give each friend at least one marble, with no two friends receiving the same number of marbles.

The discriminant Delta, of this quadratic equation is: Delta = (4km_1)^2 - 4(2m_1^2 - 2)(1 + 2k^2) = 8(1 + 2k^2 - m_1^2) > 0 Thus, the sum of the roots is: x_1 + x_2 = -frac{4km_1}{1 + 2k^2} And the product of the roots is: x_1x_2 = frac{2m_1^2 - 2}{1 + 2k^2} Therefore, the length |AB| is given by: |AB| = sqrt{1 + k^2}|x_1 - x_2| = sqrt{1 + k^2} sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2} = 2sqrt{2}frac{sqrt{1 + k^2} cdot sqrt{2k^2 - m_1^2 + 1}}{1 + 2k^2} Similarly, the length |CD| is: |CD| = 2sqrt{2} frac{sqrt{1 + k^2} cdot sqrt{2k^2 - m_2^2 + 1}}{1 + 2k^2} Since |AB| = |CD|, it follows that: 2sqrt{2} frac{sqrt{1 + k^2} cdot sqrt{2k^2 - m_1^2 + 1}}{1 + 2k^2} = 2sqrt{2} frac{sqrt{1 + k^2} cdot sqrt{2k^2 - m_2^2 + 1}}{1 + 2k^2} This gives us m_1^2 = m_2^2.

First, let's determine the possible positions for the 3 lights. Since only 2 of the 3 lights are adjacent, we have the following scenarios for their positions: - The first and second lights are adjacent, and the third light is separate. - The second and third lights are adjacent, and the first light is separate. For the first scenario, the third light can be in any of the remaining 4 positions not adjacent to the first two lights. For the second scenario, the first light can be in any of the 4 positions not adjacent to the second and third lights. Therefore, there are a total of 4 + 4 = 8 possible arrangements for the positions of the lights. Next, consider the color choices. Each of the 3 lights can be red, yellow, or blue, giving us 3 times 3 times 3 = 27 color combinations for each arrangement of lights. Multiplying the number of arrangements by the number of color combinations gives the total number of different signals that can be displayed: 8 times 27 = 216. However, the solution provided is 324.

Let us extend the segment AP beyond point P and mark a point Q such that PQ = PB.    Since (triangle BPQ) is isosceles, we have:    [    angle BQA = frac{180^circ - angle BPQ}{2} = frac{180^circ - alpha}{2}    ] 2. **Step 2: Understanding the Geometrical Implication**      Hence, point Q lies on the arc of the circle that subtends an angle ( frac{180^circ - alpha}{2} ) at B.

A super-integer is an infinite sequence of decimal digits, and the product of two super-integers is defined as taking the last ( n ) digits of the product of the last ( n ) digits of the two super-integers. 2. **Working in the Ring (mathbb{Z}_2 times mathbb{Z}_5):**    Consider the ring (mathbb{Z}_2 times mathbb{Z}_5), which is the product of the rings of 2-adic and 5-adic integers. In this ring, we are looking for elements (x) and (y) such that (xy = 0) but neither (x) nor (y) is zero. 3. **Finding Non-Trivial Solutions:**    In (mathbb{Z}_2 times mathbb{Z}_5), consider the elements ((0, 1)) and ((1, 0)). Their product is:    [    (0, 1) cdot (1, 0) = (0 cdot 1, 1 cdot 0) = (0, 0)    ]    This shows that the product is zero, but neither ((0, 1)) nor ((1, 0)) is zero. 4. **Constructing Super-Integers:**    We need to construct super-integers (x) and (y) such that:    [    x equiv 1 pmod{5^n} quad text{and} quad x equiv 0 pmod{2^n}    ]    [    y equiv 0 pmod{5^n} quad text{and} quad y equiv 1 pmod{2^n}    ]    These congruences ensure that (x) and (y) are non-zero super-integers and their product modulo (10^n) is zero for all (n). 5. **Uniqueness and Consistency:**    The sequences (x) and (y) are uniquely determined modulo (10^n).

Given (BD = DP), we need to prove that (angle ODQ = 90^circ). 2. **Drop Perpendiculars**:    Drop perpendiculars (OM) from (O) to (BC), (QX) from (Q) to (BC), and (QY) from (Q) to (AD). 3. **Compute (DM)**:    Notice that:    [    2DM = BD + DP - BM + DM - (BM - DM) = BD + DP - (BM - DM)    ]    Since (BD = DP), rewiring this:    [    2DM = DP - (CM - DM)    ]    Since (P) is symmetrical around (D) (i.e., (BD = DP)), we see that (PD = PC). 4. **Circumradius and Heights Relationship**:    It's known in triangle geometry that:    [    2OM = AH    ]    This relationship arises from the fact that (O) is the circumcentre and (H) is the orthocentre in the configuration set by (DM). 5. **Angle Equivalency**:    Consider the angles inside triangles (CPQ) and (HAQ):    [    angle CPQ = angle DBH = angle HAQ    ]    This tells us triangles (CPQ) and (HAQ) are similar by Angle-Angle similarity. 6. **Similarity of Smaller Triangles**:    From the above similarity, it's directly inferred that smaller triangles (XPQ) and (YAQ) are also similar. Consequently:    [    frac{QX}{DX} = frac{QX}{QY} = frac{PC}{AH} = frac{DM}{OM}    ]    This implies that the triangles (DXQ) and (OMD) are similar. 7. **Conclude Perpendicularity**:    Due to the similarity of triangles (DXQ) and (OMD), the following relationship holds:    [    angle ODQ = 90^circ    ] Thus, we have proved that (boxed{angle ODQ = 90^circ})."},{"instruction":"1+i+i^2+i^3= （ ） A: 1 B: 0 C: i D: 1","output":"**Answer:** By using i^2=-1 and the rules of complex number operations, we can derive the answer.

Since (P(x) geq 0) for all real (x), (P) necessarily has the form of a product of irreducible polynomials of degree 2 with negative discriminant and of the form ((x-a)^{2k}).

Specifically:    [    x^2 + b_i x + c_i = left(x + frac{b_i}{2}right)^2 + left(c_i - frac{b_i^2}{4}right) = left(x + frac{b_i}{2}right)^2 + k_i^2,    ]    where (k_i^2 = c_i - frac{b_i^2}{4} > 0). Therefore, we can define:    [    Q_i(x) = x + frac{b_i}{2}, quad R_i(x) = k_i,    ]    such that:    [    x^2 + b_i x + c_i = Q_i^2(x) + R_i^2.    ] 4. **Expressing the Entire Polynomial as Sum of Squares:**    Next, we aggregate all these individual sum-of-squares representations.

The function f(x) = 2^x(x-a) is continuous, and since x is a positive number, 2^x is always greater than 0. We are interested in finding the values of a for which there exists at least one positive x satisfying the inequality. We observe that when x approaches 0, 2^x approaches 1 and (x-a) approaches -a, so 2^x(x-a) approaches -a. This means that for extremely small positive x, if a is negative, then 2^x(x-a) will be positive but could be less than 1. When x becomes very large, 2^x grows exponentially, so no matter what a is, eventually 2^x(x-a) will exceed 1. From the above analysis, we understand that 2^x(x-a) can only be less than 1 for some positive x if the function dips below 1. For this to happen, there must be a local maximum of f(x) less than 1. To find the local maximum, we take the derivative of f(x) and set it equal to zero:  f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(2^x(x-a)) = 2^x ln(2)(x-a) + 2^x.  Setting f'(x) = 0, we get:  2^x ln(2)(x-a) + 2^x = 0,   2^x(ln(2)(x-a) + 1) = 0.  Since 2^x can never be zero for positive x, we require:  ln(2)(x-a) + 1 = 0,   x-a = -frac{1}{ln(2)},   a = x + frac{1}{ln(2)}.  This shows that for any chosen x, there is an a that makes the derivative zero, which is the x coordinate of the local maximum of f(x). Another constraint is that the local maximum value itself should be less than 1:  f(x) = 2^x(x-a) < 1.  Now, we plug in a = x + frac{1}{ln(2)} into the original inequality and check for the maximum function value:  2^xleft(x-left(x + frac{1}{ln(2)}right)right) < 1,   2^xleft(-frac{1}{ln(2)}right) < 1,   -2^x < ln(2),   2^x > -ln(2).  Since 2^x is always positive and ln(2) is positive, this inequality will always hold true. Therefore, for every x, there is an a that ensures the original inequality holds. Since there is no upper limit on x, there is no upper limit on a. The only restriction comes from the initial condition that -a must be positive when x approaches 0, meaning a must be negative. Thus, a can take any value greater than -1, so the range of values for a is:  boxed{(-1, +infty)}."},{"instruction":"Three trains are moving in the same direction on parallel tracks.

Given this information, find the length of Train A.","output":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the relative speed between the trains and use the time it takes for Train A to pass the other trains to find its length. First, let's find the relative speed between Train A and Train B. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of Train B from the speed of Train A: Relative speed (A relative to B) = Speed of Train A - Speed of Train B Relative speed (A relative to B) = 72 kmph - 36 kmph Relative speed (A relative to B) = 36 kmph Now, we need to convert this relative speed from kmph to m/s by multiplying by 5/18 (since 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s): Relative speed (A relative to B) in m/s = 36 kmph * (5/18) Relative speed (A relative to B) in m/s = 10 m/s Train A takes 18 seconds to fully pass Train B. The distance covered by Train A in this time is equal to the length of Train A (since Train B is effectively stationary relative to Train A's speed). So, we can calculate the length of Train A (L_A) as follows: L_A = Relative speed (A relative to B) in m/s * Time to pass Train B L_A = 10 m/s * 18 s L_A = 180 meters Therefore, the length of Train A is 180 meters. We can also verify this by calculating the relative speed between Train A and Train C and using the time it takes for Train A to pass Train C: Relative speed (A relative to C) = Speed of Train A - Speed of Train C Relative speed (A relative to C) = 72 kmph - 54 kmph Relative speed (A relative to C) = 18 kmph Converting this relative speed to m/s: Relative speed (A relative to C) in m/s = 18 kmph * (5/18) Relative speed (A relative to C) in m/s = 5 m/s Train A takes 36 seconds to fully pass Train C.

In the second week, the store sells to twice as many customers as in the first week, so that's 35 * 2 = 70 customers. Therefore, Julio earns 70 * 1 = 70 from commissions. Now, let's calculate Julio's total earnings from commissions for the first two weeks: 35 (first week) + 70 (second week) = 105. Julio's total earnings for the three weeks are 760, which includes his salary and bonus. So, let's subtract his salary and bonus from the total earnings to find out how much he earned from commissions in the third week: 760 (total earnings) - 500 (salary) - 50 (bonus) = 210 from commissions. We already know he earned 105 from commissions in the first two weeks, so let's subtract that to find out the commissions from the third week: 210 (total commissions) - 105 (commissions from first two weeks) = 105 from commissions in the third week. Since Julio earns 1 commission per customer, the number of customers in the third week is equal to the amount he earned from commissions that week: 105 (commissions from third week) / 1 (commission per customer) = 105 customers in the third week. Now, let's find the ratio of the number of customers in the third week to the number of customers in the first week: Number of customers in the third week / Number of customers in the first week = 105 / 35 = 3.

First, let's analyze the given conditions to understand the signs of x, y, and z. 1. Since x > y > z, we can infer that if we multiply each term by 3, we get 3x > 3y > 3z. Adding these inequalities gives us 3x > x + y + z. Given that x + y + z = 0, we can rewrite this as 3x > 0 Rightarrow x > 0. 2.

For Bank A (Simple Interest): Simple interest (SI) for 5 years is one-fifth of the sum, so SI = P/5. The formula for simple interest is: SI = P * R * T / 100 where R is the rate of interest per annum and T is the time in years. Given T = 5 years, we can substitute the values into the formula: P/5 = P * R * 5 / 100 1/5 = R * 5 / 100 R = (1/5) * (100/5) R = 20/5 R = 4% So, the rate of interest per annum for Bank A is 4%. For Bank B (Compound Interest): Compound interest (CI) for 5 years is one-fourth of the sum, so CI = P/4. The formula for compound interest compounded semi-annually is: A = P * (1 + r/2)^(2n) where A is the amount after n years, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years. Given n = 5 years, we can substitute the values into the formula: A = P + P/4 = 5P/4 5P/4 = P * (1 + r/2)^(2*5) 5/4 = (1 + r/2)^10 Now we need to solve for r. Let's take the 10th root of both sides to remove the exponent: (5/4)^(1/10) = 1 + r/2 Now we solve for r: (5/4)^(1/10) - 1 = r/2 r = 2 * [(5/4)^(1/10) - 1] To find the 10th root of 5/4, we can use a calculator: (5/4)^(1/10) ≈ 1.0185 Now we substitute this value into the equation for r: r = 2 * [1.0185 - 1] r = 2 * 0.0185 r ≈ 0.037 To express r as a percentage, we multiply by 100: r ≈ 0.037 * 100 r ≈ 3.7% So, the rate of interest per annum for Bank B, compounded semi-annually, is approximately boxed{3.7%} ."},{"instruction":"Equal fractions.

The change in sales volume can be represented as (300 - 10(x - 44)), which simplifies to: [ begin{align*} y &= 300 - 10(x - 44)  &= 300 - 10x + 440  &= -10x + 740 end{align*} ] Thus, the functional relationship between (y) and (x) is (y = -10x + 740), with the range of (x) being (44 leqslant x leqslant 52), since the selling price is set not lower than 44 yuan and not higher than 52 yuan.

The vertex form shows that the maximum occurs at (x = 57), but since (x) must be within (44 leqslant x leqslant 52), the closest value to 57 within this range is (x = 52). At (x = 52), the maximum profit (w) is calculated as: [ w = -10(52 - 57)^2 + 2890 = 2640 ] Therefore, the selling price per souvenir that maximizes the daily profit is 52 yuan, and the maximum profit is: [ boxed{2640 , text{yuan}} ]"},{"instruction":"f the function y = f(x) is the inverse function of y = a^x (a > 0 and a neq 1), and f(2) = 1, then f(x) = boxed{log_{a}x}.","output":"Given that y = f(x) is the inverse function of y = a^x, we know that f(x) and a^x are inverse functions of each other.

Here’s the step-by-step explanation: 1. **Initial Problem Setup:**    The initial fraction is (frac{a}{b}).     2. **Operation to be Performed:**    We want to multiply both the numerator and the denominator of this fraction by the expression (x - m). After multiplication, the fraction becomes:    [    frac{a(x - m)}{b(x - m)}    ]    3. **Condition for Validity:**    For the fraction to remain valid, the denominator must be non-zero. This means:    [    b(x - m) neq 0    ] 4. **Solve for the Condition:**    To find the values of (x) that satisfy this condition, we set up the inequality:    [    x - m neq 0    ]    Therefore:    [    x neq m    ] # Conclusion: The fraction can be multiplied by (x - m) as long as (x) does not equal (m).

Rearrange the equation to solve for k: k = frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{left( frac{1}{2} right)^{alpha}}. Since the problem indicates that the graph passes through this specific point, we know that at x = frac{1}{2}, the function must output frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. For this to be true, our expression must simplify such that k would end up being a constant not dependent on alpha, in other words, a specific number. In this case, since the fraction frac{sqrt{2}}{2} is equivalent to (frac{1}{2})^{frac{1}{2}}, we can make the connection that: (frac{1}{2})^{frac{1}{2}} = k left( frac{1}{2} right)^{alpha}. Therefore, we can clearly see that k must be 1 to satisfy this equation, since 1 cdot (frac{1}{2})^{alpha} = (frac{1}{2})^{alpha}. Hence: k = 1.  Also, comparing the left and right side of the equation, we get alpha = frac{1}{2}.  Adding the values of k and alpha together, we find: k + alpha = 1 + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}.

This implies that vertices must be of the types described, due to the symmetry and angle requirements of an equilateral triangle. 4. **Edge-End Coloring**:    We color each edge-end either green or blue based on their association with the vertex type:    - An edge-end is colored **green** if it touches a Type B vertex along the 180^{circ} angle.    - Otherwise, the edge-end is colored **blue**. 5. **Count of Type A Vertices**:    The large equilateral triangle has exactly 3 vertices, which are Type A by default (the three corners of the original large triangle). 6. **Edge-End Distribution**:    Let's denote:    - x: Number of Type B vertices    - y: Number of Type C vertices    Based on the vertex types, we calculate:    - Number of blue ends:     [    6 + 2x + 6y    ]    - Number of green ends:     [    2x    ] 7. **Edge-End Analysis**:    Since each Type A vertex contributes 6 blue ends and all edges connected to them end in green ends:    - We have (6) blue ends at Type A vertices' ends, and these have matching green ends. 8. **More Blue Ends than Green Ends**:    Clearly, there are more blue ends than green ends:    [    6 + 2x + 6y > 2x    ]    Some of the blue ends must connect to other blue ends, because:    [    6(1+y) > 0 implies text{(a surplus of blue ends not matching with green ends)}    ] 9. **Double Blue-Ended Edge Conclusion**:    Since not all blue ends can be connected to green ends, there must exist an edge with both ends being blue. Thus, the endpoints of this edge are neither Type A vertices. 10. **Shared Side of Two Triangles**:    The edge with both blue-ended connections implies that it forms a side shared by two adjacent equilateral triangles. Consequently, these two triangles must be identical in size. 11. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, it is concluded that among the partitioned smaller equilateral triangles, there must exist at least two triangles that are the same size.

This implies:      - Additional perimeter added is twice the length of the smaller rectangle if its lengths are along the edge of the larger rectangle.    - Thus, we calculate the maximum increased perimeter as follows:      [      P_{text{max}} = P_{text{original}} + 2 times text{length of the cut-out rectangle}      ]    - The length of the cut-out rectangle is 10 cm:      [      P_{text{max}} = 72 , text{cm} + 2 times 10 , text{cm} = 72 , text{cm} + 20 , text{cm} = 92 , text{cm}      ] 4. **Conclusion:**    [    boxed{C}    ]"},{"instruction":"Given the functions f(x) = 3^x  1 and g(x) = x^2  2x  1, if there exist real numbers a and b such that f(a) = g(b), then the range of values for b is.","output":"The function f(x) = 3^x - 1 has a range of (-1, +infty).

This parallelism holds because, in a homothety, lines through corresponding points remain parallel. 3. **Construct parallel lines through centers:**    Draw two parallel lines l_{1} and l_{2} through the centers Q_{1} and O_{2}, respectively. These lines are chosen such that each line passes through the corresponding points on each circle. Specifically, l_{1} intersects the inner circle omega_{1} at points A_{1} and B_{1}, while l_{2} intersects the outer circle omega_{2} at points A_{2} and B_{2}. 4. **Find the intersection of diameter lines:**    Consider the points of intersection of lines A_{1}A_{2} and B_{1}B_{2}.

This follows directly from the properties of homothety: all points on the inner circle are mapped to points on the outer circle by scaling distances from O by the same ratio. Therefore, the point O such that one circle is a homothety of the other with respect to O is found as described above.

We need to show that there are at least 500 friendly integers in the set {1, 2, ldots, 2012}. 2. Consider the equation (m^2 + n)(n^2 + m) = a(m - n)^3. 3. Let us take m = 2n + 1. Substituting m = 2n + 1 into the equation, we get:    [    ((2n+1)^2 + n)(n^2 + (2n+1)) = a((2n+1) - n)^3    ] 4.

Consider the equation (m^2 + n)(n^2 + m) = 2(m - n)^3. 3. We will show that this equation has no positive integer solutions. 4. First, note that m > n. Taking the equation modulo m, we get:    [    m mid 3n^3    ] 5. Also, m^2 + n > (m - n)^2, so we must have:    [    n^2 + m < 2(m - n)    ]    [    m geq (n + 1)^2    ] 6. Expanding the original equation:    [    m^3 + n^3 + m^2n^2 + mn = 2m^3 - 6m^2n + 6mn^2 - 2n^3    ] 7. Rearranging the terms, we obtain:    [    m^3 - 3n^3 = m^2n^2 + 6m^2n - 6mn^2 + mn    ]    [    m^3 - 3n^3 - 5m^2n + 7mn^2 = mn(mn + m + n + 1)    ] 8. This can be factored as:    [    mn(m + 1)(n + 1) = (m - n)^2(m - 3n)    ] 9. **Lemma:** m mid 3n^2.    - **Proof:** Let p be any prime dividing m. If v_p(m) leq v_p(3n^2) for all p, then we are done.    - We know that m mid 3n^3, so if p nmid n, then v_p(3n^2) = v_p(3n^3) geq v_p(m), so assume p mid n as well.    - Since we have:      [      mn(m + 1)(n + 1) = (m - n)^2(m - 3n)      ]      then:      [      v_p(mn(m + 1)(n + 1)) = v_p((m - n)^2(m - 3n))      ]      but since p mid m, n, p nmid m + 1, n + 1, so this simplifies to:      [      v_p(mn) = v_p((m - n)^2(m - 3n))      ]      or equivalently:      [      v_p(m) + v_p(n) = 2v_p(m - n) + v_p(m - 3n)      ]      If v_p(m) leq v_p(n), then v_p(m) leq v_p(3n^2) = 2v_p(n) + v_p(3), so assume v_p(m) > v_p(n).    - We now consider two cases:      - **Case 1: p ne 3**        - Since v_p(m) > v_p(n), we have v_p(m - n) = v_p(m - 3n) = v_p(n), so:          [          v_p(m) + v_p(n) = 2v_p(m - n) + v_p(m - 3n) = 3v_p(n)          ]          hence v_p(m) = 2v_p(n), and v_p(m) < v_p(3n^2), as desired.      - **Case 2: p = 3**        - If v_3(m) = v_3(n) + 1, then v_3(m) < v_3(3n^2) = 2v_3(n) + 1, so assume v_3(m) > v_3(n) + 1.        - Then, v_3(m - n) = v_3(n) and v_3(m - 3n) = v_3(n) + 1, so:          [          v_3(m) + v_3(n) = 2v_3(m - n) + v_3(m - 3n) = 3v_3(n) + 1          ]          hence we obtain v_3(m) = 2v_3(n) + 1, and v_3(m) leq v_3(3n^2), as desired. 10. Therefore, we have v_p(m) leq v_p(3n^2) for all p mid m, so it follows that m mid 3n^2. 11. By the Lemma, we have m mid 3n^2, and we also know that m geq (n + 1)^2, so either m = 3n^2 or m = frac{3n^2}{2}. 12. We now consider these cases separately:     - **Case 1: m = 3n^2**       - Substituting this into our original equation gives us:         [         (9n^4 + n)(4n^2) = 2(3n^2 - n)^3         ]       - Dividing both sides by 2n^3 yields:         [         2(9n^3 + 1) = (3n - 1)^3         ]       - Expanding and rearranging terms, we obtain:         [         9n^3 - 27n^2 + 9n - 3 = 0         ]       - Taking this equation modulo 9, we see that this has no integer solutions.     - **Case 2: m = frac{3n^2}{2}**       - Substituting this into our original equation gives us:         [         left(frac{9n^4}{4} + nright)left(frac{5n^2}{2}right) = 2left(frac{3n^2}{2} - nright)^3         ]       - Dividing both sides by 2n^3 yields:         [         frac{5}{4}left(frac{9n^3}{4} + 1right) = left(frac{3n}{2} - 1right)^3         ]       - Expanding and rearranging terms, we obtain:         [         frac{9n^3}{16} - frac{27n^2}{4} + frac{9n}{2} - frac{9}{4} = 0         ]       - Multiplying through by frac{16}{9} gives us:         [         n^3 - 12n^2 + 8n - 4 = 0         ]       - By the rational root theorem, we can verify that this equation also has no integer solutions. 13. Thus, the equation (m^2 + n)(n^2 + m) = 2(m - n)^3 has no solutions over positive integers, so we conclude a = 2 is not friendly. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given any triangle ( triangle ABC ), construct such a line that intersects the triangle such that the distance from point ( A ) to the line is equal to the sum of the distances from points ( B ) and ( C ) to the line.

We are asked to find the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. Let's denote: - The radii of the two original spheres as r_1 and r_2, with r_1 + r_2 = 7. - The centers of the spheres as O_1 and O_2. Because the third sphere touches both of the original spheres externally, we can write the distances from the center of this third sphere to the centers of the original spheres as O_AO_1 and O_AO_2. Let O_A = A, where the center of the third sphere is located. The distance relations: 1. From point A (the center of the third sphere) to O_1 and O_2:     [     AO_1 = r_1 + 8     ]     [     AO_2 = r_2 + 8     ] Given that the distance between O_1 and O_2 is 17, we use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle AO_1O_2: 2. Since the distance between O_1 and O_2 is:     [     O_1O_2 = 17     ] We know r_1 + r_2 = 7. Let’s substitute r_1 = 7 - r_2 into the Pythagorean theorem:     [     (r_1 + 8)^2 + (r_2 + 8)^2 = 17^2     ] Substitute r_1 = 7 - r_2 into the equation:     [     ((7 - r_2) + 8)^2 + (r_2 + 8)^2 = 17^2     ] Simplify and solve for r_2:     [     (15 - r_2)^2 + (r_2 + 8)^2 = 289     ] Expand and combine like terms:     [     (225 - 30r_2 + r_2^2) + (64 + 16r_2 + r_2^2) = 289     ]     [     2r_2^2 - 14r_2 + 289 = 289     ]     [     2r_2^2 - 14r_2 = 0     ]     [     r_2(2r_2 - 14) = 0     ] Thus, r_2 = 0 or r_2 = 7. If r_2 = 0 or r_2 = 7, either leads to a contradiction in the context of geometrical configuration: This tells us that the distance measurements and given constraints distribute radii to satisfy touching conditions.

The key is to count the number of distinct permutations of the vertices that can be seen from different viewpoints. 1. **Vertices and Edges of the Polygon**:    - A convex ( n )-gon has ( n ) vertices and ( n ) edges. 2. **Counting Distinct Permutations**:    - When an observer stands outside the polygon, they can see the vertices in a specific order.

This gives ( 2 binom{n}{4} ) additional vertices.    - Together with the ( n ) vertices of the polygon and the point at infinity, this gives:      [      V = 2 binom{n}{4} + n + 1      ]    - Any pair of vertices of the polygon define two edges outside the polygon.

According to the given male to female ratio of 1:2, we can express the number of female members as 2M (since there are twice as many female members as male members). The total number of tickets sold by the male members can be represented as M * w, where w is the average number of tickets sold by the male members. The total number of tickets sold by the female members can be represented as F * 70, since the average number of tickets sold by female members is given as 70. The total number of tickets sold by all members is the sum of the tickets sold by male and female members, which can be represented as M * w + F * 70. The total number of members is M + F, and the overall average number of tickets sold per member is given as 66. Therefore, the total number of tickets sold by all members can also be represented as (M + F) * 66. Since the total number of tickets sold must be the same regardless of how we calculate it, we can set the two expressions equal to each other: M * w + F * 70 = (M + F) * 66 Now, we can substitute F with 2M (from the male to female ratio): M * w + 2M * 70 = (M + 2M) * 66 Simplify the equation: M * w + 140M = 3M * 66 M * w + 140M = 198M Now, we can solve for w (the average number of tickets sold by the male members): M * w = 198M - 140M M * w = 58M Divide both sides by M to isolate w: w = 58 Therefore, the average number of tickets sold by the male members of the association is boxed{58} ."},{"instruction":"An equilateral triangle is divided into ( n^2 ) identical equilateral triangles.

We will have black and white triangles in an alternating pattern. 2. **Calculate the Number of Black and White Triangles:**    - The number of black triangles on each successive row increases as 1, 2, 3, ..., up to ( n ). Thus, the total number of black triangles is:    [    sum_{k=1}^n k = frac{n(n+1)}{2}    ]    - Similarly, the number of white triangles also follows a similar pattern but stops at ( n-1 ):    [    sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = frac{n(n-1)}{2}    ] 3. **Comparing Numbers of Black and White Triangles:**    It is evident from the sums calculated that from a total of ( n^2 ) triangles:    [    frac{n(n+1)}{2} text{ (black triangles) and } frac{n(n-1)}{2} text{ (white triangles)}    ]    The difference between the number of black and white triangles in general will be one, i.e.,     [    frac{n(n+1)}{2} - frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n    ] 4. **Numbering of Triangles:**    It is also given that triangles with consecutive numbering have shared sides. Hence, if we only label ( m ) triangles, black triangles overlap with white ones or interchanged recursively maintaining the adjacent side property, ensuring the number of triangles:    [    m leq n(n-1) + 1    ]    This is because only one extra black triangle can exist. 5. **Concluding Bound:**    To finalize the proof, remembering that the total must encompass black and white triangles in an alternating seam pattern, the numbering consecutively can only overplay to maximum covered bounds by a single integer difference.    Hence:    [    m leq n^2 - n + 1    ] This brings us to the desired conclusion that: [ m leq n^2 - n + 1 ] Thus ending our proof.

By assumption, ( f(n) > n ).    - Inductive step: Assume ( f^k(n) > f^{k-1}(n) ) for some ( k ). Then, ( f^{k+1}(n) = f(f^k(n)) ).

Therefore, there must exist ( k, l in mathbb{N} ) such that ( a_k = a_l ) with ( k neq l ). 6. **Injectivity Contradiction**: By the injectivity of ( f ), if ( a_k = a_l ), then ( f^{k-l}(n) = n ). This implies that ( a_{k-l-1} = a_1 ), which contradicts the strict monotonicity of the sequence ( (a_k) ). 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our assumption that ( f(n) > n ) must be false.

What is the minimum number of participants in the tournament?","output":"We are given that the winner of a round-robin ping-pong championship won more than 68% and less than 69% of their matches. We need to determine the minimum number of participants in the championship. 1. **Reflection on the Problem**:         In a round-robin tournament with ( k+1 ) participants, each participant plays ( k ) matches. Therefore, the total number of matches ( k+1 ) participants play is ( k ), and each participant, including the winner, plays ( k ) matches. 2. **Mathematical Representation**:    Let's denote the number of matches won by the winner by ( n ). According to the problem, we have:    [    0.68k < n < 0.69k    ] 3. **Bounds on Lost Matches**:        The number of matches lost by the winner is ( k - n ). We can establish bounds for ( k - n ) based on the given condition:    [    0.68k < n < 0.69k implies k - 0.69k < k - n < k - 0.68k    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    0.31k < k - n < 0.32k    ] 4. **Involving Double of Lost Matches**:    Multiply the above inequality by 2:    [    0.62k < 2(k - n) < 0.64k    ] 5. **Combining Inequalities**:        We already have:    [    0.68k < n < 0.69k    ]    and    [    0.62k < 2(k - n) < 0.64k    ]    Combining these inequalities, we get:    [    0.62k < 2(k - n) < 0.64k < 0.68k < n < 0.69k    ] 6. **Integral Constraints**:    As ( 2(k - n) ) and ( n ) must be distinct integers, the interval ( 0.62k ) to ( 0.69k ) must contain at least two integers. This implies:    [    0.69k - 0.62k > 1    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    0.07k > 1 implies k > frac{1}{0.07} = frac{100}{7} approx 14.2857    ]    Hence, ( k ) must be at least 15:    [    k geq 15    ] 7. **Verification for ( k = 15 )**:        For ( k = 15 ):    [    0.68 times 15 = 10.2 quad text{and} quad 0.69 times 15 = 10.35    ]    Since 10.2 and 10.35 are not integers, ( k = 15 ) does not satisfy the condition. 8. **Verification for ( k = 16 )**:        For ( k = 16 ):    [    0.68 times 16 = 10.88 quad text{and} quad 0.69 times 16 = 11.04    ]    Since 11 is an integer and lies between 10.88 and 11.04, for ( k = 16 ) the number of participants ( k+1 = 17 ) is feasible. 9. **Constructing the Tournament**:        Let's assign the winner ( V ). We can construct groups as follows:    - The remaining 15 participants are divided into one group of 6 and two groups of 5.    - ( V ) wins against the members of the group of 6 and one group of 5, totaling 11 wins.    - ( V ) loses to the remaining group of 5, totaling 5 losses.    - Each group of 5 wins against the group members who beat ( V ), and loses to those who ( V ) beat.    This confirms that no participant other than ( V ) will have fewer than 6 losses, ensuring ( V )'s victory. # Conclusion: The minimum number of participants required for the tournament to satisfy the given conditions is: [ boxed{17} ]"},{"instruction":"f there are n small rectangles in the frequency distribution histogram of a sample, and the area of one small rectangle in the middle is equal to the sum of the areas of the remaining n1 small rectangles, with a sample size of 160, then the frequency of the middle group is: A: 32 B: 20 C: 40 D: 25","output":"Let the area of the middle rectangle be A.

However, we are given that the area of one middle rectangle is equal to the sum of remaining n-1 rectangles. For the frequency (area) of the middle group to be maximal with respect to the others, it must be the case that n-1 rectangles represent the smallest individual area that when combined equal the area of the single middle rectangle. The largest possible value for A among the remaining options that doesn't exceed the total (160) and leaves the possibility for the smallest areas for other n-1 rectangles is option A, 32. This is because if A = 32, there are 5 rectangles in total (1 middle and 4 others), fulfilling the problem's condition that the middle's area is equal to the sum of the areas of the other 4 rectangles.

Prove that exactly one of its edge lengths is a prime number of the form (2^k  1).","output":"Let's denote the edges of the rectangular prism by ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ), where these lengths are primes. The surface area of the rectangular prism is given to be a power of a prime number. 1. **Surface Area Expression**:    The formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism is:    [    S = 2(ab + bc + ca)    ]    Given that this surface area ( S ) is a power of a prime, we can write:    [    2(ab + bc + ca) = p^n quad (p text{ prime, } n geq 1 text{ integer})    ] 2. **Divisibility Condition**:    Since ( 2 ) divides ( p^n ), the only prime number ( p ) that could satisfy this is ( p = 2 ). Thus:    [    2(ab + bc + ca) = 2^n    ]    Simplifying by dividing both sides by 2, we get:    [    ab + bc + ca = 2^{n-1}    ] 3. **Parity Consideration**:    ( ab + bc + ca ) must be greater than 1 and even. Consider that ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are all prime numbers, meaning each can be either the prime number 2 or an odd prime number. For the sum ( ab + bc + ca ) to be even, at least two of the terms must be even, which implies that at least two of ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) must be the prime number 2. Let's assume without loss of generality that ( a = 2 ) and ( b = 2 ). 4. **Solving for ( c )**:    Now, substituting ( a ) and ( b ) as 2, we get:    [    2 cdot 2 + 2 cdot c + 2 cdot c = 2^{n-1}    ]    Simplifying the left side, we have:    [    4 + 4c = 2^{n-1}    ]    Let’s isolate ( c ) by subtracting 4 from both sides:    [    4c = 2^{n-1} - 4    ]    Dividing throughout by 4:    [    c = frac{2^{n-1} - 4}{4} = 2^{n-3} - 1    ]    Thus, ( c ) expresses ( 2^{n-3} - 1 ) which must be prime.    Therefore, ( n - 3 > 0 ) implies ( n > 3 ). 5. **Special Case Verification**:    If we choose ( n = 6 ), then:    [    c = 2^{6-3} - 1 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7    ]    Therefore, when ( a = b = 2 ) and ( c = 7 ), the surface area becomes:    [    2(2 cdot 2 + 2 cdot 7 + 7 cdot 2) = 2(4 + 14 + 14) = 2 times 32 = 64    ]    ( 64 = 2^6 ), which indeed is a power of a prime number. **Conclusion:** We have shown that for a rectangular prism with edge lengths as prime numbers and a surface area that is a power of a prime, two of the edge lengths must be 2 and the third edge length must be of the form ( 2^k - 1 ).

Therefore, we assume ( n > 2 ). 2. **Partition Assumption:**    - Let the partition be ( A_1 cup A_2 cup ... cup A_n ). 3. **Preliminary Reasoning:**    - Suppose ( a, b, ) and ( c ) (not necessarily distinct) belong to the same subset ( A_1 ). 4. **Case Analysis: Assume different subsets for sums:**    - Suppose ( a+b ) belongs to ( A_2 ) and ( a+c ) belongs to ( A_3 ). 5. **Contradiction via Summation:**    - Take any elements ( a_4 in A_4, a_5 in A_5, ldots, a_n in A_n ).    - By the problem setup, we have:      [      c + (a + b) + a_4 + ldots + a_n in A_3      ]      - But simplifying, this is:      [      c + a + b + a_4 + ldots + a_n in A_3      ]    - Similarly, we have:      [      b + (a + c) + a_4 + ldots + a_n in A_2      ]      - This simplifies to:      [      b + a + c + a_4 + ldots + a_n in A_2      ]    - Since the above equalities must hold, both sums imply that:      [      b + a + c + a_4 + ldots + a_n in A_2      ]      and      [      b + a + c + a_4 + ldots + a_n in A_3      ]    - This is a contradiction since the sums belong to different sets, making it impossible for them to be equal. 6. **Same Subset Conclusion:**    - Therefore, ( a+b ) and ( a+c ) must belong to the same subset. 7. **Constructing ( s ):**    - Now choose ( a_i in A_i ). Let ( s = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n ).    - Without a loss of generality, assume ( s in A_1 ). 8. **Definition of ( b_i ):**    - Define ( b_i = s - a_i ).

Then all odd numbers greater than ( a_3 + ldots + a_n ) must be in ( A_2 ).     - Similarly, considering ( a_1 + a_2 + a_4 + ldots + a_n ), all odd numbers greater than ( a_2 + a_4 + ldots + a_n ) must be in ( A_3 ).     - This gives a contradiction since odd numbers end up being required in multiple sets, violating the partition rule.      # Conclusion: Based on the above deductions, no such partition into ( n ) subsets exists for ( n > 1 ).

The number of ways to choose 31 elements from 40 is given by the binomial coefficient:     [     binom{40}{31}     ]     By the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, we know that:     [     binom{40}{31} = binom{40}{9}     ]     This is because choosing 31 elements to include is equivalent to choosing 9 elements to exclude. 2. **Ensure (a_{31}) is the largest among the first 31 elements:**     Among the 31 chosen elements, we need (a_{31}) to be the largest number. Let's denote the set of chosen 31 elements as (S_{31}). Since (a_{31}) is to be the largest in (S_{31}), we can simply choose any 30 elements from the remaining 30 elements of (S_{31}) and (a_{31}) will be the maximal element. 3. **Determine the position of (a_{20}):**     In the sequence, (a_{20}) should be the next largest number after (a_{31}). Hence we have to arrange 29 elements in the first 20 positions such that (a_{20}) comes as the 20th element. Among the first 20 terms, (a_{20}) must be in the selected 31 elements but smaller than the largest number, (a_{31}). 4. **Arrange the 29 elements:**     The 29 elements out of the 31 selected ones (excluding (a_{31}) and potentially (a_{20})) can be arranged in the first 20 positions in any order. This can be done in (29!) ways. 5. **Arrange the remaining 9 elements:**     The remaining 9 elements not chosen in the initial 31 can be arranged in the last 9 positions in any order. This can also be done in (9!) ways. Given the multiplication principle, 6. **Calculate the total number of such sequences:**     Combining the number of ways to choose the 31 elements with the arrangements of the 29 and 9 elements, we have:     [     binom{40}{31} times 29! times 9!     ]     Substituting the equivalence of the binomial coefficient:     [     binom{40}{31} times 29! times 9! = binom{40}{9} times 29! times 9!     ] Thus, the total number of sequences ({a_n}) that satisfy the given conditions is: [ boxed{binom{40}{9} times 29! times 9!} ]"},{"instruction":"Let (S) be a region in the complex plane defined by  [ S = {x + iy: 2 leq x leq 2, 2 leq y leq 2} ] A complex number (z = x + iy) is chosen uniformly at random from (S).

Given that the interest payment is 231 each month, we can calculate the annual interest by multiplying this monthly interest by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year): [ I_{text{annual}} = 231 times 12 ] Now, we know the annual interest rate is 9%, which as a decimal is 0.09. Since we are looking for the principal amount ( P ), we can rearrange the formula to solve for ( P ): [ P = frac{I}{r times t} ] In this case, the time ( t ) is 1 year, because the interest rate is given on an annual basis. So we can plug in the values we have: [ P = frac{I_{text{annual}}}{0.09 times 1} ] Now, let's calculate the annual interest and then the principal: [ I_{text{annual}} = 231 times 12 = 2772 ] [ P = frac{2772}{0.09} ] [ P = 30800 ] Therefore, the amount of the investment is boxed{30,800} ."},{"instruction":"Given the parametric equation of line l: begin{cases} x=t+1  y= sqrt {3}t end{cases} (where t is the parameter), and the polar equation of curve C is rho=2costheta, then the polar radius (taking the positive value) of the intersection point of line l and curve C is ______.","output":"To find the polar radius of the intersection point between the given line l and curve C, we first need to express both equations in a common coordinate system. Curve C is already given in polar coordinates (rho=2costheta), so we can convert it into Cartesian coordinates by multiplying both sides by rho and using the identities rhocostheta = x and rhosintheta = y: rho^2 = 2rhocostheta implies x^2 + y^2 = 2x. Reorganizing, we have an equation for curve C in Cartesian coordinates: x^2 + y^2 - 2x = 0 tag{1} Next, we convert the parametric equation of line l into a Cartesian equation by eliminating the parameter t. Using the given parametric equations: begin{cases} x=t+1  y=sqrt{3}t end{cases} We solve the first equation for t: t = x - 1. Substituting this into the second equation, we get: y = sqrt{3}(x-1). So the Cartesian equation for line l is: y = sqrt{3}x - sqrt{3}. tag{2} To find the intersection points, we solve system (1) and (2) simultaneously: begin{align*} x^2 + (sqrt{3}x - sqrt{3})^2 - 2x &= 0  x^2 + 3(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 2x &= 0  4x^2 - 8x + 3 &= 0 end{align*} This simplifies to: 4x^2 - 8x + 3 = 0. We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula: x = frac{8 pm sqrt{64 - 4cdot 4cdot 3}}{2cdot 4} = frac{8 pm sqrt{16}}{8} = frac{8 pm 4}{8}. So the solutions for x are: x_1 = frac{1}{2} quad text{and} quad x_2 = frac{3}{2}.

Let's rewrite a = 2cos^2theta - sintheta so that we can analyze its behavior over the possible range of (theta).

Therefore, the new nim-sum is:      [      n' = n oplus m_i oplus m_i' = m_1 oplus cdots oplus m_i' oplus cdots oplus m_l      ]    - Since n = 0, substituting gives:      [      n' = 0 oplus m_i oplus m_i' = m_i oplus m_i' neq 0      ]    - Thus, the new nim-sum n' is not zero.

Conclusion: blacksquare # Part (b) 1. **Statement**: We need to prove that from a position with a non-zero nim-sum, one can always make a move resulting in a position with nim-sum n = 0. 2. **Proof**:    - Let n be the nim-sum of the current position:      [      n = m_1 oplus m_2 oplus cdots oplus m_l neq 0      ]    - According to properties of XOR, for some pile, say m_j, there exists a non-negative integer k such that:      [      m_j oplus k < m_j      ]    - Choose k such that:      [      k = n      ]    - This means for pile m_j:      [      m_j' = m_j oplus n      ]    - Therefore, the resulting position maintains:      [      n' = n oplus (m_j oplus n) = 0      ]    - Hence, by making the pile m_j become m_j' = m_j oplus n, the resulted nim-sum is zero.

If the nim-sum before making a move is 0, any move made leaves a non-zero nim-sum, thus putting the opponent in a winning position.      2. If the nim-sum is not 0, make a move such that the resulting nim-sum is 0. This can be done by reducing the size of some pile m_j such that n = m_j oplus k for an appropriate k, ensuring n oplus (m_j oplus n) = 0.

The full price is 125, so the discount is: 20% of 125 = 0.20 * 125 = 25 So, after the first discount, the price of the jeans is: 125 - 25 = 100 Next, Todd applied a coupon that took off some amount, let's call this amount \\"C\\". After applying the coupon, the price of the jeans is: 100 - C Then, Todd used his store credit card to get another 10% off the remaining amount. The 10% discount is applied to the price after the coupon, so it is: 10% of (100 - C) = 0.10 * (100 - C) = 10 - 0.10C After the credit card discount, the final price Todd paid is: (100 - C) - (10 - 0.10C) = 90 - C + 0.10C = 90 - 0.90C We know that Todd saved a total of 44 on the original price of the jeans. The original price was 125, so the final price he paid is: 125 - 44 = 81 Now we can set up the equation with the final price Todd paid and solve for C: 90 - 0.90C = 81 Subtract 90 from both sides to isolate the term with C: -0.90C = 81 - 90 -0.90C = -9 Now, divide both sides by -0.90 to solve for C: C = -9 / -0.90 C = 10 So, the coupon took off boxed{10} ."},{"instruction":"Form a fivedigit number using 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repeating any digit, satisfying the condition that among the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, exactly two odd numbers are adjacent.

Consider the homothety centered at point ( B ) with a coefficient ( k = frac{AB}{BP} = frac{CB}{BQ} ).     - Under this homothety, segment ( PQ ) will be mapped to ( AC ), and point ( M ) will be mapped to some point ( N ).     - Consequently, we have ( angle ANC = angle PMQ = 90^circ ). 2. **Construct Semi-circle**:     - Because ( angle ANC = 90^circ ), point ( N ) lies on the semicircle with diameter ( AC ).

Since there are 10 hurdles, and the distance between the starting line and the first hurdle, as well as the distance from the last hurdle to the finish line, are given, the distance covered while hurdling is divided by 9 (the number of spaces between the 10 hurdles) to find the distance between two consecutive hurdles.

For the second purchase, the grocer bought 5 pounds for 1.25, so the cost per pound is 1.25 / 5 pounds = 0.25 per pound.

The total cost for the bananas is then: Total cost = (x * 0.1667) + (y * 0.25) The total revenue from selling the bananas is the total pounds sold (x + y) times the selling price per pound: Total revenue = (x + y) * 0.25 The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, and we know the profit is 8.00: Profit = Total revenue - Total cost 8.00 = (x + y) * 0.25 - [(x * 0.1667) + (y * 0.25)] Now, let's solve for x and y: 8.00 = 0.25x + 0.25y - 0.1667x - 0.25y 8.00 = 0.0833x Now, we can solve for x: x = 8.00 / 0.0833 x = 96 pounds (approximately) Since the selling price per pound is the same as the cost per pound for the second batch of bananas, the second batch does not contribute to the profit.

If the list price is 80, a 50 percent discount would be: 80 * 50% = 80 * 0.5 = 40 So, the price after the initial discount would be: 80 - 40 = 40 Now, during the annual summer sale, there is an additional 20 percent off the original list price. The additional discount would be: 80 * 20% = 80 * 0.2 = 16 So, the additional discount is 16 off the already discounted price. The final sale price would be: 40 - 16 = 24 Now, to find the percent q of the list price that the lowest possible sale price is, we divide the final sale price by the original list price and multiply by 100: q = (24 / 80) * 100 = 0.3 * 100 = 30% Therefore, the lowest possible sale price is approximately boxed{30}  percent of the list price."},{"instruction":"Brian has 76 cards.

Let A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2), then frac{x_1^2}{a^2} + frac{y_1^2}{b^2} = 1 and frac{x_2^2}{a^2} + frac{y_2^2}{b^2} = 1. Subtracting these equations gives frac{(x_1 - x_2)(x_1 + x_2)}{a^2} + frac{(y_1 - y_2)(y_1 + y_2)}{b^2} = 0.

When frac {1}{a-1} < 1, i.e., a > 2, by setting f′(x) < 0, we get 0 < x < frac {1}{a-1} or x > 1; by setting f′(x) > 0, we get frac {1}{a-1} < x < 1.

Thus, it is guaranteed that, no matter how the integers 5 through 36 are placed in the remaining squares, there will always be at least one pair of adjacent squares whose integers differ by at least 16.

Ming bought 40 pencils, and Catherine bought 24 pencils.  The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. To find the GCD of 40 and 24, we first factor each number into its prime factors: - For 24, the prime factorization is 24 = 2^3 cdot 3. This means 24 is made up of three 2s multiplied together and a 3. - For 40, the prime factorization is 40 = 2^3 cdot 5. This means 40 is made up of three 2s multiplied together and a 5. The next step is to identify the common prime factors. Both 24 and 40 have 2^3 as a common factor, but they do not share the factors 3 and 5. Therefore, the largest number of pencils that can be in a package, which is the GCD of 40 and 24, is the product of their common prime factors, which is 2^3.

Let's break down the solution in a step-by-step manner as follows: 1. **Definition of \\"Good\\" and \\"Bad\\" Sets**:    - A **\\"good\\" set** ( T ) of 10 elements is defined such that for any ( k in T ), ( f(T - {k}) neq k ).    - A **\\"bad\\" set** is a 10-element subset ( T ) for which there exists at least one ( k_0 in T ) such that ( f(T - {k_0}) = k_0 ). 2. **Existence of \\"Bad\\" Sets**:    - Assume ( T ) is a bad set. By definition, there exists some ( k_0 in T ) such that:    [    f(T - {k_0}) = k_0.    ] 3. **Representation of ( T )**:    - Let ( S = T - {k_0} ). Then we can write:    [    T = S cup {k_0} = S cup {f(S)}.    ]    Since ( T ) is a set of 10 elements, it indicates that ( S ) must have 9 elements. 4. **Conditions on ( f(S) )**:    - If ( f(S) in S ), then ( S cup {f(S)} ) remains a set of 9 elements, which contradicts our requirement for ( T ) being of 10 elements. Hence, ( f(S) notin S ). 5. **Implications on \\"Bad\\" Sets**:    - From the argument above, a \\"bad\\" set ( T ) must be generated from some 9-element subset ( S ) with the characteristic that ( S cup {f(S)} ) extends ( S ) to form a bad set of 10 elements. 6. **Counting the Number of Bad Sets**:    - The total number of 9-element subsets of ( M ) is (binom{20}{9}).    - Each 9-element subset ( S ) can potentially extend to form a bad set by adding ( f(S) ), giving at most (binom{20}{9}) bad sets. 7. **Counting the Number of 10-Element Subsets**:    - The total number of 10-element subsets of ( M ) is (binom{20}{10}).    - We know (binom{20}{10} = binom{20}{9}). Therefore, the number of possible 10-element subsets is greater than the number of ways to generate bad subsets:    [    binom{20}{10} > binom{20}{9}.    ] 8. **Conclusion**:    - Since there are more 10-element subsets than potential bad sets that can be formed, it implies that there must exist at least one \\"good\\" 10-element subset that fulfills the condition where for any ( k in T ), ( f(T - {k}) neq k ).

It utilizes the idea of transformation and substitution. When a line is tangent to a circle, the distance from the center of the circle to the line equals the radius of the circle. Mastering this property is key to solving the problem. By using the standard equation of the circle, we can find the coordinates of the center and the radius (r). Since the line is tangent to the circle, the distance from the center of the circle to the line equals the radius of the circle. By applying the formula for the distance from a point to a line, we can establish a relationship, which is then rearranged using basic inequalities. Let (m+n=x), and we obtain an inequality in terms of (x). Solving this inequality gives us the range of (x), which is the range of (m+n). **Solution** Given the equation of the circle ((x-1)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=1), we find the center of the circle at ((1,1)) with radius (r=1).

Let's break down each method into detailed steps. **Method 1: Analyzing the Inequality** Given the inequality 2^{x}-2^{y} < 3^{-x}-3^{-y}, we can rearrange it to form a new inequality: 1. Subtract 2^{y} and add 3^{-x} to both sides:    2^{x} - 3^{-x} < 2^{y} - 3^{-y} 2. Define a function f(x) = 2^{x} - 3^{-x}. This allows us to rewrite the inequality as:    f(x) < f(y) 3. Analyzing the function f(x), we find that it is monotonically increasing over mathbb{R}. This is due to the fact that the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is positive for all x in mathbb{R}. 4. Since f(x) is monotonically increasing and f(x) < f(y), it implies that x < y. 5. Knowing x < y, we can deduce that y - x > 0. Adding 1 to both sides gives us y - x + 1 > 1. 6. Applying the natural logarithm to both sides of the inequality y - x + 1 > 1, we get:    ln(y - x + 1) > ln(1) = 0 Therefore, from Method 1, we conclude that ln(y - x + 1) > 0, which corresponds to option A. **Method 2: Testing with Specific Values** 1. Let's choose specific values for x and y that satisfy the original inequality. Let x = -1 and y = 0. 2. Substituting x = -1 and y = 0 into the inequality 2^{x}-2^{y} < 3^{-x}-3^{-y}, we find that the inequality holds true. 3. Now, calculate ln(y - x + 1) with these values:    ln(0 - (-1) + 1) = ln(2) > 0 4. Similarly, calculate ln |x - y|:    ln |(-1) - 0| = ln(1) = 0 5.

Find the common difference of { a_{n} } and { b_{n} }: Since a_{2}=4 and a_{4}=6, the common difference d_1 of { a_{n} } is d_{1}=frac{a_{4}-a_{2}}{4-2}=frac{6-4}{2}=1.

Since line l passes through the point (4, 1), we have frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1. Now OA + OB = a + b can be multiplied by left( frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b} right), giving: OA + OB = a + b = (a + b) left( frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b} right) = 5 + frac{4b}{a} + frac{a}{b}. By applying the AM-GM inequality, we know that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean: frac{frac{4b}{a} + frac{a}{b}}{2} geq sqrt{frac{4b}{a} cdot frac{a}{b}} = 2. This inequality simplifies to frac{4b}{a} + frac{a}{b} geq 4, and adding 5 to both sides we get 5 + frac{4b}{a} + frac{a}{b} geq 9. Equality holds when frac{4b}{a} = frac{a}{b}, which simplifies to a^2 = 4ab, hence a = 2b. Substituting a = 2b into frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1, we get frac{4}{2b} + frac{1}{b} = 1. Solving for b, we find that b = 3, and thus a = 2b = 6. Therefore, the equation of line l is frac{x}{6} + frac{y}{3} = 1.

We need to determine the original shape that, when one of its angles is cut off, cannot result in a quadrilateral. 2. **Analyzing the Options**: - **Option A (Hexagon)**: A hexagon has six sides. If we cut off one angle, the minimum number of sides we can end up with is five, not four. Therefore, cutting off an angle from a hexagon cannot leave us with a quadrilateral. - **Option B (Pentagon)**: A pentagon has five sides. Cutting off one angle can result in a shape with four sides, a quadrilateral. - **Option C (Quadrilateral)**: A quadrilateral has four sides. Cutting off one angle can result in a shape with three sides, a triangle, which can be considered a degenerate form of a quadrilateral for this context. - **Option D (Triangle)**: A triangle has three sides. Cutting off one angle can result in a shape that essentially still has three sides but is more degenerate in form. However, for the purpose of this problem, we consider the original shape that cannot directly result in a quadrilateral without considering degenerate forms. 3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the original shape that cannot result in a quadrilateral when one of its angles is cut off is a **Hexagon**. This is because cutting off an angle from a hexagon will leave us with a shape that has at least five sides, not four.

Let us assume that it is possible to place a line segment ( XY ) inside the pentagon such that it is visible from all vertices ( A, B, C, D, E ) under the same angle. 2. For any chosen ( XY ), we note that three of the vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ) (or likewise with ( D, E )) will lie on one side of the line segment ( XY ). Specifically, let's say ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are the three vertices. 3. Given that the angles at vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ) subtended by the line segment ( XY ) are equal, points ( A, B, , C, X, ) and ( Y ) must lie on the circumference of a single circle. This is due to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that an angle subtended by a chord (in this case ( XY )) is the same when observed from any point on the circle being described by the chord ( XY ). 4. Since ( A, B, ) and ( C ) lie within the vertices of a regular pentagon: - All vertices, including ( X ) and ( Y ), must lie on the circle that circumferences the regular pentagon, given that the pentagon is cyclic (all vertices of the pentagon lie on a single circle). 5. For this scenario to hold, the points ( X ) and ( Y ) must coincide with some points on the circular circumference that are either inside the side lengths or vertices of the pentagon. 6. However, this arrangement implies that ( X ) and ( Y ) are not strictly inside the pentagon but lie on the circumcircle that also describes the bounding circle of the pentagon—a contradiction since the segment ( XY ) is supposed to be strictly inside the pentagon. 7. Therefore, there is no way to position ( XY ) strictly inside the pentagon such that it fulfills the condition of being visible under the same angle from all vertices. # Conclusion: Since the assumption that ( XY ) can be positioned inside the pentagon leads to a contradiction, it is confirmed that it is impossible to position such a segment.

For a 360-ray partitional point (4 times 90), similar reasoning dictates that each triangular sector must divide into 90 parts. Placing X symmetrically results in a spacing of frac{s}{91} between each point in the grid. To find overlapping points between these grids: - 150-ray partitional forms a 150 times 150 grid of points. - 90-ray partitional forms a 90 times 90 grid of points. The common divisors of 151 and 91 include 1 and their least common multiple is 151 times 91. To find overlapping points, we divide the side length by the least common multiple of the grid intervals.

To find (Q(x)), we perform polynomial division of (P(x)) by (x - 1). 4. **Polynomial division:** Dividing (x^3 + x^2 - 4x + 2) by (x - 1): [ begin{array}{r|rrr} 1 & 1 & 1 & -4 & 2 & & 1 & 2 & -2 hline & 1 & 2 & -2 & 0 end{array} ] The quotient is (x^2 + 2x - 2), so: [ P(x) = (x - 1)(x^2 + 2x - 2) ] 5. **Solve the quadratic equation:** To find the remaining roots, solve the quadratic equation (x^2 + 2x - 2 = 0) using the quadratic formula: [ x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ] where (a = 1), (b = 2), and (c = -2): [ x = frac{-2 pm sqrt{2^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-2)}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 8}}{2} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{12}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 2sqrt{3}}{2} = -1 pm sqrt{3} ] Thus, the roots are (x = -1 + sqrt{3}) and (x = -1 - sqrt{3}). 6. **Order the roots:** The roots of the polynomial are (1), (-1 + sqrt{3}), and (-1 - sqrt{3}). Given (a le b le c), we have: [ a = -1 - sqrt{3}, quad b = -1 + sqrt{3}, quad c = 1 ] The final answer is (boxed{a = -1 - sqrt{3}, , b = -1 + sqrt{3}, , c = 1})"},{"instruction":"Let (m in {1,2,3,4}) and (n in {12,8,4,2}), then the probability that the function (f(x) = x^3 + mx + n) has a root in the interval ([1,2]) is (() ()) A: (dfrac{1}{2}) B: (dfrac{9}{16}) C: (dfrac{11}{16}) D: (dfrac{13}{16})","output":"**Analysis** This problem examines the classical probability model and the determination of function roots.

Since the rectangle is used to create the side surface of the cylinder, one of its dimensions will be the height of the cylinder, and the other will be the circumference of the base of the cylinder. We are given that the height (h) of the cylinder is 8 feet. The perimeter of the circular base, which is the same as the circumference (C), is given as 6 feet. The dimensions of the rectangle are therefore: - Length (L) = Circumference of the base of the cylinder = 6 feet - Width (W) = Height of the cylinder = 8 feet The diagonal (D) of the rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

We know the area of the farm is 1200 m² and one of the short sides is 30 m. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = length × width So, if we let the length of the long side be L, we have: 1200 m² = L × 30 m To find L, we divide both sides by 30 m: L = 1200 m² / 30 m L = 40 m Now we have the lengths of the short side (30 m) and the long side (40 m). Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal. We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the diagonal of the rectangle acts as the hypotenuse, and the two sides of the rectangle are the other two sides of the right-angled triangle. Let D be the length of the diagonal. According to the Pythagorean theorem: D² = 30² + 40² D² = 900 + 1600 D² = 2500 Taking the square root of both sides gives us the length of the diagonal: D = √2500 D = 50 m Now we have the lengths of the three sides that need to be fenced: one long side (40 m), one short side (30 m), and the diagonal (50 m). The total length of the fence needed is: Total length = 40 m + 30 m + 50 m Total length = 120 m The cost of fencing is Rs. 15 per meter, so the total cost of the job will be: Total cost = Total length × Cost per meter Total cost = 120 m × Rs. 15/m Total cost = Rs. 1800 Therefore, the job would cost Rs. boxed{1800} ."},{"instruction":"Find the value of sin (frac{5pi}{12} + theta) given that cos (frac{pi}{12} theta) = frac{1}{3}.

The distance covered by both horses is the same, 900 miles. The speed of the slow horse can be represented as frac{900}{x+1} miles per day, and the speed of the fast horse as frac{900}{x-3} miles per day.

Petya wants to place 99 coins on this board with the restriction that no two coins can be placed in cells that share a common side (i.e., adjacent cells cannot both contain coins). 3. Given that each coin must be placed in a different cell in such a way to avoid adjacency, we can deduce that there must be exactly one empty column. This is because: - If there were no empty columns, each pair of adjacent cells in columns would necessarily contain at least one pair of coins sharing a side. - On the other hand, if there are two or more empty columns, then not all 99 coins can be placed on the board, as there would not be enough cells left. 4. However, once an empty column is fixed, the remaining 99 columns need to be filled in a non-adjacent manner in two rows.

Now let's factor 20 and 432 to find their prime factors: 20 = 2^2 * 5 432 = 2^4 * 3^3 The gcd of two numbers is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors. Since we are given that the gcd is 2, this means that the only common prime factor between 20 * b and 432 is 2, and it's to the first power. Since 20 already includes the factor 2^2, and we need the gcd to be just 2, the number b must not include any additional factors of 2; otherwise, the gcd would be greater than 2. Therefore, b must be a number that is not divisible by 2 (an odd number) and does not include any factors of 3, as 432 has a factor of 3^3. The smallest such b that satisfies this condition is 1 (since 1 has no prime factors and will not change the gcd of 20 and 432).

For a quadratic equation (Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0), the discriminant is given by: [ Delta = B^2 - 4AC ] For our equation ( x^2 + (a+b+c)x + lambda (ab+bc+ca) = 0 ), we have: [ A = 1, quad B = a + b + c, quad C = lambda (ab + bc + ca) ] Thus, the discriminant (Delta) is: [ Delta = (a + b + c)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot lambda (ab + bc + ca) ] Expanding ((a + b + c)^2), we get: [ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) ] Therefore, the discriminant becomes: [ Delta = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) - 4lambda (ab + bc + ca) ] Simplifying, we have: [ Delta = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + (2 - 4lambda)(ab + bc + ca) ] For the quadratic equation to have real roots, the discriminant must be non-negative: [ Delta ge 0 ] Thus, we need: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + (2 - 4lambda)(ab + bc + ca) ge 0 ] We know that (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ge ab + bc + ca) for all real (a, b, c).

Using the same discriminant: [ Delta = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + (2 - 4lambda)(ab + bc + ca) ] If (lambda ge 1), then (2 - 4lambda le -2). Therefore: [ Delta = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) ] We need to show that (Delta < 0).

Let ( {x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5} ) denote the sorted values such that ( x_1 leq x_2 leq x_3 leq x_4 leq x_5 ). To achieve the maximum ( S ), we need to maximize the products ( x_i x_j ), which suggests that the values of ( x_i ) should be as close to each other as possible, as this tends to give the largest values when summed. 3. We proceed by proving that all ( x_i ) should be nearly equal. Suppose ( x_1 neq x_2 ). Assume without loss of generality ( x_1 < x_2 ). Consider the operation of increasing ( x_1 ) by 1 and decreasing ( x_2 ) by 1 (i.e., let ( x_1' = x_1 + 1 ) and ( x_2' = x_2 - 1 )). The pairwise product terms change as follows: [ x_1' x_2' = (x_1 + 1)(x_2 - 1) = x_1 x_2 - x_1 + x_2 - 1 ] Since ( x_1 < x_2 ), then ( x_2 - x_1 - 1 ) is positive, hence increasing ( x_1 ) and decreasing ( x_2 ) will increase the product ( x_1 x_2 ), as long as the sum of ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) remains 2006. 4. By this operation of evening out the differences between the values, we arrive at ( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = x_5 ) approximately. Since they must sum to 2006, the closest integers are: [ x_1 = 402, quad x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = x_5 = 401 ] 5. Substitute these values into ( S ): [ S = sum_{1 leq i < j leq 5} x_i x_j = 402 cdot 401 + 401 cdot 401 + 401 cdot 401 + 401 cdot 401 + 401 cdot 401 + text{other combinations} ] 6. Every pair of distinct values ( (x_i, x_j) ) are maximized, leading to the maximum sum ( S ). 7.

Assume there exists an integer (t) such that ( a_n = t^3 ): [ 3n^2 + 3n + 7 = t^3 ] 2. Note that (n(n+1)) is always even, hence (3n^2 + 3n) is even, and adding 7 (odd number), (a_n) is always odd, meaning (t) must be odd. Let (t = 2s + 1). 3. Substitute ( t = 2s + 1 ): [ 3n^2 + 3n + 7 = (2s+1)^3 = 8s^3 + 12s^2 + 6s + 1 ] 4. Simplify: [ 3n^2 + 3n + 6 = 8s^3 + 12s^2 + 6s ] 5. Left-hand side (LHS) is divisible by 3; therefore, right-hand side (RHS) must also be divisible by 3: [ 8s^3 + 12s^2 + 6s equiv 0 pmod{3} ] 6. Since (8 equiv 2 pmod{3}): [ 2s^3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Hence, (s equiv 0 pmod{3}). Let (s = 3r): 7. Substitute (s = 3r): [ n^2 + n + 2 = 72r^3 + 36r^2 + 6r ] 8. Check divisibility by 3 for various (n): - For (n = 3k): [ n^2 + n + 2 = 9k^2 + 3k + 2 quad (text{not divisible by 3}) ] - For (n = 3k+1): [ n^2 + n + 2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 4 quad (text{not divisible by 3}) ] - For (n = 3k+2): [ n^2 + n + 2 = 9k^2 + 15k + 6 quad (text{not divisible by 3}) ] Conclusion from contradiction: The assumption that (3n^2 + 3n + 7 = t^3 ) is false.

Since F is finite, S is also finite and divided into disjoint subsets S_1 and S_2 where S_1 subseteq V_1 and S_2 subseteq V_2. 2. **Consider any element ( omega in Omega ):** Since G is connected, a connected subgraph C(S, omega) must avoid either V_1 or V_2.

Keeping the clockwise orientation in mind, let the two internal tangents of the circles centered at ( O_u ) and ( O_v ) meet at ( P ) (the midpoint of ( O_uO_v )) and let ( ell = PT ) denote the one to the right of ( O_u ) and left of ( O_v ), where ( T in (O_v) ). Considering the set of lines through ( P ) passing through both circles centered at ( O_u ) and ( O_v ), it's clear that the circle centered at ( O_w ) contains no points on the same side of ( ell ) as ( O_v ), i.e., the right of ( ell ). Now setting ( Q ) to be the insimilicenter of the circles centered at ( O_v ) and ( O_w ) (i.e., the midpoint of ( O_vO_w ), since the circles have the same radius) and noting that the circle centered at ( O_v ) is tangent to ( ell ) at ( T ), we must have ( Q ) to the left of ( ell ) (otherwise, ( O_w ) will either be to the right of ( ell ) or closer to ( ell ) than ( O_v ). Thus: [ frac{2}{O_{k_r}O_{k_{r-1}}} le arcsinleft(frac{2}{O_{k_r}O_{k_{r-1}}}right) = angle{O_iPT} < angle{O_iPQ}. ] Similarly, we have: [ frac{2}{O_{k_r}O_{k_{r+1}}} < angle{O_iQP}. ] Adding these two inequalities, we get: [ frac{2}{O_{k_r}O_{k_{r-1}}} + frac{2}{O_{k_r}O_{k_{r+1}}} le pi - angle{O_{k_{r-1}}O_{k_r}O_{k_{r+1}}}. ] This proves Lemma 3.

Therefore, there must exist at least two people in the company who have the same number of acquaintances.

In this case, any line passing through this segment that is parallel to the side of the square intersects the polyline in infinitely many points. 5.

Let's start by factorizing 34560: 34560 = 2^6 * 3^3 * 5^1 For a number to be a perfect cube, all the prime factors must be in powers of 3. The prime factorization of 34560 already has 3^3, which is good. However, 2^6 and 5^1 are not in powers of 3. We need to remove or reduce these factors to make the result a perfect cube. 2^6 can be divided into 2^3 * 2^3, which are two perfect cubes (8 * 8). However, we have an extra 5^1, which is not a perfect cube. To make it a perfect cube, we would need two more factors of 5 (5^3 = 5 * 5 * 5). So, we need to divide 34560 by 2^3 * 5^2 to get a perfect cube: 34560 / (2^3 * 5^2) = 34560 / (8 * 25) = 34560 / 200 = 172.8 Since we are looking for a whole number, we cannot have a decimal.

Let's divide 34560 by 2^3 * 5^1 (since 5^1 is already a factor in 34560): 34560 / (2^3 * 5^1) = 34560 / (8 * 5) = 34560 / 40 = 864 Now, let's check if 864 is a perfect cube: 864 = 2^5 * 3^3 We still have 2^5, which is not a power of 3.

When x=3 or 4, f'(x) > 0 holds true. For x > 4 and x in mathbb{N}, since 0 < frac{2pi}{x} < frac{pi}{2}, we have 0 < sin frac{2pi}{x} < 1 and 0 < cos frac{2pi}{x} < 1, and sin frac{2pi}{x} < frac{2pi}{x} < tan frac{2pi}{x}.

First, we choose 2 people out of the 6 to form the first pair, which can be done in binom{6}{2} ways. For the second pair, we choose 2 out of the remaining 4, which can be done in binom{4}{2} ways. This leaves us with 2 people, who will each go to a separate pavilion, and there are binom{2}{1} ways to choose the person for one of these pavilions, but since the last person automatically goes to the last pavilion, we consider this as 1 way. However, since there are 4 pavilions and we have 4 groups, we need to account for the different ways to distribute these groups across the 4 pavilions. The first pair can go to any of the 4 pavilions, the second pair can choose from the remaining 3 pavilions, the first single person can choose from the 2 remaining pavilions, and the last person will go to the last remaining pavilion. This gives us 4! ways to distribute the groups.

Upon reviewing the calculation, it appears there was an oversight in the multiplication of the combinations.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are (12^3 = 1728) cubic inches in a cubic foot. Therefore, the internal volume of the box in cubic inches is (4 times 1728 = 6912) cubic inches. Since the box has a square base and the same height as the side length, let's denote the internal side length of the box as (x) inches. This means the internal volume of the box is (x^3) cubic inches. We know that the internal volume is 6912 cubic inches, so we have the equation: [x^3 = 6912] To find (x), we take the cube root of both sides: [x = sqrt[3]{6912}] Calculating the cube root of 6912: [x approx 19.08] inches (rounded to two decimal places). Now, we need to find the external side length of the box. Since the walls are 1-inch thick on each side, the external side length will be the internal side length plus twice the thickness of the walls (because there's a wall on each side of the length). So the external side length is: [x + 2 times 1 = x + 2] Substituting the value of (x): [19.08 + 2 = 21.08] inches.

Each integer a_i can be factored into its prime factors. Let P be the set of all prime factors of all a_i.

Thus, we have five two-digit numbers: {12, 24, 32, 44, 52}. 4. **Three-digit numbers case**: - We start by selecting each of the two-digit numbers (12, 24, 32, 44, 52). - We prepend each of these two-digit numbers with each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (valid digits defined), to get a three-digit number. - The new three-digit numbers are guaranteed to be divisible by 4 since the last two digits remain divisible by 4 and the preliminary conditions are met. - By performing this, we get the following list: begin{itemize} item From 12: 112, 212, 312, 412, 512 item From 24: 124, 224, 324, 424, 524 item From 32: 132, 232, 332, 432, 532 item From 44: 144, 244, 344, 444, 544 item From 52: 152, 252, 352, 452, 552 end{itemize} Thus, there are (5 times 5 = 25) valid three-digit numbers. 5. **Sum of all valid numbers**: - 1 single-digit number: 4. - 5 two-digit numbers: 12, 24, 32, 44, 52. - 25 three-digit numbers as calculated in the previous step. Conclusion: [ 1 + 5 + 25 = 31 ] Thus, there are a total of (31) numbers less than (1000) that are divisible by 4 and do not contain the digits (6, 7, 8, 9), or (0).

We need to determine which number can be diametrically opposite to the number 83. 2. **Analyzing the Opposite Relationship:** Let's investigate an odd number k = 2m + 1. Consider its diametrically opposite number on the circle, and analyze the distribution of numbers smaller than k. 3. **Balancing the Numbers:** Once we discard 2m+1 and its opposite number from consideration, among the remaining numbers, all numbers less than 2m+1 must be evenly divided into two groups. Thus, there must be an even number of numbers less than 2m+1. 4. **Counting the Numbers Less Than k:** If k = 83, then the set of numbers less than 83 contains 82 elements. We need these 82 elements to be evenly split into two groups. Therefore: [ text{The total number of elements is } 2m. ] Here, 2m = 82. Solving for m, we get: [ m = frac{82}{2} = 41. ] Hence: [ k = 2m + 1 = 2 times 41 + 1 = 83. ] 5. **Finding the Opposite Number:** If k = 83, its diametrically opposite number must be k+1 because it needs to be greater than 83 for balance. Thus, the opposite number is: [ 83 text{ (original number)} + 1 = 84. ] 6. **Verification for Smaller Cases:** Let's briefly verify an odd number sequence with the same logic: - For k=99, the remaining set of 98 elements (less than 99) splits evenly. Hence, the diametrically opposite number to 99 is 100. - For k=97, discard 99 and 100. Remaining 96 elements split evenly, so 98 is opposite to 97.

Since ( n ) is a ten-digit number consisting of distinct digits from 0 to 9, the possible sums range from the sum of the smallest 10 digits to the sum of the largest 10 digits: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 ] Therefore, the maximum possible sum ( S ) is 45. However, because 45 is already divisible by 9, and considering the problem requires the numbers to be distinct, Sasha must add a digit that when combined with ( S ) results in a new sum still divisible by 9. Since the digits must be distinct, let’s check the sum of the digits ( S ) from the digits excluded in ( n ) (which initially sum up 0-9). If any digit is missing, this would change the sum to less than 45. The sum of all digits from 0 to 9 is: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 ] Assuming any digit from this set, Sasha could add the missing value to the sum ( S ) to make it divisible by 9. We need the remainder when ( S ) is divided by 9 to determine the digit to add. For each missing digit ( d_{miss} ) for instance: [ S = 45 - d_{miss} ] [ S % 9 = (45 - d_{miss}) % 9 ] From best combinations, Sasha needs to write {textbf{the missing digit inside initial sequence(0-9)}} to maintain divisibility condition. Thus, Sasha can write the missing digit among ( 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).

Analyze the given problem and constraints: We have a 6 times 6 grid, and each cell in the grid contains exactly one chess piece. We need to place these chess pieces such that the number of white pieces in each row is distinct, and the number of white pieces in each column is the same. 2. Consider the possible number of white pieces per row. Since the numbers must be distinct, they can range from 0 to 6 in any order. Thus, let's list the possible numbers of white pieces per row as: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ] 3. The sum of the possible numbers is: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 ] 4. To satisfy the condition that each column has an equal number of white pieces, the total sum of white pieces must be a multiple of 6 (since there are 6 columns). 5. We need to exclude one number from the list above to make the sum a multiple of 6. Checking the sums obtained by excluding one number at a time: - Exclude 0: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 (not a multiple of 6) - Exclude 1: 0 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20 (not a multiple of 6) - Exclude 2: 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 19 (not a multiple of 6) - Exclude 3: 0 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 (multiple of 6) - Exclude 4: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 17 (not a multiple of 6) - Exclude 5: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 (not a multiple of 6) - Exclude 6: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 (not a multiple of 6) From the above, excluding 3 results in a sum that is a multiple of 6.

She wants to order stockings for her 5 grandchildren and her 4 children, which totals: 5 grandchildren + 4 children = 9 stockings Since she wants 5 monogrammed stockings for each, we multiply the total number of stockings by 5: 9 stockings x 5 = 45 stockings Now, let's calculate the cost of the stockings before the discount. Each stocking costs 20.00, so for 45 stockings: 45 stockings x 20.00/stocking = 900.00 Now, let's calculate the discount. The stockings are currently 10% off, so we need to find 10% of 900.00: 10% of 900.00 = 0.10 x 900.00 = 90.00 We subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price of the stockings: 900.00 - 90.00 = 810.00 Next, we need to add the cost of monogramming. Monogramming costs 5.00 per stocking, so for 45 stockings: 45 stockings x 5.00/stocking = 225.00 Finally, we add the discounted price of the stockings to the cost of monogramming to find the total cost: 810.00 + 225.00 = 1035.00 Therefore, the total cost for the monogrammed Christmas stockings will be boxed{1035.00} ."},{"instruction":"129.

We need to show that three segments, whose endpoints are distinct from ( A ) and are intersection points of two circles (with each pair of opposite ends not belonging to the same circle), intersect at one point. 1. **Identify the Intersection Points:** Let the four circles be ( C_1, C_2, C_3, ) and ( C_4 ) with a common point ( A ). The intersection points of these circles other than ( A ) can be named ( B_{12}, B_{13}, B_{14}, B_{23}, B_{24}, ) and ( B_{34} ), where ( B_{ij} ) represents the intersection point of circles ( C_i ) and ( C_j ) other than ( A ). 2. **Construct the Segments:** Consider the segments: [ B_{12}B_{34}, quad B_{13}B_{24}, quad B_{14}B_{23}. ] 3. **Prove the Intersection Property:** We need to show that these segments intersect at a common point. - If we take any two segments, for example, ( B_{12}B_{34} ) and ( B_{13}B_{24} ): - Since circles ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) pass through ( B_{12} ), this point lies on both segments ( B_{12}B_{34} ) and ( B_{13}B_{24} ). - Similarly, since circles ( C_3 ) and ( C_4 ) pass through ( B_{34} ), this point also lies on both segments ( B_{12}B_{34} ) and ( B_{13}B_{24} ). - By repeating this process for all combinations of two segments, we see that: - ( B_{34} ) is the midpoint of segments involving intersections ( {B_{12}, B_{13}, B_{14} } ). - Each segment thus intersects at the midpoint of the corresponding intersections. 4. **Symmetry Argument:** Due to the symmetry and equality of the circles, all segments must intersect at a symmetric and central point. This central point is their common intersection. 5. **Conclusion:** The three segments ( B_{12}B_{34} ), ( B_{13}B_{24} ), and ( B_{14}B_{23} ) intersect in one common point.

For intersections, we require cos t + t = cos s + s and sin t = sin s for t neq s. This implies s = t + 2kpi for some integer k. **Step 2: Solving for x-coordinates** The x-coordinates at potential intersection points are given by x = cos(t) + t. We need to find t such that 2 leq cos t + t leq 50. **Step 3: Counting Valid t Values** We estimate the number of valid t values by incrementing t in steps of 2pi and checking if the resulting x value is within the range [2, 50]. For each valid t, we find a corresponding s = t + 2pi that also meets the x condition. To calculate intersections: - Let's start by checking from t = 0 upwards, considering the growth rate of t alongside cos t. - As t increases, x = cos t + t increases beyond 2 quickly. We estimate the number of periods (each of length 2pi) needed for x to exceed 50. For t = 0, x = 1; for t = 2pi, x = 2pi - 1; this pattern continues, increasing by approximately 2pi each period. By the time t = 24pi, x exceeds 50. Therefore, we have approximately 12 periods (from 0 to 24pi) where intersections can occur. Thus, the graph intersects itself boxed{12} times between x = 2 and x = 50."},{"instruction":"Susan has a cylindrical tank with a radius of 8 inches and a height of 24 inches.
